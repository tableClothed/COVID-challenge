In addition to its natural reservoir species, influenza viruses infect a wide range of hosts including canids, equids, humans and swine. 2 IAVs' ability to generate novel gene constellations through reassortment between subtypes poses a risk for immune escape in these new hosts. 7 Furthermore, IAV undergoes rapid genetic and antigenic evolution, which makes vaccination control difficult in humans and other domestic species.\n",

      "\n",
      "Emerging infectious diseases affecting humans, wildlife, and agriculture are often the result of a pathogen jumping from its original host into a novel host species. This can take the form of spillover events that result in dead end infections or short stuttering transmission chains, or a host shift with successful infection and sustained transmission in the new host (Box 1). Host shifts have resulted in multiple human pandemics, such as HIV from chimps [1] and the H1N1 ''Spanish flu'' from birds [2] , which have both killed tens of millions of people. Other important human pathogens have originated from other host species, including Plasmodium falciparum [3] , SARS coronavirus [4] , Hendra and Nipah viruses [5] , and the measles virus [6] . Past host shifts can be detected when the phylogenies of hosts and their pathogens are different (phylogenetic incongruence-Box 1). This is very common, with a survey of the published literature finding 93% of studies comparing host and pathogen phylogenies showed evidence of host shifts [7] , and there are relatively few cases where the pathogen phylogeny mirrors that of its host completely [8] .\n",

This can take the form of spillover events that result in dead end infections or short stuttering transmission chains, or a host shift with successful infection and sustained transmission in the new host (Box 1). Host shifts have resulted in multiple human pandemics, such as HIV from chimps [1] and the H1N1 ''Spanish flu'' from birds [2] , which have both killed tens of millions of people. Other important human pathogens have originated from other host species, including Plasmodium falciparum [3] , SARS coronavirus [4] , Hendra and Nipah viruses [5] , and the measles virus [6] . Past host shifts can be detected when the phylogenies of hosts and their pathogens are different (phylogenetic incongruence-Box 1). This is very common, with a survey of the published literature finding 93% of studies comparing host and pathogen phylogenies showed evidence of host shifts [7] , and there are relatively few cases where the pathogen phylogeny mirrors that of its host completely [8] .\n",

Since that time, many MAbs have been developed for use in diagnostic procedures and in immunotherapy. Ever since it was observed that the therapeutic use of heterologous MAbs elicited immunogenic responses in humans, significant research efforts have been devoted toward creating chimeric and humanized antibodies for use in human patients. Major achievements have been in the production of MAbs in transgenic plants and animals. The use of phage display libraries has created customized antibodies with defined affinity and specificity. This review describes how rodent, chimeric, and humanized antibodies have each been used, with varying degrees of success to treat cancer, septicemia, autoimmune disorders, and infectious diseases. We also describe here recent applications of antibody engineering, such as the use of bispecific antibodies and antibody fragments in immunotherapy.\n",

Saudi Arabia, being the custodian of the 2 holy cities (Mecca and Medina), provides extensive, multifaceted programs to serve these \"Guests of God.\" However, the annual event is confronted with public health challenges besides immigration, crowd, and crime management. In addition to the formidable logistics, the risk for spread of infectious diseases is well recognized in the era of globalization. Contemporary outbreaks of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), Ebola virus, and Zika virus have drawn much attention to global health. The annual Hajj event definitely calls for precautions. This paper is informed by a review of the literature and case studies among 2015 Hajj pilgrims.\n",

      "Emerging infectious diseases are of particular concern to public health. Emergence is driven by sociocultural, environmental, and ecological factors. 1 The vulnerability of people to emerging infectious diseases has been shown by the emergence of AIDS in the late 1970s, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003, pandemic infl uenza H1N1 in 2009, and multidrug-resistant nosocomial pathogens, as well as the re-emergence of dengue, chikungunya, and malaria. Traditionally, eff ective disease surveillance is expensive and needs a formal public health network. 2 Such systems are maintained by most countries, to varying degrees. Data sources, surveillance methods, analytical approaches, and factors aff ecting these systems are varied and have been reviewed in detail elsewhere. 3, 4 Traditional, passive surveillance systems typically rely on data submitted to the relevant public health authority by physicians, laboratories, and other health-care providers; they provide information crucial to the eff ective functioning of health systems. 5 These systems can be com plex and expensive. Time and resource constraints, as well as a lack of operational knowledge of reporting systems, adversely aff ect the completeness of reporting, 6 resulting in an incomplete account of disease emergence. Furthermore, substantial lags between an event and its notifi cation are common; a result of late or failed reporting and the hierarchical structure of these systems. 7 The average delay from receipt to dissemination of data by traditional sentinel surveillance networks is roughly 2 weeks. 8 Internet availability and use has increased greatly in the past 10 years (fi gure 1). 9, 10 The availability of healthrelated information on the internet (of varying quality and legitimacy) has also changed how people seek information about health. 10, 11 These changes provide a new means to detect and monitor infectious diseases. The nature of emerging infectious diseases often limits the eff ectiveness of traditional surveillance systems. 12 Digital surveillance could improve both the sensitivity and timeliness of detection of health events. 13 We review recent studies that have exploited internet use and search trends to monitor two acute-onset viral illnesses of worldwide importance that have substantial seasonal and geographic variation: infl uenza and dengue. We critically analyse the eff ectiveness of monitoring internet data to track these diseases and discuss the advantages and limitations of this approach.

      "EVALUATING HOSPITAL-BASED SURVEILLANCE FOR OUTBREAK DETECTION IN BANGLADESH: ANALYSIS OF HEALTHCARE UTILIZATION DATA\n",

      "\n",
      "We propose a framework to evaluate the sensitivity and representativeness of hospital-based surveillance and apply it to severe neurological infectious diseases and fatal respiratory infectious diseases in Bangladesh. We identified cases in selected communities within surveillance hospital catchment areas using key informant and house-to-house surveys and ascertained where cases had sought care. We estimated the probability of surveillance detecting different sized outbreaks by distance from the surveillance hospital and compared characteristics of cases identified in the community and cases attending surveillance hospitals.\n",

      "Emerging infectious diseases are of particular concern to public health. Emergence is driven by sociocultural, environmental, and ecological factors. 1 The vulnerability of people to emerging infectious diseases has been shown by the emergence of AIDS in the late 1970s, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003, pandemic infl uenza H1N1 in 2009, and multidrug-resistant nosocomial pathogens, as well as the re-emergence of dengue, chikungunya, and malaria. Traditionally, eff ective disease surveillance is expensive and needs a formal public health network. 2 Such systems are maintained by most countries, to varying degrees. Data sources, surveillance methods, analytical approaches, and factors aff ecting these systems are varied and have been reviewed in detail elsewhere. 3, 4 Traditional, passive surveillance systems typically rely on data submitted to the relevant public health authority by physicians, laboratories, and other health-care providers; they provide information crucial to the eff ective functioning of health systems. 5 These systems can be com plex and expensive. Time and resource constraints, as well as a lack of operational knowledge of reporting systems, adversely aff ect the completeness of reporting, 6 resulting in an incomplete account of disease emergence. Furthermore, substantial lags between an event and its notifi cation are common; a result of late or failed reporting and the hierarchical structure of these systems. 7 The average delay from receipt to dissemination of data by traditional sentinel surveillance networks is roughly 2 weeks. 8 Internet availability and use has increased greatly in the past 10 years (fi gure 1). 9, 10 The availability of healthrelated information on the internet (of varying quality and legitimacy) has also changed how people seek information about health. 10, 11 These changes provide a new means to detect and monitor infectious diseases. The nature of emerging infectious diseases often limits the eff ectiveness of traditional surveillance systems. 12 Digital surveillance could improve both the sensitivity and timeliness of detection of health events. 13 We review recent studies that have exploited internet use and search trends to monitor two acute-onset viral illnesses of worldwide importance that have substantial seasonal and geographic variation: infl uenza and dengue. We critically analyse the eff ectiveness of monitoring internet data to track these diseases and discuss the advantages and limitations of this approach. Finally, we make recommendations for future research into these systems.\n",

Along with Brazil, Russia, and India, China has one of the world's most rapidly developing markets. Its growing economy is creating new public relations opportunities within and outside its borders, thereby arousing worldwide interest in China's emergent engagement with the global economic sphere. In the first decade of the twenty-first century; however, China's economy faced several major crises.

The author in a recent paper extended the systems approach to incorporate principles of complexity science and to conceptualize population health outcomes as an emergent property of a dynamic and open, complex adaptive system [2] . The current paper explores these themes further and applies the principles of systems approach and complexity science (i.e. systems science) to conceptualize social determinants of health inequalities (SDHI). The paper begins with a brief overview of the existing models of SDHI, and then proposes a two step approach to remodel our perspectives and outlines possible implications.\n",

      "\n",
      "The IHR's origins can be traced to a series of Sanitary Conferences beginning in 1851 to forge an international agreement to curb the spread of infectious diseases (originally cholera, followed by plague and yellow fever) entering Europe from Asia, particularly India and the Levant. 10 At that time, the concept of global health security meant protecting Europe without unduly hindering trade. The Sanitary Conferences led to a binding agreement in 1892-the International Sanitary Convention (ISC)-focused on quarantine for cholera. European states subsequently adopted additional conventions, which were incorporated into a single ISC. By 1926, the ISC covered primarily cholera, yellow fever, and plague. The raison d'être of the earliest treaties grew out of a perceived security imperative for powerful countries. Most important was selfprotection against external threats, rather than safeguarding the public's health in every region of the world.\n",

From sanitary cordons instituted to prevent plague from entering Croatia's Dalmatian Coast to the international sanitary conventions, which began in 1851, to the victories over malaria and yellow fever that permitted the construction of the strategic Panama Canal, health and disease have been intertwined with the pursuit of foreignpolicy interests. However, over the last 2 decades, globalization has made global health more relevant across multiple aspects of foreign policy than ever before. Fidler calls this a ''revolution'' in the political status of global health, noting that ''nothing in the prior history of national and international efforts on public health compares to the political status public health has reached today'' (1, p. 45) .\n",
