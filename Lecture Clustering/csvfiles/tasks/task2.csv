Respiratory disease in pregnancy,Breathlessness in the absence of an underlying pathology is common in pregnancy. Asthma affects about 7% of women of childbearing age. Treatment is the same as for the non-pregnant population and most drugs are safe in pregnancy. Educating women to continue preventer inhaled corticosteroid therapy will reduce the risk of attacks. Respiratory infections are associated with a higher morbidity in pregnancy and should be treated aggressively. Most chronic pulmonary diseases do not alter fertility. Large reserves in respiratory function allow the fetus and mother to survive without compromise in most cases. The use of chest X-rays should not be avoided in pregnancy. Women with a chronic respiratory disease should receive pre-pregnancy counselling and education. Women should be managed in a multidisciplinary setting with the respiratory team. The presence of pulmonary hypertension and cor pulmonale is associated with a high risk of death in pregnancy.,"Severe chest disease leading to respiratory failure is uncommon in women of childbearing age but respiratory symptoms are extremely common in pregnancy. This is in part an effect of the physiological adaptation of the respiratory and vascular systems to pregnancy and in part because of limited functional capacity and mobility from diaphragmatic elevation by the gravid uterus in late gestation. Oxygen consumption is increased by 20% from early pregnancy, minute ventilation by 40-50% secondary to tidal volume increase, and maternal hyperventilation results in a mild fully compensated respiratory alkalosis (increased arterial pO 2 and decreased arterial pCO 2 , compensatory fall in serum bicarbonate to 18-22 mmol/l; arterial pH 7.44).

The commonest respiratory symptom in pregnancy is breathlessness. Although not the subject of this article, pulmonary embolus and cardiac causes are important differential diagnoses, but it is most commonly the increased awareness of the physiological hyperventilation of pregnancy which leads to a subjective feeling of breathlessness. Women most often present in the third trimester but may become symptomatic at any gestation. Classically physiological breathlessness of pregnancy is present at rest or while talking and paradoxically improves with activity. Table 1 summarises other causes. Other presenting symptoms of respiratory disease include chest pain, cough, sputum production, haemoptysis, fever or cyanosis.

On examination, respiratory rate is unchanged by pregnancy. Presence of raised temperature should be noted. Expansion on inspiration reflects tidal volume and is reduced in many respiratory diseases. Percussion note may be dull in the presence of pleural effusion, consolidation, collapse or fibrosis. It is enhanced in the presence of a pneumothorax. Auscultation may reveal wheezes indicative of asthma, fine crepitations in the presence of pulmonary oedema and pleural rubs indicative of inflammatory conditions of the pleura in pneumonia or pulmonary infarction; and bronchial breathing+coarse crackles suggest consolidation. Absent breath sounds occur with pneumothorax or extensive collapse.

A simple non-invasive investigation is transcutaneous oxygen saturation. The normal oxygen saturation is 495%. A fall in saturation on exercise, e.g. climbing stairs, indicates some form of cardiopulmonary disease and should be investigated further. Measurement of arterial blood gases should be reserved for those who are markedly breathless, those whose oxygen saturations are low at rest or which drop on exercise, and those who appear unwell. Reluctance to perform a chest X-ray in pregnancy may delay a diagnosis. Ionising radiation from a chest X-ray is approximately 0.2 rad (o5% of the maximum recommended exposure in pregnancy) and abdominal shielding will reduce fetal exposure further. Sputum should be sent for microbiological examination.

Asthma is a common chronic inflammatory condition of the lung airways characterised by episodes of reversible bronchoconstriction as a result of various stimuli. It affects up to 7% of women of childbearing age. It may present with episodes of wheeze, shortness of breath, chest tightness or cough. Signs classically include a diffuse, bilateral, expiratory (7inspiratory) wheeze and tachypnoea but are often absent. There may be an associated personal or family history of atopy and recognised triggers include pollen, dust, animals and infections. Objectively the diagnosis may be confirmed by measuring the peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) or forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV 1 ) as an indication of the degree of bronchoconstriction. A 420% diurnal variation on X3 days in a week for 2 weeks on PEF diary or FEV 1 X15% increase after a trial of a b 2 agonist or steroid tablets or a similar decrease after 6 minutes of exercise are diagnostic. PEFR and FEV 1 are unaffected by pregnancy.

Atopy is often associated with asthma. It has no effect on pregnancy and drugs used in the treatment of hayfever (the antihistamines most commonly used with best safety profile are chlorpheniramine and intranasal beclomethasone) may be safely prescribed.

Effect of asthma on pregnancy: Although a number of small studies have suggested an association of asthma with the development of pre-eclampsia, intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR), preterm birth and low birthweights, most pregnancies are unaffected by the effects of asthma. Severe poorly controlled asthma resulting in episodes of maternal hypoxaemia could, however, give rise to such complications. It is therefore of concern that many women stop their medication at the start of the pregnancy because of concerns regarding the safety profile of these drugs for the fetus. In a recent US study, between 5 and 13 weeks' gestation there was a 23% reduction in use of inhaled corticosteroids, 13% reduction in short-acting b 2 -agonists and a 54% reduction in rescue steroids.

Effect of pregnancy on asthma: Asthma can worsen, improve or remain unchanged in pregnancy. Endogenous steroids in labour ensure that acute asthma attacks are very uncommon during labour and delivery. There may be a deterioration postpartum.

Management: Pregnancy is an ideal opportunity to optimise therapy. Ideally, this should occur pre-pregnancy. A pre-conceptual visit would allow time to optimise therapy and educate women regarding the importance and safety of continuing their medication to ensure good asthma control throughout pregnancy. Inhaler techniques should be checked and home peak flow monitoring encouraged. Pregnant women should be monitored closely so that any change in course can be matched by an appropriate change in therapy. Smoking should be discouraged.

Drug therapy in pregnancy is essentially the same as for the non-pregnant population and should follow the British Thoracic Society guidelines on the management of asthma. A stepwise approach is recommended (Figure 1 ). Inhaled b 2 -agonists, inhaled and oral steroids, oral and intravenous theophyllines and intravenous magnesium sulphate should be used as normal. Only leukotriene antagonists are not recommended because of limited data, although the guidelines suggest that it is safer to continue these in women who are already taking them and who are resistant to the other therapies.

Acute asthma attacks should be managed aggressively as an emergency in hospital. Multidisciplinary care from obstetricians, respiratory physicians and, in severe cases, ITU staff will ensure that appropriate treatment as for the non-pregnant patients is administered (Table 2) . Continuous oxygen to maintain saturation above 95% and continuous fetal monitoring should be instigated. A PEFR of 33-50% best/predicted indicates acute severe asthma attack;o33% is life-threatening. Other concerning signs are SpO 2 o92%, pO 2 o8 kPa with normal pCO 2 , silent chest, cyanosis, feeble respiratory effort, hypotension, altered consciousness and exhaustion.

If caesarean section is required, regional blockade is preferable to general anaesthesia in women with asthma and opiates should be avoided for pain relief, especially in the presence of an acute

Prostaglandin E 2 does not cause bronchoconstriction and may used for induction of labour. Prostaglandin F 2a should be used only in extreme circumstances in the management of postpartum haemorrhage and with caution since it may precipitate an acute attack. Likewise aspirin and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs should be avoided, although if aspirin is indicated for pre-eclampsia prophylaxis, and there is a history of aspirin exposure without problems, then it should be safe to use. Encourage women to continue their regular medication in labour. Those women taking 47.5 mg prednisolone tablets for 42 weeks prior to the onset of labour require parenteral hydrocortisone 100 mg 6-8 hourly during labour. Ergometrine has been reported to cause bronchospasm but syntometrine routinely used for active management of the third stage does not.

Postpartum, breastfeeding may reduce the incidence of asthma in the child and should be encouraged. None of the medications for asthma is contraindicated in breastfeeding.

Pneumonia occurs in the pregnant population with a frequency equal to that in the general population.

Effects of pregnancy on pneumonia: Pneumonia in pregnancy is often more virulent and mortality is higher than in the nonpregnant population. The spectrum of pathogens is similar to that in the non-pregnant population and the management does not differ. Coexisting maternal disease, including asthma and anaemia, and immunosuppressive therapy increase the risk of contracting pneumonia.

Effect of pneumonia on pregnancy: Severe pneumonia may precipitate preterm delivery and result in low birthweight infants. There is an increased risk of serious maternal complications, including respiratory failure.

Clinical features: Women may present with cough, fever, rigors, breathlessness and pleuritic pain. Signs include fever, purulent sputum, coarse crackles on auscultation and signs of consolidation. Diagnosis may be confirmed with a chest X-ray. Blood and sputum cultures should be taken. Bacterial pneumonia is associated with a raised white blood cell count, although mycoplasma pneumonia is not. Knowledge of the increased mycoplasma activity in the community during an epidemic period may help guide the clinician to the increased likelihood of mycoplasma infection. Mycoplasma and chlamydial pneumonias are diagnosed on serological assays with complement fixation tests.

Management: Supportive measures in the management of pregnant women with pneumonia include oxygen administration if there is evidence of hypoxia, and rehydration especially in the presence of fever. Chest physiotherapy will help clear secretions and aid oxygenation. Oral antibiotic therapy should be commenced for community acquired bacterial infections -oral amoxicillin (0.5-1 g t.d.s.) and clarithromycin (500 mg b.d.) are the current recommended strategies. For severe community acquired or hospital acquired infections intravenous cefuroxime and clarithromycin should be used. Tetracyclines cause discolouration of the teeth in the fetus and should be avoided after 20 weeks' gestation.

Community-acquired pneumonia is most commonly caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. b-Lactam and macrolide antibiotics are safe in pregnancy and are effective in treating community acquired infections.

Viral pneumonia Viral respiratory infections, including varicella, influenza A and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), may present in pregnancy and are associated with a worse outcome than in the non-pregnant population. Current antiviral and respiratory therapies can reduce maternal morbidity and mortality.

The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists' guidelines on the treatment of varicella infection in pregnancy recommend that all non-immune pregnant women exposed to varicella should be given zoster immunoglobulin (ZIG) as soon as possible. Those who develop clinical varicella should be treated with aciclovir if within 24 hours of the onset of the rash and after 20 weeks' gestation since mortality and morbidity is higher at advanced gestations. Hospital admission should be arranged in the event of respiratory deterioration, neurological symptoms, haemorrhagic rash and bleeding, or in the presence of a dense rash with mucosal lesions. Delivery during a viraemic period is hazardous with maternal risks of bleeding, thrombocytopenia, disseminated intravascular coagulation and hepatitis. Supportive treatment and intravenous aciclovir may be necessary. There is a high risk of varicella transmission to the newborn with significant morbidity and mortality. Therefore, VZIG should be given to the newborn after delivery (if maternal infection occurred within 5 days pre and 2 days post-delivery). If the neonate develops varicella, aciclovir should be commenced.

Influenza vaccination can reduce the prevalence of hospitalisations among pregnant women during the influenza season and is not contraindicated in pregnancy.

Give high flow oxygen b 2 -agonist bronchodilators High-dose inhaled b 2 -agonists by oxygen-driven nebuliser Ipratropium bromide Add nebulised ipratropium bromide (0.5 mg 4-6 hourly) if poor response to bronchodilators or severe acute asthma Steroid therapy Systemic steroids (40-50 mg/day) in all cases for at least 5 days or until recovery Other therapies Consider single dose intravenous magnesium sulphate (1.2-2 g infusion over 20 minutes) Routine antibiotics are not recommended 

Pneumocystis pneumonia in association with HIV Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) is the most common opportunistic infection in patients progressing to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and continues to carry significant maternal risk to the immunocompromised population. It should be suspected in the presence of profound hypoxia out of proportion to the chest X-ray findings, and bronchoscopy should be considered. Treatment is with high-dose co-trimoxazole (Septrin)7pentamidine, usually contraindicated in pregnancy because of the theoretical risks of neonatal kernicterus and haemolysis. However, in the presence of PCP the benefits of treatment outweigh these risks and women with HIV and a past history of PCP or with a CD4+ cell count ofo200 cells/ml should receive prophylactic Septrin or nebulised pentamidine when embarking on pregnancy.

This is an infection caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis which characteristically causes caseating granulomas, usually involving the lungs as the primary site. The incidence of tuberculosis (TB) worldwide is rising, in part due to the susceptibility to TB of HIVinfected patients, and in the UK is more prevalent amongst Asian and African immigrants. In pregnancy recent studies have suggested a high prevalence (50%) of extrapulmonary TB (at sites such as lymph nodes, bone, liver, spleen, bone marrow, caecum, nervous system and eye). The patient is often asymptomatic but typically can present with a cough, haemoptysis, weight loss and night sweats. The diagnosis is confirmed with sputum examination for acid-fast bacilli (Ziehl-Neelsen stain).

Although pregnancy and TB have little effect on each other, treatment should not be delayed in pregnancy. Because of a rising incidence of drug-resistant TB, treatment is often with prolonged courses of multiple chemotherapeutic agents at the advice of the respiratory physicians. The usual drugs given are rifampicin (no proven adverse fetal effects but risk of maternal hepatotoxicity), isoniazid (in combination with pyridoxine 50 mg/day to reduce the risk of peripheral neuritis), pyrazinamide and/or ethambutol. Liver function should be monitored monthly. Streptomycin is associated with eighth nerve damage and should therefore be avoided. After delivery the neonate should be given prophylactic isoniazid treatment if the mother is sputum positive. The infant should also be vaccinated as soon as possible. Breastfeeding is not contraindicated since very little of the drugs are excreted in breast milk.

This is a complication of gastric regurgitation often at the time of a general anaesthetic in late pregnancy (usually at caesarean section). It may also occur in the event of an excessively high regional block. Increased intra-abdominal pressure, delayed gastric emptying and reduced gastro-oesophageal sphincter tone contribute to the risk. Ranitidine, an H 2 antagonist, which reduces gastric acid secretion and an antacid which neutralises the gastric acid are now routinely prescribed for women in labour with risk factors for caesarean section or prior to an elective procedure. The last confidential enquiry into maternal deaths (2000) (2001) (2002) reported one death from gastric aspiration in an obese woman (BMI 435) following failure to intubate the trachea after induction for general anaesthesia.

Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal-recessive disorder affecting the body's exocrine glands, including the pancreas, sweat glands and lungs. It results from a gene deletion in 70% of cases and has a carrier frequency of 1 in 25 caucasians. A resultant defect in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator protein causes impaired movement of water and electrolytes across epithelial surfaces. Formerly, CF patients rarely lived to adulthood, but improvements in treatment have meant more women with CF are now reaching reproductive age and wish to become pregnant. The signs and symptoms of CF vary, depending on the severity of the disease and the degree of bacterial infection. Some cases are very mild and may not be diagnosed until adulthood. CF is characterised by the production of very thick and sticky mucus. The ducts leading from the pancreas become obstructed, causing pancreatic insufficiency, diabetes and malnutrition. About 90% of CF cases involve the lungs with recurrent or persistent infections, development of bronchiectasis and respiratory failure. A productive cough is almost always present, and very often patients appear barrel-chested. Frequent hospitalisations are a result of recurring respiratory, gastrointestinal and nutritional problems.

Effect of cystic fibrosis on pregnancy: Female fertility may be impaired because of malnutrition or thickened cervical mucus but is usually normal. Men are usually sterile. Most reported series of pregnancies in women with CF have shown that with careful planning and close monitoring by a dedicated CF team, pregnancy outcomes are favourable. Commonly reported adverse events are IUGR and prematurity, which includes iatrogenic early delivery in unwell women.

Effect of pregnancy on cystic fibrosis: Pregnancy does not affect disease severity or cause deterioration in the patient's condition. Maternal mortality is not significantly greater than non-pregnant age-matched women with CF except in the presence of pulmonary hypertension, cyanosis, arterial hypoxaemia (oxygen saturationo90%), severe lung disease (FEV 1 o60% predicted) and/or malnutrition when both maternal and fetal outcome may be poor.

Management: The risk of a child being born with CF is 2-2.5% if the carrier status of the father is unknown (based on the UK carrier status of 1 in 25) and 50% if the father is heterozygous for the gene. Therefore pre-conceptual genetic counselling is important. During the pregnancy, regular assessment of fetal growth should be planned to detect early signs of fetal growth restriction.

Ideally women with CF planning a pregnancy should be seen and assessed pre-conceptually. Women with mild disease can then be reassured that pregnancy is safe and liaison may be planned ahead between a CF centre and an obstetrician with a special interest in CF.

Screening for diabetes and baseline lung function tests can be performed. Dietary supplementation and enzyme supplements can be commenced to optimise the patient's condition prior to conception and continued throughout pregnancy. Women with CF are at increased risk of developing gestational diabetes. Chest physiotherapy and prophylactic antibiotics may be implemented prior to conception and continued throughout the pregnancy. Infective chest exacerbations should be treated aggressively with antibiotic therapy.

Conversely, if pre-conceptually the patient is found to have pulmonary hypertension complicating the CF, cor pulmonale or an FEV 1 o30-40%, she may be counselled regarding the associated high risk and be strongly advised against pregnancy. Effective contraception should also be discussed in such cases.

In order to achieve a successful outcome, multidisciplinary management aims to ensure adequate maternal nutrition, control of pulmonary infection and avoidance of prolonged hypoxia. Women may develop symptoms of breathlessness or evidence of hypoxia in late pregnancy. Admission for bed rest and oxygen therapy should be arranged. Delivery should be planned if their clinical condition deteriorates further.

There is no contraindication to vaginal delivery but a prolonged second stage should be avoided because of the susceptibility of these patients to pneumothoraces. General anaesthesia should be avoided. There is no contraindication to breastfeeding but women may need to continue nutritional supplements postpartum.

Bronchiectasis is a sequela of CF, pneumonias and rarer causes such as Kartagener's syndrome. It is characterised by irreversibly dilated damaged bronchi predisposing to persistently infected mucus and bacterial infections. A cough productive of large amounts of sputum is characteristic. The condition is uncommon in the childbearing years but there is some evidence to suggest an association with IUGR when present in pregnancy. Women should be managed jointly with respiratory physicians and their condition can deteriorate in pregnancy. Close attention to postural drainage and physiotherapy will help. Regular sputum cultures and treatment of chest infections are necessary intermittently or continuously if recurrent infections are frequent. The use of bronchodilators may help. As in CF, the presence of pulmonary hypertension and/or hypoxaemia adversely affects prognosis.

There are few data regarding pregnancy outcome in women following lung transplant. Of a series of 10 pregnancies in 10 women who were CF lung transplant recipients, five with a long stable interval of 43 years between transplant and the pregnancy had favourable outcomes; the remaining five had preterm deliveries. All 10, however, showed progressive decline in lung function and all died of chronic rejection within 38 months of delivery.

Restrictive ventilatory defects characterised by a reduction in lung volumes and an increase in the ratio of FEV 1 to forced vital capacity (FVC) occur when lung expansion is limited because of alterations in the lung parenchyma or because of abnormalities in the pleura, chest wall or neuromuscular apparatus. The majority of pulmonary diseases do not alter fertility. A large reserve in respiratory function allows fetus and mother to survive without compromise in most cases. FVC of 41 l or 50% of predicted have been suggested as a cut-off for successful pregnancies and although more severe cases can negotiate pregnancy, patients with severe restrictive lung disease should be advised to avoid pregnancy or consider a therapeutic termination. Associated polycythaemia causing hyperviscosity may add to the thrombotic risk during a pregnancy. Women with an associated kyphoscoliosis are often delivered prematurely because of deterioration in lung function. Mode of delivery tends to be caesarean section because of abnormal fetal presentation. Each case should be assessed individually.

Sarcoidosis is characterised by non-caseating epithelioid granulomas that may affect any organ system. The aetiology of the disease remains unknown. The disease most commonly involves granuloma formation in the lungs. Other commonly involved organ systems include the lymph nodes (especially the intrathoracic nodes), skin, eyes, liver, heart, and nervous, musculoskeletal, renal and endocrine systems.

The course of sarcoidosis is variable, ranging from self-limited acute disease to a chronic debilitating disease that may result in death. Spontaneous remissions occur in nearly two-thirds of patients, but 10-30% of patients have a more chronic or progressive course. Because sarcoidosis can involve any organ system, the clinical presentation is often variable. Many patients are asymptomatic but there may be chest symptoms. Other features include erythema nodosum, anterior uveitis, hypercalcaemia, arthropathy, fever or central nervous system symptoms.

Effect of pregnancy on sarcoidosis: According to reported series, sarcoidosis either does not change in pregnancy or if it changes, improves, possibly because of the increased circulating cortisol. However, there is a tendency to relapse in the puerperium. This should not be a contraindication to pregnancy except in severely affected cases pre-pregnancy. Factors indicating a poor prognosis include parenchymal lesions on chest X-ray, advanced radiographic staging, advanced maternal age, low inflammatory activity, requirement for drugs other than steroids and presence of extrapulmonary sarcoidosis.

Effect of sarcoidosis on pregnancy: Sarcoidosis does not adversely affect pregnancy and is not transmitted to the fetus. There is one report of sarcoid granulomata found in the placenta of one patient.

Management: Ideally patients require evaluation before pregnancy to establish chronicity, baseline pulmonary function, inflammatory activity, staging and response to treatment. Systemic steroids should be continued in pregnancy. Angiotensin converting enzyme levels, used as a marker of disease activity, are unreliable in pregnancy. Women should be advised to avoid vitamin D because of the risk of hypercalcaemia. Intravenous hydrocortisone should be administered in labour in women taking 47.5 mg/day of prednisolone.

Wegener's granulomatosis This is a rare form of systemic vasculitis in which necrotising granulomatous lesions affect the upper respiratory tract, lungs and kidneys. Without treatment the condition has a poor prognosis. Remission may be achieved with prednisolone and cyclophosphamide, a teratogenic drug. Women should be advised to avoid pregnancy until remission has been achieved and to wait at least 3 months following cessation of cyclophosphamide before conceiving. Cyclophosphamide may also cause ovarian failure.

Pregnancy has been associated with exacerbation of disease activity and cyclophosphamide has been used in the latter half of pregnancy, causing a fetal leucopenia. Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) titres are markers of disease activity but their reliability in pregnancy has not been evaluated.

Amniotic fluid embolism is fortunately rare (1 in 80 000) but should be suspected when a woman presents with a sudden onset of hypoxia (with dysnoea, cyanosis or respiratory arrest), collapse, an acute hypotensive crises or disseminated intravascular coagulation or haemorrhage in the absence of any other explanation. Onset is usually during labour, caesarean section or within 30 minutes of delivery. It has also been described during dilatation and curettage procedures. Management is supportive with early involvement of the intensive care team. The aim is to achieve adequate oxygenation with ventilatory support, invasive monitoring to maintain good cardiac output and correction of a coagulopathy. Mortality rate is 480%. The pathogenesis is not entirely clear. It is thought to be due to the passage of amniotic fluid and debris into the maternal circulation, precipitating an anaphylactic-like reaction. Fetal squames are however present in the circulation of healthy pregnant women without any consequences.

Bronchial carcinoma accounts for 95% of all primary tumours of the lungs. Although the incidence continues to rise in women, few cases have been reported in pregnancy. The commonest presenting symptoms are cough, chest discomfort and haemoptysis and chest X-ray may demonstrate round shadows. Metastasis has been reported in the pericardium and placenta. Lymphomas may also present with respiratory symptoms.

The strength of association between cigarette smoking and bronchial carcinoma overshadows any other aetiological risk factors and 20-30% of pregnant women report smoking in the developed world. Few will stop on becoming pregnant but focused counselling by specialist staff has been shown to be more effective than other measures, with more than doubling of cessation rates. The effectiveness and safety of nicotine replacement therapy in pregnancy have yet to be established. Besides maternal morbidity, smoking adversely affects the pregnancy by doubling the risk of premature delivery, both spontaneous and iatrogenic, as a result of placental abruption and lowers the mean birth weight. Reduced ovarian and tubal function and implantation predispose to subfertility, miscarriage and ectopic pregnancy.

Breathlessness in the absence of an underlying pathology is common in pregnancy, especially in the second and third trimesters. The use of chest X-rays when underlying disease is suspected should not be avoided in pregnancy and most drugs can be used safely in pregnancy. It is important that women with a chronic respiratory disease should receive pre-pregnancy counselling and education regarding the risks of pregnancy and the importance of continuing their medications. It also provides the opportunity to optimise their condition and so reduce adverse pregnancy outcomes. Women should be managed in a multidisciplinary setting with regular review by chest physicians and access to chest physiotherapy if necessary. Liaison with obstetric anaesthetists in the antenatal period will optimise care at delivery with regard to pain relief and reduce anaesthetic risks. Respiratory diseases complicated by pulmonary hypertension and cor pulmonale have a poor prognosis in pregnancy.F

Pneumonia in pregnancy is often more virulent and therefore should be treated aggressively All non-immune pregnant women exposed to varicella should be given zoster immunoglobulin (

Exercise and infection risk,"After studying this chapter, you should be able to . . . 1. Describe the J-shaped model of upper respiratory tract infection risk and exercise volume. 2. Evaluate the evidence concerning moderate exercise and upper respiratory tract infection risk. 3. Evaluate the evidence concerning heavy exercise and upper respiratory tract infection risk.","Upper respiratory tract infections (URTI) such as coughs and colds, throat infections and middle ear infections are a leading cause of visits to general practitioners throughout the world (Graham 1990) . Given that the average adult suffers from two to five colds each year (Heath et al 1992) it is not surprising that the socioeconomic consequences of these illnesses are considerable in terms of days lost from work and costs of medical consultation, care and over-the-counter remedies. As such, these illnesses present a real concern to the wellbeing of both athletes and the general population and therefore an understanding of the relationship between physical activity and infection risk is of great importance.

The J-shaped model 2 Moderate exercise and risk of URTI 2 Anecdotal reports 2 Epidemiological data 3 Moderate exercise and URTI symptoms 5 Possible mechanisms 6

The J-shaped model of the relationship between exercise and URTI risk It has been hypothesized that the relationship between exercise intensity/volume and susceptibility to URTI is J-shaped (Nieman 1994, Fig. 1.1) . According to this model, taking part in some regular moderate physical activity decreases the relative risk of URTI below that of a sedentary individual. However, performing prolonged, high-intensity exercise or periods of strenuous exercise training is associated with an above-average risk of URTI. When first proposed, the J-shaped model was based on the findings of a relatively small number of studies and the majority of these explored the relationship between heavy exercise and URTI risk. There has been further interest in this area in recent years, particularly with regard to the relationship between moderate exercise and incidence of URTI. This provides us with additional evidence to consider when assessing the relationship between exercise and infection risk and we can now more effectively evaluate the validity of the J-shaped model.

Athletes and fitness enthusiasts have long supported the idea that 'keeping fit' confers some protection against infection. In a survey examining the long-term health value of endurance exercise training, responses from 750 'Masters Athletes' (age range 40-81 years) suggested that 76% considered themselves as 'less vulnerable to illness than their peers' and 68% regarded their quality of life as 'much better than that of their sedentary friends' (Shephard et al 1995) . In a further survey of 170 nonelite marathon runners, 90% agreed with the statement that they 'rarely get sick' (Nieman 2000) . Thus, anecdotal reports such as these certainly support the J-shaped model concerning the relationship between moderate exercise and infection risk. However, these reports alone by no means validate this portion of the J-shaped model; data from experimental and epidemiological studies needs to be considered.

On the whole, the studies that have looked at the relationship between moderate (and more intense) exercise and infection risk have been survey-based epidemiological studies. In the majority of these studies, a physician has not diagnosed an episode of URTI; rather, subjects have completed a questionnaire or a daily logbook in which they noted their symptoms of illness (including URTI) either during the study or retrospectively. For example, in one randomized exercise training study that is typical of many of the studies carried out on this topic, subjects recorded health problems each day by means of codes including: cold (runny nose, cough, sore throat), allergy (itchy eyes, stuffy nose), headache, fever, nausea/vomiting/ diarrhoea, fatigue/tiredness, muscle/joint/bone problem or injury, menstrual cramps, other (describe), or none (Nieman et al 1990b) . An episode of URTI was defined as coding for a cold with or without supporting symptoms of headache, fever, fatigue/tiredness or nausea/vomiting/diarrhoea for 48 hours and separated from a previous episode by at least 1 week. In most studies, physical activity patterns are also assessed by questionnaire. These studies have the advantage in that they allow large cohorts to be studied, although the reliability of the data gained from these studies may depend upon the experimental design; for example, memory recall over long periods of time has obvious potential for error. One study that illustrates both of these points examined the relationship between physical activity patterns and episodes of URTI in 199 young Dutch adults (age range 20-23 years) (Schouten et al 1988) . The 92 men and 107 women were asked to recall habitual physical activity over the previous 3 months and symptoms of URTI over the previous 6 months. In both the men and women, the incidence and duration of URTI symptoms was not related to total physical activity, although a significant, albeit very weak, negative correlation was found between sports activity (range 0-480 minutes/week) and incidence of URTI in the women (r = −0.18). However, despite the large cohort studied, the long period of recall used in this study may call the reliability of these findings into question.

In a smaller-scale study, a group of 36 previously sedentary, mildly obese young women (body mass index of ~28 kg/m 2 ) were randomly assigned to either 15 weeks of exercise training or to a control group who did not participate in any exercise outside normal daily activity (Nieman et al 1990b) . The exercise training was supervised and comprised five 45-minute sessions of brisk walking at 60% heart rate reserve each week. Symptoms of illness were recorded daily in a logbook and, importantly, all of the women were unaware of the aims of the study. Over the 15-week study period, the actual number of URTI episodes did not differ between the two groups. However, the women in the exercising group reported significantly fewer days with URTI symptoms compared with the sedentary controls (5.1 ± 1.2 days versus 10.8 ± 2.3 days in the exercising and control groups, respectively; Fig. 1 .2).

Thus, it appears that the exercising women were able to 'get over' their colds more quickly. In a similar study, 14 previously sedentary elderly women (aged 67-85) completed 12 weeks of supervised brisk walking (Nieman et al 1993) with another group of 16 of their sedentary peers participating in supervised sessions of callisthenics (light exercise involving muscular strength and flexibility work) over the same period. Only three of the walkers experienced an episode of URTI during the study period, compared with eight of the individuals in the callisthenics group. In addition, both groups were also compared with a group of 12 highly conditioned elderly women, who were still actively involved in endurance competitions; only one of these women experienced an episode of URTI during the same period. However, this study was performed during the autumn, and so may have been influenced by seasonal variations in exposure to pathogens (microorganisms that cause disease) and immune function. Nevertheless, in support of these findings, a prospective study performed over a whole year found that the number and duration of episodes of URTI in 61 men and women aged 66-84 years were negatively related with daily energy expenditure (Kostka et al 2000) , as assessed by questionnaire and daily logbooks. These subjects were involved only in moderate intensity activities, with the majority of the activities being performed indoors.

On the face of it, the findings of these studies certainly lend some support to the moderate exercise portion of the J-shaped model. However, it does raise the question of whether these findings are specific to the populations studied. For example, it may be that the elderly begin these investigations with a poorer level of immune function, and so any benefit of increased physical exercise may be more obvious (Shephard & Shek 1999) . In addition, other factors should also be considered. Nutritional status is known to influence immune function (as discussed further in Chs 8 and 9) and as such may be an important factor in determining an individual's susceptibility to infection; in the study of the elderly women, the well-conditioned group had a much higher dietary intake of energy and of several vitamins and minerals (Nieman et al 1993) . Psychological influences are also well known to affect measures of immune function (this is discussed further in Ch. 11), with decreases in measures of psychological stress associated with enhancement of several aspects of immune function. Interestingly, in both the elderly and younger, mildly obese women, participation in supervised exercise programmes was associated with increased feelings of general wellbeing (Cramer et al 1991 , Nieman et al 1993 . Furthermore, the selection criteria used may well present some degree of bias towards those with a 'healthy lifestyle'. The inclusion criteria for these studies may require individuals to be non-smokers and to be free from ailments such as diabetes, hypertension and cardiovascular disease; as such, these individuals may be less vulnerable to infection anyway. In support of this, a recent retrospective study found no relationship between habitual moderate physical activity and the incidence of colds in over 14 000 middle-aged smokers (Hemilä et al 2003) . These confounding factors aside, the findings of one recent study appear to give further support to the hypothesis that regular moderate exercise is associated with a lower incidence of URTI. The relationship between exercise and infection risk was explored across a broad range of age (from 20 to 70 years) and habitual physical activity level (Matthews et al 2002) . Over 500 adults were asked to recall episodes of colds (used to assess incidence of URTI), flu or allergic episodes at 3-month intervals over a period of a year. Explicit symptoms for assessment of URTI occurrence (e.g. runny nose, cough and sore throat) were not routinely recorded. Physical activity levels were assessed by 24-hour recall occurring on three occasions within 7 weeks of each URTI recall and took into consideration physical activity at home, work and during leisure time. The findings suggested that moderate physical activity was associated with a 20-30% reduction in annual risk of URTI, compared with low levels of activity. Although this study was based on 3-month recall of 'colds' rather than any specific symptoms of URTI, the patterns of seasonal variation in episodes of URTI were similar to others in the literature that have used more intensive assessment methods. As you can see in Figure 1 .3, colds were four times more prevalent in the winter months (November-March) than in the summer (June-August). In contrast, allergies were more common in the summertime. Furthermore, the data were also adjusted for many of the known risk factors for infection, such as age, smoking, anxiety, depression and dietary factors such as macronutrient and vitamin supplement intake.

On balance, the evidence from the available randomized controlled studies and larger survey-based studies does suggest some positive benefit of moderate exercise in reducing incidence of URTI. Furthermore, the finding that young women engaging in regular brisk walking compared with a sedentary lifestyle had fewer URTI symptom days suggests that moderate exercise may decrease URTI symptom severity and duration (Nieman et al 1990b) . One study to address this assertion in a controlled situation vaccinated 50 moderately trained college students with human Rhinovirus on two consecutive days (Weidner et al 1998) . Thirty-four of the students then went on to exercise at 70% heart rate reserve for 40 minutes every other day for 10 days, with the remaining 16 students assigned to a no-exercise condition. Over the 10 days, symptom severity and duration was assessed using a checklist and by weighing collected facial tissues. Throughout the 10 days post-vaccination, mean scores on the symptom questionnaire did not differ between the two groups, neither were there any differences in mass of the collected tissues. While these findings suggest that continuing to exercise during an URTI in moderately fit individuals does not affect symptom severity or duration, any extrapolation of these findings should be taken with caution. Human Rhinovirus accounts for only 40% of cold infections (Weidner et al 1998) and other cold-causing viruses, such as coronavirus, may have different symptom profiles because the immune response is specific to the invading pathogen. As this study investigated only Rhinovirus-caused URTI, this may account for the discrepancies between the findings of this study and those of Nieman et al (1990b) where the episodes of URTI experienced by the women were naturally occurring. Nevertheless, as a guideline, it is recommended that individuals do not exercise if symptoms are 'below the neck' (e.g. fever, diarrhoea, chesty cough, aching joints and muscles, swollen lymph glands). However, if the symptoms are above the neck (e.g. runny nose, sneezing) then exercise at low to moderate intensities may be performed (Weidner et al 1998) .

It has been suggested that the apparent relationship between moderate exercise and incidence of infection may be related to an increase in 'immunosurveillance', that is, an increase in the ability of the host to respond to an infectious challenge (Nieman 2000) . However, evidence in support of this has not been so forthcoming; rather, it appears that acute and regular moderate exercise generally has little effect on the immune system. Nevertheless, in the study of 36 mildly obese women discussed above, brisk walking for 45 minutes, five times a week over a 15-week period was associated with a 57% increase in natural killer cell cytotoxic activity (NKCA) after 6 weeks of the study compared with an increase of just 3% in the control group (Nieman et al 1990b) . NK cells are a type of lymphocyte (further details about NK cells can be found in Ch. 2) and unlike the other lymphocyte sub-populations T and B cells, NK cells are able to destroy a variety of virus-infected cells spontaneously. NK cells form an important first line of defence against viral infection, and as such, the greater NKCA, or killing ability, found after 6 weeks of moderate exercise training could account for the fewer URTI symptom days experienced by the exercising group. However, this elevation of NKCA was not observed at the end of the 15 weeks of training; this was suggested by the authors to be perhaps due to seasonal variations in this measure of immune function. Elevated NKCA was also not found after 5 or 12 weeks of a brisk walking training programme in elderly women compared with their peers who participated in callisthenics training (Nieman et al 1993) . This was despite observing a lower incidence of URTI in the walkers during this time, as discussed above. It was suggested that any training-induced adaptation in NK defence mechanisms may require longer to develop in elderly individuals because baseline comparison of the sedentary women with a group of highly conditioned elderly women revealed that NKCA was 54% higher in the highly conditioned women. As you may remember, these women also had the lowest incidence of URTI among the three groups. It has also been suggested that immunoglobulin-A (IgA) may play a role in the apparent altered susceptibility to URTI associated with moderate exercise. IgA is the principal immunoglobulin (or antibody) in mucosal secretions (e.g. tears, saliva); therefore, IgA is an important defence mechanism against pathogens trying to enter through the oral mucosa (see Chapter 2 for further details about the structure and function of immunoglobulins). A 12-week exercise training programme (three aerobic training sessions per week, each lasting 30 minutes at 70% heart rate reserve) was associated with a 57% increase in salivary-IgA (s-IgA) concentration compared with baseline in nine previously sedentary men and women (Klentrou et al 2002) . A non-significant decrease in s-IgA concentration was observed at the same time point in a group of sedentary controls. URTI symptoms were recorded in daily logbooks, using codes similar to those described previously. In addition, subjects were asked to code their symptoms as 'mild', 'moderate' or 'severe'. Although it is possible that the perception of severity of symptoms may differ between individuals and hence may undermine the reliability of these data, there were fewer 'severe' URTI symptom days in the exercising group compared with the controls during the study. A significant negative relationship was found between s-IgA levels and total sickness days (r = −0.64, P<0.05) (i.e. higher s-IgA levels were associated with fewer days with sickness). However, a significant relationship between s-IgA concentration and days reporting only cold symptoms was not found, with the authors suggesting that this was due to some ambiguity in the description of the cold-related symptoms. Given the small number of subjects in the study, it might be that a larger-scale study is needed to confirm these findings. However, a significant negative relationship between s-IgA concentration and incidence of URTI (as assessed by a physician) has been reported in a group of moderately trained subjects (Gleeson et al 1999) . These subjects were involved in regular exercise programmes for up to 4 hours per week over a 7-month period, and formed the control group for a group of elite swimmers; a similar relationship between s-IgA and incidence of infection was also found for these athletes.

Although the findings outlined above may suggest that alterations in s-IgA and NKCA contribute to the apparent lower susceptibility to infection associated with regular performance of moderate exercise, there is not sufficient convincing evidence at present to support the theory that immunosurveillance is improved with regular moderate exercise.

The J-shaped model suggests that taking part in some regular moderate physical activity decreases the relative risk of URTI to below that of a sedentary individual. Although this area has not been extensively researched, this hypothesis is generally supported by the findings of a number of epidemiological studies. However, evidence to support the hypothesis of improved immunosurveillance with regular moderate exercise is not so forthcoming, although there is some limited evidence to suggest that enhanced NKCA and s-IgA concentrations may play key roles. The influence of other factors such as psychological wellbeing, nutritional status and subject lifestyle should also be considered when exploring potential reasons for this apparent relationship between regular moderate exercise and lowered risk for URTI.

Recall from the J-shaped model that an acute bout of prolonged, intense exercise or a prolonged period of heavy exercise training is associated with a risk of URTI that is above that of a sedentary individual. The majority of studies that have explored the validity of this portion of the J-shaped model have looked at responses from athletes involved in endurance-type events. That is not to say that athletes involved in resistance or sprint events are less likely to report symptoms of URTI; if training heavily with insufficient recovery periods between sessions it would appear that these athletes are at as much risk of URTI as those who perform endurance sports.

For the past 50 years or so, there have been an increasing number of reports from both athletes and their coaches to suggest that athletes involved in heavy schedules of training and competition suffer from a higher incidence of infection, particularly URTI, compared with their sedentary counterparts. Furthermore, there is a feeling that it takes longer for these athletes to recover from illness. For example, after setting the 5000 m World Record in 1982, David Moorcroft spoke of 'those familiar coughs and colds' (Evans 1996) . The marathon runner Alberto Salazar reported that he caught 12 colds in 12 months while training for the 1984 Olympic marathon and recalled that 'I caught everything. I felt like I should have been living in a bubble' (Nieman 1998) . A number of epidemiological studies have now been conducted to try and establish whether or not there is any truth in the perception among athletes and coaches that heavy training can lead to a decreased resistance to illness.

Compared with the effects of moderate exercise on susceptibility to URTI, there has been a little more research conducted in the area of heavy exercise and risk of URTI. As with moderate exercise, these studies have been survey-based epidemiological studies, with self-reporting of symptoms of URTI, rather than a confirmed clinical diagnosis. As mentioned earlier, these studies have the advantage of allowing large numbers of athletes to be studied. On the other hand it should be acknowledged that the self-reporting of URTI by athletes may be influenced by a degree of positive response bias in the data: it could be argued that those athletes who respond to these questionnaires are more likely to be those who have symptoms of URTI (i.e. a positive response). Furthermore, it could be argued that highly trained athletes are

also more 'body-aware' and hence may report symptoms that less active individuals may not take any notice of.

The findings of two key studies looking at incidence of URTI following marathontype events suggest that participating in competitive endurance events is associated with an increased risk of URTI during the 7-14 days following the event (Nieman et al 1990a , Peters & Bateman 1983 . In a randomly selected sample of 140 runners in the 1982 Two Oceans Marathon (a distance of 56 km) in Cape Town, 33% of the runners reported symptoms of URTI in the 2-week period following the race, compared with 15% of a group of age-matched non-running controls, each of whom lived in the same household as one of the runners (Peters & Bateman 1983) . Further examination of the data revealed a significant negative relationship between racetime and post-race illness with symptoms of URTI far more prevalent in those runners who completed the race in less than 4 hours, suggesting a relationship between acute exercise stress and susceptibility to URTI (Fig. 1.4) . Similar findings were reported from a cohort of over 2000 runners who took part in the 1987 Los Angeles Marathon (Nieman et al 1990a) . During the week after the marathon, 13% of the runners reported symptoms of URTI compared with only 2% of a group of similarly experienced runners who did not compete for reasons other than illness. In addition, 40% of the runners experienced at least one episode of URTI during the 2 months prior to the marathon itself. After controlling for confounding factors such as age, perceived stress levels and illness in the home, it was found that those who ran more than 96 km (60 miles) per week in training were twice as likely to suffer illness compared with those who trained less than 32 km (20 miles) per week.

Although many of the investigations of the relationship between heavy exercise and immune function have concentrated on competitive marathon races, there are now several published reports detailing a relationship between heavy volumes of training and competition and incidence of URTI in athletes involved in other sports, including swimming (Gleeson et al 1999) , orienteering (Linde 1987) and football (Bury et al 1998) . For example, over a 1-year period, 22 episodes of URTI (as diagnosed by a physician) were observed in a group of professional European footballers compared with only nine episodes in a group of untrained controls. There was also a tendency for the URTI symptoms to last longer in the footballers compared with the controls. In another study, Foster (1998) reported that the majority of illnesses experienced by a group of competitive speed skaters occurred when the athletes exceeded individually identifiable training thresholds, with almost 90% of these illnesses occurring within 10 days of a peak in training strain, although it should be noted that these illnesses were not explicitly recorded as episodes of URTI.

Taken together, these studies suggest that performing both acute bouts of intense, prolonged exercise and higher volumes of training are associated with an increased susceptibility to URTI, thus supporting the J-shaped model. However, it is important to keep this in perspective: the findings of these studies suggest that the relative risk of an episode of URTI is increased following heavy exercise but the majority of athletes do not experience an episode of URTI after prolonged strenuous activity. For example, in the cohort of over 2000 marathon runners who completed the 1987 Los Angeles marathon, only one in every seven marathon runners reported symptoms of URTI in the week following the event (Nieman et al 1990a) . In addition, exercise duration may be a critical factor in determining post-race susceptibility for URTI because performing 5 km, 10 km and 21.1 km events was associated with the same incidence of URTI in the week after the race as that reported in the week before (Nieman et al 1989) . Other factors that may influence these findings should also not be overlooked. The Los Angeles marathon is held in March and reported episodes of URTI are lower in the summer than in the winter months (Nieman 2000) . In support of this, 77% of the URTI diagnosed in professional footballers occurred during the winter months (Bury et al 1998) , although equally it could be argued that it is during this period that the footballers would have been training and competing most heavily. As well as ambient conditions, other environmental factors may also contribute to the finding of increased episodes of URTI following marathon events in large cities such as Cape Town and Los Angeles. Exposure to elevated levels of ozone during exercise has been associated with increased mortality in mice exposed to Streptococcus pyogenes, while exposure to elevated levels of sulphur dioxide increased leukocyte counts in the lungs of males following 20 minutes of light-intensity cycling (Illing et al 1980 , Sandström et al 1989 . In addition, inhalation of air pollutants could cause the symptoms of a sore throat in the absence of any infection. Other possible reasons for the increased incidence of URTI reported in athletes include poor dietary practices, increased exposure to pathogens (through sharing drinking bottles and spending time in close proximity to others -for example at training camps) and elevated psychological stress (Shephard & Shek 1999) . These issues are discussed further in Chapter 12.

Putting aside the potential influences outlined above, it is now well established that performing acute bouts of high intensity exercise is associated with a depression of immune function that may last up to 72 hours (Nieman 2000) and it seems logical to assume that this may be related to the apparent increased incidence of URTI experienced by athletes who are training and competing heavily. The decline in host defence mechanisms after exercise has been termed an 'open window' during which viruses and bacteria may gain entry into the body, thus increasing the risk of infection (Nieman 2000) . In theory, a chronic depression of immune function could arise over a period of time during which strenuous exercise is performed without sufficient time for recovery of immune cell function. However, although there is a great deal of evidence for a decrease in the ability of isolated immune cells to respond to a challenge following strenuous exercise (as discussed in Chs 4 and 5), a direct link between impaired immune function in vivo and subsequent infection has not yet been established. One of the reasons for this is the serious ethical issues involved in inoculating subjects with a known cold-causing virus and asking them to participate in heavy exercise. One major concern here is the potential risk of viral myocarditis (a viral infection of the heart muscle); exercising during a viral infection may increase the likelihood of developing this potentially fatal condition.

One study has attempted to shed some light on whether an impairment of the whole body's ability to respond to a pathogen following severe exercise could be associated with an increased risk of acute infection (Bruunsgaard et al 1997) . In this study, several antigens (foreign proteins that induce an antibody response) were injected into the skin on the forearms of trained triathletes following a half-ironman event. This action should stimulate an immune response to each of the antigens, known as a delayed hypersensitivity reaction, resulting in a raised red swelling of the skin at the site where the antigen was applied. After 48 hours, an investigator recorded the diameter of the resulting swelling, giving a positive reading if the mean diameter was 2 mm or more. The implication is that the larger the area of the swelling the stronger the immune response to that antigen. The skin test responses of the triathletes were compared with those of a group of triathletes who did not take part in the event in addition to a group of moderately trained controls. The lowest cumulative responses to the skin tests (i.e. lowest number of positive readings and sum of the diameters of the swellings) were found in the exercised triathletes ( Fig. 1.5 The cumulative skin test score (number of positive responses and sum of the diameters of the raised swellings) in a group of triathletes following a triathlon race (group A), a group of triathletes who did not compete in the race (group B) and a group of moderately trained individuals (group C). The response of group A was significantly lower than that of groups B and C. (Data from Bruunsgaard et al 1997.) suggesting an impaired whole body ability to respond to an infectious challenge following intense exercise and an increased risk of developing subsequent infection.

The J-shaped model suggests that participating in acute bouts of intense exercise and involvement in heavy schedules of training and competition increases the relative risk of URTI to above that of a sedentary individual. Research into this area has generally concentrated on survey-based studies of large cohorts of competitive endurance-trained athletes and the findings do provide support for a relationship between heavy exercise and increased risk for URTI, thus supporting the J-shaped model. However, whether or not this increase in susceptibility for infection is associated with the documented impairment of immune function observed following prolonged, intense exercise is still not wholly proven. A number of other factors may also contribute to the higher number of infections experienced by athletes, including environmental factors, increased exposure to pathogens, poor nutritional practices and increased psychological stress.

Pregnancy and perinatal outcomes of women with severe acute respiratory syndrome,"Objective: This study was undertaken to evaluate the pregnancy and perinatal outcomes of pregnant women with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Study design: All pregnant women (12) who presented with SARS in Hong Kong between February 1 and July 31, 2003, were included. The pregnancy and perinatal outcomes were collected. Evidence of perinatal transmission of virus was assessed with the SARS-associated coronavirus reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction on cord blood, placenta tissue, and subsequent follow-up of the neonate on serology. Results: Three deaths occurred among the 12 patients, giving a case fatality rate of 25%. Four of the 7 patients (57%) who presented in the first trimester had spontaneous miscarriage. Four of the 5 patients who presented after 24 weeks were delivered preterm. Two mothers recovered without delivery, but their ongoing pregnancies were complicated by intrauterine growth restriction. No newborn infant had clinical SARS and all investigations were negative for SARS. Conclusion: SARS during pregnancy is associated with high incidences of spontaneous miscarriage, preterm delivery, and intrauterine growth restriction. There is no evidence of perinatal SARS infection among infants born to these mothers.","Since November 2002, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) has affected 8437 persons and has caused more than 800 deaths worldwide. 1 SARS is a new disease caused by a novel coronavirus 2,3 that causes atypical pneumonia, which may progress to respiratory failure. 4 It appeared that the SARS outbreak was currently under controlled, though the problem may re-emerge during the winter. There is no published information on the outcomes of pregnant women infected with SARS. Given the significant maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality of most viral pneumonia in pregnancy, SARS may impose greater risk in pregnant compared to nonpregnant individuals. We reported the pregnancy and perinatal outcomes of all pregnant women affected during the outbreak in Hong Kong.

Between February 1 and July 31, 2003, all pregnant women in Hong Kong whose disease met the World Health Organization (WHO) case definition of May 1, 2003 , of SARS were included. 5 These patients were jointly managed by the infectious disease specialists, intensive care physicians, respiratory physicians, obstetricians, and midwives. The (medical) clinical course and demographic data were abstracted from the records.

Pregnancies in the first trimester were identified by pregnancy tests offered to all female SARS patients suspected to be pregnant. Ultrasound examination was performed as soon after admission as practical. All pregnant women at more than 24 weeks of gestation, once classified as probable cases of SARS, were transferred to Princess Margaret Hospital, which is a designated hospital for infection control in Hong Kong, for further management. Medical treatment was offered to the patients while maternal and fetal conditions were closely monitored. Indications for early delivery included maternal deterioration, failure to maintain adequate oxygenation or difficulty with mechanical ventilation because of the gravid uterus, fetal compromise or other obstetric indications. Daily cardiotocography (CTG) was performed for pregnancies after 28 weeks of gestation. Fetal growth was assessed by serial ultrasound scans every 2 weeks. Liquor volume measurement and umbilical Doppler artery blood flow studies were performed on a weekly basis.

The obstetric and neonatal outcomes were collected. Major medical complications were identified. Evidence of perinatal transmission of virus was assessed by the SARS-associated coronavirus reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (SARS-CoV RT-PCR) and viral culture on cord blood, placenta tissue, and amniotic fluid at or after delivery as appropriate. Maternal blood was removed before the cord blood was collected with a sterile syringe. A 1-cm cubic of fresh placenta tissue was removed after it had been thoroughly rinsed with sterile saline solution and dissected from the chorionic plate. The remaining placenta tissue was sent for histopathology and/or electron microscopy, particularly searching for viral inclusion bodies or particles. The newborn infants were followed-up with SARS-CoV antibody titers for evidence of SARS infection.

The samples collected were sent to the Public Health Laboratory, Government Virology Unit of Hong Kong for qualitative SARS-CoV PCR testing. The technique was described in a recent Center for Disease Control publication. 6 For SARS-CoV antibody titer, enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay test was used, a test detecting a mixture of immunoglobulin M and immunoglobulinG antibodies in the serum of SARS patients yields positive results reliably at around day 21 after the onset of illness. 7

During the study period, there were a total of 12 Southern Chinese patients with SARS admitted to 5 public hospitals in Hong Kong (Table I) . The maternal age ranged between 27 to 44 years. There were 5 health care workers and 7 others who acquired the disease in the community. Seven women were less than 13 weeks of gestation (3-12 weeks) and the other 5 patients were in their late second and third trimesters at presentation. None of the patients had underlying medical disease.

All patients had high fevers (O38(C) and most presented with chill, rigors, malaise, and myalgia. Only 33% of the pregnant patients presented with shortness of breath. Physical examination of the chest revealed crackles with or without percussion dullness. Lymphopenia (!1.0!10 9 /L) was observed in 8 patients at presentation, but subsequently all had lymphopenia develop. Some patients had mildly elevated lactate dehydrogenase (5/12) and aminotransferase (4/12) levels. Serial chest radiographs showed progressive air-space disease in all patients, similar to those reported earlier in nonpregnant patients. 6 There was no evidence of infection by Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae, or Legionella pneumophila. Viral serology for adenovirus, influenza A and B, parainfluenza type 1 to 3, and respiratory syncytial virus were negative. All patients had either positive SARS-CoV RT-PCRs or raised SARS-CoV antibody titers (O100). Patient 7 was retrospectively diagnosed to have SARS. She is a health care worker and had cared for a patient with atypical pneumonia from Guangdong Province, China, before the SARS outbreak in Hong Kong. She subsequently had a high fever and atypical pneumonia develop 5 days later.

All patients were given broad-spectrum antibiotics, namely, beta-lactams and macrolides or fluoro-quinolones.

All patients, except patient 7, were given ribavirin and/ or hydrocortisone after 48 hours of observation. All couples were fully informed of the potential teratogenic effect of ribavirin and all opted to receive this treatment. Ten patients also had 1 or more courses of pulse methyl-prednisolone as described in previous publications. 8 The fever lasted between 2 and 9 days. Five patients had high fevers develop again after initial response. Six patients (50%) were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) because of decreased blood oxygen saturation. The length of stay ranged from 14 to 37 days. Four patients (33%) required mechanical ventilation ranging from 16 to 37 days. After ribavirin therapy all patients became anemic (Hb !10g/dL).

The major medical complications among these patients included disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (patients 3, 8, and 12), renal failure (patients 3, 9, and 12), secondary bacterial pneumonia (patients 3 and 12), sepsis (patients 11 and 12), adult respiratory distress syndrome (patients 3, 10, 11, and 12), cardiovascular collapse (patient 11), abdominal wound dehiscence (patients 11 and 12), and surgical emphysema (patient 12). Three deaths occurred of which 2 patients (patients 3 and 11) died of progressive respiratory failure and 1 patient (patient 12) died of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia associated with cardiovascular collapse not responsive to active resuscitation.

Six of the 7 women (except patient 7) presenting in the first trimester had positive pregnancy tests during hospital admission. Five women (patients 2-6) had ultrasound confirmation of an intrauterine gestational sac. In these, absence of fetal pole was noted in 3 women (patients 2, 3, and 4) and a single fetal pole with fetal heart pulsation was detected in 2 (patients 5 and 6). Ultrasound failed to demonstrate an intrauterine sac in 1 woman (patient 1) and she did not have any sign or symptom of ectopic pregnancy or spontaneous miscarriage. Serial serum human chorionic gonadotrophins rapidly decreased and she was considered to have a very early pregnancy loss. Myalgia 

NA, Not applicable; SOB, shortness of breath; CXR, chest X-ray; CT, computed tomograph; IV, intravenous.

Four of the 7 patients presented in first trimester had spontaneous miscarriages between 2 to 5 weeks after the onset of illness (Table II) . Patient 7 did not receive ribavirin or steroid and has an uncomplicated ongoing pregnancy. Patients 5 and 6 had termination of pregnancies at 10 weeks and 15 weeks of gestation for social reasons after they had recovered from SARS. Gestation at presentation for the other 5 patients ranged from 26 to 32 weeks. Four pregnancies (80%) resulted in preterm delivery. Three patients were delivered by emergency cesarean section between 26 and 32 weeks of gestation because of maternal deterioration, secondary to failure to maintain adequate blood oxygen saturation, despite on 100% oxygen (patients 10 to 12). Patient 10 also had fetal distress develop before cesarean section. After delivery, the need for supplemental oxygen was reduced in all mothers. One patient was extubated 20 hours after delivery, but she was reintubated 32 hours later for oxygen desaturation again. The ventilator settings for the other 2 patients were unchanged after delivery.

Two pregnancies (patients 8 and 9) that did not require early intervention had intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) develop during treatment. Both pregnancies were also complicated by oligohydramnios. Fetal surveillance with antenatal CTG and umbilical arterial Doppler velocimetry was satisfactory. Patient 8 had spontaneous preterm labor at 33 weeks of gestation during the convalescence period, which did not respond to tocolysis. Patient 9 had emergency lower-segment cesarean section for intrapartum nonreassuring CTG.

There was no clinical or serologic evidence suggestive of vertical transmission of the coronavirus (Table III) . To date, none of the 5 newborn infants show any evidence of perinatal SARS infection. In particular, the first 3 newborn infants (newborn infants 3-5) were delivered during the acute stage of maternal SARS infection and were exposed to a significant risk of perinatal infection. Peritoneal fluid (patient 10) and samples of body fluid were positive for SARS-CoV at the time of cesarean section. The SARS-CoV RT-PCRs and viral cultures from nasal swab, blood, urine, and stool were all negative in these infants. There was also no significant rise in paired acute and convalescent SARS-CoV antibody titers.

Three newborn infants delivered soon after the mothers presented with SARS were average in size, whereas the other 2 were growth restricted with birth weight below the fifth percentile for gestation. Of the newborn infants delivered preterm, 2 had serious complications develop related to prematurity (Table III) .

RT-PCRs and viral cultures of the cord blood and placenta tissues were all negative for SARS-CoV. Amniotic fluid obtained from patients 5, 6, and 9 were also negative for SARS-CoV. No viral inclusion body or particle was detected in the products of conceptions. The placental findings from the 5 deliveries are summarized in Table III . All the placentae showed trimmed weight falling short of the fifth percentile for gestation, with a weight deficiency of 8% to 47%. Three placentae (patients 10 to 12) had normal histopathologic findings. Two placentae from pregnancies (patients 8 and 9) complicated by IUGR showed avascular fibrotic terminal villi with thrombotic vasculopathy in some stem villi. In addition, placental infarction was evident grossly and on histology in the placenta of patient 9. The percentage of infarcted placental tissue was estimated to be about 10%. No placentae showed chorioamnionitis, funisitis, villitis, viral inclusion, or other features of infection. No significant erythroblastosis was noted.

The risk of viral pneumonia is significantly higher among pregnant women compared with the general population, especially when there is no effective antiviral therapy. 9 The influenza epidemic of 1918 and Asian flu epidemic of 1957 had a maternal mortality rate of 30% to 50%. 10,11 SARS has the same impact, and pregnant women appear to have a worse clinical course with a case fatality rate of 25%. In the current series, more patients required ICU admissions (50%) and mechanical ventilation (33%) compared with the nonpregnant adult population (20% ICU admission). 8 This poor outcome could be ascribed to the physiologic changes in pulmonary function during late pregnancy. The gravid uterus has been shown to elevate the diaphragm by up to 4 cm in the third trimester, while oxygen consumption is increased by 20% in pregnancy and functional residual capacity is decreased, rendering the woman intolerant to hypoxia. 12 Fifty-seven percent of our patients had spontaneous miscarriage, which was higher than the 15% to 20% widely reported early pregnancy loss rate. 13 The increased miscarriage risk was unlikely to be due to transplacental infection, as there was an absence of viral particles in the products of conceptions. Severe maternal respiratory failure and hypoxemia may disrupt uterine placental flow and cause miscarriage. Ribavirin is a commonly used first-line medication for the management of SARS in Hong Kong. Six patients had ribavirin, and a significant embryocidal effect has been observed in rabbits and mice, it may be possible that during this anembryonic stage ribavarin was the cause of spontaneous miscarriage. 14, 15 There are no human data for early pregnancy use and such postulation needs further confirmation. Ribavirin was also associated with significant teratogenic effects in animal studies. 14, 16 Patients who decide to use ribavirin in early pregnancy should be given the option for termination of pregnancy.

In maternal pneumonia, neonatal morbidity frequently arises as a result of preterm labor (15%-44%). 17, 18 Eighty percent of our cohort who presented after 24 weeks were delivered preterm and therefore were associated with higher neonatal morbidity. Other fetal/neonatal complications include IUGR, intrauterine demise, and neonatal death. 17 ,18 IUGR appears to be a common sequel among our patients who carried on with their pregnancies. This might be due to the severe maternal respiratory illness affecting the oxygen supply to the fetuses. These patients had frequent episodes of oxygen desaturation, often falling below 90%. The situation resembles that of those living at high altitudes, causing a low arterial partial pressure of oxygen 19, 20 and consequent IUGR. The general impact of a severe maternal debilitating illness on fetal growth also needs to be considered. The placental findings of placental infarction (patient 9) indicate maternal thrombosis, and the avascular villi (patients 8 and 9) suggest fetal thrombosis. There was also significant placental weight reduction relating to the duration of SARS before delivery (Table III) . Again, these changes were likely to represent complications of the hypoxemia and circulatory insufficiency in both the mother and fetus as a result of SARS. The observed fetal growth restriction is unlikely to be due to hydrocortisone or methyl-prednisolone, as neither steroid crosses the placenta readily. The risk of perinatal transmission of SARS-CoV was low, as there was no evidence of the presence of virus/viral particles in the products of conception or the infants. Direct contact with maternal body fluid that contained SARS-CoV put the infants at high risk of perinatal infection. Preventive measures at delivery, such as performing nasopharyngeal suction before first breath and cleansing the infant soon after birth, might help to reduce the viral load. It was a fortunate finding from our cohort that there was no evidence of vertical transmission, despite close contact with SARS virus. Indeed, there should be a theoretical advantage of delaying delivery in these patients to avoid the exposure of these infants to the virus at birth. The passage of maternal SARS-CoV antibodies across the placenta to the fetal circulation should have additional protective effect on the fetus/neonate. Nevertheless, it was our experience that the timing of delivery was frequently dictated by the deteriorating maternal condition.

This observational study consisted of only 12 pregnant women and the number of patients involved is small. We caution the readers to take this into account when interpreting the results and conclusion drawn from the study, as some of the above observations may be due to chance occurrence. As there is currently no large series on pregnant women with SARS, we believed such information is useful in guiding us in our future management of such women.

In conclusion, our experience showed that SARS during pregnancy is associated with high maternal morbidity and mortality. There were high incidences of spontaneous miscarriage, preterm delivery, and IUGR. There appeared to be a low risk of clinical SARS among infants of SARS patients, even when the delivery occurred during acute maternal infection. The adverse pregnancy outcomes might be due to the effects of SARS infection on pregnancy as well as to the medical treatment received for SARS.

Severe Morbidity and Mortality Associated With Respiratory Syncytial Virus Versus Influenza Infection in Hospitalized Older Adults,Background. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is an important cause of serious respiratory illness in older adults. Comparison of RSV and influenza infection in hospitalized older adults may increase awareness of adult RSV disease burden.,"Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) initially was found to be a common cause of severe respiratory illness in young children [1, 2] . While mild disease in healthy young adults has also been described [3] , the potential for RSV to cause severe disease in adults was not recognized until reports of outbreaks among older adults residing in long-term care facilities emerged [4, 5] . Subsequently, RSV was shown to cause serious illness among healthy, community-dwelling older adults. A landmark study of high-risk and community-dwelling adults aged ≥65 years and high-risk adults in the United States detected RSV infection in 3%-7% of healthy, community-dwelling older adults, 4%-10% of high-risk adults, and 16% of adults hospitalized with cardiopulmonary infections [6] . Furthermore, RSV infection was estimated to result in approximately 177 000 hospitalizations, 10 000 to 14 000 deaths, and more than $1 billion dollars in healthcare costs per year in the United States, mostly among older adults [6, 7] . Nonetheless, RSV remains clinically underrecognized by most healthcare providers as a cause of severe respiratory disease in adults [7] [8] [9] .

A current comparison of the clinical characteristics and burden of RSV illness with those of influenza, a well-recognized cause of severe morbidity and mortality in older adults [10] , may increase provider awareness of the potential of RSV infection to cause severe lower respiratory tract disease in older adults. Appreciation of the potential for RSV infection to cause serious illness similar to that caused by influenza will likely trigger more testing for RSV in addition to testing for influenza and direct therapy to the identified etiology in patients as newer agents become available. In addition, recent data on the epidemiology and clinical outcomes of older adults hospitalized with RSV are critical to the evaluation of more than 50 RSV vaccines, monoclonal antibodies, and antivirals currently under development prior to their introduction [11] . While a number of important studies have described the burden and clinical characteristics of RSV and influenza disease in hospitalized older adults, most of these studies were conducted at least a decade ago [6, [12] [13] [14] [15] . Furthermore, longterm mortality has not been analyzed previously. Therefore, we evaluated a large cohort of adults aged ≥60 years hospitalized with RSV or influenza A/B infection during 5 consecutive seasons. Demographics, prehospitalization characteristics, hospital utilization, and clinical outcomes, including long-term mortality, were assessed and compared between adults with RSV infection and those with influenza virus infection.

This observational, retrospective, cohort study was conducted at Kaiser Permanente Southern California (KPSC), an integrated healthcare system that provides comprehensive prepaid health services for 4.4 million members cared for at 15 large, community-based hospitals that are owned and operated by KPSC. The demographic makeup of the KPSC membership closely mirrors the racially and sociodemographically diverse Southern California population and the California census population; more than 99% are community dwelling [16] . As KPSC is a prepaid healthcare system, there is a very strong motivation for members to use services internally. Furthermore, reimbursement by KPSC for outside care requires that claims be submitted with documentation of the care provided; claims are subsequently entered into the administrative data systems. Thus, capture of care delivered to KPSC members by electronic data is very comprehensive.

The study population consisted of hospitalized KPSC members aged ≥60 years at the time of admission who had a positive RSV or influenza A/B laboratory test (multiplex polymerase chain reaction [PCR] [FilmArray, Luminex xTAG], influenza A/B/ H1N1 [Cepheid Xpert Flu], or viral culture) that was ordered between 1 January 2011 and 30 June 2015 during a hospitalization encounter or an emergency department encounter that resulted in hospitalization at 1 of 15 KPSC hospitals. All samples were submitted to a single, centralized KPSC laboratory for processing. Participants were required to have continuous KPSC membership for at least 6 months (allowing a 31-day gap) prior to the hospital admission date to allow for ascertainment of baseline characteristics. If there were patients with multiple hospitalizations who met the above criteria (eg, had a positive RSV or influenza A/B test on 2 separate hospitalization encounters), the first RSV or first influenza hospitalization was kept for the RSV or influenza cohort, respectively. For the purpose of statistical comparison, independent samples of RSV and influenza cohorts were defined. Twenty-five individuals with both a positive RSV test and a positive influenza test during different hospitalizations during the study period were kept in the RSV cohort and removed from the influenza cohort. Nineteen individuals coinfected with RSV and influenza during the same hospitalization were excluded from the comparison. The KPSC Institutional Review Board reviewed and approved the study.

Electronic medical records were used to obtain information for the study population, including membership history, baseline characteristics, demographics, comorbidities, treatments, utilization, and outcomes. Each KPSC health plan member has a unique medical record number that is used as an identifier to retrieve and link all variables from different databases.

Outcomes of hospitalization included length of stay, occurrence of complications, use of respiratory support, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, readmission, use of vasopressors, mortality, exacerbation of chronic conditions, discharge location, and healthcare utilization after discharge.

Patient demographics, prehospital course, comorbid conditions, and in-hospital utilization were compared between patients hospitalized with RSV and those hospitalized with influenza A/B using a χ 2 test, Fisher exact test, t test, or Wilcoxon ranksum test, as appropriate. Categorical factors were presented using frequencies and percentages. Continuous variables were categorized based on distribution and described using mean, standard deviation, and range, in addition to frequencies and percentages.

Multivariable logistic regression was used to estimate the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) associated with hospitalization outcomes between those infected with RSV and those infected with influenza after adjustment for potential differences between cohorts, including age, sex, race/ethnicity, history of influenza and pneumococcal vaccination, prior chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)/chronic bronchitis/emphysema, Charlson comorbidity index [17] , history of healthcare utilization, and recent use of antivirals, antibiotics, or steroids. One-year survival after admission was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method, and survival rates between hospitalized persons infected with RSV or influenza were compared using the log-rank test. The analyses were performed using SAS Enterprise Guide 5.1 (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC).

Among patients hospitalized with RSV (n = 645) during the study period, RSV infection was detected by multiplex PCR in 91.8% and by culture in 8.2% of patients. Among patients hospitalized with influenza (n = 1878) during the study period, influenza infection was detected by multiplex PCR in 82.6%, by influenza A/B/H1N1 PCR in 0.05%, and by culture in 17.4% of patients. The distribution of demographic characteristics, medical history, and comorbidities of patients hospitalized with RSV (n = 645) or with influenza (n = 1878) is presented in Table 1 . Patients hospitalized with RSV infection were slightly older (mean age, 78.5 vs 77.4 years; P = .035), with a higher proportion of those aged ≥85 years compared to those hospitalized with influenza infection. There was a higher proportion of females in the RSV cohort than in the influenza cohort (60.5% vs 50.3% female; P < .001). Race/ethnicity distributions were similar between the RSV and the influenza cohorts. A higher proportion of RSV patients than influenza patients had received influenza vaccine in the 1 year prior to admission (83.1% vs 73.1%; P < .001). Smoking status and body mass index were similar between cohorts. The prevalence of several comorbidities was significantly different between patients hospitalized with RSV and those with influenza, including congestive heart failure (35.3% vs 24.5%; P < .001), diabetes (38.9% vs 44.6%; P = .012), COPD/chronic bronchitis/emphysema (29.8% vs 24.3%; P = .006), asthma (26.0% vs 18.6%; P < .001), any solid cancer (11.2% vs 8.0%; P = .016), and leukemia (1.9% vs 0.9%; P = .050). Use of any antiviral therapy, including oseltamivir, within 14 days prior to admission was not common but was more prevalent in the RSV cohort than the influenza cohort (4.3% vs 2.7%; P = .034 for any antiviral medication and 2.3% vs 1.1%; P = .026 for oseltamivir; data not shown).

The in-hospital characteristics of the RSV and influenza cohorts are described in Table 2 . The mean time from admission to the first positive test result for either RSV or influenza was similar between the 2 cohorts (2.5 vs 2.6 days; P = .570), and approximately 98% of patients in either cohort did not have test results available until some time after the hospital admission date. Among the RSV and influenza cohorts, respectively, use of antivirals (47.1% vs 78.6%; P < .001), 99% of which was oseltamivir (data not shown); antibiotics (94.1% vs 88.9%; P < .001); and any inhalation, injection, intravenous, or oral steroid (64.5% vs 47.9%; P < .001) during the hospitalization period was significantly different.

In the adjusted analyses, the odds of all outcomes were similar or significantly higher among participants hospitalized with RSV compared to those hospitalized with influenza ( Figure 1 ). Hospital utilization was greater among those infected with RSV than with influenza as measured by length of stay ≥7 days among the entire population (OR = 1.4; 95% CI, 1.2-1.7), length of stay ≥7 days among survivors (OR = 1.5; 95% CI, 1.2-1.8), and ICU admission (OR = 1.3; 95% CI, 1.0-1.7). In addition, respiratory complications during hospitalization were more common among RSV-infected older adults including pneumonia diagnosis (OR = 2.7; 95% CI, 2.2-3.2); highest measured respiratory rate (RR; measured by breaths per minute; RR ≥26 vs ≤22 reference group [OR = 1.5; 95% CI, 1.2-1.9]); lowest oxygen saturation (≤84% vs ≥93% reference group [OR = 1.6; 95% CI, 1.2-2.1]); greatest level of oxygen supplementation (≥16 L/min vs ≤5 L/min reference group [OR = 1.5; 95% CI, 1.0-2.2]); exacerbation of COPD, chronic bronchitis, or emphysema (OR = 1.7; 95% CI, 1.3-2.4); and exacerbation of asthma (OR = 1.5; 95% CI, 1.1-1.9). More older adults infected with RSV than with influenza required home health service after discharge (OR = 1.3; 95% CI, 1.0-1.6). While mortality during hospitalization (OR = 1.1; 95% CI, 0.8-1.7) and within 6 months of admission (OR = 1.2; 95% CI, 0.9-1.5) for patients with RSV did not differ significantly from those with influenza, long-term mortality within 1 year of admission was significantly greater in the RSV cohort compared to the influenza cohort (OR = 1.3, 95% CI, 1.0-1.6). The 1-year survival rate after admission was significantly lower (Figure 2 , 74.2% vs 81.2%; P < .001) in older adults hospitalized with RSV compared to those hospitalized with influenza.

This retrospective cohort study that spans 5 consecutive winters demonstrates that RSV is an important cause of serious and life-threatening respiratory illness that results in morbidity and mortality among older adults that were comparable or more severe than those caused by influenza. To our knowledge, this study describes the largest and most recent cohort of older adults hospitalized with RSV or influenza reported to date. By utilizing patient electronic health records, we were able to obtain important information, including demographics and comorbidities prior to hospitalization and short-and long-term healthcare utilization and hospitalization outcomes.

Consistent with earlier reports, we found that adults hospitalized with RSV were slightly older and had greater frequency of baseline comorbidities, particularly cardiopulmonary disease, than those hospitalized with influenza virus infection [6, 12, 14] . However, after adjustment for comorbidities, we found that hospitalization outcomes among older adults hospitalized with RSV were either comparable to or significantly worse than they were among those hospitalized with influenza. While previous studies found similar hospital length of stay among older adults hospitalized with RSV or with influenza [6, 14] , we found that longer hospitalizations (length of stay ≥7 days) occurred more often among the RSV cohort than they did in the influenza cohort. This may reflect increased use of antiviral therapies in recent years that ameliorate influenza but not RSV disease [18] or differences in clinical recovery associated with a more pronounced RSV-associated severe lower respiratory tract syndrome. We also found that pulmonary complications and findings, including pneumonia, tachypnea, hypoxia, and greater need for oxygen supplementation, and exacerbation of asthma and of COPD, chronic bronchitis or emphysema were significantly greater among the RSV cohort after adjustment for potential confounders. These findings are similar to those of Lee et al. who reported that hospitalized adults with RSV in Hong Kong had a greater frequency of lower respiratory complications than those with influenza [14] . While increased baseline cardiopulmonary disease in the RSV cohort likely increased their risk of pulmonary complications, including exacerbation of chronic respiratory disease and asthma, these differences were observed after adjustment for comorbidities, including baseline cardiopulmonary disease. Discharge to hospice and skilled nursing facilities was similar in the RSV and influenza cohorts, but a greater proportion of the RSV cohort required home health services after discharge. Finally, similar to previous findings [6, 14] , short-term mortality for patients infected with RSV was similar to that of patients infected with influenza. However, longer-term survival among the RSV cohort, which has not been reported previously, was significantly worse than that of the influenza cohort. The impact of RSV on long-term survival may be a reflection of the potential for RSV to drive chronic inflammation associated with persistent, sometimes progressive, pulmonary disease, although the mechanism for this is not clear [19] [20] [21] [22] . In addition to confirming the severe impact of annual influenza epidemics, our findings also underscore the substantial morbidity, mortality, and healthcare utilization associated with RSV infection in the expanding population of older adults and the need for RSV vaccines and antivirals. Interestingly, influenza vaccine uptake within 1 year of admission was higher among the RSV cohort than the influenza cohort while receipt of pneumococcal vaccine was similar. This may reflect, in part, the effectiveness of influenza vaccine in preventing influenza infections and is unlikely due to differential vaccine acceptance. On the other hand, the increased use of oseltamivir within 14 days prior to hospitalization among older adults hospitalized with RSV compared to those hospitalized with influenza may reflect presumed influenza infection and delay in diagnosis of RSV infection. Conversely, decreased in-hospital use of antiviral therapy among the RSV cohort compared to the influenza cohort likely reflects the discontinuation of oseltamivir after identification of RSV and initiation of oseltamivir after identification of influenza. The greater use of antibiotics and systemic and inhaled steroids in the RSV cohort during their hospitalizations may mirror the higher frequency of pneumonia and exacerbation of chronic lung disease and asthma among older hospitalized adults with RSV infection than those with influenza infection.

Whereas RSV has long been recognized as a cause of serious illness among young children, its role as a significant pathogen among older adult patients appears to be underrecognized by many adult providers [7] [8] [9] . This is understandable since in many settings, respiratory pathogen testing is limited to influenza virus testing, so that noninfluenza pathogens, including RSV, have not been recognized as possible etiologies of serious respiratory illness similar to that caused by influenza. In addition, even in settings in which multiplex pathogen testing is used, local circulation of influenza virus in the community and clinical suspicion for influenza may drive testing patterns among hospitalized older adults and, thus, may underestimate the relative frequency of other viral respiratory pathogens, including RSV, which may have either nonoverlapping or broader periods of circulation in the same community. Therefore, the number of hospitalizations with RSV or with influenza detected in this study may not reflect the relative incidences of each pathogen over the study period since RSV infections that occur during intervals when influenza virus is less prevalent are less likely to be detected.

Increased provider recognition of RSV as an important cause of severe influenza-like illness among older adults and other high-risk populations will become increasingly important in order to increase vaccine uptake among high-risk populations after RSV vaccines are developed. In addition, recognition and early identification of RSV as a potential cause of illness that is sometimes indistinguishable from influenza [23, 24] will be important in the timely implementation of diagnostic testing, adjustment of antiviral medication administration, including early discontinuation of medications targeted to influenza, and initiation of medications effective against RSV as they become available in order to optimize effectiveness and to minimize cost and complications.

The strengths of this study include detailed clinical and health outcomes data extracted from a large patient sample drawn from a racially and socioeconomically diverse population receiving care at multiple medical centers over 5 seasons. In addition, the widespread inpatient use of a sensitive multiplex PCR to detect RSV and influenza allowed for the possible detection of a wide spectrum of both diseases [6] . Moreover, since these test results were not immediately available, initial medical management decisions, including hospital admission and treatment decisions, were made based on severity of clinical symptoms rather than virologic diagnosis, minimizing bias resulting from differential admission or management plans for different infections.

RSV is a cause of serious illness among hospitalized older adults with morbidity and mortality that may be even more substantial than that caused by influenza, with possibly greater impact on long-term survival. The projected continued increase in the proportion of older adults in the population [25] underscores the growing unmet medical and public health need to develop vaccines and therapeutics directed against RSV. Increased appreciation among adult providers of the frequency and severity of RSV disease among adults will be important to the uptake of RSV vaccines and antivirals after they are introduced.

Clinical Presentation and Birth Outcomes Associated with Respiratory Syncytial Virus Infection in Pregnancy,Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most important cause of viral pneumonia in children worldwide. A maternal vaccine may protect both the mother and infant from RSV illness. The epidemiology and clinical presentation of RSV in pregnant and postpartum women is not well-described.,"Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most important cause of acute lower respiratory infection (ALRI) in children worldwide [1] . RSV antibody protects young infants from severe ALRI. No RSV vaccines are currently licensed, though a RSV vaccine for use in pregnant women recently completed a phase II clinical trial in the United States [2, 3] . A RSV vaccine administered during pregnancy has the potential to protect the infant through transplacental antibody transfer and to decrease maternal RSV illness incidence and severity.

Maternal immunization against influenza, tetanus, and pertusiss has been shown to be safe, immunogenic, and efficacious in preventing disease in infants [2] . Influenza infection during pregnancy is associated with increased maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality [4] . Maternal influenza vaccination is associated with decreased risk of adverse birth outcomes, such as low birthweight or small-for-gestational age infants [5] [6] [7] . RSV infection is associated with a similar disease burden to influenza in high-risk and elderly adults, and may be associated with adverse outcomes in pregnancy [8, 9] . The clinical presentation of RSV illness during pregnancy and the postpartum period and the effect of RSV infection on maternal, fetal, and infant outcomes are not well-described in large prospective studies.

The objective of this study was to describe the epidemiology and clinical presentation of respiratory syncytial virus infection using active home-based surveillance for respiratory illness in pregnant women in a prospective study.

Two consecutive randomized placebo-controlled trials of maternal influenza immunization were conducted in two annual cohorts in Sarlahi District of southern Nepal from April 2011 to May 2014 (Clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT01034254) [10] . Women were enrolled in the second trimester of pregnancy and followed with weekly home-based visits until 180 days postpartum. Symptom information was captured by recall over the previous week at each visit. Maternal respiratory illness required reported or measured fever (>38°C) with at least one other symptom: cough, myalgia, sore throat or rhinorrhea. Infant respiratory illness was defined as having any of the following: fever, cough, wheeze, difficult or rapid breathing, or a draining ear. Participants who reported protocol-defined respiratory illness had mid-nasal swabs (NS) obtained by field workers during weekly visits. An RSV illness episode was defined as the presence of any symptoms occurring for a minimum of one day with a mid-nasal swab obtained and RSV detected on PCR assay, with a minimum of 7 symptom-free days separating illness episodes. Incidence of RSV was calculated using days of follow-up from enrollment until end of study or loss to follow-up.

Clinical and sociodemographic data were collected at enrollment and at weekly visits, and birthweight was measured at a postpartum home visit. Birthweight was included in the analysis if obtained within the first 72 hours after birth. Low birthweight was defined as weight < 2500 grams. Preterm birth was defined as birth at < 37 weeks completed gestation. Gestational age was calculated based on last menstrual period according to previously published methods [11] . Small-for-gestational age was defined according to the Alexander criteria [12] . A household was defined as the persons sharing a common cookstove. Household density was defined as the numbers of persons/room in the household. Statistical testing was performed using Wilcoxon rank-sum tests and Fisher's exact tests to compare clinical and sociodemographic characteristics (SAS 9.3, Cary, NC).

Mid-nasal swabs were transported in a temperature-stable nucleic acid buffer (Primestore, Longhorn Diagnostics, Austin, TX) to the field laboratory, where they were aliquoted and stored at 4°Celsius until transport to the University of Washington Molecular Virology Laboratory in Seattle, WA, U.S.A [13] . RSV testing was performed using real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) [13] . Specimens with RSV detected were additionally tested for quantitative viral load and subtype [14] [15] [16] .

IRB approval for the study was obtained from the Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg School of Public Health, Seattle Children's Hospital, Cincinnati Children's Hospital, the Institute of Medicine at Tribhuvan University, and the Nepal Health Research Council. Oral consent was obtained from study participants due to low literacy rates in the population. This procedure was approved by the IRB.

Altogether, 3693 pregnant women were enrolled and followed from April 2011 to May 2014; 944 nasal swabs were collected during 3554 person-years of follow-up while pregnant or postpartum, with a respiratory virus detected in 556 (59%) of these swabs. RSV was detected in nasal swabs collected from 14 (0.4%) of all women, which constitutes 2.0% of the 733 women with febrile respiratory illnesses (Fig 1) . RSV was detected in women only between September and December during the three years of the study. The incidence of RSV was 3.9/1000 person years overall. A total of 1189 person-years of follow-up occurred between September and December; during this period, the incidence of RSV was 11.8/1000 person-years.

Overall, the median gestational age at enrollment was 17 weeks (range, 4-34). For mothers who had RSV, the median age at enrollment was 16 weeks, (range, and for mothers without RSV, the median age at enrollment was 17 weeks (range, 4-34). Overall, 90% of moms were enrolled prior to 28 weeks gestation. Seven women had an RSV illness during pregnancy (median days before birth: 42 days, range, 13-201 days) and seven had RSV illness after delivery (median days after birth: 74, range 27-168). Baseline characteristics of women with and without RSV infection are shown in Table 1 . Mothers with RSV report fewer median years of education than those without (0 vs. 5 years; P = 0.04). No differences were observed in number of other children in the household (P = 0.80), use of an open indoor cookstove (P = 0.09), or presence of household members who smoked (P = 0.73).

RSV illness in pregnant and postpartum women was associated with a median of 2 days of fever (range, 1-7), 2 days of myalgia (range, 0-5), 1 day of cough (range, 0-5), 2 days of rhinorrhea (range, 0-18), and 0 days of sore throat (range, 0-10), with a median of 4 days of any symptoms (range, 2-18) ( Table 2 ; Fig 2) . Seven (50%) mothers sought care at local health care facilities for their RSV illness. Of these, two visited a medicine shop and five saw a practitioner. No mothers with RSV infection died.

The median RSV viral load was 4.1 log 10 copies/mL (range, 2.3-8.5). RSV subtype A was detected in 9 (75%) of 12 samples with subtyping performed. An additional respiratory virus was detected in five illness episodes, including coronavirus (n = 1; 20%), rhinovirus (n = 2; 40%), parainfluenza 2 (n = 1; 20%), human metapneumovirus (n = 1; 20%), and bocavirus (n = 1; 40%). 

All seven women with RSV illness during pregnancy delivered live born infants (Table 3) . Two (29%) infants were born prematurely at 34 and 36 weeks gestation to mothers who had RSV six and two weeks before birth, respectively. Of the five infants with known birthweights, 1 (20%) was low birthweight and 1 (20%) was small for gestational age. Among infants born to women without RSV during pregnancy, 678 (25%) of 2736 infants with weights measured within 72 hours of delivery were low birthweight. In addition, 469 (13%) of 3612 infants were premature and 63 (2%) of 3719 infants were stillbirths. Growth data was available for 5 (63%) infants born to pregnant women with RSV; median six month Z-score for weight was -0.8 (IQR, -3.0-0.7) and six month Z-score for length was -0.5 (IQR, -2.1-0.4). For infants born to mothers without RSV during pregnancy, the median six-month Z-score for weight was -1.0 (IQR, -8.5-3.7) and six-month Z-score for length was -1.1 (IQR, -12.0-3.7). With the small number of infants born to mothers having had RSV during pregnancy, no statistical testing was done to compare these characteristics. 

Among the 7 mothers with RSV in the six months following birth, 4 of their infants also had RSV. Two infant-mother pairs had RSV detected on the same day. For two additional pairs, the infant and mother had RSV four weeks apart. Of these two, in one pair, the infant had RSV detected four weeks following maternal RSV detection and in the other, the mother had RSV detected four weeks following infant RSV detection. All 3 pairs with RSV typing available from both the mother and infant had the same subtype (2 subtype A; 1 subtype B). The median differences in RSV viral load between mothers and infants was 1.9 log 10 copies/mL (range, 1.5-3.5).

Active home-based viral surveillance in rural Nepal was utilized to determine the incidence and clinical presentation of febrile RSV disease in pregnant and postpartum women. RSV was an uncommon cause of febrile respiratory illness in pregnant women, and did not result in any hospitalizations or deaths in this population.

Maternal vaccination is recommended in many countries to protect women and their infants against influenza, tetanus, and pertussis [2] . Influenza infection during pregnancy may be associated with increased risk of maternal mortality, as well as low birthweight and smallfor-gestational age infants [6] . The mechanism for this is unknown, but may be related to physiologic changes related to pregnancy, decreased cardiopulmonary reserve leading to increased severity of illness, and modulation of the systemic immunologic response to infection [17] . Because of the increased risk of maternal mortality and adverse birth outcomes associated with influenza during pregnancy, the Centers for Disease Control in the United States recommends influenza vaccine be administered at any time during pregnancy [18] . In contrast, pertussis in adults has a relatively milder course compared to the high morbidity and mortality due to pertussis infection in infants. Therefore, pertussis vaccines in pregnancy are administered in the third trimester to maximize transplacental antibody transfer to the infant [19] . RSV transplacental antibody transfer is efficient in mother-infant pairs in South Asia, the United States, and the Gambia [20] . Higher cord blood RSV antibody titers in Bangladesh are associated with decreased risk of serologic infection in infants [21] . Because febrile RSV illness was rare and relatively mild in pregnancy, a potential vaccination strategy would be similar to the pertussis strategy, with prioritization of infant protection from severe disease. Vaccination during the third trimester when antibodies are most likely to be transferred to the infant would maximize protection of the infant in the early postpartum period.

Assessment of risks of RSV infection in women becomes more important as maternal immunization with RSV subunit vaccines is considered as an approach to prevent symptomatic lower respiratory tract disease in both mothers and infants [22] . A phase II trial of a maternal RSV vaccine candidate was recently found to be safe and immunogenic in non-pregnant women of childbearing age [3] . As trials expand to resource-limited settings, it will be important to know baseline incidence rates of RSV infection and adverse birth outcomes in the study population. Previous estimates of RSV incidence in adults in low and middle-income countries have been calculated using outpatient and hospital-based surveillance with estimates ranging from 0.13 to 4.4/1000 person-years in Kenya, Egypt, and Thailand [23] [24] [25] . In the United States, the incidence of RSV in healthy elderly adults was 8.7/1000 person-years; however, in this study, surveillance was only performed between November and April during periods of RSV circulation [8] . The incidence rates of 11.8/1000 person-years during RSV season in this study are comparable to prior studies. The seasonality of RSV in southern Nepal is similar to that observed in previous studies performed in northern India and other regions of Nepal, with a clear peak during the months of September through November [26, 27] . This is in contrast to influenza, which has a less defined season in tropical as compared to temperate regions of the world [28] [29] [30] .

RSV was an uncommon cause of febrile respiratory illness in the participants in our study. The median duration of fever was only two days, and total symptom duration was four days. No participants in this study were hospitalized or died due to RSV; this is in contrast to a case report of pregnant women with RSV at an academic medical center in the United States where two of three patients were mechanically ventilated [9] . In contrast to this case report, our study used active home-based surveillance in rural south Asia, a population with low rates of obesity and other risk factors that may increase risk for respiratory failure.

RSV was also detected in a substantial proportion of infants of mothers with postpartum RSV illness, with evidence of the same subtype in mother-infant pairs. This agrees with studies showing mothers as a potential source of RSV introduction to infants in households in rural Kenya [31] . Maternal vaccination may potentially reduce the spread of RSV within motherinfant pairs and other household members if administered close to the time of delivery.

Limitations of our study include lack of collection of samples in mothers whose respiratory symptoms did not include fever, or in mothers without any symptoms. In family studies, RSV is associated with fever in only 5-27% of illness episodes [32] . These studies suggest the incidence of RSV-associated afebrile respiratory illness could be several-fold higher than found in our study, and potentially account for significant numbers of days with symptoms and health care seeking. Febrile respiratory illness due to RSV in our population did result in a median of four days of symptoms and half of the mothers seeking care for their illness. This is in a region of the world where access to health care is limited by poverty, distance, and gender inequality. Studies in healthy military recruits have found that RSV accounts for 11% of clinically significant respiratory illness in this population, and accounted for one day of missed work in 94% of the cases [33] . An additional limitation was our inability to describe the effect of RSV infection on birthweight or other birth outcomes due to the small numbers of pregnant or postpartum women with febrile RSV illness. It is possible that milder cases of RSV disease without fever can have adverse effects on maternal and infant outcomes, and we were unable to assess this in our study. We did find, however, no mortality or hospitalization due to RSV in this population.

In conclusion, symptomatic febrile RSV illness during pregnancy and after delivery was rare among mothers in south Asia. These data will inform prevention and therapeutic strategies against RSV in resource-limited settings.

Risk factors for severe bronchiolitis caused by respiratory virus infections among Mexican children in an emergency department,Severe bronchiolitis is the most common reason for hospitalization among children younger than 2 years. This study analyzed the prevalence of community-acquired respiratory virus infection and the risk factors for hospitalization of Mexican children with severe bronchiolitis treated in an Emergency department.,"Bronchiolitis causes significant morbidity and mortality in infants and young children worldwide and is one of the most common clinical conditions treated by practicing pediatricians. [1] Severe bronchiolitis is the most common reason for hospitalization of pediatric patients. This condition causes acute inflammation, edema, and necrosis of epithelial cells; increased mucus production; and inadequate oxygenation of tissues, which can permanently damage the respiratory structures. In high-income countries, such as the United States, the number of hospitalizations for severe bronchiolitis have been estimated at 120,000 cases per year among infants, [2] and the proportion of hospitalizations have tripled between 1980 and 1996, from 5% to 16%. [3] In Spain, the incidence of bronchiolitis is estimated at 7%, and hospital admissions is estimated at 1.79% annually in children younger than 2 years. [4] However, in low/middle-income countries, the data on admissions of children with severe bronchiolitis and their outcomes are seldom up to date.

Bronchiolitis is caused by viral infection in infants and young children. Although many respiratory viruses infect the lower respiratory system, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most common etiology of bronchiolitis, and it has been reported as the most frequent cause of infant hospitalization annually in developed countries, such as the United States and Spain. [5, 6] In fact, about 90% of children suffer an RSV infection during the first 2 years of life, [7, 8] and as many as 40% present with lower respiratory tract infection initially. [9] Other viruses can cause bronchiolitis, including rhinovirus, metapneumovirus, influenza, adenovirus, coronavirus, and parainfluenza viruses. [10] However, in Mexico, infants and young children with respiratory virus infections and severe bronchiolitis have not been reported in Emergency department data.

Although RSV infection is known as a risk factor for severe bronchiolitis, [11] other risk factors have been associated with the severity of bronchiolitis in infants and young children. These risk factors can be categorized as environmental, maternal, and host factors. Environmental exposure of children or their mothers to allergens, cigarette smoke, overcrowded living conditions, and particulate matter can contribute to the severity of bronchiolitis and cause respiratory airway damage. [2, [12] [13] [14] The host-related factors associated with severe bronchiolitis are male sex; congenital heart disease; and a history of premature birth, mechanical ventilation as a neonate, low birth weight, or short birth length. [6, [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] Other associated risk factors in infants with severe bronchiolitis include the lack of breastfeeding, delivery by elective caesarean section, maternal age, inadequate prenatal care, incomplete vaccination history, and a family history of asthma. [6, 14, 18, [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] These risk factors related to the severity of bronchiolitis in children have been reported in Europe, North America, and South America.

In Mexico, a history of premature birth and a family history of asthma were associated with increased risk of bronchiolitis in children younger than 2 years, and factors that had protective effects were early ablactation, considered as introduction of other foods different to milk before from four months of age, and breastfeeding. [17] However, the associations of the other risk factors associated with severe bronchiolitis in hospitalized children have not been studied in Mexico. For that reason, we analyzed the respiratory viruses implicated in severe bronchiolitis among children 2 years or younger and estimated the impact of the known risk factors associated with severity of this disease to implement better pediatric care in Emergency departments in low/middle-income countries. The aim of this study was to analyze the prevalence of respiratory virus infections in children 2 years or younger and estimate their associations with established risk factors for severe viral bronchiolitis treated in an Emergency department in a public hospital in Mexico.

This retrospective, case-controlled study included all children 2 years or younger who were hospitalized with a diagnosis of severe bronchiolitis in the Emergency department at the Civil Hospital of Guadalajara Dr. Juan I. Menchaca from September 2012 to January 2015. Severe bronchiolitis was defined as rhinorrhea, cough, tachypnea, wheezing, rales, and increased respiratory effort (e.g., grunting, nasal flaring, and intercostal and/or subcostal retraction), with symptoms of severity (e.g., increased respiratory rate, retractions, and oxygen saturation at 90% or lower). [25] All these children with severe bronchiolitis-diagnosed were hospitalized in ward. In addition, clinical information about healthy age-matched children, that received care for healthy children control, from the same period of time was used as the control group. Informed consent was obtained from the children's parents at the time of clinical evaluation. The Research Council and Ethical Committee of the Civil Hospital of Guadalajara Dr. Juan I. Menchaca approved the study in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki 1975, as revised in 1983.

Inclusion criteria included diagnosis of severe bronchiolitis, age 2 years or younger, date of birth during the study period, birthplace in Jalisco, Mexico, and respiratory virus detected in nasopharyngeal aspirate. Exclusion criteria included previous hospitalization for bronchiolitis, previous use of bronchodilators or corticosteroids, the lack of clinical symptoms of respiratory infections and/or demographic data, birthplace outside the catchment area, and absence of respiratory virus isolated in nasopharynx aspirate. Healthy children 2 years or younger, with no history of respiratory symptoms or previous hospitalizations during the past 6 months, who were born in the catchment area and received care from the Preventative Medicine department in our hospital were included as a healthy control group.

The Civil Hospital of Guadalajara Dr. Juan I. Menchaca is a tertiary-level hospital that provides medical care to people from rural towns and urban cities of western Mexico, many of whom have a low income and very limited access to social security or health insurance. The Emergency department has 2 consultation offices for triage evaluation, 6 beds for ambulatory fluid resuscitation, and 23 beds for pediatric hospitalization (8 for newborns and 15 for pediatric patients). Twelve emergency pediatricians and 24 nurses attend to pediatric patients that arrive at this department for any emergency.

The medical records of children included in this study were independently reviewed by 2 pediatricians, and the information was recollected using a standardized questionnaire in the moment that the child was present at Emergency or Preventative Departments for evaluation. The following demographic data were investigated: age, sex, date of birth, gestational age, birth weight, birth length, previous hospitalizations, history of previous respiratory disease, and birthplace. All mothers were interviewed to determine their children's exposure to potential or known risk factors for severe bronchiolitis, including the following: history of inadequate prenatal and neonatal care (e.g., whether mother was evaluated by a medical doctor at least 9 times during the pregnancy [24] ), intake of vitamins and calcium during of pregnancy, exposure to cigarette smoke, [26] delivery by elective caesarean section, [23] premature birth (gestational age < 37 weeks [15] ), requirement of mechanical ventilation during the neonatal period, [15] congenital abnormality (e.g., persistent ductus arteriosus, Down syndrome [15, 19] ); children's health history: breastfed for at least 6 months [21] (if the children were less than 6 months of age and they were being breastfed, was considered to have this criteria), completed vaccination schedule for the child's age (Bacillus Calmette-Guerin and hepatitis B vaccines at birth and hepatitis B vaccine at 2, 4, and 6 months of age; pentavalent acellular pertussis, rotavirus, and pneumococcus vaccines at 6 and 7 months of age; and annual influenza vaccines [27] ), daycare, [28] or malnutrition (i.e., deficiency of weight/age, index weight/age, height/age, and weight/height were obtained from the children, and then the nutrition indexes were analyzed [29] ); family health history: asthma, allergies, atopy, and rhinitis in family members [18] ; and environmental factors: passive exposure to house smoking, [30] excessive moisture in the house (coexistence of molds or black spots on the walls), overcrowding, [12] pest infestation in the house, and coexistence with pets. [18, 30] 

Nasopharyngeal samples were obtained upon admission from all children with a diagnosis of severe bronchiolitis who were Robledo-Aceves et al. Medicine (2018) 97:9 Medicine enrolled in the study. The presence of respiratory virus was analyzed using a standard procedure. [31] Viruses were placed in viral transport medium and maintained at 4°C. The samples were stored at -80°C until their viral nucleic contents were analyzed. Respiratory viruses were detected and identified using the CLART PneumoVir array assay (Genomica S.A.U., Madrid, Spain) in 3 steps (extraction, amplification, and hybridization array), according to the manufacturer's protocol. This kit is based on 2 end-point multiplex reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or PCR amplification and subsequent DNA microarray (hybridization) detection. This assay detects single or mixed infections with 17 different respiratory viruses: adenovirus; bocavirus; coronavirus; enterovirus (echovirus); influenza A virus H1N1/2009; influenza viruses A, B, and C; metapneumoviruses A and B; parainfluenza viruses (PIV) type 1, 2, 3, 4A, and 4B; rhinoviruses; and RSV A and B. Sensitivity and specificity values of 90% or more are reported per the manufacturer.

Briefly, the viral genomes were manually obtained from 200 mL of samples with an extraction kit included in the assay, then eluted in 20 mL of elution buffer. RT-PCR was carried out in 2 different ready-to-use amplification tubes with specific primers for the respiratory viruses listed below. One multiplex-PCR tube for amplification of coronavirus, metapneumovirus (subtypes A and B), parainfluenza virus 1, 2, 3, and 4 (subtypes A and B), and RSV type A; and another multiplex-PCR tube for amplification of adenovirus; bocavirus; enterovirus, influenza virus C, metapneumovirus, and RSV type B. These tubes have a mixture of retrotranscriptase and DNA polymerase enzymes for amplification both RNA and DNA viruses. During the amplification process, the amplified products were labeled with biotin. These biotin markers act as reference system for the automatic alignment of the array grid, and serve as control of the reagents performance. A specific 120-to 330-base pair fragment of the viral genomes was amplified. In addition, an internal control (200 mL of solution dilution) was used to ensure the proper performance of the process of amplification.

After the amplification process, the amplified products were hybridized with their respective probes that were immobilized at different sites on the array. Then, they were incubated with streptavidin peroxidase to generate an insoluble product that precipitates at the hybridization sites in the array. Hybridization occurred in a low-density microarray containing triplicate DNA probes that are specific to the respiratory virus studied. All these products were visualized by using CAR automatic reader (Clinical Array Reader) (Genomica S.A.U.).

The continuous variable data are reported as the mean and standard deviation (SD). The demographic data, respiratory viruses detected, and risk factors are given as simple frequencies and proportions. Statistical associations were determined by Student t test, Chi-square test, or Fisher exact test, when appropriate. Bivariate analysis was performed using Chi-square test and odds ratio (OR) calculated for risk factors. A Pvalue < .05 was considered statistically significant, and the confidence interval (CI) was set at 95%. All risk factors with significant OR (P < .05) and those with P < .20 were chosen for further evaluation. Logistic regression was used to analyze independent risk factors. Two models were built using enter and conditional forward-selection methods, and then a final model was built. The risk factors that significantly changed the Chisquare value of the model were preserved. The following risk factors or protective variables were entered: exposure to cigarette smoking, having completed the vaccination schedule for the patient's age, breastfeeding for at least 6 months (in children older 6 months of age), a family history of asthma, and male sex.

During the study period, 134 cases of severe bronchiolitis caused by respiratory virus confirmed in pediatric patients 2 years or younger were treated in the pediatric Emergency department, and none were hospitalized on 2 or more occasions. Table 1 summarizes the demographic data of the patient and health control groups; the data were compared between both groups. The mean age of children with severe bronchiolitis was 6.6 ± 5.7 months (range, 1-24 months), which did not differ from that of the control group (mean age, 6.61 ± 5.6 months; P = .748). The patient group was predominantly male (60.5%, 81/134), but the control group was not (39.5%, 53/134; P = .0006).

Several respiratory viruses were identified in the nasopharyngeal samples from the 134 children with severe bronchiolitis ( 

We investigated various potential risk factors in children with severe bronchiolitis and in the healthy control group ( Table 3 ). The following risk factors were independently associated with severe bronchiolitis: male sex, having persistent ductus arteriosus at birth, maternal history of asthma and/or allergies, history of www.md-journal.com exposure to cigarette smoking, a family history of cigarette smoking, overcrowding, and coexistence with animals. In contrast, the protective factors we found in the children with severe bronchiolitis were adequate prenatal care, maternal history of taking prenatal calcium, and having a complete vaccination profile for the patient's age.

The final model of logistic regression analysis of the risk factor independently associated with severe bronchiolitis in children 2 years or younger is shown in Table 4 . Only exposure to cigarette smoking was an independent risk factor associated with severe bronchiolitis (OR, 3.5; 95% CI, 1.99-6.18; P = .0001) and having a complete vaccination profile for the patient's age was the only protective factor identified (OR, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.35-0.87; P = .010).

Respiratory virus infections are the most common cause of bronchiolitis in children worldwide, and RSV is well recognized as the most prevalent virus in severe bronchiolitis among infants treated in Emergency departments. In our study, we found that RSV type A or B was the most frequently isolated virus, and all mixed viral infections included RSV and another respiratory virus.

It is important to note that we did not find an association for severe bronchiolitis among cases of children with severe bronchiolitis with viral coinfections, as has been reported previously. [28] Our findings also contrasted with previous reports in which rhinovirus and metapneumovirus were the most frequent viruses isolated from children with bronchiolitis. [11, 22, 28] In addition, is contrasting with our study the fact of metapneumovirus and adenovirus were the respiratory virus reported most frequently in Mexican children (under 5 years of age) who had acute respiratory infection during winter and spring, and did not require being hospitalized in Emergency department. [32] Although we detected rhinovirus, PIV type 3, and other respiratory viruses in the children with severe bronchiolitis in our study, further large-scale investigations are necessary to estimate the prevalence of these respiratory viruses in different pediatric settings and their implications in the severity of respiratory infections.

Several environmental and host factors have been implicated in the development of severe bronchiolitis in children during their first 2 years of life that require treatment in an Emergency department, and numerous studies have analyzed the association between these risk factors and severe bronchiolitis. However, few studies have been performed using infants hospitalized with severe bronchiolitis whose viral infections were confirmed, and few studies have included the incidence of these risk factors in the general pediatric population in which this investigation was done.

Exposure to cigarette smoking is a major cause of increased risk of hospitalization due to bronchiolitis among infants and young children. In this study, exposure to cigarette smoking was the only independent risk factor associated with severe bronchiolitis treated in the Emergency department at our hospital. This result is consistent with those from previous studies that reported children's exposure to maternal cigarette smoking increased the risk of hospitalization in infants and young children with bronchiolitis. This result suggests that exposure to cigarette smoking decreases pulmonary function in children 2 years or younger, which in turn, results in an increased number of visits to the Emergency department. [2, 12, 17, 18, 33, 34] Regional campaigns to increase awareness about the importance of avoiding exposing young children to cigarette smoking should be reinforced to decrease acute inflammation, hospitalizations, and permanent damage to their lower airway systems.

Other environmental factors that we found to be associated with severe viral bronchiolitis in our bivariate analysis were living in overcrowded conditions, having a pest (e.g., termite, flea, tick, or rodent) or cockroach infestation in the house, and coexisting with pets. Although previous reports have not shown that overcrowded living conditions is associated with severe viral bronchiolitis in infants, [17, 35] overcrowding is a well-known risk factor for severe bronchiolitis. [1, 8, 25] In addition, these associated environmental factors, that were found in our study, may reflect that our hospital primarily serves a low-income population that lacks health insurance. One earlier study reported that living in low-income conditions influences the severity of viral bronchiolitis, [30] but the presence of pets, pest infestation in the house, or farm animals did not. [17, 35] However, the contribution of these environmental factors to worse outcome of viral bronchiolitis in infants and young children is well studied; thus, studies in similar populations are required to analyze these associations. Family factors that were associated with severe viral bronchiolitis in this study were maternal history of asthma and allergies, as have been previously reported in Mexico. [17] However, risk factors such as exposure to cigarette smoking during pregnancy were not associated with severe bronchiolitis in the children studied, contrasting with findings reported previously in Spain and North American. [2, 26] This could be a secondary effect of campaigns against smoking during pregnancy that have been undertaken in Mexico, but are not related with the lack of association between severity of bronchiolitis and pregnancy smoking in this study. Comparable results have been published in Italy. [14] However, activities that prevent smoking Table 4 Multivariate analysis of risk factors associated with severe viral bronchiolitis.

Crude odds ratio (95% CI) Adjusted odds ratio (95% CI) P * during pregnancy should have been followed because it is a wellknown risk factor that influences the severity of bronchiolitis in infants and young children.

With respect to the host risk factors that affect severe bronchiolitis, we found that male sex and having persistent ductus arteriosus at birth were associated with severity. This is consistent with the fact that persistent ductus arteriosus at birth increases the severity of bronchiolitis because congenital heart disease compromises hemodynamic function, which has been reported previously. [6, 16, 19] In addition, being a white male is associated with severe bronchiolitis. [2, 16, 21] Although these host risk factors cannot be avoided to decrease severe bronchiolitis presentation, they should be taken into account when the child arrives to be treated at the Emergency department to improve their care.

Finally, we found that having a complete schedule of vaccinations was a protective factor to prevent severe viral bronchiolitis in infants and young children. This could be a surrogate factor linked to better socioeconomic status and better life habits, as less tobacco smoke, less crowding, or better medical assistance. However, socioeconomic status or parent's level of education was not possible to compare between patients and controls because this information was missing in the majority of the cases, being a limiting of our study. In Mexico, the Ministry of Health provides the seasonal flu vaccines to all children older than 1 year, but vaccination against RSV is not available to date. Although this protective association does not explain the decreased incidence of severe bronchiolitis among vaccinated children, it is important to note that these data reflect that the healthy control group had better health care, including vaccinations against preventable infections. Pregnancy history factors, such as adequate prenatal care and taking calcium during pregnancy, were protective factors for severe viral bronchiolitis in this study. Although a previous report did not find these factors protective, [24] studies in low-income populations should be done to more thoroughly investigate these protective associations.

In summary, RSV infections were the most common respiratory virus isolated in infants and young children with severe bronchiolitis. Therefore, to significantly reduce the incidence of hospitalizations due to severe bronchiolitis, we must develop vaccines against RSV infections. In addition, to minimize children's exposure to cigarette smoking, the National Ministry of Health should reinforce public campaigns to avoid the exposing infants and young children to cigarette smoking.

Clinical characteristics and outcomes of respiratory syncytial virus infection in pregnant women,"Objective: To describe the clinical presentation and laboratory diagnosis of pregnant women with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection. Methods: Pregnant women in their second and third trimester were enrolled during the course of routine prenatal care visits when they were asymptomatic within the preceding two weeks (healthy controls) or when they reported symptoms of acute respiratory illness (ARI) of 7 days of duration (cases). Clinical outcomes were assessed at enrollment and two weeks after. Re-enrollment was allowed. Nasalpharyngeal secretions were evaluated for respiratory pathogens by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Sera were tested for RSV-specific antibody responses by Western Blot, microneutralization assay, and palivizumab competitive antibody assay. Results: During the 2015-2016 respiratory virus season, 7 of 65 (11%) pregnant women with ARI at their initial enrollment and 8 of 77 (10%) pregnant women with ARI during the study period (initial or reenrollment) had PCR-confirmed RSV infection. Four (50%) PCR-confirmed RSV ARI cases reported symptoms of a lower respiratory tract illness (LRTI), one was hospitalized. Combining PCR and serology data, the RSV attack rate at initial enrollment was 12% (8 of 65), and 13% (10 of 77) based on ARI episodes. Among healthy controls, 28 of 88 (32%) had a Western Blot profile suggestive of a recent RSV infection either in the prior and/or current season. Conclusion: RSV had an attack rate of 10-13% among ambulatory pregnant women receiving routine prenatal care during the respiratory virus season. The serology results of healthy controls suggest a potentially higher attack rate. Future studies should be aware of the combined diagnostic strength of PCR and serology to identify RSV infection. As maternal RSV vaccine candidates are evaluated to protect young infants, additional priority should be placed on outcomes of pregnant women.","Infection with respiratory pathogens during pregnancy can result in mild to severe acute respiratory illness (ARI). Due to the physiologic changes that occur during pregnancy, pregnant women may experience severe outcomes when infected with a respiratory pathogen [1] . Infection with influenza during pregnancy has been associated with an increased risk of maternal mortality, preterm birth, and infants that are small for gestational age [2, 3] . To prevent these adverse maternal and fetal outcomes, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends immunization with influenza vaccine during pregnancy [4] . The ACIP also recommends maternal immunization with the Tetanus-Diphtheria-acellular Pertussis (Tdap) vaccine [5] given that, although adult infection with pertussis is often mild, maternal antibodies transferred to the infant can prevent pertussis-related morbidity and mortality in this vulnerable age group [6] . Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a leading cause of lower respiratory tract illness (LRTI) among infants and young children, contributing significantly to morbidity and mortality in these populations [7] [8] [9] . There is currently a robust pipeline of RSV vaccine candidates in various preclinical and clinical phases of development. One strategy targets protection of infants less than three months of age through maternal vaccination. Maternal RSV antibodies are efficiently transferred transplacentally to the fetus during gestation, and have been associated with decreased risk of RSV infection in young infants [10] [11] [12] . For this reason, maternal immunization appears to be a promising strategy to prevent severe RSV disease in infants. However, the direct benefit to pregnant women from maternal immunization against RSV is currently unknown.

Maternal RSV infection has not been well defined, both in regards to rate of infection and consequences of infection. A case-series study was the first to describe severe RSV infection during pregnancy: two of the three cases were hospitalized and required mechanical ventilation [13] . In addition, several large prospective maternal cohort studies of influenza-like illness (ILI) evaluated during influenza vaccine trials have described maternal RSV infection incidences of 3.9/1000 person-years in Nepal, 5.3/1000 person-months in South Africa, and 0.3/1000 persondays in Mongolia [14] [15] [16] . Recently, a retrospective multicountry study of ARI-related hospitalizations among pregnant women identified 846 women who were tested for RSV during the influenza season, 21 (2.5%) had detectable RSV by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (PCR) [17] . Of the 21 cases, 13 had a pregnancy complication, 8 were diagnosed with pneumonia, and 6 had subsequent preterm birth. We previously described the frequency and clinical impact of respiratory viruses in women seen during the second and third trimester of pregnancy at a primary obstetrical and gynecological clinic [18] . In this manuscript we expand on the clinical and diagnostic laboratory findings of pregnant women infected with RSV.

Detailed methods for patient enrollment and sample collection have been previously published [18] . In summary, pregnant women in their second or third trimester of gestation were enrolled from November 3 through May 10, during the 2015-2016 respiratory virus season, as defined by local surveillance, as they received routine prenatal care at an obstetrical/gynecological clinic in Houston, Texas, whether they were asymptomatic in the prior two weeks (healthy controls) or when they had selfreported symptoms of ARI (rhinorrhea, sore throat, cough, difficulty breathing or shortness of breath, wheezing, or cyanosis) in the prior seven days (cases) (Fig. 1) . Upper respiratory tract illness (URTI) was defined as the presence of any of the following: rhinorrhea, sore throat, or cough. LRTI was defined as the presence of any of the following: difficulty breathing or shortness of breath, wheezing, or cyanosis. At any point in the study, healthy controls were allowed to re-enroll if they developed an ARI, and those initially enrolled with ARI were allowed to re-enroll (1) if they developed a new ARI, or (2) as a healthy control.

This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Baylor College of Medicine. Written informed consent was obtained. Nasal-pharyngeal secretions and serum samples for both ARI cases and healthy controls were obtained at enrollment. Clinical outcomes were assessed at enrollment and at a two-week phone follow-up. Each subsequent enrollment was treated as a new event, with collection of nasal-pharyngeal secretions and serum samples at re-enrollment, as well as clinical outcomes two weeks later.

The rate of PCR-confirmed RSV ARI in pregnant women was calculated by two approaches. The first was based on the participants' ARI vs. healthy status at first enrollment (65 ARI cases and 90 controls). The second approach was based on the first ARI episode and includes those women who were first enrolled as healthy and subsequently re-enrolled as an ARI case (77 ARI cases and 78 controls).

RSV infection was determined by PCR or serology. ARI was attributed to RSV infection if RSV PCR was positive. Acute RSV infection diagnosed by serology required at least two serum samples more than two weeks apart to observe a four-fold or greater increase in RSV specific neutralizing antibody titer or a Western Blot infection profile. However, because the serum samples did not bracket a particular ARI, the viral cause of the ARI could not be definitively confirmed. When only one serum sample was available that had a Western Blot profile consistent with infection subjects were designated as having had a recent prior RSV infection [21, 22] .

PCR: The PCR assays were performed as previously described, in a CLIA certified Respiratory Virus Diagnostic laboratory (CLIA ID# 45D0919666). Nasal-pharyngeal secretions were evaluated for a number of respiratory pathogens, including RSV/A and /B [18] [19] [20] .

Western Blot: The RSV-Western Blot assay was utilized to determine serological evidence of a recent prior RSV infection when only one serum sample was available or of an acute serologic infection when two or more serum samples were available for analysis. This was done by evaluating antibody binding patterns to internal [nucleoprotein (N), phosphoprotein (P) and matrix-2 (M2-1)], and surface [attachment (G) and fusion (F)] RSV proteins, as previously described [21, 22] . A recent prior RSV infection was suggested by detecting bands to one or more internal viral proteins in a single serum sample, and an acute serologic RSV infection was identified when there was an increase or new RSV protein band(s) identified in the second serum sample compared to the first serum sample. Previous studies indicate that the banding patterns seen with a recent prior RSV infection suggest that a person has been infected sometime within the last year [21, 22] .

Microneutralization Assay: Serum neutralizing antibodies against RSV/A (Tracy) and RSV/B (18537) were quantified using a previously described qualified microneutralization assays [23] . Neutralizing antibody titers were defined as the final dilution at which there was a 50% reduction in viral cytopathic effect (CPE). The lowest limit of detection was 2.5 log 2 . Any sample resulting in a titer below the lower limit of detection was assigned a value of 2.0 log 2 . Individuals who developed a four-fold or greater rise in neutralizing antibody titer between the serum samples collected at enrollment and subsequent re-enrollment were reported to have an acute serologic RSV infection.

Palivizumab Competitive Antibody Assay (PCA): A PCA assay was performed as previously described to detect the concentration of palivizumab-like antibodies (PLA) that compete with biotinylated palivizumab for binding to antigenic site II of the fusion protein of RSV [24] . The source of the fusion protein was from sucrose purified RSV/A/Bernett (GA1 genotype) that was coated onto the 96-well plate for 18 h. The lower limit of detection was 1 lg/mL.

Those samples with undetectable levels of PLA were assigned a value of 0.5 lg/mL.

Data from the Texas Department of State Health Services were utilized to define the RSV season [26] . For Houston, the 2015-2016 RSV season was defined as the timeframe in which the percentage of positive RSV antigen tests rose above the 10% threshold (onset, week 43) and decline below 10% threshold (end of season, week 12).

A 5-15% incidence of community acquired RSV was used to estimate sample size. A total of 150 or 71 subjects per group were required for 5% or 10% respective incidence rates of RSV infection to show a 5% difference in RSV incidence between RSV-infected pregnant women and healthy pregnant women using a power of 80% and an alpha level of 0.05.

Frequencies of demographic, clinical data, and laboratory findings were determined for RSV-infected and healthy control groups. Frequency distributions between groups were compared using Fisher's exact test. An independent t-test or Kruskal-Wallis test was conducted to compare mean or median values of continuous demographic and clinical data between groups. The geometric mean ratio (GMR) with a 95% confidence interval was calculated to compare the difference in the geometric mean titers (GMT) of the serologic data between groups. Stata software version 14.2 was used to perform all statistical analyses [25] .

At their first enrollment there were 65 pregnant women with ARI and 90 healthy pregnant women controls. Twelve of the ninety healthy pregnant women controls were re-enrolled later during the RSV season with ARI. Similarly two pregnant women with ARI at their initial enrollment were re-enrolled twice more with new ARI. [18] .

Among the 65 pregnant women with ARI at their initial enrollment, 39 (60%) had PCR evidence of a respiratory pathogen, of which seven (11%) were PCR-confirmed RSV infections. When expanded to include all women with an ARI during the study period, among 77 enrolled pregnant women with an ARI, 47 (61%) had PCR evidence of a respiratory pathogen, and eight (10%) were PCR-confirmed RSV infections. Thus, the rate of RSV ARI by initial enrollment during the RSV season was 11% (7 of 65) and by ARI episode it was 10% (8 of 77).

We compared women with PCR-confirmed RSV infection (n = 8) to pregnant women who were enrolled as healthy controls (n = 90). There were no significant differences between pregnant women with PCR-confirmed RSV and healthy pregnant women controls in regards to demographics or medical history (Table 1) . Asthma was uncommon in both groups and allergies were reported by three (38%) individuals with PCR-confirmed RSV and 42 (47%) healthy pregnant women. Co-morbidities and complications in current or previous pregnancies were similarly infrequent in both groups.

All patients with PCR-confirmed RSV reported symptoms of ARI in the week prior to enrollment ( Table 2 ). The time post-onset of symptoms at enrollment ranged from 1 day to 9 days, except for one individual who reported 25 days of symptoms. Cough (n = 7/8), congestion (7/8), and sore throat (6/8) were the most common symptoms among those with PCR-confirmed RSV ARI. Three (37.5%) patients reported fever. Four (50%) patients with PCR-confirmed RSV infection reported symptoms of an upper respiratory illness (congestion, sore throat, or cough), and all had symptom onset <6 days prior to enrollment. Four of eight women (50%) with PCR-confirmed RSV had symptoms consistent with a LRTI (shortness of breath or wheezing) and all were 6 days post-onset of symptoms. These four individuals also reported fever, chest pain, nausea or diarrhea, loss of appetite, and decreased activity with a greater frequency ( Table 2 ). All women with RSV-LRTI also reported a previous ARI during their pregnancy, one of which developed into pneumonia.

Most women with PCR-confirmed RSV ARI were seen at the obstetrics and gynecology clinic, and one patient was hospitalized. This patient presented during the peak of the RSV season with sudden onset of fever and uterine contractions. She was a 35-year-old, gravida 5, para 1, 35 weeks of gestation with dichorionic diamniotic twins. The physical exam was significant for left costovertebral angle and flank pain; she reported general malaise. The patient was started on antibiotics and supportive care. During her stay she developed symptoms of LRTI and was treated with azithromycin. Within 48 h, symptoms improved and the patient was discharged. Pregnant women in their second or third trimester of gestation were enrolled if they were asymptomatic (healthy controls) in the prior two weeks or if they had symptoms of ARI in the prior seven days. At any point in the study, pregnant women were allowed to re-enroll. The total number of women initially enrolled with symptoms of ARI was 65. Taking into consideration those 12 healthy controls who reenrolled when they developed symptoms of ARI, the total number of women with ARI during the study period was 77. The total number of women who re-enrolled was 15. She was enrolled into the study five days after hospital discharge and was still reporting congestion, cough, and sore throat. These symptoms resolved 10 days after discharge.

The duration of illness for women with PCR-confirmed RSV ranged from 7 to 30 days. In general, those who were enrolled later in their illness (6 days) experienced a longer illness. Two women (25%) continued to report symptoms when contacted at their two-week follow-up (Table 2) . Four (50%) reported the use of over-the-counter medications, including antihistamines, cough medicine, and pain relievers. Two (25%) were prescribed medications, including antibiotics and inhaled glucocorticoid.

Of the three pregnant women with ARI at their initial enrollment who subsequently re-enrolled in the study, one exhibited an acute serologic RSV infection profile. In addition, of the twelve women initially enrolled as healthy controls who later reenrolled in the study with ARI symptoms, two exhibited an acute serologic RSV infection profile (Table 3 ). In total, 3 (20%) of 15 pregnant women had serologic evidence of RSV infection. None of these individuals had PCR-confirmed RSV. One woman (Case 9) was initially enrolled as healthy control, but developed symptoms of an ARI by her two-week follow-up, and was secondarily enrolled as an ARI case. Similarly, Case 10 was also enrolled as healthy control and reported symptoms of ARI at two weeks. However, she was not re-enrolled into the study until 30 days after her first enrollment when she reported an additional instance of ARI. Case 11 was initially enrolled with ARI and 7 weeks later enrolled a second time as a healthy control.

In combining the PCR and serology data, the RSV attack rate based on health status at initial enrollment during the RSV season was 12% (8 of 65) and by ARI episode it was 13% (10 of 77).

The majority of patients did not re-enroll in the study and, as a result, only had one serum sample available for Western Blot analysis. Of the eight patients with PCR-confirmed RSV, six did not have Western Blot evidence of a recent prior RSV infection (Table 4 ). These six individuals were enrolled early in their infection (1-8 days of illness onset) and therefore we did not expect to observe PCR, real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. RSV, respiratory syncytial virus.

Data are mean ± standard deviation (SD), Median and interquartile range (IQR), or n (%). * Two healthy controls had two co-morbidities. an antibody response to their RSV infection. Two patients with PCR-confirmed RSV had serologic evidence of a recent prior RSV infection profile; these two individuals were enrolled on days 9 and 25 of their illness onset. Of the 88 healthy controls enrolled during the RSV season, 28 (31%) had a Western Blot profile consistent with recent prior RSV infection.

It would be expected that if RSV infection occurred during the RSV season, the greatest proportion of women with a recent prior RSV infection would occur later into the season when (1) greater exposure to RSV has occurred, and (2) time to develop an immune response following the RSV infection has elapsed. In Houston, the RSV season began on CDC week 43 and peaked weeks 3-4, ending week 12 (Fig. 2) . Overall, the rate of patient enrollment was greatest in the first third of the RSV season (weeks 43-50). The proportion of healthy controls with serologic evidence of a recent prior RSV infection significantly increased from 21% (13/62) in the first third of the RSV season, to 43% (6/14) in the second third, and 64% (9/14) in the last third (p < 0.004). In addition, two healthy controls were enrolled shortly after the end of the RSV season (weeks 13 and 15) and are included in Fig. 2 .

Healthy controls had serum neutralizing antibody GMT of 173.5 for RSV/A and171.7 for RSV/B, while the GMTs for women with PCR-confirmed RSV were 245.1 and 234.8, respectively. The two women with PCR-confirmed RSV who were enrolled on days 9 and 25 (Table 4) The geometric mean of PLA concentration of healthy controls (6.4 mg/mL) was similar to that of women with PCR-confirmed RSV (5.8 mg/mL). However, those two individuals with PCRconfirmed RSV infection who were enrolled later in their illness (days 9 and 25) had comparatively greater levels of PLA, 25.3 lg/mL and 10.5 lg/mL respectively.

PCR-confirmed RSV contributed to 10 or 11% of ARI cases based on initial enrollment status or first ARI episode, respectively, among pregnant women in our study. Because we enrolled women seen at an outpatient clinic regardless of history of fever, we were able to capture the full range of clinical manifestations of RSV infection in pregnancy without a selection bias for severe or concurrent disease. We found that 50% (4/8) of the pregnant women with PCR-confirmed RSV had symptoms of LRTI; this included one woman who was hospitalized, possibly related to her RSV illness.

Previous studies have documented the combined diagnostic strength of PCR and serology [26, 27] . Utilizing both techniques we identified RSV infection in acute samples by PCR and convalescent samples by serology. RSV was identified by PCR in 11% (7/65) of pregnant women with symptoms of ARI at their initial enrollment. Taking into account one additional woman who exhibited an acute serologic RSV infection, the RSV attack rate was at least 12% (8/65) of ARI cases. An RSV attack rate as high as 13% (10/77) is estimated if calculated using the first ARI episode. This is substantial given that the RSV season in Houston was relatively mild compared to previous years [28] , and greater than reported by maternal studies of respiratory illness in Nepal and Mongolia, where RSV accounted for 2% and 2.4% of ARI cases, respectively [14, 15] . However, because fever was an inclusion criteria for those studies, and fever occurs in less than one-third of adult RSV infections, these numbers may be an underestimate [29] . Our attack rate of 12-13% is similar to that of other studies with broad ARI inclusion criteria in adults. In a four year study of ARI in high risk adults, RSV was detected in 46 of 519 (10%) cases [9] . Similarly, a 20-year study of otherwise healthy adults found that 7% of individuals with respiratory illness were infected with RSV [30] .

Nearly one-third (32%, 28/88) of healthy pregnant women enrolled during the RSV season had evidence of a Western Blot profile consistent with a recent prior RSV infection and, based on serology, 2 of 12 (16.7%) healthy pregnant women went on to develop an RSV infection during the RSV season. Recent studies have reported findings wherein at least 20% of women of childbearing age had serologic evidence of an acute RSV infection [21, 31] . In our study, the percentage of healthy pregnant women with a Western Blot profile of a recent prior RSV infection increased significantly as the RSV season progressed. These women had enrollment dates that followed the peak of RSV illness in Houston. This suggests that these healthy controls may have been infected with RSV during the course of this study. A caveat in our method of defining the RSV season is the use of the RSV antigen test as a marker for infection. A recent study found that utilizing PCR as an alternative diagnostic tool allows for a more expanded RSV season and, as a result, an increase in the RSV cases reported [32] .

RSV infection during pregnancy resulted in a range of clinical manifestation of ARI illnesses. Cough, congestion, and sore throat were the most common symptoms among those with PCRconfirmed RSV. In previous studies of ILI, pregnant women with RSV generally reported a mild, febrile illness restricted to the upper airways [14, 15] . In our study women who reported fever also had symptoms of LRTI. Although none of the women were diagnosed with pneumonia, the morbidity attributable to RSV was significant. One woman did report symptoms of LRTI during hospitalization for fever and uterine contractions and was found to have PCRconfirmed RSV several days after hospital discharge. She, like those in the case-series by Wheeler et al, reported co-morbidities that may have put her at risk for a more serious illness [13] .

Due to differences in study design and sample collection, it is difficult to make comparisons between our study and others that have documented maternal RSV infection. Three of the previous studies were prospective, wherein a participant was actively followed during the RSV season by weekly visits or telephone calls, sampled when she became ill, and followed for clinical outcomes through the duration of her pregnancy [14] [15] [16] . However, these study participants were only sampled when they reported ILI or sought medical attention for their respiratory illness. The retrospective case-series describes three patients identified through tertiary care records [13] . These studies may select for a more severe illness or illness restricted to ILI. Conversely, in our study we captured women in different stages of their illness.

Of the eight women with PCR-confirmed RSV, only two had serological evidence of a recent prior RSV infection by Western Blot. Both were enrolled well into their illness, at 9 and 25 days, giving them time to develop an RSV specific immunological response. This is also evident by their comparatively greater levels of neutralizing antibodies and palivizumab-like antibodies [9, 33] . Three women who were re-enrolled and had paired sera, exhibited an RSV infection profile despite negative PCR. It is likely that these women were exposed to RSV sometime between their first and second enrollment visit. Although we cannot definitively establish causality, it is possible that RSV infection was responsible for some or all of the symptoms these three women reported. Twenty-eight healthy controls had serologic evidence of a recent prior RSV infection by Western Blot testing of a single serum sample, suggesting they had been infected with RSV at sometime within the year.

The proportion of healthy controls with a Western blot profile of a recent prior RSV infection significantly increased in the latter part of the RSV season. This suggests that many of these healthy women had been infected with RSV earlier in the current RSV season and, that by the time of study enrollment, sufficient time had elapsed to develop an RSV-specific antibody response.

Our study is limited in its size and duration. Because patients were enrolled at a single site over one RSV season, we were only able to capture eight women with PCR-confirmed RSV. However, this proportion is greater than that reported by other studies to date and, given our broad inclusion criteria, we were able to describe a range of RSV clinical manifestations. The case definition is limited in that it is dependent on self-reported symptoms, and LRTI was not confirmed by radiologic study. In addition, because serum samples were collected at the time of enrollment, only one serum sample was available for most patients, unless participants chose to re-enroll in the study at a later time. Given this, RSV case identification by serology was dependent on the number of serum samples provided: patients with sequential serum samples could be identified as having an acute serologic RSV infection, while patients with a single serum sample could be identified as having had a recent prior RSV infection.

In summary, RSV is a common cause of ARI during pregnancy with appreciable morbidity. Although the primary goal of maternal immunization against RSV is to protect young infants who are at increased risk for severe disease, a maternal RSV vaccine may also directly benefit pregnant women. As maternal RSV vaccine candidates move forward in evaluation, additional priority should be placed on evaluating the impact of RSV disease prevention in pregnant women.

Risk of mortality associated with respiratory syncytial virus and influenza infection in adults,"Background: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection constitutes a substantial disease burden in the general population. However, the risk of death for RSV infection has been rarely evaluated with confounders or comorbidities adjusted. We aimed to evaluate whether RSV infection is associated with higher mortality than seasonal influenza after adjusting for confounders and comorbidities and the effect of oseltamivir on the mortality in patients with influenza infection. Methods: A retrospective cohort study was conducted on adult (≥18 years) patients admitted to the emergency department and ward of a university teaching hospital for suspected viral infection during 2013-2015 (N = 3743). RSV infection was diagnosed by multiplex PCR (N = 87). Adults hospitalized for seasonal influenza during the study period were enrolled as a comparison group (n = 312). The main outcome was 20-day all-cause mortality.We used Cox proportional hazard regression analyses to calculate the relative risk of death. Results: Adult patients were less likely to be diagnosed with RSV than with influenza (2.3 vs 8.3%, respectively), were older and more likely to be diagnosed with pneumonia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hypoxemia, and bacterial co-infection. In patients with RSV infection, the 20-day all-cause mortality was higher than that for influenza, (18.4 vs 6.7%, respectively). RSV infection showed significantly higher risk of death compared to the seasonal influenza group, with hazard ratio, 2.32 (95% CI, 1.17-4.58). Oseltamivir had no significant effect on mortality in patients with influenza. Conclusions: RSV infection was significantly associated with a higher risk of death than seasonal influenza, adjusted for potential confounders and comorbidities.","Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a significant cause of lower respiratory tract infections in infants, and usually requires hospitalization, with the occurrence of death in extreme cases [1, 2] .

During the past decades, many studies have clearly demonstrated RSV as a serious pathogen in certain adult populations including long-term care facilities [3] [4] [5] [6] and immunocompromised host [7] [8] [9] [10] . Although RSV infection in adults is often mild, the effects of RSV infection can be substantial in both healthy adults and hospitalized patients [11] . RSV infection can cause significant morbidity in hospitalized patients, with mortality rates up to 12% [12] . A recent study showed that hospitalized community-acquired pneumonia related with viral pathogens, influenza, and RSV comprised of 21% and 11% among all viral pathogens, respectively [13] .

A retrospective cohort study showed that RSV infection, in combination with bacterial co-infection was associated with increased risk of mortality [14] . RSV infections may contribute to 5% to 10% of cases of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations [15] , and 7% of asthma admissions [11] in adults. Virus infections including RSV may explain seasonal mortality in the elderly [16] .

In the 1990's, Influenza had attributable mortality more than 4 times higher than RSV in the elderly in a population-based study [17] . However, in the 2000's attributable mortality of influenza was less than 2 times compared with those of RSV [18] . Attributable hospitalization due to RSV was almost two-thirds those of influenza [19] . RSV is an increasingly common cause of illness and high morbidity in adults. A better understanding of complications and outcomes of adults hospitalized with RSV compared to influenza infection would be useful to identify high-risk adults. Furthermore, oseltamivir has been commonly prescribed in influenza infected patients since 2009. However, the efficacies of oseltamivir treatment are contradictory [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] .

We investigated the 20-day all-cause mortality rate for hospital admitted patients with laboratory confirmed RSV compared to influenza. We also investigated the effect of oseltamivir on the mortality of patients with influenza infection.

A retrospective cohort study of hospitalized adults with RSV infection was conducted. All patients aged ≥18 years admitted between January 2013 and December 2015, with suspected respiratory viral infections (N = 3743), were studied. If physicians suspected respiratory viral illness, then virus multiplex PCR was performed. We excluded 2980 subjects who had no identifiable viral infections, and 364 patients with viral infections other than influenza A/B or RSV infection (Fig. 1 ). RSV patients (n = 87) were compared with patients diagnosed with seasonal influenza (n = 312) during the same period (2013-2015).One patient had a mixed infection of influenza and RSV. Among RSV-infected patients, one patient had a mixed infection with bocavirus. Among influenza-infected patients, 5 patients had mixed infection with bocavirus, and 3 patients with coronavirus. All the patients with mixed infections were included in this study except the one patient who had a mixed infection of influenza and RSV.

The current study was approved by the institutional review board at Dongsan Hospital, Keimyung University School of Medicine. The need for written informed consent was waived. This study was conducted in compliance with the Declaration of Helsinki.

An upper respiratory infection was defined as the presence of one or more of the following respiratory symptoms: cough, sputum production, rhinorrhea, sore throat, or dyspnea. Pneumonia was defined as the presence of a new or progressive infiltrate found using chest radiography, in addition to two or more of the following: fever, sputum production, rhinorrhea, sore throat, dyspnea, or a diagnosis of pneumonia by the attending physician. The outcome was designated as all-cause mortality up to 20 days after hospital admission. 

During the study period, nasopharyngeal specimens were obtained using flocked swabs and stored and transported using the universal transport medium (COPAN, Brescia, Italy). Nasopharyngeal specimens were submitted for respiratory virus detection. Nucleic acids were extracted from 300 μL specimens using a Viral Gene-spin™ Viral DNA/ RNA Extraction Kit (iNtRON Biotechnology, Seongnam, Korea). cDNA was synthesized from each of the extracted RNA samples with cDNA Synthesis Premix (Seegene, Seoul, Korea) and a GeneAmp PCR System 9700 thermal cycler (Applied Biomaterials, Foster City, CA, USA).

Respiratory virus (RV) 16 testing was performed to detect the following viruses: adenovirus, influenza viruses A and B, RSV A, RSV B, parainfluenza viruses 1 to 4, Rhinovirus A/B/C, metapneumovirus, enterovirus, coronavirus 229E, coronavirus NL63, coronavirus OC43, and bocavirus. During the RV16 test, an internal control was added to each specimen to check the entire process from nucleic acid extraction to PCR, according to the manufacturer's instructions. An Anyplex II RV16 Detection Kit (Seegene, Seoul, Korea) was used to detect 14 types of RNA viruses and two types of DNA viruses, according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, the assay was conducted in a final volume of 20 μL containing 8 μL of cDNA, 4 μL of 5 × RV primer, 4 μL of 8-methoxypsoralen solution, and 4 μL of 5 × master mix with the CFX96 real-time PCR detection system (Bio-Rad Laboratories Inc., Hercules, CA, USA).

This study was performed at Keimyung University Dongsan Hospital, a 867-bed, tertiary care teaching hospital in Daegu, Republic of Korea. If a patient had an episode of acute respiratory infection at an emergency department or outpatient clinic or within 2 days during admission, he or she underwent multiplex RT-PCR testing. Adult patients (≥ 18 years of age) who underwent multiplex RT-PCR testing between January 2013 and December 2015 were identified by electronic medical records. We collected clinical data using the electronic medical record on general characteristics, co-morbidities, presenting symptoms, lower respiratory complications, requirement of supplemental oxygen therapy and/or ventilatory support, hospitalization duration, and allcause mortality. Chest radiography was performed on all patients admitted to the hospital, and radiographic interpretation was performed for all RSV and influenza cases by radiologists. Additional laboratory investigations were performed based on the results of a routine blood test. Sputum samples were collected for bacterial culture preparation at admission and during hospitalization. Blood cultures were also performed when indicated. Pneumonia severity index (PSI) consisted four parts, demographics including age and sex, co-morbidity, physical examination, and laboratory findings [26] . PSI score was collected every admitted patient. We contacted patients or their families by phone to identify survival and clinical information if the patients were not followed up regularly.

Baseline characteristics (including age, sex, residency in a long-term care facility, comorbidities, presenting symptoms, and complications) at date of admission for cases and control patients were summarized using descriptive statistics, such as proportion and means (standard deviation, SD). A Chi-squared test was applied for comparison between categorical variables, and two-tailed t-tests, for comparison between continuous variables. P values <0.05 were considered statistically significant.

Fifty-two patients had missing data on body temperature due to lack of measurement in the outpatient clinic. We imputed 52 missing values for body temperature, 10 for RSV group and 42 for influenza group, using a sequential regression approach [27] , assuming that body temperature was missing at random conditioning on all covariates included in the analysis.

The univariate and multivariate Cox regression models were used to evaluate the risk of death from RSV infection compared to that of seasonal influenza. The pneumonia severity index (PSI) score and resident of long-term care facilities were excluded from the final model due to multicollinearity with age. The multicollinearity between adjusting variables was checked by the variance inflation factor (VIF) and the tolerance statistic [28] . The largest VIF was 2.05 for PSI score and average VIF was 1.28. The smallest tolerance was 0.48 for PSI score. However, more detailed collinearity diagnostics indicated collinearity between age and PSI score. And when age and resident of long-term care facilities were entered simultaneously into the model, the hazard ratio for age changed its polarity. We analyzed survival curves for case and control subjects by the Kaplan-Meier method and compared them using the log-rank test. We assessed the assumption of proportional hazards with graphical and goodness-of-fit (GOF) approaches [29] . We considered ties when using Cox proportional hazards with the Breslow method [29] . Adjustments were made for sex, age, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, body temperature > 37.5°C, pneumonia, hypoxemia and bacterial superinfection. Selection of covariates for the model building was based on clinical relevance and availability. The candidate variables for adjusting were sex, age, resident of long-term care facilities, COPD, high body temperature, pneumonia, bacterial superinfection, hypoxemia, and PSI score. All statistical analyses were performed using IBM SPSS V.21.0 (SPSS Version 23 for Microsoft Windows, IBM, Armonk, NY).

RSV seasonal peaks occurred during January in 2013, December in 2014, and January in 2015 (Fig. 2) . The influenza season was defined as period between January and April, and was determined based on the weekly surveillance reports for influenza and other respiratory viruses prepared by the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

RSV infection was diagnosed in 87 adult patients (54 A and 33 B), and influenza infection, in 312 adult patients (244 A and 68 B), during the 3-year study period. The percentage test positivity rates during this period were 2.3% and 8.3% for RSV infection and influenza, respectively among all patients tested with respiratory viruses multiplex PCR.

The average age of RSV-infected patients was older than that of influenza patients (70 and 62 years, respectively) ( Table 1) . RSV patients were more likely to be residents of a long-term care facility or to have COPD, pneumonia, or respiratory bacterial superinfection. Hypoxemia was more frequent and body temperature > 37.5°C was less common in RSV patients than in influenza patients (Table 1) . Oseltamivir was prescribed for 248 influenza patients (79.4%). Mechanical ventilation was used for 3 patients (3.4%) with RSV infection, and for 7 patients (2.2%) with influenza. Mean PSI score was 21 points higher in RSV infection (107.5) than influenza (86.5).

All-cause 20-day mortality rates were higher in RSV patients than in influenza patients (18.4 and 6.7%, respectively) (Fig. 3) .

After adjusting for potential confounders and comorbidities, the hazard ratio (HR) (2.32; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.17-4.58) of 20-day all-cause mortality was significantly higher for RSV than influenza ( Table 2 ).

Eighty percent of influenza virus infected patients were treated with oseltamivir (n = 247), while the other 20% of these patients were not prescribed oseltamivir (n = 65). They were less likely to be treated with oseltamivir if diabetic, otherwise similar groups (Table 3) . Oseltamivirtreated patients had no significant difference in mortality than the patients not treated with oseltamivir did; the 20-day all-cause mortality rates were 6.4% and 7.6%, respectively (P = 0.72, Fig. 4 ).

This study showed that all-cause mortality within 20 days after hospital admission was higher in patients with RSV infection (18.4%) than in those with influenza (6.7%) and adjusted hazard ratio (RSV vs. influenza) was 2.32 (95% CI, 1.17-4.58). However, oseltamivir had no significant effect on mortality in patients with influenza.

Previous epidemiologic study and retrospective cohort suggested the mortality rates related to RSV infection in the elderly was estimated 2-17% [12, [30] [31] [32] [33] . The varying mortality rates related with RSV infection might be explained by high viral load and severity of infection [32, 33] . In this study, the high PSI score in RSV infection might represent the severity of infection, which may partly explain the higher mortality from RSV infection in the current study than previously reported.

RSV infection is a significant cause of death in infants less than 12 months of age [34, 35] . The serious problem of RSV was underestimated in elderly individuals until the 1970s [36] . Epidemiologic studies revealed that the RSV infection, like influenza infection, is also a significant cause of death or morbidity in elderly individuals [17, [37] [38] [39] [40] . However, the risk of mortality with RSV infection in the presence of comorbidities or confounders has not been explored well. In the present study showed RSV infection was an independent risk factor for mortality adjusting variables. Although RSV data was based on both antigen detection and viral isolation methods [17] , only antigen detection tests were used in the surveillance report since 2008 [41] . In addition to RSV, real-time PCR for detection of influenza viruses was implemented in the 2000's [42] [43] [44] . Since realtime PCR is more sensitive than antigen detection or virus isolation [45] , there may be a difference in the description of the epidemiology between the pre-and post-PCR time periods. Thus, detecting methods may influence on virus epidemiology. Therefore, it would not be reasonable for direct comparison between previous epidemiologic studies and the present study.

Oseltamivir therapy showed effectiveness on reducing mortality in influenza infection [22] [23] [24] . However, there are still controversies about the effect of oseltamivir on the outcome of influenza-infected patients [21, 25] . In the present study, oseltamivir was prescribed in almost 80% of influenza infection cases. Although the difference in mortality rates failed to reach statistical significance, there was a trend towards influenza-infected patients treated with oseltamivir having a lower mortality rate than influenza-infected patients who were not treated with oseltamivir. We suspect that oseltamivir may partly contribute to the difference in mortality rates between RSV and influenza infection cases in the present study. Our study showed that in adult patients, RSV infections can also cause pneumonia, resulting in respiratory failure in a higher proportion than seasonal influenza. RSV is the most significant cause of lower respiratory tract infections in infants and young children [46] and is known to be a significant cause of severe acute respiratory infections in elderly people [11, 47] . In our study, pneumonia was diagnosed in 39.1% patients. In 1984, similar results were observed in a nursing home for elderly during an outbreak of RSV infection [48] .

In the present study, patients with RSV infection exhibited lower body temperature more frequently than patients with influenza did. In 2007, Walsh et al. [49] also reported that RSV infections were more commonly associated with lower temperature than influenza, and a greater proportion of RSV patients The variables, resident of long-term care facilities and pneumonia severity index score, were not included due to collinearity RSV respiratory syncytial virus, COPD chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, HR hazard ratio, CI confidence interval. Hazard ratios were calculated using a Cox Proportional hazards regression model [39] in 1995 and Dowell et al. [47] in 1996. The PSI was developed as a clinical prediction tool to guide doctors in deciding between inpatient or outpatient treatment of pneumonia patients [26] . Viral pneumonia may not be detected using simple chest radiography; however, ground glass opacity can be identified using chest computed tomography. Furthermore, RSV and influenza infection may have a significant impact on vital signs, as well as on laboratory findings. In the present study, the PSI score was significantly higher in RSV infection cases than in influenza cases by 21 points. We speculate that RSV infection may result in a more serious inflammatory response than influenza infection.

Although RSV infection accounted for only 2% of all adult respiratory viral infections in the present study, RSV infection should not be regarded as insignificant. If patients are suspected of having RSV infection, a prompt test for the respiratory virus should be the first step towards confirming diagnosis and treating patients. In addition to performing the test, the result should be made available quickly. Identification of the virus, as well as patients who are at a high risk of death, would help in prescribing antiviral therapies appropriately. Recent advances in the development of antiviral therapies for RSV are promising [50, 51] , ensuring more options for treating RSV infections in the near future. If an effective vaccine for RSV becomes available, it would be prudent to target high prevalent groups, such as nursing home residents.

This study has several limitations. First, the absence of RSV or influenza in the nasopharynx does not exclude the presence of RSV or influenza in the lower respiratory tract. Thus, the results may underestimate RSV infection or influenza in lower respiratory tract infection. However, it was unlikely to affect the HR estimates. Second, we did not take into consideration vaccination against influenza, which may have reduced the impact of influenza illness. Third, data were retrospectively collected. Missing data and inadequate documentation including time to start medication may have resulted in biases in the study analysis. Fourth, there is a need for validation of the results with extended hospitals because of limited sources of the patients.

Our study showed that although RSV was detected less frequently in hospitalized adult patients, it was associated with a significantly higher risk of 20-day all-cause mortality than seasonal influenza.

Viruses causing lower respiratory symptoms in young children: findings from the ORChID birth cohort Respiratory infection,"Introduction Viral acute respiratory infections (ARIs) cause substantial child morbidity. Sensitive molecularbased assays aid virus detection, but the clinical significance of positive tests remains uncertain as some viruses may be found in both acutely ill and healthy children. We describe disease-pathogen associations of respiratory viruses and quantify virus-specific attributable risk of ARIs in healthy children during the first 2 years of life. Methods One hundred fifty-eight term newborn babies in Brisbane, Australia, were recruited progressively into a longitudinal, community-based, birth cohort study conducted between September 2010 and October 2014. A daily tick-box diary captured predefined respiratory symptoms from birth until their second birthday. Weekly parent-collected nasal swabs were batch-tested for 17 respiratory viruses by PCR assays, allowing calculation of virus-specific attributable fractions in the exposed (AFE) to determine the proportion of virus-positive children whose ARI symptoms could be attributed to that particular virus. Results Of 8100 nasal swabs analysed, 2646 (32.7%) were virus-positive (275 virus codetections, 3.4%), with human rhinoviruses accounting for 2058/2646 (77.8%) positive swabs. Viruses were detected in 1154/1530 (75.4%) ARI episodes and in 984/4308 (22.8%) swabs from asymptomatic periods. Respiratory syncytial virus (AFE: 68% (95% CI 45% to 82%)) and human metapneumovirus (AFE: 69% (95% CI 43% to 83%)) were strongly associated with higher risk of lower respiratory symptoms. Discussion The strong association of respiratory syncytial virus and human metapneumovirus with ARIs and lower respiratory symptoms in young children managed within the community indicates successful development of vaccines against these two viruses should provide substantial health benefits.","Viral acute respiratory infections (ARIs) are a common cause of morbidity in children, either on their own or in synergy with bacterial pathogens. 1 Virus-positive ARIs early in life are associated with developing wheeze and asthma during childhood and adolescence. 2 Community-based studies from the 1950s to 1960s examining the aetiology of ARIs by traditional laboratory detection methods remain the template for understanding childhood respiratory virus epidemiology. 3 Advances in molecular diagnostics, including PCR testing, have improved virus detection in those with ARIs. 4 However, this increased test sensitivity has also resulted in viruses being detected in asymptomatic individuals. 4 5 The clinical significance of finding respiratory viruses is not always straightforward, and a better understanding of the proportion of infections that are symptomatic for individual viruses is needed.

The attributable fraction in the exposed (AFE) provides information about the percentage of cases among exposed individuals that can be attributed to the exposure. In our study, the AFE measures the percentage of ARIs in virus-positive children attributable to that particular virus. The AFE does not inform on the aetiology at an individual level, but is a key population-level metric for interpreting positive specimen results. It assists with estimation of the true burden of disease, thus guiding preventative strategies for respiratory infections, such as immunisation. Virus-specific AFE estimates for ARI in children are reported infrequently, with most studies reporting AFEs having important methodological limitations. Except for one community

What is the key question?

► What is the attributable risk for symptoms of acute respiratory infections (ARIs) when specific respiratory viruses are detected by PCR assays in nasal swab samples collected weekly from otherwise healthy young children?

► Attribution for ARIs by specific viruses was strongest for respiratory syncytial virus and human metapneumovirus in young children with lower respiratory tract infections, while among DNA viruses tested, only adenoviruses were significantly associated with an increased risk of symptoms.

► The virus-specific attributable risk of ARIs is a population-level metric to inform causal inference in the aetiology of ARIs and provides quantitative estimates of the relative proportions of virus-associated ARIs in the community, yielding important insights for prioritising public health interventions.

study, 5 these investigations recruited either highly selected hospitalised children or outpatients as study cases, [6] [7] [8] or used controls from outpatient clinics. 6 7 A meta-analysis of 23 studies that calculated virus-specific AFEs included 22 studies employing hospital-based case ascertainment and only three using community-based controls. 9 Other studies comparing symptomatic and asymptomatic groups calculated odds ratios (ORs), [10] [11] [12] or relative risks, 13 without calculating AFEs. Moreover, several studies focused solely either on specific viruses 10 12 or outcomes. 6 11-13 Longitudinal, community-based studies employing sensitive molecular-based assays with regular and frequent sampling, irrespective of illness, are best suited to explore the relationship between respiratory virus detections and ARI symptoms, especially as they represent most ARI episodes. The aim of our study was to examine the disease-pathogen associations of respiratory viruses in infants participating in a community-based birth cohort project 14 and to calculate their virus-specific AFE values.

The Observational Research in Childhood Infectious Diseases (ORChID) project ( clinicaltrials. gov: NCT01304914) is an observational, longitudinal community-based birth cohort study of ARI episodes in children until their second birthday. 14 Participants were able to leave the study temporarily (such as during family holidays) and rejoin at a later date. It was conducted in the subtropical city of Brisbane, Australia (latitude 27° South, average monthly maximum temperature range 22°C-30°C, maximum rainfall in December-February, population 2.2 million) between September 2010 and October 2014. Parents consented antenatally for their child's participation. For enrolment, infants needed to be healthy, without congenital abnormalities or underlying chronic disorders, and to be born at term (36-42 weeks). Recruitment was progressive over 2 years at one of two metropolitan hospitals (one private and one government-funded). Detailed methods of recruitment, study design and sample and data collection are described elsewhere. 14 The Children's Health Queensland, Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital, and The University of Queensland Human Research Ethics Committees approved the study.

Following recruitment, parents provided their sociodemographic and health history, pregnancy and birth details. Telephone interviews were conducted every 3 months to update immunisation, feeding and childcare attendance details. Childcare was categorised as formal (regulated care outside the child's home) or informal (non-regulated care provided by family or friends). 15 The duration of exclusive breast feeding was from birth to the introduction of either any milk formula or solids.

Parents were trained to recognise respiratory symptoms and provided with diary cards designed in a tick-box format and listed with predefined respiratory symptoms or diagnoses to be completed daily and returned by regular mail monthly. The diary cards were modified from a prior study 16 and used successfully elsewhere. 17

Viruses were identified from parent-collected anterior nose swabs at the infant's birth, and weekly thereafter. 18 Specimens were mailed to the laboratory, taking a median of 3 (IQR 2-4) days, and where they were processed and stored at −80°C until further analysis. 14 19 Swabs were batch-tested for 17 respiratory viruses: human rhinovirus (HRV), influenza A and B (IFV-A, IFV-B), respiratory syncytial virus A and B (RSV-A, RSV-B), parainfluenza viruses 1-3 (PIV-1, PIV-2, PIV-3), human coronaviruses (HCoV) OC43, NL63, 229E and HKU1, human metapneumovirus (HMPV), adenovirus (AdV), human polyomaviruses WU (WU-PyV) and KI (KI-PyV) and human bocavirus-1 (HBoV-1), using previously validated real-time PCR assays. 14 Details of sample collection, processing, PCR assay parameters, quality control measures and HRV typing into species A, B  and C are outlined in the online supplementary text and E-table  1 . Specimen quality was assessed by testing for a marker of human genomic DNA, endogenous retrovirus-3 (ERV-3). 20 Swabs with ERV-3 cycle-threshold (Ct) values >38 (including undetectable Ct values) were deemed to be of lesser quality and excluded from parts of the analysis. 21

New virus detection episode When a new virus (different virus or new species/subtype of the same genus or species, respectively) was detected in a swab by PCR testing, or the same virus was detected after at least two negative intervening swabs, or the same virus was detected at least 30 days from the last positive swab.

When symptoms were reported 7 days before or 7 days after detecting a new virus.

ARI was defined as a new episode of respiratory symptoms of the upper and/or lower respiratory tracts demarcated by a window of ≥3 symptom-free days. 17 22 Upper respiratory tract infection Parent-reported runny nose/nasal congestion, dry cough or doctor-diagnosed otitis media. 22 

Parent-reported rattly breathing, moist cough, shortness of breath, wheeze or doctor-diagnosed pneumonia. 22 ARIs were subcategorised hierarchically as either a lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) or upper respiratory tract infection (URTI), respectively.

The incidence rate of single new virus detection episodes (VDEs) per 100 child-years was calculated using Poisson regression. To account analytically for the differing lengths of time children remained in the study, the natural logarithm of the number of swabs returned was included in the model as an offset. Swabs were removed from incidence rate calculations for individual viruses when the participant was not at risk of a new VDE (a positive consecutive swab following the initial positive swab, and two swabs after the last positive swab, as per our definition of a new VDE), or the swabs were of lesser quality (to avoid underestimating incidence rates). 21 When calculating incidence rates for 'any virus', we assumed children were at risk of being positive for new viruses in every swab.

The virus-specific risk and AFE of single VDEs in cases of ARI and LRTI were estimated using a generalised linear model with binomial family and log link. Robust variance estimates were calculated using sandwich estimators to account for repeated measures within children. We analysed LRTIs separately as children with these infections are more likely to visit family physicians, present to hospital and receive antibiotics. 22 The AFE was The association between potential risk factors (age, sex, type of delivery, gestational age at birth, season, family history of asthma or eczema, tobacco smoke exposure, household size, maternal education status, mode of feeding, category of childcare attendance) and symptomatic and asymptomatic virus detection was examined using mixed-effects logistic regression with the child entered as a random effect to account for repeated measurements within children. Both univariable and multivariable analyses were conducted. Breast feeding and childcare attendance were analysed as timevarying variables. Multivariable models included all the above risk factors with no forward or backward selection. Only virus-negative Table 2 Respiratory viruses detected in 8100 high-quality nasal swabs collected from 157 infants from the Observational Research in Childhood Infectious Diseases (ORChID) birth cohort in the first 2 years of life. Incidence rates/100 child-years presented overall, and for the first and second years of life separately 

Of 891 potential participants approached, 165 (18.5%) eligible singleton infants from 163 families were enrolled (two families enrolled two siblings) (figure 1). Seven were excluded subsequently; one from ineligibility (born <36 weeks) and six for failing to provide any swabs. 

When calculating incidence rates, of the 11 192 total swabs submitted by all children, 3025 (27.2%) lesser-quality swabs (346 virus-positive and 2679 virus-negative) were removed from the analyses, as were 67 swabs submitted after the child's second birthday, leaving 8100 swabs from 157 infants (figure 1). Overall, 

When considering virus-positive ARIs and asymptomatic episodes, we retained 346 virus-positive swabs with ERV-3 Ct values >38, but removed a further 244 swabs with missing symptom data, to give a final dataset of 8202 swabs from 151 participants (3 participants submitted swabs of high or no Ct values or swabs with no corresponding symptom data before withdrawing early in the study) (tables 3-5).

Of 8202 swabs, 3894 (47.5%) were taken during symptomatic periods and 4308 (52.5%) from asymptomatic periods. Of all swabs taken any time during symptomatic periods, 1903/3894 (48.9%) were positive for a virus, and 1120/3894 (28.8%) were new VDEs. Overall, 984/4308 (22.8%) swabs taken during asymptomatic periods were positive for a virus, of which 562 (57.1%) were new VDEs and 491/562 (87.4%) were new single virus detections (tables 3 and 4). Table 3 shows that for new VDEs involving only single viruses, HRV-A, HRV-C, IFV-A, PIV-3, RSV-A, RSV-B, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, HMPV, and AdV had statistically significant, positive AFE values, indicating they were significantly more often associated with ARI episodes than asymptomatic periods. In Table 4 Lower respiratory tract infections and asymptomatic single new virus detections, risk ratios and attributable fractions by respiratory virus in 151 children from the ORChID birth cohort (n=5267 swabs) Continued contrast, HCoV-229E, HCoV-HKU1, WU-PyV, KI-PyV, and HBoV-1 were frequently detected in asymptomatic periods and had low point estimates for AFE, indicating they were less likely to have caused the ARI. Of the total 1641 ARIs, 111 (6.8%) did not have swabs submitted during the ARI episode, including swabs taken 7 days before or 7 days after the last day of the illness. Of the remaining 1530 ARIs, 1154 (75.4%) ARIs (935 (81%) URTI, 219 (19.0%) LRTI) had ≥1 swabs with a virus detected during this period.

RSV and HMPV were more strongly associated with LRTI than asymptomatic detections (table 4), with higher risk ratios than other viruses. While significant, the association between LRTI and HRV-C, HCoV-OC43 and PIV-3 detection was weaker. Interestingly, codetected specimens had among the strongest AFE values for both ARIs and LRTIs (tables 3 and 4), with HRV the most frequently detected virus group, usually in combination with DNA viruses (see online supplementary E-table 3).

To investigate the sensitivity of results from including lesser quality swabs, we reanalysed the data by excluding 346 virus-positive swabs of lesser quality, and found minimal change to the AFEs calculated in tables 3 and 4 (see online supplementary E-table 2).

Independent risk factors associated with symptomatic rather than asymptomatic VDEs, included increasing age, particularly after 6 months, and virus infections during non-summer seasons (table 5 ). The regression model revealed childcare attendance was also independently associated with higher rates of VDEs, both symptomatic and asymptomatic, but no other risk factors were found to be associated with asymptomatic VDEs.

Healthy children in the ORChID community-based birth cohort experienced an incidence rate of 978 new VDEs per 100 childyears during the first 2 years of life, with HRV playing a dominant role. Overall, respiratory viruses were detected by PCR in regular weekly swabs at least once during 75% of ARIs, while in asymptomatic periods 23% of weekly nasal swabs were positive by PCR for respiratory viruses, accounting for 33% of all new VDEs. We demonstrated evidence of attribution for ARIs by RNA viruses, which included HRV (HRV-A, HRV-C), influenza (IFV-A), parainfluenza (PIV-1, PIV-3), RSV (RSV-A, RSV-B), HCoV (HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63) and HMPV; and AdV as the single DNA virus representative. All these viruses were detected significantly more often in children with an ARI than during asymptomatic periods and had statistically significant positive AFEs. The largest association was observed for RSV and HMPV, both of which were more strongly associated with LRTIs than other respiratory viruses. Increasing age ≥6 months, non-summer months and childcare attendance were independent risk factors for symptomatic VDEs. Age as a host risk factor for symptomatic infection is also noted in other studies, 23 and is presumably due to protection afforded by maternal transplacental and breastmilk antibodies in the very young. 24 Environmental risk factors of season and childcare attendance for ARIs may be related to the intensity and opportunity for exposure in these settings experienced by young children. 10 

The virus-specific attribution of ARIs was quantified by identifying VDEs during asymptomatic periods and calculating the virus-specific AFE, an infrequently reported metric for helping to determine the relative causal roles of different viruses at a population level. A limitation of the AFE approach is that it cannot inform on the aetiology at an individual level: in individual cases it does not differentiate between those with a true positive test identifying the virus responsible for the ARI and those with a false positive result from asymptomatic virus shedding. Nevertheless, knowing the AFE for respiratory viruses can help inform clinicians on the likely clinical significance of detecting one or more viruses in nasal swab specimens taken from infants or young children during an ARI episode, by assigning the group aetiological fraction for viruses detected in that child. Importantly, AFE estimates can be applied to studies of ARIs in different settings to estimate the true burden of disease in the community, thus informing which viruses should be prioritised in future public health policies and interventions.

Most previous studies have overestimated AFE values by using ORs, rather than RRs, in calculations. 5 6 8 9 ORs overestimate the effect size when the event is not rare, as occurs with ARIs in children. These studies are principally cross-sectional, hospital-based and often have poorly matched controls. Consequently, our estimates of AFE being lower than reported elsewhere is not surprising, and, we believe, are likely to provide more accurate estimates of the ARI and LRTI burden attributable to these viruses in the broader paediatric population.

The proportion of asymptomatic infections in our study highlights the risks of extrapolating hospital-based data from sick children to the community setting. Previously, the significance of detecting viruses by PCR was tempered by concerns that this may be from an incubating or unrelated subclinical infection or represent continued virus nucleic acid shedding from a recent ARI that has resolved. The intensive longitudinal specimen and symptom sampling from our cohort, as well as the definitions of VDEs and symptomatic VDEs used, helped identify nascent and subclinical infections. In this context, our observations emphasise the frequency of subclinical infections by respiratory viruses in young children, who when otherwise well, may act as important 'silent' reservoirs of infection. Similar observations and conclusions were reported recently in a household study involving both child and adult contacts of symptomatic cases of laboratory-confirmed influenza. 26 Nevertheless, in addition to influenza, established viruses, such as HRV, PIV-3, RSV, and HMPV are also important community respiratory pathogens, especially the latter two viruses, and potential candidates for vaccine and other therapeutic interventions. 27 This contrasts with the novel DNA viruses, HPyVs and HBoV-1, which have low AFEs calculated for both ARIs and LRTIs, despite their higher detection rates. 28 29 However, as suggested by this cohort, synergy may exist between multiple viruses causing ARIs. Unexpectedly, this involved mostly HRV and DNA viruses, and this finding warrants further study.

The 78% of expected child-days and 68% of expected swab returns was a very good retention rate given the intensive and prolonged nature of the study for participating families. Analysis of incidence rates of ARI in participants that withdrew from the study at different periods showed no clear association between time of dropout and ARI incidence. Regular parent-collected nasal swabs avoids the need for home visits by research staff or clinic attendance during an ARI, minimising possible biased estimates of ARI events and specimen availability from losing families failing to seek healthcare. Moreover, regular weekly nasal swab collections increase the likelihood of virus detections during an ARI episode rather than relying simply on results from a single specimen. Our previous work found that with sensitive PCR techniques, parent-collected nose or nose-throat swabs sent to the laboratory by standard mail had comparable sensitivity to nasopharyngeal swabs obtained by healthcare workers. 18 19 30 Longitudinal data collection also allows assessment of asymptomatic status by considering past and future illness history, as some viruses are detectable days before and after ARI symptoms develop, 31 and are therefore less likely to yield false-positive findings.

There are also some important limitations to consider. To reduce the chances of false-negative test results, 21 we excluded from analysis 2679 (23.9%) swabs where the internal control for human DNA, ERV-3, was either undetected or present at very low levels. We excluded both virus-positive and virus-negative swabs to avoid overestimating our incidence and prevalence rates. In addition, some viruses were detected rarely, in particular influenza, a finding reflected in other community studies, 17 but nevertheless limiting our ability to provide precise AFE estimates for these agents. We also excluded codetections in individual virus assessments as multiple aetiological agents make individual contributions of each agent difficult to ascertain, but analysed them separately to look at the association patterns of individual viruses. Symptom information, other than doctor-diagnosed otitis media and pneumonia, captured by daily diaries was not validated. To maximise accuracy, parents were trained to recognise symptoms before commencing the study. While healthcare worker-validated symptoms would be ideal, a study of this scale is logistically challenging without parent participation. This study design has been used previously 18 and with others have shown that parents can be trained to recognise symptoms of interest, 18 often as reliably as healthcare professionals. 32 33 Our rates of ARI, including those associated with wheeze, are comparable with other community studies. 34 35 Finally, as is common for these types of studies, families in our cohort were from more advantaged backgrounds and ARI episodes were predominantly of a mild-to-moderate nature. 22 While many children in our study were first-born and from advantaged families, factors thought to decrease the rate of ARIs, secular changes in Australia have led to an increased proportion of children from these families attending childcare at an earlier age than other sectors of the population. A slightly higher proportion (80%-85%) of our cohort attended some form of care by the age of 15-24 months, compared with 74% of children in the Australian population, with childcare attendance an independent risk factor for ARIs. 25 Moreover, the incidence of ARIs in the ORChID cohort 22 is comparable to other reports in this age group 34 36 37 and RSV and HRV-associated ARIs approximate other community-based studies conducted in more temperate climates of Australia (Perth) and Europe. [38] [39] [40] Our findings for this cohort remain valid and provide important estimates on community respiratory virus exposures and ARIs in Australian children in a subtropical, urban setting.

Respiratory viruses, particularly HRV, were detected with remarkable frequency in healthy Australian children in the first 2 years of life, with at least one-third of new VDEs unaccompanied by symptoms. With molecular methods used increasingly to detect respiratory viruses in young children, our study provides insights into supporting attribution for virus-specific ARIs in this age group managed within the community. The established RNA respiratory viruses and AdV were more strongly associated with symptomatic than asymptomatic infections, while no such associations were found for the newly described DNA viruses, HPyVs and HBoV-1. These data emphasise the high community levels of HRV circulating among children. Importantly, they also provide evidence to suggest that the current clinical trials of candidate RSV and HMPV vaccines seeking to protect infants against severe disease and hospitalisation might also deliver substantial health benefits for all young children within the community. 27 Correction notice This article has been corrected since it was published Online First.

Statins May Decrease the Fatality Rate of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Infection,Citation Yuan S. 2015. Statins may decrease the fatality rate of Middle East respiratory syndrome infection. mBio 6(4):e01120-15.,"T he recent paper by Totura and colleagues (1) revealed that Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) signaling contributes to a protective innate immune response to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) infection. Despite the importance of SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV) as public health threats, there are currently no drugs available to treat these coronaviruses, with current evidence suggesting that the antiviral drugs ribavirin and interferon (IFN) are only slightly efficacious in ameliorating SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV infections (2) . Now human-to-human infections of MERS-CoV are more frequently reported, with a total case fatality rate of 37.7% (2). Therefore, a feasible but effective treatment is needed urgently, especially treatment with FDA-approved drugs, including some over-the-counter (OTC) drugs.

Like avian influenza viruses (AIVs), MERS-CoVs set off a cytokine storm (3), which is likely to lead to the subsequent acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Therefore, some immunomodulatory therapies were suggested for respiratory virus infections, such as celecoxib, mesalamine, cyclosporine, and the TLR4 antagonist eritoran (4). TLRs play a critical role in the recognition of pathogens and induction of the innate immune response to many viruses. The TLR3 agonist poly(I·C) and the TLR4 agonist lipopolysaccharide (LPS) are protective against SARS-CoV infection in mice (1). TLR4 Ϫ/Ϫ mice are resistant to acute lung injury via AIV infections (5) . However, TLR4 Ϫ/Ϫ mice have significantly more disease resulting from SARS-CoV infection than wild-type mice (1). The protective signaling via TLR4 pathways may be a unique feature in the pathogenesis of coronaviruses compared to other respiratory pathogens, such as influenza viruses (1) .

Despite the opposite functions of TLR4s in AIV and SARS-CoV infections, MYD88 (myeloid differentiation primary response 88; downstream of TLRs) plays an important role in the survival of respiratory virus infections (Fig. 1) . The MYD88 gene was observed to be highly induced by SARS-CoV infection (1). Interestingly, either excessive expression of MYD88 (1) or a deficiency in MYD88 expression (6) resulted in high mortality rates after MERS-CoV infections, implying that a balanced immune response is crucial for survival of respiratory virus infections.

Downstream of TLR-MYD88 pathways, activation of NF-B is a hallmark of coronavirus infections, and inhibition of NF-B reduced lung infection and significantly increased mouse survival after SARS-CoV infection (7) .

Among TLR-MYD88 antagonists, statins are the most common FDA-approved drugs (atorvastatin will be sold as an OTC drug). Statins do not affect the MYD88 level significantly under normal conditions but maintain (stabilized) MYD88 at the normal level during hypoxia or after hydrogen peroxide treatments (8, 9) . Furthermore, atorvastatin at 10 M significantly attenuated NF-B activation within 24 h, whereas at lower doses of 0.1 and 1 M, the treatment time had to be prolonged for up to 48 h for a significant inhibition to occur (10) . Thus, an early and high dose of a statin (such as a single dose of 40 mg atorvastatin per day, equaling a 0.1 M plasma concentration) might be an idea for treatment of MERS-CoV infections. Given that 3-to 10-timeshigher levels of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines were observed after MERS-CoV infection than after no infection (3), statins may not be very effective for late-stage patients. Timely administration of statins may be crucial to surviving MERS-CoV infection.

Human Metapneumovirus Infection in Jordanian Children: Epidemiology and Risk Factors for Severe Disease,Background-Human metapneumovirus (HMPV) is a leading cause of acute respiratory tract infection (ARTI) in young children. Our objectives were to define HMPV epidemiology and circulating strains and determine markers of severe disease in Jordanian children.,"Human metapneumovirus (HMPV) is a leading cause of acute respiratory tract infection, and the incidence of hospitalization is highest in young children. 1 Prevalence varies from year-to-year, and the four subgroups (A1, A2, B1, and B2) circulate unpredictably, even within similar geographic regions. [2] [3] [4] HMPV reports from the Middle East have primarily consisted of retrospective or single-year prospective studies; therefore, the true prevalence and characteristics of HMPV in Middle Eastern children are not well described. [5] [6] [7] Given the emergence of Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) virus in this region, prospective surveillance studies are important for understanding the etiology and epidemiology of viral respiratory illnesses. [8] [9] [10] No vaccines or therapeutics are currently licensed for HMPV, but recent studies have identified potential vaccine candidates and monoclonal antibodies to prevent and treat severe disease. 11, 12 Therefore, recognizing at-risk populations and markers of disease severity could help target the use of these agents. Reports of such populations have been conflicting and were conducted mostly in high-income countries. Hospitalization in HMPV-infected children has been linked to age <6 months, viral load, and household crowding. 13, 14 Female sex, prematurity, and presence of a chronic medical condition were also associated with severe disease. 14, 15 Approximately 40% of US children hospitalized with HMPV have underlying medical conditions, 1 and viral load is not consistently a predictor of severe disease. 16, 17 Whether one HMPV subgroup causes more severe disease also remains undetermined, with conflicting data. 18, 14, 19, 20, 21 Viral co-infections in children are common and may increase the likelihood of hospitalization. [22] [23] [24] The relationship between single HMPV infection and co-infection has not been well described. In a small cohort of intensive care unit (ICU) patients with HMPV, children with multiple viral pathogens did not have increased mortality. 15 Some studies reported that children with both HMPV and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) had more severe disease, 25, 26 but this relationship has not been upheld. 27 A major limitation of these studies is sample size and retrospective design. enrollment, and had to have fever and/or respiratory symptoms with one or more of the following admission diagnoses: acute respiratory illness, apnea, asthma exacerbation, bronchiolitis, bronchopneumonia, croup, cystic fibrosis exacerbation, febrile seizure, fever without localizing signs, pharyngitis, pneumonia, pneumonitis, pertussis, pertussis-like cough, respiratory distress, rule-out sepsis, or upper respiratory infection. Exclusion criteria were children ≥2 years, not enrolled within 48 hours, children with fever and neutropenia, and newborns who never left the hospital. Subjects could be included more than once during the study period for a new illness. The Institutional Review Boards of Vanderbilt University, Jordan University, and the Jordanian Ministry of Health approved the study. Written consent and clinical/demographic data were obtained from parents/guardians. Missing data and length of stay were obtained from medical records.

To better understand the role of HMPV in pediatric lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI), we identified a sub-cohort of children. The LRTI cohort consisted of children with an admission diagnosis of asthma, bronchiolitis, bronchopneumonia, pneumonia, respiratory distress, or wheezing; or clinical signs of retractions or accessory muscle use; or wheezing on examination. We also characterized the group of children who did not present with lower respiratory tract disease.

Nasal and throat swabs were collected, placed into lysis buffer, aliquoted, and frozen at −80°C. Specimen aliquots were shipped to Vanderbilt for viral testing. Nucleic acids were extracted on a MagMax-96 express automated instrument (ABI) using the MagMax 96 Viral RNA kit (ABI). Individual quantitative RT-PCR reactions were run on a Step One Plus (ABI) using the AgPath-ID RT-PCR kit (ABI). Primers and dual-labeled probes were used to detect HMPV, 28 respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), 29 rhinovirus (HRV), 30 influenza A and B, 31 adenovirus, 29 and parainfluenza viruses 1, 2, 3 (PIV1-3) (unpublished data). Specimens testing positive for HMPV were genotyped by RT-PCR to amplify a 227nt portion of the N gene. Primers were: for 5′-CTCTTCAAGGGATTCACC-3′ and rev 5′-TGGCATARCTTTCTGCTG-3′. Amplicons were PCR purified, directly sequenced, aligned with N sequences from prototype subgroup strains 32 and GenBank using MacVector 12.0 (MacVector), and subgroup genotypes assigned. The evolutionary history was inferred by using the Maximum Likelihood method based on the Tamura-Nei model 33 using MEGA6. 34

Descriptive statistics are reported as total number and percentage or median and interquartile range (IQR). Categorical variables were compared between groups using χ 2 test or Fisher's exact test. Continuous variables were compared by Mann-Whitney U test or Kruskal-Wallis test with adjustment for multiple comparisons. Significant and near significant variables (P<0.10) from univariate analysis were used in a multivariate logistic regression model. A type I error rate of a=0.05 was used throughout, unless otherwise specified. Statistical analysis was carried out in IBM SPSS Statistics (version 22.0) and R (version 3.1.1). 35 We used a Bayesian hierarchical model to derive population prevalence estimates for each of the three years of the study. 36 Al-Bashir hospital admissions data were filtered to exclude children not residing in Amman. Estimates of the <2-year-old Jordanian population were obtained from the World Bank database and the proportion residing in Amman from the 2012 national census. 37 These values were used in a binomial model to estimate the population of children <2 years old in Amman in 2010-2012. The market share for Al-Bashir hospital was modeled as a random variable and the probability of enrollment set to 71.4% (5 of 7 days) and used in a binomial model. Prevalence was given diffuse beta (1, 5) priors for all models. Models were fitted using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods 38 in PyMC 2.3 software. 39 Models were checked for convergence using the Gelman-Rubin diagnostic 36 and for goodness-of-fit using posterior predictive checks. 40

From March 16, 2010 to March 31, 2013, 3,175 children were enrolled. Seven children were excluded: 4 were referred for meningitis, and 3 were ≥2 years at enrollment. None of the excluded children were positive for HMPV. Therefore, 3,168 children were included.

The rates of HMPV-associated hospitalization for children <2 years varied for each study year: 0.7, 3.1, and 1.2 per 1000 children for years 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Rates were higher in children <6 months each study year (1.5, 7.2, and 1.9 per 1000 children) compared to the older age groups, 6-11 months (0.9, 2.9, and 1.9 per 1000 children) and 12-23 months (0.4, 1.2, and 0.5 per 1000 children).

Of the 3,168 children included in the study, 273 (8.6%) children were positive for HMPV (Table 1) . HMPV-infected children were significantly older than children without HMPV ( Table 2) . Both groups had a slight male predominance. More HMPV-infected children were diagnosed clinically with bronchopneumonia compared with the HMPV-negative group. Bronchiolitis and pneumonia were common diagnoses in both groups. Asthma was rarely diagnosed, although this is a difficult diagnosis to make in children <2 years. Compared with the HMPV-negative group, significantly fewer HMPV-infected children were diagnosed with rule-out sepsis. A second virus was identified in 145 (53.1%) HMPV-positive children, most commonly HRV or RSV (Table 1) .

Few HMPV-positive children (9.2%) had underlying medical conditions. Most children in the cohort were full-term and had a normal birth weight. Forty-four (16%) of HMPV infected children were premature (<37 weeks), and 10 (3.7%) were very preterm (<32 weeks). Few children attended daycare; most had exposure to a household smoker. These findings were not significantly different between children with and without HMPV infection.

HMPV circulated during the winter-spring months with a February to April peak ( Figure 1 ). We were able to genotype 215 specimens (78.8%), revealing seasonal strain variation. In spring 2010, 5/13 (38%) were A2 with 8/13 (62%) B2. In 2010-2011, 60/64 (94%) were A2 and 2/64 (3%) each B1 and B2. In 2011-2012, 51/106 (48%) were A2, 4/106 (4%) B1, and 51/106 (48%) B2. In 2012-2013, 1/32 (3%) was A2, 5/32 (16%) B1, and 26/32 (81%) B2. No A1 was identified during this period. Sequencing of the N region demonstrated marked similarity of strains within subgroups (see Figure, Supplemental Digital Content 1).

In order to characterize the features of HMPV-associated LRTI, we excluded children who did not present with LRTI. Of the initial 3,169 children, 2,263 (71.4%) met criteria for LRTI. 268 (11.8%) had no virus identified on PCR, 242 (10.7%) were HMPV-positive, and 1753 (77.5%) were positive for a virus other than HMPV (Table 3) .

Cough (96.7%) and shortness of breath (79.3%) were common in children with HMPV and LRTI. Approximately 60% of children with HMPV had fever. Gastrointestinal symptoms were less frequent.

238/242 (98.3%) HMPV LRTI had a chest X-ray, and most were abnormal. Approximately 30% of HMPV LRTI children required supplemental oxygen (median, 2 days). Seven (2.9%) children required ventilation, and 2 (0.8%) children died. Median length of stay for children with HMPV was 4 days. Fewer children with HMPV required intensive care unit (ICU) stay compared with virus negative and other virus positive children; however, no significant difference in overall lengths of stay was noted.

Of the 242 children with HMPV LRTI, 127 (52.5%) were co-infected with another viral pathogen (Table 1) . Children with HMPV co-infections and LRTI did not have a statistically significant difference in their symptomatology, chest X-ray findings, need for supplementary oxygen, or need for mechanical ventilation compared to HMPV-only infection. Ten (7.9%) children with HMPV co-infections and LRTI were admitted to the ICU compared with 1 child with isolated HMPV infection (0.9%), P=0.009.

We were able to genotype 192 (79%) of 242 specimens from HMPV LRTI children. Symptoms were not significantly different between the two subgroups ( We evaluated the characteristics of HMPV LRTI children on oxygen and in the ICU. Seventy-three children required oxygen (Table 5) . Forty-two (57.5%) were male and 66 (90.4%) had no past medical history. The median gestational age was 40 weeks. Viral load, smoke exposure, and daycare were not significantly different between those who did and did not require supplemental oxygen. Children on oxygen were younger than children not on oxygen (3.9 vs. 7.0 months, P<0.001). Supplemental oxygen was required by 41/155 (26.5%) breastfed children compared with 32/85 (37.6%) of not breastfed children (P=0.07). Although HMPV co-infection overall was not significantly associated with oxygen requirement, HMPV-RSV co-infection was associated with oxygen use. Supplemental oxygen was required by 26/65 (40.0%) children with both HMPV and RSV compared with 47/175 (26.9%) with HMPV but not RSV, P=0.049.

Of the 11 children with HMPV LRTI in the ICU, 7 (64%) were male. The median age was 1.4 months. Two (18%) children had underlying medical conditions (Down syndrome with cardiac disease and Down syndrome alone). Nine (82%) children were co-infected with RSV. ICU patients had a significantly lower median HMPV viral load (2.1 log 10 copies/μL) compared with non-ICU patients (3.3 log 10 copies/μL), P=0.01. Breastfeeding was not significantly protective.

Since few children required ICU care stay, we used supplemental oxygen requirement as a surrogate for HMPV severe disease. In a multivariate model (Table 5 ), we included factors that were significant or neared significance in univariate analysis: age, HMPV subgroup, codetection of RSV, and breastfeeding. When adjusting for other factors, age <6 months and HMPV A were independent risk factors of severe disease while breastfeeding was protective. Co-infection with RSV and HMPV was not significantly associated with oxygen requirement in the model.

Of the original 273 children with HMPV infection, 31 (11.4%) did not meet criteria for LRTI. 18 were diagnosed with rule-out sepsis, and the remainder were diagnosed with paroxysmal/pertussis-like cough/pertussis (8) , upper respiratory infection (2), croup (1), febrile seizure (1), or upper respiratory infection and vasculitis (1). The median age was 2.1 months, younger than the LRTI cohort. 13 (42%) were infected with only HMPV. Of the 30 children with data available, 8 (27%) were on oxygen for a median of 3 days, and 4 (13%) were in the ICU. The median LOS was 5 days. None of these patients died.

Our study provides one of the largest prospective cohorts of HMPV disease in young children, including data from the Middle East. Similar to studies in other regions, HMPV caused a significant burden of disease in children, and rates of HMPV infection in children <6 months were higher than United States cohorts. 1 HMPV-positive children were older than HMPV-negative children. However, chronic medical conditions and prematurity were much less common in our hospitalized HMPV-positive cohort compared with other studies. 1, 14, 41 Low daycare rates and high smoke exposure were also dissimilar compared with other large studies. 41, 42 Since hospital admissions are free for children <6 years old in Jordan, this may explain the high percentage of healthy children being admitted. With around 40% of all children <6 months of age, the threshold to admit younger children may be lower than highincome countries. Thus, our cohort of young Jordanian children is unique in that many previously described risk factors for viral LRTI are present at lower rates, and the majority of children hospitalized were full-term and otherwise healthy.

Circulating subgroups identified from Jordanian children are similar to recent studies, with predominance of A2, B1, and B2 with yearly variability. 2 A1 was not detected, and this genotype has not been recently identified in other geographic locations. 43 In contrast, A2 has been the predominant subgroup in other recent studies worldwide. [43] [44] [45] Although we only sequenced part of the N gene, there was little variability within subgroups, suggesting the predominance of few circulating strains.

Viral respiratory co-infection in young children is common. In children with multiple viral infections, it can be difficult to discern which virus is contributing to symptoms or whether interplay between the two viruses occurs. In children with LRTI, we detected no differences in symptoms or disease severity other than ICU stay in children with HMPV single versus co-infection. In univariate analysis, HMPV-RSV co-infection was associated with an increased risk for supplemental oxygen, but this association did not reach significance in multivariate analysis. A previous pilot study in this region found a trend toward increased oxygen usage and ICU admission in HMPV-RSV co-infection. 5 Since children with RSV are typically younger than children with HMPV, 46 age may be a confounding factor in previous reports of HMPV-RSV causing more severe disease.

Symptomatology between HMPV A and B was similar. However, children with HMPV A were more likely to require supplemental oxygen, suggesting that HMPV A may cause more severe disease. Other studies have suggested that genotype B was associated with a higher clinical score 19 or disease severity. 14 However, our study included a considerably larger number of subjects. Significantly more HMPV B children were co-infected with other viruses, which may be related to the years that HMPV B was circulating. Further research is needed to validate our findings.

Approximately 30% of children in our cohort required supplemental oxygen, which we used as a surrogate for severity. In a multivariate regression model, HMPV A independently predicted oxygen requirement, but co-infection with RSV did not. Previously established factors such as young age were independently associated with disease severity. However, prematurity, daycare, and smoke exposure were not associated with severe disease, and breastfeeding was not protective. Prematurity and daycare are underrepresented factors in this population, highlighting that factors contributing to severe disease differ substantially between geographic and developing regions. We did not find an association with viral load and disease severity, which corroborates some studies. 16, 17 Interestingly, viral load was significantly lower in the ICU group, the majority of whom (81%) were co-infected with RSV. Young age and RSV co-infection may have contributed to severity in the ICU subjects, since HMPV viral load was lower than non-ICU patients. Unlike other studies, female gender and past medical history were not associated with severe disease. 15 We identified a unique group of children with HMPV infection and no LRTI symptoms at admission. Approximately 25% developed an oxygen requirement during hospitalization, suggesting that upper respiratory disease may have progressed to the lower tract. These children were notably younger than the LRTI cohort. Despite the lack of LRTI symptoms on admission, 13% required ICU care and the overall median length of stay was 5 days. Fever without respiratory symptoms is a recognized clinical syndrome in young children with other respiratory viruses, particularly influenza. 47, 48 Therefore, young children with fever should be screened for HMPV infection as they may present without classic LRTI symptoms but develop severe disease. Recognition of HMPV could avoid unnecessary antibiotics in these children, and they could benefit from an antiviral or vaccine in the future.

Our study has strengths and limitations. This is a prospective viral surveillance study over a three-year study period, and it is one of the largest cohorts of children infected with HMPV. We only enrolled children at one large, referral hospital in Amman, Jordan andmay have selected for sicker children. Data not obtained from parents was gleaned from chart review andwas dependent on provider accuracy. Admission diagnosis was based on physician discretion. We tested for 10 common respiratory viruses, but we did not test for parainfluenza 4, coronavirus, or human bocavirus, which have been implicated in LRTI. 49, 50 There were few blood cultures and thus limited data on bacterial co-infection, which could contribute to disease severity. However, neither child who died had cultures consistent with bacterial infection (not shown). Although HMPV is rarely found in asymptomatic children, 1 we did not have a matched healthy cohort to determine the role of HMPV in causing symptomatology. Lastly, we were not able to genotype ~20% of specimens.

In addition to the unique geographic location, our population differs from many studies evaluating HMPV disease severity in that the majority of children were not premature, had no significant past medical history, and did not attend daycare, but had smoke exposure. Thus, the epidemiology of previously established risk factors in this population are different than other cohorts where these factors are often predictors of respiratory virus severity. Previous studies have used hospitalization, clinical severity scores, and ICU mortality as markers of disease severity. [13] [14] [15] Since our population did not include outpatient children with HMPV and few children required ICU care, we used supplemental oxygen as a surrogate for severe LRTI. In a large population of previously healthy children, with HMPV subgroups A2, B1, and B2 circulating over a 3 year period, HMPV A and young age were independently associated with oxygen use. Our study highlights that the epidemiology of established risk factors are unique to specific populations. Pediatricians should be aware of local epidemiology and risk factors and recognize that young children and children with HMPV A may be at higher risk for severe disease and benefit from future development of antivirals and monoclonal antibodies.

Respiratory virus infection among hospitalized adult patients with or without clinically apparent respiratory infection: a prospective cohort study,"Objectives: To determine the viral epidemiology and clinical characteristics of patients with and without clinically apparent respiratory tract infection. Methods: This prospective cohort study was conducted during the 2018 winter influenza season. Adult patients with fever/respiratory symptoms (fever/RS group) were age-and sex-matched with patients without fever/RS (non-fever/RS group) in a 1:1 ratio. Respiratory viruses were tested using NxTAG™ Respiratory Pathogen Panel IVD, a commercially-available multiplex PCR panel.","Respiratory viruses are the leading cause of respiratory tract infection [1, 2] . Influenza virus and respiratory syncytial virus have been associated with high morbidity and mortality [3e5]. Rhinovirus has been found to be the most frequently detected respiratory virus among patients with community-acquired pneumonia, and has been associated with significant morbidity and mortality [1,6e8] . Adenovirus and parainfluenza virus (PIV) were reported to have the highest hospitalizationefatality ratio [9] .

Defining of the burden of respiratory viruses is one of the agendas in the WHO Battle against Respiratory Viruses (BRaVe) initiative [10] . Accurate data on the burden of respiratory virus infection is critical for patient management, infection control measures and public health policies. Current clinical guidelines suggest that respiratory virus should be tested in patients with respiratory symptoms, or those with myocarditis or encephalitis [2] . As a result, epidemiological data on respiratory virus infection mostly rely on studies analysing patients with clinical evidence of respiratory tract infection [1,9,11e15 ]. However, non-respiratory symptoms and extrapulmonary complications are common among patients with respiratory virus infection [15e18] . Renal failure is particularly common among patients with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus infection [19, 20] . Myocardial infarction and stroke can be triggered by respiratory virus infection [12, 14, 21] . Hence, epidemiological studies excluding patients without symptoms or signs of respiratory tract infection may underestimate the true burden of respiratory virus infection.

Here, our objective was to reveal the hidden burden of respiratory virus infection among patients requiring hospitalization without clinical suspicion of respiratory virus infection. We explored the differences in the incidence of different respiratory viruses between patients with or without clinical suspicion of respiratory tract infection. We analysed the clinical features associated with the detection of respiratory viruses among patients without fever or respiratory symptoms. To reduce patient discomfort, we collected saliva specimens for respiratory virus testing. We and others have demonstrated that there is a high concordance (>90%) between saliva and nasopharyngeal specimens in the detection of respiratory viruses [22e24].

This was a prospective cohort study conducted in Queen Mary Hospital of Hong Kong, an acute-care university-affiliated teaching hospital with 1700 beds. All adult patients admitted to the acute medical wards from 9 January to 12 February, 2018 were screened for eligibility. Inclusion criteria were age !18 years, admission to any hospitals for <24 hours, competent and agreed to provide written informed consent. Patients were excluded if they could not provide adequate saliva. Written informed consent was obtained from all recruited patients. Saliva specimens were collected from all eligible patients.

Eligible patients with fever !38.0 C or any respiratory symptoms (RS) upon admission were classified as the fever/RS group, whereas those without fever or respiratory symptoms in the preceding 7 days before hospitalization were classified as non-fever/RS group. Respiratory symptoms included runny nose, sore throat, cough (including haemoptysis), sputum and shortness of breath. A saliva specimen was collected from all eligible patients. Each patient in the fever/RS group was matched with an age-matched (within 5 years) and sex-matched patient in the non-fever/RS group in a 1:1 ratio. All unmatched patients were excluded from further testing.

Saliva specimens were tested for respiratory viruses using NxTAG™ Respiratory Pathogen Panel IVD (Luminex, Austin, TX, USA) as described previously [22, 25] . Differentiation of rhinovirus and enterovirus was performed by sequence analysis of the VP4/ VP2 gene region.

Data on fever or respiratory symptoms were collected by research nurses using a standardized questionnaire. Final diagnosis, outcome and laboratory investigation results were obtained from the Clinical Management System. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the University of Hong Kong/Hospital Authority Hong Kong West Cluster (UW 13-265). This study is reported using the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) guidelines [26] . Please refer to Supplementary material (Appendix S1)for details on respiratory virus testing and sequencing, and specimen collection.

All statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 23.0. ManneWhitney U test and Fisher's exact test were used for the 

A total of 385 patients were included in the study, and 214 patients were included for respiratory virus testing in their saliva and final analysis, including 107 patients in the fever/RS group and 107 age-and sex-matched patients in the non-fever/RS group (Table 1 and Fig. 1 ). The median age was 67.5 years (range 18e93 years), and 42.1% (90/214) were female. There was no significant difference in the demographics and co-morbidities between the fever/RS group and the non-fever/RS group, except that chronic lung disease was more common among the fever/RS group than the non-fever/ RS group (25.2% (27/107) versus 6.5% (7/107); p < 0.001). The number of patients in each week was not statistically different between the fever/RS group and the non-fever/RS group (p 0.489) (see Supplementary material, Table S1 ).

Among the fever/RS group, the most common respiratory symptom was cough (61.7%; 66/107) ( Table 1) . Sixteen patients (15.0%) only had fever but no respiratory symptoms. Among patients in the non-fever/RS group, the most common symptom was chest discomfort (27.1%; 29/107), followed by dizziness (20.6%; 22/ 107) and gastrointestinal symptoms (18.7%; 20/107) ( Table 1) . Three patients in the non-fever/RS group developed fever (n ¼ 2) or respiratory symptoms (n ¼ 1) during hospitalization after collection of saliva. There was no significant difference in the frequency of non-respiratory symptoms between the fever/RS group and the non-fever/RS group, except that palpitation was significantly more common in the non-fever/RS group (17.8% (19/107) versus 7.5% (8/ 107); p 0.038). Significantly more patients in the fever/RS group required oxygen supplementation when compared with those in the non-fever/RS group (25.2% (27/107) versus 3.7% (4/107); p < 0.001). Oseltamivir was only given empirically in the fever/RS group, not in the non-fever/RS group.

Respiratory viruses were detected in 34.1% (73/214) of patients (Table 2; and see Supplementary material, Table S2 ). The respiratory virus detection rate in the fever/RS group (44.9%; 48/107) was significantly higher than that in the non-fever/RS group (23.4%; 25/ 107) (p 0.001). For the 16 patients with fever only in the fever/RS group, seven (43.8%) had respiratory virus detected. Co-infection with two or more respiratory viruses was detected in 17 patients, including 10.3% (11/107) in the fever/RS group and 5.6% (6/107) in the non-fever/RS group, but the difference was not statistically significant (p 0.312). There was no significant difference in the proportion of patients with co-infection among different respiratory viruses (see Supplementary material, Fig. S1 ).

Overall, the most frequently detected respiratory viruses were adenovirus (7.9%; 17/214) and influenza B virus (7.9%; 17/214) ( Table 2 , and see Supplementary material, Fig. S1 ). For the fever/RS group, the most frequently detected respiratory viruses were influenza B virus (15.0%; 16/107) and enterovirus/rhinovirus (12.1%; 13/107) ( Table 2 ). For the non-fever/RS group, the most frequently detected viruses were adenovirus (10.3%; 11/107) and PIV-4B (9.3%; 10/107). The detection rates of influenza B virus (15.0% (16/107) versus 0.9% (1/107), p < 0.001), enterovirus/rhinovirus (12.1% (13/ 107) versus 2.8% (3/107); p 0.017) and coronaviruses (5.6% (6/107) versus 0% (0/107); p 0.029) were significantly higher in the fever/RS group than in the non-fever/RS group (Fig. 2) . Adenovirus (10.3% (11/107) versus 5.6% (6/107); p 0.312) and PIV-4B (9.3% (10/107) versus 2.8% (3/107); p 0.082) were more common in the non-fever/ RS group than in the fever/RS group, but not reaching statistical significance.

We have further compared patients with and without virus detection among patients in the non-fever/RS group (Table 3) . For co-morbidities, there were no significant differences between patients with respiratory virus detected than those without (17.2%) were the most common respiratory viruses detected in patients with chest discomfort (see Supplementary material, Table S3 ).

This study showed that respiratory viruses could be frequently detected among acutely hospitalized patients without fever or respiratory symptoms (23.4%), although less frequently than in patients with fever or respiratory symptoms (44.9%). For the fever/ RS group, influenza B virus and enterovirus/rhinovirus were the most commonly identified viruses, which was similar to the surveillance data from the Public Health Laboratory Service in Hong Kong during the same period (see Supplementary material, Fig. S2 ). However, for the non-fever/RS group, adenovirus and PIV-4B were the most frequently detected viruses. Notably, adenovirus and PIV-4B were more common among patients in the non-fever/RS group than those in the fever/RS group. Among patients in the non-fever/ RS group, chest discomfort was more frequently reported by patients with respiratory virus detected than those without respiratory virus detected.

Previous studies have reported that respiratory symptoms predominated in patients with symptomatic infection, whereas non-respiratory symptoms were only present in a minority of patients [7, 15] . Many retrospective studies have demonstrated an association between respiratory virus infection and extrapulmonary complications [12, 14, 21] . However, because of the bias in testing patients with fever or respiratory symptoms, these reported results may not be accurate. Our results suggest that patients without respiratory symptoms should be enrolled in future studies on the role of respiratory viruses in extrapulmonary complications. Adenovirus and PIV-4B were more frequently detected in the non-fever/RS group than in the fever/RS group. Adenovirus and PIV are generally perceived to be less important than influenza virus or respiratory syncytial virus because of the low incidence. However, a retrospective study showed that adenovirus and PIV had the highest hospitalizationefatality rate among different respiratory viruses [9] . It is possible that these respiratory viruses are transient, colonizing the patients' upper respiratory tract but not actually causing the symptoms or disease. However, although asymptomatic infections due to adenovirus and PIV are often found in children [11, 27, 28] , adenovirus and PIV are rarely detected among healthy asymptomatic adults [11, 29] .

This study was designed to minimize potential bias. First, we have recorded the respiratory symptom data from study participants using a standardized questionnaire. This is important because mild symptoms may not be actively reported by patients. Second, the fever/RS group and non-fever/RS group were matched for age and sex. The matching of age is particularly important because previous studies have shown that the proportion of patients with symptoms varies according to age [28] . Another unique feature in this study is that we have included patients with fever but without respiratory symptoms in the fever/RS group because many clinicians test respiratory viruses in febrile patients without respiratory symptoms.

In the current study, patients in the non-fever/RS group were admitted to hospital for acute non-respiratory symptoms. Hence, our patient cohort differs from studies involving asymptomatic adult individuals who were not clinically affected by the respiratory viruses [11, 27, 29] . Further studies are required to determine whether there is a causal relationship between the identified respiratory virus and the symptoms among patients in the fever/RS group.

This study was conducted during the influenza B epidemic. As expected, influenza B virus was the most commonly detected respiratory virus among the fever/RS group. Interestingly, influenza B virus was only found in one patient in the non-fever/RS group. The ratio in the detection rate of influenza B virus in the fever/RS group and non-fever/RS group was greatest among all viruses. Our results suggest that patients with influenza B virus infection are more likely to present with respiratory symptoms than those with other respiratory virus infections.

First, we only recruited patients from acute adult medical wards. Therefore, adult patients hospitalized with surgical conditions or paediatric patients would not be included. Second, we enrolled patients within 24 hours of hospitalization. The role of respiratory viruses for nosocomial complications should be further explored. Third, this study was conducted over a 1-month period during the influenza B winter season, and therefore the respiratory viruses detected in this study are not representative for the entire year. A long-term study should be conducted to capture the peak seasons of other respiratory viruses. Fourth, some patients in the non-fever/ RS group may have prolonged viral shedding from a previous respiratory illness that occurred more than 7 days before admission. Finally, we studied acutely hospitalized patients, who would have more severe symptoms or complications when compared with patients seeking help in the community. Therefore, further studies should be performed at general practice in the community.

This study showed that respiratory viruses, especially noninfluenza viruses, can be detected in a substantial proportion of acutely hospitalized adult patients without clinically apparent respiratory tract infection. For future studies, the inclusion of hospitalized patients without clinically apparent respiratory tract infection will lead to a better understanding of the non-respiratory symptomatology and extrapulmonary complications of respiratory viruses.

The high rate of detection of respiratory viruses among the nonfever/RS group may be important for infection control and clinical management. Respiratory viruses are responsible for many nosocomial outbreaks. Patients without clinical evidence of respiratory illness may represent an 'occult' source of respiratory viruses for nosocomial outbreaks, and therefore these patients might have to be included in outbreak investigations. Furthermore, the detection of respiratory viruses in these patients may affect antiviral treatment decisions, especially when novel antivirals against noninfluenza viruses become available [6, 30] .

Adenovirus respiratory infection in hospitalized children in Hong Kong: serotype-clinical syndrome association and risk factors for lower respiratory tract infection,"Lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) caused by adenovirus can be severe with resultant chronic pulmonary sequelae. More than 50 serotypes have been recognized; however, the exact association of serotype with clinical phenotype is still unclear. There have been no reports on the adenovirus serotype pattern in Hong Kong, and their relationships with disease manifestations and complications are not known. Clinical and epidemiological data on 287 children (<6 years old) admitted with adenovirus respiratory infections from 2001 to 2004 were reviewed. Common presenting symptoms included fever (97.9 %) and cough and rhinitis (74 %). Extra-pulmonary manifestations were present in 37.3 %. The clinical picture mimicked bacterial infection for its prolonged high fever and neutrophilic blood picture. Forty-two patients (14.6 %) had LRTI, either pneumonia or acute bronchiolitis, but none had severe acute respiratory compromise. Children aged 1 to 2 years old were most at risk for adenovirus LRTI (adjusted p=0.0165). Serotypes 1 to 7 could be identified in 93.7 % of the nasopharyngeal specimens, with serotypes 2 and 3 being the most prevalent. Different serotypes showed predilection for different age groups and with different respiratory illness association. The majority of acute bronchiolitis (71.4 %) were associated with serotype 2 infection, and this association was statistically significant (p<0.0001). Serotype 3 infection accounted for over half of the pneumonia cases (57-75 %) in those aged 3-5 years old. Only one patient developed mild bronchiectasis after serotype 7 pneumonia. Children aged 1 to 2 years old were the at-risk group for adenovirus LRTI, but respiratory morbidity was relatively mild in our locality. There was an apparent serotype-respiratory illness association.","young age (less than 7 years old), underlying chronic disease, post-transplant or immunocompromised state [13, 24, 30] .

In the past decade, there were increasing numbers of reports on Ad serotype analysis, in part because of the more readily available polymerase chain reaction sequencing approach for typing Ad as compared to the traditional neutralization method [5, 11, 20, 21] . However, the exact association of serotype with clinical phenotype is still unclear. So far, there have been no reports on the Ad serotype pattern in Hong Kong, and their relationships with disease manifestations and complications are unknown. The few local studies that related to Ad infection only focused on the overall epidemiology of viral pneumonia or acute respiratory tract infections in hospitalized children [7, 32, 33] .

Hence, we conducted a retrospective review to study the epidemiology, clinical features, and outcome of Ad respiratory tract infections in children admitted to our hospital. We focused on those pre-school children under the age of 6 years old as nearly 90 % of Ad infections occur in this age group [5, 6, 17] . We also aimed to explore for any serotype-clinical syndrome association and to identify the at-risk group for ""lower"" versus ""upper"" respiratory tract infections. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of our Hospital Authority. The need for informed consent was waived.

The study was carried out in Queen Mary Hospital, a university affiliated hospital, and one of the two public hospitals in Hong Kong Island serving a population of more than 100,000 children under 18 years old. All preschool children under 6 years of age admitted with acute respiratory symptoms and with a virologic diagnosis of Ad from January 2001 to December 2004 were included in the study. These cases were identified retrospectively from laboratory surveillance database, and their clinical records were reviewed for demographic and clinical details. Based on our admission policy, nasopharyngeal aspirates were obtained routinely in all patients who admitted with respiratory symptoms for isolation purposes and tested for five common viruses-Ad, influenza A and B, parainfluenza virus, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)-by direct antigen detection by immunofluorescence (IF) and viral culture.

Children with acute respiratory illnesses were categorized into those with upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) and those with lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI). LRTI included pneumonia and acute bronchiolitis. The medical records were reviewed carefully and the clinical diagnosis of each case was classified cautiously: Acute bronchiolitis was defined as the presence of viral upper respiratory prodrome including rhinorrhea and cough with any signs of increased respiratory effort and wheezing in young children [9] . The diagnosis of pneumonia was based on the presence of cough with tachypnea [28] or positive auscultative findings (bronchial breath sound or crackles) in addition to abnormal radiological features (consolidation/interstitial infiltrates) that were consistent with pneumonia, as interpreted by the attending pediatrician or by the radiologist. Patients with co-infection of other known respiratory viruses or bacteria in the same course of hospital stay were excluded.

Virus isolation was performed by inoculating HEp-2C cell monolayers in tissue culture tubes with 150 μl of the nasopharyngeal aspirate in viral transport medium and incubated at 37°C for up to 7 days. The culture maintenance fluid, minimum essential medium supplemented with 2 % fetal bovine serum (GibcoBRL, Grand Island, NY, USA), L-glutamine (2 mM), and antimicrobials (final antimicrobial concentration per milliliter of medium: vancomycin, 50 μg; amikacin, 20 μg; nystatin, 20 units), was changed every 2 to 3 days or twice during the incubation period. Ad was identified initially by characteristic cytopathic effect and direct immunofluorescence staining (Adenovirus DFA Reagent, EMD Millipore Corporation, USA) of the infected cells. Definitive typing of the viral isolate was performed by micro-neutralization assay with HEp-2C cells for serotyping as described previously [16] . The isolate was passed to a new HEp2-C tube until ≥75 % cytopathic effect was evident and diluted the culture at 1:10 with 2 % minimum essential medium after freezing and thawing of the culture once before carrying out the neutralization test. Briefly, 0.05 ml of each Ad typing serum type 1 to 7 (Denka Seiken, Japan) at 10-20 antibody unit per 0.05 ml was added to 0.05 ml of each isolate at a viral concentration of 100 TCID 50 (50 % tissue culture infective dose) per 0.05 ml and incubated at 37°C in 2.5 % CO 2 for 1 h, followed by incubation with 0.1 ml HEp-2C cells (150,000 cells per ml) for up to 7 days. The serotypes were determined by inhibition of cytopathic effect by corresponding typespecific antisera. End results were read when the virus control showed 100 % cytopathic effect. Back-titration of the input virus dose and cells without virus inoculation as negative control was run in parallel. In case where the virus could not be neutralized by the antisera used, the test was repeated at 1:20, 1:50, or higher viral dilution if necessary. Isolates that did not type after repeated tests were considered as untypeable.

Descriptive statistics were used to describe the epidemiological data of the disease and clinical characteristics of patients.

Chi-square test was used to test if there was any significant relationship between individual serotype and each disease category (pneumonia versus acute bronchiolitis versus URTI). Demographic characteristics were compared between the groups of children with LRTI and URTI using Pearson's chisquare test (with Yates' correction) for categorical variables and unpaired t-test for continuous variables for any risk factors that might predispose a child to lower respiratory tract involvement. Significant risk factors identified in the univariate analysis were then adjusted using multi-variate logistic regression to determine their independent effects. All analyses were done by using SAS software (version 9.12). A p-value of <0.05 was considered as statistically significant.

A total of 287 children fulfilled the study criteria during the specified period, and their demographic characteristics were shown (Table 1 ). There was a slight male predominance. The mean age was 2.82±1.61 years old. The majority (85.4 %) of them were previously healthy. Thirty children were admitted from institutions (i.e., residential facilities for children with social problems). Twenty-nine cases were excluded from the study due to co-infection with other pathogens: nine cases with influenza virus A or B, two cases with RSV, 14 cases with parainfluenza virus 1, 2, or 3, one case with Coxsackie virus A, one case with human metapneumovirus, one case with rotavirus, and one case with both Stapylococcus aureus and Moraxella catarrhalis.

Common presenting symptoms included fever (97.9 %), cough (74.9 %), and rhinitis (73.9 %). A total of 107 (37.3 %) patients had one or more associated extra-pulmonary manifestations: gastrointestinal symptoms (n=39), febrile seizure (n=36), conjunctivitis (n=26), and skin rash (n=14). URTI was the most common presentation (245 cases, 85.4 %). Among them, four cases presented as croup-like illness and 14 cases were complicated with otitis media. LRTI was diagnosed in 42 patients (14.6 %) with 28 cases of pneumonia and 14 cases of acute bronchiolitis. a Forty-two patients had underlying chronic illness which included asthma in 25 patients, congenital heart disease in seven patients, cerebral palsy, mental retardation, or epilepsy in four patients, an underlying immunodeficiency in two patients, Down syndrome in three patients, and inborn error of metabolism in one patient Laboratory and radiological findings Blood tests with differential white cell counts (WCC) were available in 255 patients. Among them, 52.2 % had neutrophilia as defined by absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of ≥8.5×10 9 /L according to the laboratory reference. The mean total WCC, ANC, and lymphocyte count did not differ significantly between the URTI and LRTI groups ( Table 1 ). C-reactive protein level was not routinely performed in our setting. Among those with LRTI, interstitial pulmonary infiltrates were the most common abnormal radiological findings (73.3 %), while the remaining ones showed lobar-type consolidation.

Both URTI and LRTI patients suffered from high fever (mean peak temperature of 39.6±0.6 and 39.5±0.7°C, respectively), and the overall mean duration of fever prior to attendance of the Accident and Emergency Department was 3.4±2.5 days.

Those with LRTI had a slightly longer hospital stay than those with URTI (4.6±2.9 versus 2.9±1.9 days). The whole febrile illness usually lasted 5 to 6 days. While awaiting for the rapid IF result, 30.3 % of the patients were empirically treated with antibiotics in view of the high-grade fever together with the finding of neutrophilia. Indeed 43.9 % of the admitted children had received antibiotics from their primary care physicians before hospital admissions. Four out of 42 patients (9.5 %) with LRTI had hypoxia, defined as oxygen saturation below 92 % on admission, and required oxygen supplement for 1 to 5 days. Two patients needed intensive care support due to associated febrile status epilepticus which were not directly related to the severity of respiratory illness. One had acute bronchiolitis and the other had URTI. There was no mortality.

Among those 42 patients with LRTI, about 60 % of them were offered follow-up as they still had considerable symptoms or significant chest X-ray abnormalities at the time of discharge. Most of them had symptoms or radiological improvement within a few weeks' time and did not require longterm follow-up. Only one patient developed chronic pulmonary sequelae. He was a 3-year-old child with good past health who suffered from right lower lobe pneumonia caused by Ad serotype 7. Serial follow-up chest X-rays showed persistent right lower lobe collapse consolidation even after several months. Initial computer tomography scan of the thorax revealed lobar collapse, but repeated scan after 1 year showed bronchiectatic changes in the corresponding lobe. Workup for other common causes of bronchiectasis was negative.

Among the risk factors selected for analysis, age between 1 and 2 years (p=0.0153), history of prematurity (p=0.0018), history of ventilator assistance at birth (p=0.0215), and institutionalization (p=value 0.0009) were found to be associated with LRTI in univariate analysis (Table 2) . After multiple logistic regression, only age between 1 and 2 years remained as the statistically significant risk factor for LRTI (adjusted p=0.0165, odds ratio 2.48, 95 % confidence interval 1.18 to 5.22).

In our study, rapid detection of Ad by IF had a sensitivity of 73.8 % (212/287) in comparison to cell culture. Serotyping by microneutralization assay was achieved for 93.7 % of the culture samples. Among the seven serotypes (type 1-7) that were isolated during the 4-year period, serotypes 2, 3, and 7 accounted for most of the respiratory tract infections. The prevalent serotype and the peak season varied in each year (Table 3 The serotype distribution among different respiratory illnesses is shown in Table 4 . Being more common, serotypes 2, 3, and 7 proportionally accounted for most of the pneumonia cases. Serotype 3 infection accounted for over one third of the pneumonia cases. Interestingly, the majority of acute bronchiolitis (71.4 %) were associated with serotype 2 infection, and this association was statistically significant (p<0.0001). Infection with serotype 5 was only associated with URTI in our series.

On stratifying patients according to their age groups and types of respiratory illness (Table 5) , we found that serotype 2 accounted for the majority of acute bronchiolitis and half of the pneumonia cases in those aged below 2 years, while it did not cause any LRTI in those aged above 3 years old. The prevalence of serotype 2 in causing URTI also significantly decreased after the first 3 years of age. Serotype 3, despite being the most prevalent serotype, did not play any significant role for LRTI in those aged below 3 years. It was, however, the predominant etiological agent of pneumonia in those aged between 3-4 and 4-5 years old, accounting for 75 and 57.1 % of pneumonia cases, respectively. Serotype 7, on the contrary, did not seem to have a particular age group predilection. Comparison between serotypes 3 and 7 revealed no significant difference between their clinical and laboratory characteristics, but those patients infected with serotype 7 required a slightly longer mean hospital stay (3.7±3.3 versus 2.8±1.2 days, p=0.0207) and were more likely to have a history of prematurity (p=0.0407) or were living in institutions (p=0.0025) ( Table 6 ). The latter was likely contributed by the fact that an outbreak of serotype 7 occurred between April and May in 2001 which resulted in nine consecutive admissions from an institution.

Adenovirus has been known as a common cause of childhood respiratory illness since it was first described in 1950s. By now, more than 50 serotypes have been recognized, but the exact association of serotype with clinical phenotype is still unclear. It is likely that different serotypes display different tissue tropisms and clinical manifestations of infection. As the predominant serotypes differ among countries and change over time, the epidemiological and clinical pattern of Ad infection will vary accordingly. However, there is paucity of local data on the epidemiological characteristics, serotype pattern, and clinical outcome of Ad infection in Hong Kong children.

We showed that serotypes 2 and 3 were the most prevalent serotypes among hospitalized children with Ad respiratory infections during this 4-year study period. There was a small epidemic due to serotype 7 in 2001. The number of admissions due to Ad was markedly reduced in 2003, during the SARS outbreak. Reduced infection of other respiratory viruses in Hong Kong during that time had also been documented and might be partly explained by increased social distancing and improved community hygiene during that period [22] . Unlike influenza virus and RSV, no consistent seasonal pattern of Ad respiratory infection was observed, which was similarly seen in some other areas [1, 19] .

The clinical picture of Ad respiratory infection was characterized by coryzal symptoms with prolonged and high fever. Our children suffered from a mean peak temperature of 39.6±0.6°C, and the mean duration of this febrile illness lasted 5.2±2.7 days. The presence of extra-pulmonary manifestations (gastrointestinal symptoms, febrile seizure, conjunctivitis, and skin rash) might potentially serve as a hint for Ad infection as these symptoms were seen in over one third of cases. Some studies have reported leukocytosis or elevated Creactive protein with Ad infections [5, 8] . We have also found neutrophilia in over half of our cases as opposed to lymphopenia or lymphocytosis seen in most other viral infections. Because of the high fever and neutrophilic blood picture, the disease presentation often mimicked bacterial disease and led to unnecessary antibiotic prescription. The fact that Ad infections mimicked bacterial infection and parental anxiety due to persistent high fever might lead to a higher likelihood of hospital admission and hence explained why a considerable number of children were admitted to the hospital for URTI in our locality.

There was a relatively even distribution in age among children who suffered from URTI, but over one third of the children suffered from LRTI aged between 1 and 2 years old. We have confirmed from the multi-variate analysis that children in this age group were more predisposed for ""lower"" versus ""upper"" respiratory tract infection by Ad. Acute bronchiolitis is generally more common in those aged below 2 years old but possible explanation that these children (1 to 2 years old), rather than the even younger age group, were at higher risk for developing LRTI might include waning of protective antibodies at this age.

It is well reported that a subgroup of patients with Ad infection can progress to severe pneumonia with long-term complications. Serotypes 3, 7, and 21 have been previously identified as the culprits [3, 15, 18, 29] . Apart from susceptible host risk factors, severe infection can also occur in previously healthy person [14, 26] . Interestingly, there was a marked variation in the morbidity and mortality rates of adenovirus LRTI in different studied populations. Ad respiratory infection had a profound impact in some countries. Mortality up to 16 % and permanent pulmonary sequelae ranging from 14 to 60 % were reported in children in some South American countries following Ad pneumonia [3, 4, 24, 34] . Lower yet still significant mortality and morbidity rates were reported in some neighboring Asian countries. In Korea, Hong et al.

reported that Ad LRTI-related mortality in a children hospital was 12 % overall and 19 % among patients who were infected with serotype 7 [17] . Residual sequelae were identified in 50 % of the patients who were infected with serotype 3 and in 25 % of those infected with serotype 7. In a Taiwanese study, two out of 48 patients with Ad pneumonia died and five had permanent lung damage, while there was no mortality nor long-term sequelae found in the non-Ad group [12] . While traditionally serotypes 3 and 7 were well known to cause more severe respiratory infections, there were occasional reports on other serotypes which could be potentially associated with severe infections. For example, in the review by Lee et al. [20] , serotype 8 was one risk factor for severe respiratory infection in Korea, while serotype 4 was identified as an important pathogen responsible for the fatal childhood pneumonia in South China [27] . The reason why a certain strain of Ad in some populations was more virulent and damaging to the growing lung was not understood clearly. It was speculated that host variation in immune response and the local virulence of the specific serotype might both play a part [10, 23, 35] . However, the disease severity of Ad respiratory infections in our locality appeared to be less alarming than many of our neighbouring countries. In our study, 14.6 % of those admitted were classified to have lower respiratory tract complications, either acute bronchiolitis or pneumonia, based on rather stringent diagnostic criteria, yet only four patients with LRTI suffered from mild hypoxemia, without severe acute respiratory compromise or mortality. As our study was conducted in a hospital providing both secondary and tertiary care in the region, it should have covered the whole spectrum of patients with severe illness.

Still one of our patients developed bronchiectasis after serotype 7 infection, a subtype notorious in causing longterm pulmonary sequelae. This serotype was indeed well known to be associated with severe pneumonia, but it only ranked third in causing pneumonia in our hospitalized cases, probably because it was only present in two cases out of the 4year study period. It was no longer detected in 2003-2004 among our hospitalized children after the apparent small epidemic in 2001. We could not ascertain whether this might reflect an increasing trend of herd immunity in the community, resulting in lesser case severity. Lee et al. also observed a decreasing size of subsequent epidemics after a large outbreak of serotype 7 [20] . This could partly account for the milder disease phenotype associated with Ad infection during the study period in our locality.

As shown, the most prominent serotype-clinical syndrome correlation appeared to be serotype 2 with acute bronchiolitis. While Ad has been known to be occasionally associated with acute bronchiolitis, the role of serotype 2 has not been previously reported. One study from Cuba reported that serotype 5 accounted for 71 % of the 14 cases of acute bronchiolitis identified, but serotype 2 was not tested for in that study [2] . Their sample size was smaller (49 cases) and with a lower serotyping rate (63 %). The study was not confined to the pediatric age group and there was no clear case definition of acute bronchiolitis versus pneumonia.

It would be difficult to clearly delineate the complex relationship between serotype virulence, host factor, and resultant disease phenotype. For example, serotype 2 seemed to infect the youngest children predominantly (mean age 1.94±-1.29 years old), but ""young age"" could also be the risk factor for developing acute bronchiolitis. On the other hand, serotype 3 displayed predilection for the slightly older age groups (mean age 3.43±1.42 years old). It was the leading cause for pneumonia among those aged between 3 and 5 years old, but it did not play any significant role for LRTI in those younger children. Hence, host factor might also be a potential confounding factor for the serotype-respiratory illness association. Further epidemiological studies would be needed to better support our observation.

The potential limitations of our study must be addressed. Firstly, there was no assurance of standardized documentation relating to the history, physical findings, and radiological interpretation because this was a retrospective study. Secondly, our study was confined to a single centre and the result might not be extrapolated beyond our local community. Thirdly, the neutralization test only routinely tested for serotypes 1 to 7 as these serotypes were considered to be most frequently associated with respiratory disease. It meant that other serotypes (constituted 6.3 % of the total cases) were not serotyped, though the majority of them only caused URTI. The neutralization test also might not be able to type virus isolates containing coinfections with multiple Ad serotypes. Such coinfections, even by serotypes 1-7, might appear nonneutralizable by the serotype-specific sera and would be falsely categorized as non-1-7 serotype. Fourthly, although we had tried to exclude the possible impact of co-infections by other pathogens in the analysis of the clinical disease spectrum, viruses such as human metapneumovirus, coronavirus, and rhinovirus and atypical bacteria such as mycoplasma and chlamydia were not tested for. Lastly, it was postulated that Ad might persist and be shed for prolonged periods and thus positive cell cultures for Ad might not represent an etiological link with disease. However, direct immunofluorescence assay from nasopharyngeal aspirate was known to have lower sensitivity than the cell culture method. Currently, there is no good diagnostic test to ascertain acute Ad infection as seroconversion test is not available in most clinical settings.

The current study was the first comprehensive review of Ad respiratory infections among hospitalized children in Hong Kong with serotype data presented. Apart from revealing the local serotype pattern and epidemiology, we have shown that Ad generally did not cause severe acute respiratory disease in our young children and long-term pulmonary sequelae was comparatively infrequent, but as the clinical manifestations of Ad infections mimicked bacterial infections, it often led to unnecessary hospital admissions and antibiotic use. Children aged between 1 and 2 years were most at risk for LRTI. Serotypes 2 and 3 were the most prevalent serotypes among our hospitalized children, and they seemed to have a predilection for different age groups and with different resultant respiratory illness association. A longer study period over time is needed to monitor the serotype pattern and disease complication for better understanding and prognostication of Ad infections in the region and to better delineate the potential complex relationship between serotype virulence, host factor, and resultant disease phenotype.

Viral Respiratory Infections in Preterm Infants during and after Hospitalization,Objective To determine the burden of viral respiratory infections in preterm infants both during and subsequent to neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) hospitalization and to compare this with term infants living in the community.,"A lmost 4 million babies are born in the US each year with approximately 12% of those births occurring prematurely. 1 Preterm infants suffer significant respiratory morbidity because of lung immaturity at birth, especially those born before 32 weeks gestation. The more severe cases are diagnosed with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) based on oxygen requirement near term corrected gestational age. However, infants born at less than 32 weeks who do not develop BPD and those born moderate to late preterm, from 32 to <37 weeks gestation, also have an increased prevalence of respiratory symptoms and rehospitalization because of respiratory problems during their first year of life as well as a greater degree of respiratory symptoms at preschool age. 2, 3 Viral respiratory infections contribute to poor respiratory outcomes and are the most common pathogens identified in children under the age of 18 years hospitalized for community-acquired pneumonia. 4 In addition to well-documented outbreaks, a prior surveillance study suggested a high burden of on-going respiratory viral infections in preterm infants born at less than 32 weeks gestation while they are still hospitalized in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). 5 NICU infections with human rhinovirus also have been described in both extremely and moderately preterm infants and postulated as a cause of significant respiratory morbidity. 6 A recent report identified respiratory viral infections in a number of clinically significant systemic illnesses in the NICU population and suggested that testing for viral respiratory pathogens may be helpful in the diagnostic evaluation of infants developing signs of sepsis after the first 72 hours of age (late-onset sepsis). 7 We sought to determine the full extent of viral respiratory infections in the extremely to moderately preterm population in the NICU and during the first 4 months following discharge from the hospital. This study is part of a larger study of infant immune system development and respiratory function (Prematurity, Respiratory outcomes, Immune System and Microbiome study or PRISM) that is part of the Respiratory Pathogens Research Center at the University of Rochester. We hypothesized that the risk of respiratory viral infections in preterm babies in the NICU was significantly lower than term infants residing in the community. Secondarily, we hypothesized that the rate of respiratory viral infections in preterm infants would rise to match the term infants' rate of infection once they were discharged from the NICU. 

At the initial visit, information was obtained regarding the birth history of the child and the maternal medical history including medication use or medical problems during pregnancy. Parents also self-reported family demographic information. Nose and throat swabs were obtained from each newborn on study day 1 and then weekly during hospitalization, monthly following discharge until 12 months corrected gestational age, and again at 3 years of age. Results of research testing were not shared with the clinical team. Samples through 4 months after discharge are included in this report. In addition, families were reminded at each visit to notify the study team if a child developed respiratory symptoms that reached a score of ≥3 on the Childhood Origins of ASThma or ""COAST"" score. 8-10 When a respiratory illness was identified, a study visit was completed as soon as possible. At all visits following hospitalization, parents provided the child's interval medical history. In addition to our prospective, active surveillance, we reviewed the charts of all enrolled preterm infants who underwent a late onset sepsis evaluation (>72 hours after birth) to determine if the illness episode was associated with a viral respiratory infection.

During the study period, the University of Rochester Medical Center NICU was a regional level IV, 60-bed unit organized into nine 6-8 bed ""rooms"" opening into a common corridor with 4 negative pressure isolation rooms. Patients with suspected or proven viral illness were isolated promptly before a definitive diagnosis was made. Visitor restrictions were in place from mid-December to mid-March limiting visitors to 4 for each infant with no visitors permitted under the age of 14 years. Influenza vaccination or surgical mask use was required of staff each winter and strongly encouraged for family members. Sibling visits were allowed outside the winter months but required review by a NICU nurse to obtain an updated immunization history and review of symptoms. At all times, visitors were asked to refrain from entering the NICU if they had symptoms of a respiratory illness.

Hand hygiene for staff included hand sanitizing and gloves for all patient contact. All patients were assigned a stethoscope and infants less than approximately 34 weeks gestation at birth were cared for in incubators until able to maintain temperatures in <27°C beds. Palivizumab was not administered to hospitalized infants.

Separate flocked swabs (Copan, FLOQSwabs catalog no. 525CS01; Copan, Murrieta, California) were used to obtain samples from the nares and oropharynx/tonsillar region using a tongue depressor. Specimens were immediately combined in 3 mL of universal transport media (Cat no. 330CHL; Quidel [formerly Diagnostic Hybrids], Athens, Ohio), shaken, placed on ice, and transported to the laboratory.

Total nucleic acid was extracted using 200 mL of universal transport media with the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini-Kit on a QIAcube (Qiagen, Valencia, California) with a final volume of 75 mL. TaqMan array card (TAC) technology was used on the ViiA7 instrument (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, California) as previously described, with primer and probe modifications as outlined ( Table I ; available at www.jpeds.com). [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] Targets included influenza A and B, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza virus 1, 2, and 3, human rhinovirus (hRV), enterovirus, adenovirus, coronavirus 1 through 4 (229, NL63, OC43, and HKU1, respectively), human metapneumovirus, human bocavirus, and human parechovirus.

Groups were compared by 2-sample t-test for continuous variables and c 2 test for categorical variables. Corresponding nonparametric version of Wilcoxon rank sum test and Fisher exact test were used for confirmation. Survival analysis was applied to study the infection-free curves of preterm babies during NICU hospitalization vs term babies in the community, and of both cohorts in the community, controlling for other covariates. For the NICU vs community comparison, time to first infection was calculated as the interval between birth date and infection date for the first infection for preterm babies and discharge date and infection date for term babies. For the comparison of both cohorts in the community, time to first infection was the interval between discharge date and infection date. Time to repeat infection was the interval between previous and current infection dates. Log-rank test and Kaplan-Meier nonparametric estimation of infection-free probability curves were used to compare days with infection between groups (eg, cohort [preterm vs term], sex [female vs male], and others). Further, the intensity model 29 using the modelbased covariance estimate and coupled with stepwise variable selection was used to explore the effect of demographics and to account for within-subject correlation. All statistical analyses were conducted using v 9. Table II) . The term and preterm cohorts were generally well matched although, as expected, there were significantly more preterm infants born by cesarean delivery than term infants and more multiple births among the preterm cohort (Table II) .

Because of variability in the length of hospitalization, the number of specimens from each infant ranged from 1 to 18 with a total of 618 NICU samples that were fairly evenly distributed over all 4 seasons and represented 119 weeks at risk (Figure 1 ; available at www.jpeds.com). Eighty-nine of 96 term infants contributed 1 nose/throat swab during the birth hospitalization.

Postdischarge, we obtained a total of 489 samples (range of 1-6 per subject) during the first 4 months following hospitalization with 235 samples contributed by the preterm group. These samples were also fairly equally divided over all 4 seasons (Figure 1) .

Four infants with viral respiratory infections were identified in the NICU during the 119 weeks at risk. All 4 were less than 28 weeks gestation at birth and had been in the NICU an average of 11 weeks (Table III) . Two infants were ill with respiratory symptoms within 48 hours of the weekly sampling. Log-rank test and Kaplan-Meier curve estimators suggest that the risk of acquiring a respiratory viral infection in preterm infants in the NICU was significantly lower than in the term cohort living in the community, and the risk was not associated with mode of delivery, multiple birth, or sex (Figure 2 , A). These findings were confirmed in the intensity model with only a younger age as measured by the corrected gestational age significantly increasing the daily infection rate (hazard ratio 0.951, P = .002) when delivery mode, multiple births, sex, race, and ethnicity were included in the model.

Thirty-one preterm infants (33%) had 71 late-onset sepsis evaluations in the NICU. Six infants had testing for respiratory viruses concomitant with routine bacterial cultures for the evaluation of sepsis, and 2 had viruses identified in the clinical laboratory via molecular methods that also were identified in weekly research samples as noted above (RSV, coronavirus 4) ( Table III ). The first infant had symptoms including sneezing, progressive congestion, and cough, and the clinical team suspected a viral respiratory infection. RSV was identified in the clinical laboratory and by weekly study sampling obtained the following day. The second infant had tachypnea and tachycardia and the following day had an elevated temperature to 38.1°C. Coronavirus 4 was identified by the clinical laboratory and in the study sample the following day. The third infant underwent a sepsis evaluation for bacterial infection 9 days before hRV was identified in a study sample. Worsening respiratory function prompted the sepsis investigation that included a tracheal aspirate for bacterial culture and Mycoplasma culture but no viral diagnostic studies were performed and the symptoms were attributed to evolving BPD when all routine cultures were negative. A weekly study specimen obtained 4 days before the sepsis evaluation was negative for respiratory pathogens. At the time of hRV identification, (Table IV ; available at www.jpeds.com). Seventy-one percent of term babies were infected within 4 months with 27% acquiring a viral respiratory infection in the first 2 months of life. Preterm infants had a slightly higher rate of infection, with 37% acquiring at least 1 infection in the 2 months after discharge. However, the difference in the likelihood of acquiring at least 1 respiratory viral infection in the first 4 months between the 2 groups while living in the community was not significant (P = .39). Further, the log-rank test suggested no difference in the infection-free probability curves between the 2 groups after hospital discharge (Figure 2, B) . The immediate respiratory viral infection rate after hospital discharge was not associated with mode of delivery, multiple birth, or sex by the marginal analyses. Although hRV was the predominant virus detected in both groups, 12 different viral species were identified in infants in the community (Table V; available at www.jpeds.com).

The number of sick visits for respiratory symptoms was not different between the 2 groups of infants living in the community. Fourteen percent of preterm infants had 1-2 sick visits in the first 4 months following discharge, compared with 17% of term infants (P = .66), (Table VI; available at www.jpeds.com).

The intensity model was applied to determine the factors associated with the time to acquisition of a viral respiratory infection once discharged from the hospital and included age as measured by corrected gestational age, delivery mode, multiple birth, sex, race, and ethnicity, with days to infection as the outcome. The model fitting after variable selection procedures showed that the daily infection rate for all infants following hospital discharge was higher for younger infants as measured by a smaller corrected gestational age (range for the preterm cohort was 38.4-64.3; full term cohort range was 40.1-59.7). Singleton births, boys, and white race were associated with a higher daily infection rate when other covariates were held constant (Table VII) .

We prospectively evaluated a large group of preterm and term newborns for viral respiratory infections from birth through hospital discharge followed by the first 4 months in the community and found a very low rate (4%) of viral respiratory infections in our NICU environment. This is in contrast to the findings of Bennett et al 5 who followed 50 preterm infants with biweekly sampling for 1 year and noted a viral respiratory infection in 52%. Our NICU infection rate was significantly lower than both the rate in term infants living in the community and in preterm infants once discharged from the hospital. Other variables that were associated with preterm birth were not associated with the risk of acquiring a viral respiratory infection while still being cared for in the NICU suggesting that the location of care was the key factor responsible for this finding. Our data support the conclusion that it is possible to limit the frequency of respiratory viral infections in premature infants in the NICU.

Our NICU employs standard infection prevention strategies including hand hygiene and gloves for all patient contact with visitor restrictions during the winter months and During the 24 months of this study our unit was arranged in multipatient rooms and since that time, we have moved to a new facility with all single patient rooms.

Although not yet formally evaluated, we speculate that many families visit more frequently and stay for more extended periods when there are single patient rooms such that our low infection rate may have been due to inadvertent limitations on family visitation in the previous physical space.

Our data are consistent with those of Ronchi et al 7 who found that hospitalized infants with respiratory viral infections were likely to have symptoms of congestion and rhinorrhea and be tested based on clinical suspicion. We did not find substantial undetected respiratory viral infections associated with nonspecific concerns for sepsis in our NICU but instead that infants with respiratory infections had suggestive symptoms. Because only 2.8% of sepsis evaluations in the study population were associated with viral detection by surveillance sampling, including viral investigation routinely with sepsis evaluations will have very low yield in this NICU.

The acquisition of a viral respiratory infection in the NICU setting has been linked with a longer length of hospital stay as well as markers of more significant lung disease of prematurity. 5 In this regard, it is interesting to note the lower rate of chronic lung disease in our NICU very low birth weight population from 2006 to 2014 (17.1%) than comparable units that belong to the Vermont Oxford Network (2006) (2007) (2008) (2009) (2010) (2011) (2012) (2013) (2014) 25 .4%) with a risk adjusted observed to expected average of -12% (data available from authors upon request).

Once discharged from the hospital, both preterm and term infants acquired viral respiratory infections at a similar rate and reported an equivalent number of symptomatic illnesses. Male sex, white race, and younger age were associated with an increased daily risk of acquiring an infection. Because our study design focuses on the first 6 months of life, it is difficult to compare our results with other studies. However, respiratory infection rates have been reported to be higher in younger infants than in children over the age of 12 months, with male sex a risk factor for acquiring hRV infection. 31 White race and young age also have been associated with severity of bronchiolitis suggesting that our findings are consistent with prior research. 32 The strengths of this study include the prospective, longitudinal design with repeated sampling of a large number of preterm and term infants. In addition, the study spanned all 4 seasons of the year and included infants while hospitalized and also while living in the community, both when well and ill with respiratory symptoms.

Our study has limitations. First, our center is a regional referral center creating some difficulties for enrollment into longterm prospective studies and limiting the percentage of subjects we were able to enroll. In addition, this study included only 1 NICU, and infection rates appear to vary substantially between different centers based upon limited prior reports.

Another potential limitation is the frequency of sample collection. We obtained nose and throat samples from our population once weekly while in the NICU; this may have led to a decreased detection rate. Previous studies have shown that respiratory samples obtained from the nasal turbinates with a flocked swab have similar sensitivity to nasopharyngeal aspirates and that adding a throat swab to a nasal swab improves the detection of respiratory viruses. 33, 34 In addition, viral identification by polymerase chain reaction is highly sensitive, and the TAC platform has been shown to have at least equivalent detection of viral nucleic acid as other commercially available detection systems. 16 Prior studies also have identified extended periods of shedding of respiratory viruses (≥7 days), especially in younger age cohorts, suggesting that our sampling should have been sufficient to identify infections in our NICU population. 5, [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] Our pre-and postdischarge TAC platform and sampling techniques were identical and readily detected viral infections in both term and preterm infants after discharge, supporting the study design. A further limitation is that we did not obtain respiratory samples specifically at the time of suspected sepsis while the preterm infants were in the NICU, and our sampling schedule differed between hospitalized infants and those living in the community. Nevertheless, our data suggest that weekly sampling was sufficient to identify both symptomatic and asymptomatic infections in hospitalized preterm infants. Once living in the community, the monthly sampling schedule likely missed asymptomatic infections in both preterm and term infants. However, as the schedule was the same between these 2 groups and we were comparing the infection rates between them, we do not believe this limitation substantially changes our results. ■

The Incidence of Respiratory Tract Infection in Adults Requiring Hospitalization for Asthma*,Acute respiratory tract infections (RTI) are known to worsen asthma particularly in children.,"The role of respiratory tract infections (RTI) in the evolution of acute exacerbations of asthma is continuing to be defined. There are many studies in children that have shown an association of RTI with a deterioration of asthma symptoms. Between 14% and 45% of acute asthma exacerbations in children are thought to be related to viral RTIJ- 5 The situation in adults is less clear with older studies showing RTI associated with asthma exacerbation in only 10 to 21 %. 6 · 7 There have been few recent studies assessing the rate of RTI in acute exacerbation of adult asthma. Beasley et al, 8 in a longitudinal outpatient study, have shown an incidence of viral RTI of 36% in acute severe adult asthma exacerbations and 10% in mild asthma exacerbation. Nicholson et al, 9 also in a longitudinal study of adult asthmatics in the home, have shown objective evidence of RTI in 44% of asthma exacerbations.

Our prospective study was performed over a 12-month period and assessed the incidence of RTI in adults with acute asthma exacerbation requiring admission to a general hospital in metropolitan Melbourne, Australia.

This was a prospective study performed at a community hospital in the western suburbs of Melbourne, Australia. The study was approved by the hospital's Research and Ethics Committee. Patients and control subjects were recruited between August 1993 and July 1994. Each patient was matched on the basis of sex and age with a control subject and control subjects were recruited simultaneously with patients to avoid potential seasonal bias. Asthma patients received standard therapy with IV and/or oral steroids, bronchodilators, and antibiotics as required. Asthma patients were recruited via the Emergency Department of the hospital if admitted to the respiratory medical unit. Control subjects were recruited from elective surgical admissions. All subjects gave informed consent to enter the study. The diagnosis of asthma was defined on history and variability of peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) and/or of FEV 1 of at least 20% either with therapy or spontaneously.

All patients and control subjects underwent a detailed history, including questioning for subjective evidence of recent RTI and asthma symptoms. Nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA) was performed on each subject and the aspirate was cultured for influenza A and B, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), adenovirus, parainfluenza virus, rhinoviruses, coronaviruses, and herpes simplex virus at the Victorian Infectious Diseases Reference Laboratory (VIDRL), Fairfield, Victoria, Australia. The NPAs were performed with the patient in upright position. A fin e sterile nasal cannula was attached to a sterile suction trap and passed to the posterior nasopharynx via a nostril and suction applied. The cannula tip was withdrawn from the nasopharynx, inserted into sterile saline solution, and 5 mL of saline solution was suctioned into the trap container. All NPA specimens were examined within 24 h of sampling. All subjects underwent an initial first bleed serologic test and where possible had a furth er convalescent serum sample taken 2 to 3 weeks following admission to the study. Serum samples were examined for evidence of acute infection for Legionella species, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia infection via chlamydia! common antigen, and influenza A and B. The patients also had a chest radiograph, full blood examination, and sputum microscopy and culture assessment looking for eosinophils, neutrophils, and pathogens. If febrile at the time of hospital admission, the asthma patients had blood cultures taken.

The NPAs were cultured for viruses at the VIDRL. Culture for and identification of viruses were performed by techniques previously published. 10 -11 Sputum Microscopy and Culture Procedures Sputum was obtained from asthma patients if the patient had a productive cough. Microscopy was performed on all sputum after Gram's stain both at low power (XlOO) and with oil immersion lens. A qualitative report on leukocytes, squamous cells, and organisms was made on smear. Sputum was then cultured on horse blood agar (HBA) with Optichon disc {Becton-Dickinson; Sparks, Md), chocolate blood agar (CBA) with bacitracin and MacConkey agar at 35°C in C0 2 . The HBA and CBA plates were incubated for 48 h. If fungal elements were seen, the sputum was also cultured on a Subouraud dextrose agar with antibiotics for 7 days at 30°C. Cultures were reported as positive for pathogens if Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haenwphilus influenza were cultured. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and streptococci of groups A, B, C, or G, Staphylococcus aureus, and Klebsiella pneunwniae were considered pathogens on culture if the organism was predominant on smear, there were leukocytes present in the smear, and there was a clinical history of pneumonia.l2-1 4

Blood cultures were performed in an incubation and fluorescent reading system (Bactec 9240) as per manufacturer's hand book (Becton-Dickinson; Sparks, Md). Blood was injected into bottles for culture (Bactec Plus Aerobic F and Bactec anaerobic F).

First bleed and where possible second bleed serologic tests were performed at the VIDRL. Mycoplasma IgM titers were measured by reverse enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay technique (Diatech Diagnostics Ltd; Israel). Total antibodies to M pneunwniae were measured by passive particle agglutination test (Fujeribio Inc; Japan). Chlamydia psittaci antibodies were assessed by complement fixation test (CFT) using virion CFT antigen and Chlamydia control antigen (Virion Ltd; Rueschlikon, Switzerland). Influenza A and B antibodies were assessed by CFT (Whitakers Bioproducts; Md). Legionella antibodies were measured by immunofluorescence using anti-human IgA, IgG, IgM (H & L) \vith IgG fraction. Fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated (Silenus; Hawthorn, Australia) Legionella standard strains were obtained (American Type Culture Collection; Rockville, Md).

A diagnosis of recent RTI was made if subjects had one of the following: (1) fourfold increase in antibody titer of paired sera or high IgM antibody titer if only first bleed serologic test available;

(2) growth of viruses on NPA culture; (3) positive sputum culture for respiratory pathogen in association with sputum and blood neutrophilia and temperature >37.5°C on admission; and (4) negative serologic test res ult, NP A, and sputum culture but with chest radiographic evidence of lobar consolidation (not collapse or atelectasis), temperature >37.5°C on admission, and no evidence of allergic bronchopulmonmy aspergillosis on sputum sample, full blood examination, total IgE, and specific IgE to aspergillus.

Differences between patient and control groups were analyzed either by Mann-Whitney Rank Sum test or z-test to compare proportions \vith Yates' correction applied to calculations. Results were considered significantly different when p:50.05.

Seventy-nine patients with acute exacerbations of asthma who were hospitalized in the respiratory medical unit and 54 control subjects were recruited. In the study period, 155 adults were admitted to the hospital with acute exacerbation of asthma-ll8 to the respiratory medical unit and 37 to other medical units of the hospital. We chose to recruit only patients admitted to the respiratory medical unit because the patients admitted with asthma to other medical units also had evidence of other major medical illnesses that may have confounded our results. The 49 patients admitted to the respiratory medical unit and not recruited to trial were missed predominantly because of logistic reasons rather than refusal to enter the study. The major reasons for asthma patient nonrecruitment to the trial was admission to hospital over weekends and a 2-week period in April1994 when the physicians conducting the trial were on leave. Nonrecruitment into the trial was not related to season. The demographic characteristics of the patient and control groups are given in Table l .

The monthly patient admission numbers to the hospital and trial are shown in Figure l. Peak patient admissions to hospital occurred in late winter, all of spring, and early summer with less patient admissions occurring in late summer and autumn.

Twenty-nine patients (37%) had evidence of recent RTI compared with five of the control group (9%) (p<0.001) . Twenty-three patients (29%) had evidence of recent viral infection, predominantly influenza A and rhinoviruses, on serologic and/or NPA culture criteria ( Table 2) . Thirteen of the patients had evidence of recent influenza A infection, two had evidence of recent influenza B infection, and nine had evidence of recent rhinovirus infection. Five of the patients had evidence of more than one viral infection ( Table 2 ). There was a peak of influenza in the late winter and early spring period whereas rhinovirus infection occurred predominantly in early winter. Three patients with either DISCUSSION We have found evidence of recent RTI in 37% of adult patients admitted to hospital to the respiratory medical unit over a 12-month period with acute exacerbation of asthma. This is in contrast to early previous studies in which 10 to 21% of adult asthmatics have been found to have RTI present at time of acute exacerbations. 15 Indeed, Tarlo et al 1 6 in 1979 did not find an association between RTI and asthma exacerbation in adults. It has long been postulated that many asthma exacerbations are precipitated by RTI. In children it has been shown that asthma exacerbation is associated with respiratory tract infection in up to 45% of cases, though RTI is present in between 50% and 60% of asthmatic children studied without asthma exacerbation. 5 In the same study, 24% of children hospitalized with asthma had evidence of recent viral infection. Horn et alP however, found 50% of children with acute asthma exacerbation had evidence of rhinovirus infection in sputum. The higher rate of RTI in children with asthma exacerbation compared with adults has been thought to be partly due to the delayed presentation of adults for management and the more rapid clearing of viruses which often occurs in adults, leading to increased difficulty in isolation of viruses in adults. .. Older studies had difficulty in isolating rhinovirus and coronavirus infection and although we tried to culture for coronaviruses on NPA, we did not find infection with this organism, perhaps because of its fastidious nature. Our study has identified only one patient with evidence of recent Mycoplasma infection. As Mycoplasma infections occur in epidemics, this suggests that little Mycoplasma had occurred in the community during the patient recruitment period. We found that 11% of our patients had rhinovirus cultured from NPA and by combining NPA culture and viral serology, we also found an incidence of 19% influenza A or B infection in our patients. Our results for viral RTI associated with acute asthma exacerbation are lower than those of Nicholson et al 9 who prospectively studied 138 adult outpatient asthmatics. They found an incidence of 44% of nonbacterial pathogens in what they termed severe asthma episodes (mean decrease of PEFR > 100 Umin). They also found that 24% of laboratory-confirmed RTI were associated with mean decrease of PEFR :::::50 Umin on days 1 to 7. These authors were also able to identify coronavirus infections by a noncommercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay technique and rhinoviruses by seminested reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. 9 In a prospective study, Beasley e t al 8 assessed recent RTI in acute asthma exacerbations in adults in an outpatient setting. Though overall they found evidence of RTI in only 10% of acute asthma exacerbations, they state that the incidence of viral RTI with severe asthma exacerbation was 36%. The authors, however, did not specify the criteria for severity of asthma. They further found that 60% of those adult asthma patients who had evidence of RTI also had an exacerbation of asthma of varying severity. 8 To our knowledge, our study is only the second prospective work assessing the association of recent RTI in adults with acute asthma requiring hospitalization. Abramson et al, 18 in a case-control study of 38 patients older than 10 years admitted to hospital with acute asthma, found that 21% had evidence of recent viral RTI. The asthmatic group had 6.2 times more chance of having viral RTI than a control group. 18 Our study has a larger number of patients and we specifically assessed patients older than 18 years.

To reduce the likelihood that our findings may have been secondary to a high background incidence of RTI within the general community at the time of our study, we attempted to recruit control subjects who were age-and sex-matched with our patients. Because our control subjects were recruited simultaneously with the patients and were age-and sexmatched, there were some difficulties with recruiting over the entire 12-month period; however, it was clear that the rate of RTI within the control group was lower than the asthmatic patients. Our control subjects, however, were a selected group admitted to the hospital for elective surgery and our finding of 9% incidence of recent RTI may be an underestimation for the general community. Although we do not have incidence figures of RTI agents in the community during the time frame of our study, we have an indication of these pathogens in the community from data collected by VIDRL (N. Lehmann; personal communication; 1995).1 9 These data are taken from serologic, NP A, and sputum samples sent to the reference laboratory, from patients who are ill with RTI. Overall during winter, RSV was the predominant pathogen as it was in spring and the influenza viruses were common in early spring. Viral infections were uncommon in summer with adenoviruses and parainfluenza viruses being predominant, and during autumn, rhinoviruses, adenoviruses and parainfluenza viruses were common. From these figures, there did not seem to be an influenza or Mycoplasma outbreak in the community during the 12 months of our study (N. Lehmann; personal communication; 1995). 1 9 Indeed RSV, adenoviruses, and parainfluenza were noted frequently in the VIDRL data, but they were infrequently associated with asthma exacerbations in our study. The reasons for this are unclear; perhaps the latter infections occurred predominantly in children and/or are less likely to cause increase in bronchial reactivity in adults compared with the influenza viruses. 20 Data regarding pollen counts during the year in Melbourne show that 81% of total grass pollens per annum occur in November and December and tree pollens, mainly elm and cypress, predominate in late winter and early spring. 21 Taken together, these data suggest that in late winter and early spring, the population is exposed to a number of RTI pathogens and tree pollens that could potentially cause asthma. Whereas in summer, though RTI pathogens are less evident, grass pollens are abundant and in autumn and early winter, RTI pathogens are again common in the community. Our hospital admission rates for adult patients with acute asthma show that 55% of the patients were admitted in the five months August 1993 to December 1993 inclusive, whereas in the four months January 1994 to April 1994 inclusive, 20% of the year total number of patients were admitted (Fig 1) . It is therefore tempting to suggest that in our group of patients, the worst times for acute exacerbation of asthma are in late winter, all of spring, and early summer and are related to high levels of community RTI pathogens and high environmental pollen counts.

We believe that the incidence of 37% RTI occurring in adult patients with acute exacerbation of asthma requiring hospitalization could be underestimated because a number of the patients failed to return for their convalescent serum sample and as a result some viral infections may have been missed. In addition, we were unable to specifically culture for Chlamydia pneurrwniae (strain TW AR) infection, an organism that has previously been implicated in asthma exacerbations. 22 Further studies in adults with acute exacerbation of asthma using the polymerase chain reaction technique for viral identification may identify a higher incidence of RTI in adult subjects. 23 • 24 It is possible that we may have overestimated the frequency of RTI in our patients by using the criteria of chest radiograph consolidation in association with fever and blood neutrophilia as being diagnostic of infection. However, these criteria are used in routine clinical practice to diagnose pneumonia, and in studies of etiology of hospitalized community-acquired pneumonia, an infective organism is not identified in at least 30% of cases. 25 Similarly the isolation of an organism in the sputum is likely to be pathogenic in the setting of associated sputum neutrophilia and fever with or without chest radiograph abnormalities. Alternatively, we may have underestimated the number of patients with bacterial RTI because of antibiotic therapy prior to their admission to hospital. We do not have reliable data to confirm or deny this possibility, though most of the patients in the study denied recent antibiotic therapy.

An interesting clinical observation was the 43% frequency of fever in patients with acute exacerbation of asthma requiring hospitalization. One could postulate that the fever could be secondary to the inflammatory process of asthma alone. However, perhaps not surprisingly, in our population the find-ing of a fever was more common in those asthmatics with evidence of recent RTI compared to those without. Those patients with evidence of recent RTI but who were afebrile on admission to hospital may have exhibited ongoing increased bronchial reactivity secondary to an RTI that had occurred within the 4 weeks prior to hospitalization. There is evidence from both animal and human experimentation to support the concept that viral RTI cause ongoing bronchial inflammation and bronchial hyperreactivity.26·27 In addition, as previously stated, adult asthma patients may present to hospital late in the disease severity, so that even if there is evidence of recent RTI, the patients may be afebrile at time of hospitalization.

In summary, we believe this study demonstrates that there is a strong association of recent RTI with severe acute exacerbation of asthma in adults requiring hospitalization for their asthma. The 19% incidence of influenza infection in this group supports the view that in adults with significant long-term asthma, influenza vaccination on a y early basis would be advisable. 28 As 79% of RTI found in our patient group were viral, we suggest that antibiotic therapy be withheld in acute severe exacerbation of asthma unless there is a high clinical and microbiologic suspicion of acute bacterial infection.

Respiratory viral infections and the risk of rheumatoid arthritis,Background: We aimed to investigate the effects of ambient respiratory viral infections in the general population on rheumatoid arthritis (RA) development.,"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an immune-mediated disease involving interactions between genetic and environmental factors [1, 2] . It has been considered that a pre-clinical RA phase comprising the generation of autoantibodies in genetically susceptible individuals lasts months to years then transitions to a clinical RA event by virtue of other driving factors [2] . These driving factors are currently poorly understood, but it is suspected that microvascular, neuroregulatory, microtrauma-related, or transient infectiondependent pathways are involved [2, 3] .

We are interested in determining whether respiratory viral infections have the capacity to driving RA development, for several reasons. Smoking, periodontitis, and microbiomes-all prominent environmental risk factors for RA-interact with mucosal surfaces including the lungs, oral mucosa, and gastrointestinal tract [4] . It is thought that these local tissue stresses on the mucosa lead to post-translational modification of peptides involved in RA pathogenesis [2, 5, 6] . Initial respiratory virus infections usually involve both the oral mucosa and the lungs, and this may be relevant to the generation of immune responses potentially associated with RA development. Previous studies suggest that RA exhibits seasonal tendencies, whereby RA onset is more frequent in winter [7] , and relapses are more frequent in summer [8] . Thus, we hypothesized that respiratory viral infections that exhibit seasonality may be associated with RA development. This hypothesis is supported by studies investigating other autoimmune diseases [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] . Multiple sclerosis which exhibits seasonal tendencies has been associated with upper respiratory picornavirus, rhinovirus, and influenza infections [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] . Influenza virus infections triggered disease in a genetic model of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis [16] . Furthermore, the occurrence of pediatric Henoch-Schönlein purpura was highest in the spring and lowest in the summer, and it was associated with an outbreak of influenza [17] .

A few studies have investigated a potential link between respiratory viral infections and the development of RA [18, 19] . In the population-based case-control study, previous respiratory tract infections including sinusitis and tonsillitis treated with antibiotics, and pneumonia showed no association with a risk of RA [18] . In this study, it is not certain whether respiratory infections were caused by viruses or bacteria, but rather bacterial respiratory infections seemed to be considered more. Another study, however, showed that viral infection symptoms confirmed by questionnaire were more frequent in patients with a new-onset RA in the previous year compared to healthy control, but this was a small-sized study using 59 RA patients and 69 controls [19] .

Reliable data reflecting respiratory viral epidemic burden in South Korea are available, because the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) operates a wellestablished surveillance system for the detection of respiratory viruses via polymerase chain reaction (PCR) diagnosis in patients with respiratory symptoms [20, 21] . In addition, population-based incident RA can be identified via claims data because the Korean National Health Insurance (KNHI) covers almost the entire South Korean population.

In the present study, the effects of ambient respiratory viral infections on the number of incident RA in South Korea were investigated using national public data. First, patterns of incident RA over time were investigated using claims data. A time-series analysis was then conducted to investigate associations between the detection rate of ambient respiratory viral infections and the number of incident RA.

This is an ecological study design, and we used records from the KNHI claims database from 2011 to 2015. Patients' diagnoses recorded via the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems 10th Revision (ICD-10), procedures, prescriptions, type of institution or department, and individual beneficiary information were provided [22] . The protocol utilized in the present study was approved by the Institutional Ethics Review Board of St. Vincent's Hospital, Catholic University of Korea.

The algorithm for identifying RA using claims has been previously validated in Korea [23] and was recently updated by Won et al. [24] . In accordance with Won et al. [24] , we selected individuals aged ≥ 19 years with claims data pertaining to RA (ICD-10 codes M05 or M06). RA was deemed to be confirmed in cases in which a prescription for disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs was issued within 1 year of the RA code being assigned. Incident RA, which means new RA cases, has to be fulfilled 1-year window period (no codes or prescriptions for RA) and three consecutive years of treatment. Weekly number of incident RA was calculated from the first week of January 2012 to the last week of December 2013.

KCDC posts the incidences of respiratory virus infections each week on their website (http://cdc.go.kr) [20] . Nasopharyngeal specimens from patients with acute respiratory infections are collected from 36 sentinel hospitals located nationwide and subjected to respiratory viral genetic testing via multiplex PCR. Target viruses include influenza, parainfluenza, adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), rhinovirus, coronavirus, metapneumovirus, and bocavirus.

The detection rate of respiratory virus was calculated as a proportion of patients who are confirmed for viral infection by PCR among those with acute respiratory viral infection symptoms who visited sentinel hospitals. Because we hypothesized that respiratory viral infections would exhibit a delayed association with incident RA rather than an immediate effect, the detection rates of eight respiratory viruses were collected from the first week of November 2011, which is 8 weeks prior to the start date of the collection of incident RA data, to the last week of December 2013.

Data pertaining to the potentially confounding factors with regard to the viral detection rates and RA diagnoses were obtained from public websites. We obtained hourly air pollution data including particulate matter < 10 μg/ m 3 in aerodynamic diameter (PM 10 ) and ozone (O 3 ) from the website airkorea.gov.kr [25] , operated by the Korean Ministry of Environment. Meteorological data reflecting hourly measurements of temperature, humidity, and solar radiation were obtained from the website maintained by the Korea Meteorological Administration [26] . The hourly mean of all variables was calculated by using obtained raw data in each station and converted to daily means. Next, the daily metrological data were converted into weakly means, then these means were analyzed in conjunction with the respiratory viral infection data. As with the respiratory viral detection rate data, the meteorological data were collected from the first week of November 2011 to the last week of December 2013.

To identify the groups who were significant to the effects of ambient respiratory viral infections on the number of incident RA, a subgroup analysis was conducted based on age, sex, and the presence or absence of respiratory disease prior to RA development. Age groups were categorized as < 40 years, 40-59 years, and ≥ 60 years based on previously reported definitions of young-onset and elderly-onset RA [27] . The presence of respiratory diseases was defined as cases with respiratory disease codes during the 12 months prior to RA diagnosis. Respiratory disease codes were extracted from ICD-10 codes (I27.8, I27.9, J40.x-J47.x, J60.x-J67.x, J68.4, J70.1, J70.3) for Charlson comorbidity index analysis [28] .

Because respiratory virus data are provided by the source as nationwide totals, all other data were analyzed as nationwide totals. First, generalized additive modeling (GAM) with integrated smoothness estimation was used to investigate the relationships between detection rates of eight respiratory viruses and the numbers of incident RA cases. Generalized linear modeling (GLM) was then used to estimate the effects of eight respiratory viruses on the numbers of incident RA cases after adjusting for potential confounders.

Degrees of freedom (df) for each confounding factor was determined based on the unbiased risk estimation derived from the GAM. Potential confounders used in the model were PM 10 with 9 df, O 3 with 9 df, mean temperature with 8 df, mean humidity with 9 df, solar radiation with 9 df, and the natural cubic splines (ns) of time trend with 4 df per year (4 df × 2 years = 8 df). To consider delayed and cumulative effects of respiratory viral infections on incident RA, we used the moving average lag up to eight lag weeks (lag1-8). For example, ""lag1-8"" refers to a moving average lag model for respiratory viral infections over the previous 8 weeks. Confounder lag weeks were also matched with those of each virus in GLM. To determine the greatest respiratory viral effect on incident RA, we selected the lag associated with the highest beta for each virus then analyzed the statistical significance of the effect size at the selected lag week in each virus.

SAS statistical software (version 9.4, SAS, Cary, NC, USA) was used for data collation. All statistical analyses were performed using R software (version 3.5.1, The R Project for Statistical Computing, www.r-project.org). A P value < .05 was considered statistically significant.

From January 2012 to December 2013, the total number of patients newly diagnosed with RA was 24,117. Of these, 18,688 (77.5%) were females, and the mean age at RA diagnosis was 54.7 (SD 13.2) years (Table 1) . Almost all patients (95.0%) had a national health insurance. The proportion of institutions that reported patients who were diagnosed with a new RA was 44.6%, 23.8%, and 31.6% in clinics, general hospitals, and tertiary hospitals, respectively (Additional file 1: Table S1 ).

The analysis revealed a seasonal tendency of incident RA in each year (Fig. 1 ). In 2012, the number of incident RA increased from January (n = 781) to July (n = 1274) then decreased to December (n = 775) (Additional file 1: Table S2 ). July had the highest number of incident RA cases, and December had the lowest. We observed a similar seasonality in 2013. In that year, the number of incident RA cases increased from January (n = 1057) to July (n = 1212) then decreased to December (n = 853). The differences in the weekly mean number of incident RA cases were compared between the top peaks in July and other months. A significantly lower number of weekly incident RA cases were observed from September to February in both 2012 and 2013 (Additional file 1: Table S2 ). Men and women showed the same seasonal pattern for the number of incident RA (Additional file 1: Figure S1 ). 

Most viruses showed seasonal tendencies between 2012 and 2013 (Additional file 1: Figure S2 ). Outbreaks of parainfluenza virus and bocavirus tended to occur in late spring and early summer. RSV tended to be diagnosed in the autumn. Outbreaks of influenza occurred in winter, and coronavirus tended to be diagnosed from November to December. Rhinovirus was prevalent from spring to autumn, but only exhibited an outbreak in the autumn of 2012, not in the autumn of 2013. Metapneumovirus was infrequent but tended to be diagnosed in late winter and spring. Adenovirus did not exhibit any seasonal tendencies. The associations between the detection rate of respiratory viral infections and the number of incident RA were investigated using GAM. At lag1w, fluctuations in associations were observed for all viruses except bocavirus (Additional file 1: Figure S3 ). As the lag structure changed from lag1w to lag1-8w, however, the fluctuations in the associations gradually disappeared and the association became more apparent and more linear for some viruses. This suggests that ambient respiratory viral infections are associated with an increased number of incident RA after a moderate time interval, rather than having an immediate effect.

Three viruses were significantly associated with the number of incident RA in time-series analysis ( Table 2 ). The number of incident RA increased by 4.8% with an incremental increase of 1% in the parainfluenza virus detection rate at lag1-7w (P = 0.003). At lag1-6w, coronavirus and metapneumovirus were associated with respective increases in the number of incident RA of The moving average lag up to 8 lag weeks (lag1-8) was used in the analysis. For example, ""lag1-8"" refers to a moving average lag model for respiratory viral infections over the previous 8 weeks CI confidence interval a Relative risk adjusted for mean particulate matter < 10 μg/m 3 in aerodynamic diameter, ozone, temperature, humidity, amount of solar exposure, and seasonality 9.2% (P < .001) and 44.0% (P = 0.038) with an incremental increase of 1% in virus detection rate. The visualized associations with integrated smoothness estimation of these respiratory viruses are shown in Fig. 2a -c.

In women, all three viruses were significantly associated with incident RA (P < .05), but in men, only parainfluenza virus was (P = 0.019) ( Table 3) . Elderly-onset RA in patients aged ≥ 60 years was significantly associated with all three viruses (P < .05). Only parainfluenza virus was significantly associated with incident RA in patients aged under 40 years (P = 0.034), and in patients aged 40-59 years, none of the three viruses was significantly associated with incident RA. The presence or absence of preexisting respiratory diseases showed a different association with each virus; that is, coronavirus was only associated with the number of incident RA cases in the absence of other respiratory conditions, while metapneumovirus showed the opposite results, i.e., a significant association (79.18% change in risk per 1-unit change in exposure, P = 0.034) in the presence of a respiratory disease, but not in disease absence (23.87% change in risk per 1-unit change in exposure, P = 0.352).

The idea of infections acting as a trigger for the development of RA has been suggested for a quite long time without much clarification. In this study, the number of weekly incident RA cases exhibited an inverted Ushaped seasonal tendency throughout each year. In addition, the detection rate for ambient respiratory viral infections in the population was associated with an increased number of incident RA cases, which suggests a possible role for respiratory infections as a trigger for the development of RA.

Seasonal tendencies of RA onset or relapse have been evaluated in a small number of studies. In an Italian study including 44 RA patients, there was no seasonal tendency [29] . In the UK between 1957 and 1963, 43 of the 100 patients had reported that RA occurred during the winter [7] . In a more recent study using data from the year 2000 in Israel, RA relapse occurred mostly during the summer [8] . These studies were conducted many years ago with small study groups. Advances in the understanding of RA and in diagnostic tools have since changed the reported characteristics of patients with RA. Thus, there is a need to reevaluate seasonal patterns of RA using recent data derived from large groups.

In the present study, population-based incident RA diagnoses in 2012 and 2013 were used, which is more reliable. Notably, however, observations pertaining to the seasonality of RA in the study should be interpreted with caution. The index date of incident RA is not the date of onset, rather it is the date that RA is diagnosed by physicians. The onset of RA may precede its diagnosis by several weeks or months [30] . Nevertheless, a distinct seasonal pattern of incident RA determined based on the date of diagnosis could be explained by the role of respiratory viral infections in inflammation. Respiratory viral infections may play a role in the exacerbation of inflammation involving joints in patients with subclinical or early-stage RA, prompting patients to visit the hospital.

Several mechanisms of virus-induced initiating or triggering of autoimmune disease have been suggested [31, 32] : (1) ""Molecular mimicry"" is the most widely proposed mechanism and occurs when a virus antigen mimics a host antigen and activates cross-reactive T cells. (2) ""Epitope spreading"" is another potential mechanism. Tissue damage resulting from virus-specific T cell activation or direct virus-mediated host tissue destruction causes de novo activation of autoreactive T Fig. 2 Effects of ambient respiratory viral infections on incident RA. Parainfluenza (a), coronavirus (b), and metapneumovirus (c) infection. The xand y-axes represent the weekly virus detection rate as a percentage and difference from the mean log relative risk of incident RA, respectively. Solid lines represent the associations between the weekly virus detection rate and weekly number of incident RA cases, and the gray area represents 95% confidence intervals for the risk cells and releases self-antigens into the inflammatory environment. (3) ""Bystander activation"" is the activation of autoreactive T cells as a result of the release of cytokines during a virus-targeted immune response. (4) Encrypted host antigens are released from certain tissues during virus-targeted tissue damage. (5) ""Superantigens"" activate a wide range of nonspecific T cell clones regardless of their specificity. In this study, however, we could only reveal the association between respiratory viruses and incident RA, but not investigate the possible mechanisms as this is an ecological study.

In our study, parainfluenza, coronavirus, and metapneumovirus were significantly associated with the number of incident RA. The patterns of virus seasonality, the severity or virulence of infections, and the parameters such as peak age of viral infections have differential effects on the associations between each respiratory virus and incident RA. The similarity of the three significant respiratory viruses in the study has not been elucidated The moving average lag up to 8 lag weeks (lag1-8) was used in the analysis. For example, ""lag1-8"" refers to a moving average lag model for respiratory viral infections over the previous 8 weeks CI confidence interval a Relative risk adjusted for mean particulate matter < 10 μg/m 3 in aerodynamic diameter, ozone, temperature, humidity, amount of solar exposure, and seasonality by one of the factors described above. More complex interactions among these virus factors or other environmental factors may be involved.

Regarding the confounding factors, we adjusted for meteorological factors and air pollution data, which could affect the seasonality of the number of incident RA cases. Considering the unmeasured confounders associated with seasonality, we also adjusted the time trend in the generalized linear model to avoid overestimation of the effects of respiratory viral infection on the number of incident RA cases. Nevertheless, other factors that could explain why the number of incident RA cases increased in July could exist. This point indicates we should be cautious in interpreting these results.

It was interesting that the effects of ambient respiratory viral infections in the population on the number of incident RA differed according to sex, although men and women showed the same seasonal pattern for the number of incident RA cases. Only the parainfluenza virus was significant in men while all three viruses were significant in women. The relatively small sample size of men might have affected this difference. Also, a stronger immune response in women could affect this difference [33] . Stronger immunity to pathogens in women is associated with lower viral loads and lower prevalence of infections than in men, but it may also be associated with increased severity of disease symptoms [34] . For example, HIV-positive women tend to exhibit less circulating HIV RNA than HIV-positive men, but they are reportedly at a 1.6-fold higher risk of developing AIDS [35] . Fatality following exposure to pathogenic influenza A viruses is higher in women [36, 37] . It may be that respiratory viral infections result in stronger inflammation in women than in men, and trigger stronger immune responses, and this results in a differential proportion of incident RA in women and men. However, the virus data in relation to sex was not available for analysis in the present study.

Viral arthritis is distinct from autoimmune disease-associated polyarthritis. Viral arthritis is usually self-limiting, and treatment with immunosuppressants is usually not required [38] . To exclude viral arthritis in the present study, only individuals who underwent treatment for 3 years were included. Additionally, treatment was required to include immunosuppressants. Thus, the seasonal tendency of RA diagnosis and the association between ambient respiratory viral infections in the population and incident RA in the study are unlikely to be an effect of transient viral arthritis.

The current study had some limitations. A causal association between ambient respiratory viral infections in the population and incident RA could not be proven because this is an ecological study where it is not known whether the individuals with RA also had viral infections. A clear causal association between respiratory viral infections and RA development remains to be proven via future individual-level data study. In addition, many respiratory viral infections, especially in the case of mild symptoms, would not have been detected at hospitals, hence would not have been listed in the nationwide database. Further study including all the patients with acute respiratory infection symptoms, not based on PCR, confirmed infection would also be valuable when investigating possible associations between respiratory infections and RA development.

In the present study, RA development exhibited a seasonal tendency, and ambient parainfluenza, coronavirus, and metapneumovirus infections were associated with an increased number of incident RA. These results support the etiological hypothesis that respiratory viral infections in the population may have the capacity to trigger RA.

Viral Infection in Adults with Severe Acute Respiratory Infection in Colombia,To identify the viral aetiology in adult patients with severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) admitted to sentinel surveillance institutions in Bogotá in 2012.,"Acute respiratory infection is one of the main causes of hospitalization and death worldwide, although identification of the aetiological agent is not achieved in a majority of cases. Instead, the infections are treated empirically and often successfully with antimicrobial therapy. Nonetheless, the roles of viruses in the aetiology of these infections are becoming clear, especially after the 2009 pandemic of the new Influenza A subtype H1N1 [1] . The presence of a virus does not imply either a more benign clinical course or that systemic inflammatory responses or complications will be absent [2] .

Due to its implications for Public Health, the efforts in reinforcing and improving the epidemiological surveillance of respiratory infections have increased. Under this initiative, countries have developed surveillance systems by following cases of influenza-like illness and severe acute respiratory infections (SARIs), which are clinically diagnosed among patients with fever, coughing or sore throat, difficulty breathing and the need for hospitalization [3] . The main aims of surveillance have been to provide information on circulating viruses and the susceptibility of Influenza to available antivirals and also to promote and define vaccination needs in different populations.

The true impact of viral infections in the aetiology of acute respiratory disease requiring hospitalization is unknown [4] . The aims of this study were to identify viral aetiologies in hospitalized adult patients with SARI in Bogotá in 2012 and to describe the characteristics and clinical outcomes among these patients.

This study was performed in Colombia's capital city of Bogotá, which is located in the Andes in South America, near the equator and 2,600 metres above sea level. A total of 7 tertiary care hospitals performing sentinel surveillance of SARI during 2012 participated in the study. Such hospitals forwarded all respiratory samples from patients with SARI to the District Health Department. SARI was defined as any respiratory infection with a possible viral and/or bacterial origin requiring inpatient management and a clinical presentation of fever of less than 14 days after onset and higher than 38°C, shortness of breath, cough, hypoxia and systemic compromise (systemic inflammatory response syndrome or organ failure), depending on symptom severity [5] . The samples were taken via nasopharyngeal aspiration or swab. The samples were sent, together with the required basic epidemiological data collection form, through the Epidemiological Surveillance System (Sistema de Vigilancia Epidemiológica Nacional-Sivigila). Samples were sent in a viral transport medium to the Public Health Laboratory of the District Health Department, where they were stored between 4 and 8°C in refrigerators intended for this purpose.

need for intensive care, the use of mechanical ventilation and the length of hospital stay. Inclusion criteria consisted of patients over 18 years of age who provided a respiratory sample in 2012 at one of the hospitals performing sentinel surveillance. Patients with incomplete medical records from the sampling institution were excluded. The following research and ethics committees of each participating institution approved the study: , with the exception of one institution that requested written informed consent to access medical records (Fundación Cardioinfantil, Instituto de Cardiología). Written consent was obtained from 25 participants or their proxies (in case of death) from that institution (39 patients were not found, did not respond or refused to provide written consent). Written informed consent, in the cases in which was requested and obtained, was kept at Universidad Nacional de Colombia.

A total of 288 nasopharyngeal aspiration or swab samples were taken during 2012 from adult patients of the 7 hospitals. The sample was randomly selected, with the only inclusion criteria being patients older than 18 years of age with SARI reported to the surveillance system during that year. A sample size calculation found that 117 respiratory samples were needed for a prevalence of 25%, with the poorest accepted result of 20%, 90% power and a 95% confidence level. However, because 150 molecular tests could be processed, the sample was increased to 150 patients. Subsequently, the medical records were reviewed, and after the approval and authorisation of the research and ethics committee of each institution, the information was gathered from each hospital.

A microarray diagnostic assay using CLART 1 PneumoVir equipment by Genomica (Madrid, Spain) was used to identify the viruses involved [6] . This assay detects and characterises viruses that most frequently cause respiratory symptoms in humans. The following viruses were analysed: Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) A and B, Influenza A (H1N1, H3N2, 2009 A/H1N1 pdm), B and C virus, Parainfluenza virus subtypes 1, 2, 3, 4A and 4B, Metapneumovirus A and B, Adenovirus, Enterovirus, Rhinovirus, Coronavirus subtype 229E and Bocavirus. This kit amplifies specific fragments of the viral genome via a reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or via a PCR with hybridisation detection using specific capture probes [7] .

The following variables were collected from the patients' medical histories according to international definitions: age, gender and comorbidities such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes mellitus and heart failure. The inclusion criteria took into account the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), which was defined as a heart rate over 90 beats per minute, a breathing rate of over 20 breaths per minute, leukocytosis of over 12,000 cells per millilitre or leukopenia of fewer than 4,000 cells per millilitre and fever; pneumonia among SARI patients was diagnosed from radiological findings of consolidation or alveolar infiltrates. The Confusion, Urea, Respiratory Rate and Blood Pressure (CURB)-65 scores for pneumonia were applied using the criteria of age greater than or equal to 65 years, impaired consciousness, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) over 20 mg/dl, breathing rate above 30 breaths per minute and a systolic arterial pressure under 90 mmHg or a diastolic pressure under 60 mmHg [8] . Additionally, severe pneumonia was considered among patients complying with the following major and minor criteria of the American Thoracic Society/Infectious Disease Society of America (ATS/IDSA): shock, need for mechanical ventilation, thrombocytopenia (platelets under 100,000), an Arterial Oxygen Partial Pressure to Fractional Inspired Oxygen Ratio (PaO 2 /FiO 2 ) ratio, multilobar compromise, impaired consciousness, leukopenia (under 4,000) and BUN over 20 mg/dl [9] . Shock was also considered when the systolic arterial pressure was below 90 mmHg or when the diastolic arterial pressure was under 60 mmHg. Moderate oxygenation impairment was defined by a PaO 2 /FiO 2 below 220 mmHg and over 160 mmHg, and severe oxygenation impairment was defined by an index less than or equal to 160 mmHg. Institutions that identified viral antigens following institutional protocols performed and interpreted these tests in their hospitals. Colonisation of the airway was defined as the presence of microorganisms in a Gram test or in a culture of the airway. Gram tests and sputum cultures or other respiratory samples were performed based on clinical decisions made by the doctor from the institution. A viral co-infection diagnosis was made when 2 or more different viruses were identified in the same sample.

The chi-square test and Fisher's exact test were used to compare categorical variables, and the comparison of continuous variables was performed with either Student's T test or the Mann-Whitney U test on a case-by-case basis. The variable analysis was performed using Stata (ver. 11.0), and P values less than 0.05 were considered significant. Odds ratios (OR) with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI) were used to analyse outcomes.

In 2012 in Bogotá, 288 samples from respiratory secretions were collected in the sentinel surveillance system from patients over 18 years of age. Through randomised sampling, 150 cases of SARI were selected from those respiratory samples (Fig 1) . The medical histories of 99 patients with SARI reported through the surveillance system were examined. These histories were obtained from 7 Bogota hospitals in 2012 according to the following distribution: 45 (45.5%) were from the San Rafael University Hospital Clinic, 23 (23%) were from Fundación CardioInfantil, 10 (10%) were from Suba Hospital, 9 (9.1%) were from El Tunal Hospital, 6 (6%) were from Santa Clara Hospital, 3 (3%) were from San Ignacio University Hospital, and 3 (3%) were from the Occidente de Kennedy Hospital. Of the 99 patients, 8 showed disease progression beyond 14 days and were dismissed from the final analysis (Fig 1) .

Of the 91 patients included in the analysis, 50 (55%) were female; the patients' average age was 50.6 years (range, 18 to 95 years). Table 1 shows the most frequent comorbidities identified. The average length of disease progression was 5.1 days, with a minimum duration of hours and a maximum duration of 14 days (Table 2) . Radiographical abnormalities were observed in 65 patients. The following radiological findings of chest images were described in the medical histories, in order of frequency: 32 patients had interstitial infiltrates (35.1%), 27 had alveolar infiltrates (29.6%), 26 had consolidation (28.6%), 21 had multilobar compromise (23.1%), and 19 had pleural effusion at admission (20.9%). Pleural effusion was found in 15.3% of the patients with alveolar infiltrates and 13.2% of the patients with interstitial infiltrates. We Among the SARI patients, 82 (90.1%) were treated with antibiotics; patients received between 1 and 7 antibiotics, with an average of 2.3 antibiotics per patient. Antibiotics were started a median of 1 day after admission (range, 0 to 21 days, 95% CI: 0-7 days). The beta-lactam group was the most frequently used. Oseltamivir was used in 72.5% of cases (66 patients), with a minimum duration of 1 day, a maximum duration of 10 days and an average duration of 4.2 days. Oseltamivir was started a median of 1 day after admission (range, 0 to 21 days, 95% CI: 0-9 days).

At least one virus was identified in 63 patients (Table 3) . Influenza virus was the most common and was isolated in 28 patients (30.8%), of whom 21 (75%) had Influenza A and 7 (25%) had Influenza B (Table 3) . Of the Parainfluenza virus subtypes identified, five cases were PIV 3, and one case was PIV 1.

In the group with more than one viral infection ( 

Influenza and Bocavirus were identified throughout the year, though cases of Influenza were commonly found in May, August and September, and cases of Bocavirus were commonly found in June and November. Influenza B was identified only in the second semester, while the two cases of Influenza A/H2N3 were seen in May. Adenovirus was seen only during the rainy season (April to May and August to November); most cases of Metapneumovirus, Parainfluenza and RSV were seen only in the first semester, specifically in April and May; the two cases of Coronavirus were identified in May (Fig 2) .

Patients with and without viral detection did not differ in terms of comorbidity, with the exception of the frequency of diabetes mellitus. Diabetes was detected in 4.8% of patients with viral detection and 20.8% of patients without viral detection (Fisher's exact test, P = 0.034). Of the patients with pneumonia, a virus was identified in 28 patients (73.7%). Severe pneumonia was diagnosed in 62.5% of patients without viral detection and 60.1% of patients with viral detection. No significant differences were observed between the groups with and without viral detection with regards to SIRS, neutropenia during hospitalization or shock.

Of the 22 patients with SARI and a history of COPD, viruses were identified in 16 (72.7%), 5 of whom had viral co-infections. The viruses were distributed as follows: 6 cases of Bocavirus, 4 of Adenovirus, 3 of Influenza A, 3 of Parainfluenza, 3 of RSV, 2 of Metapneumovirus, 1 of Coronavirus and 1 of Rhinovirus. Of the 91 patients, 13 were active smokers and 9 (69.2%) had a viral infection, with Bocavirus being the most frequently isolated (33.3%) virus. 

With regards to complications, pleural effusion developed in 12.5% of patients without viral identification and 19% of patients with viral identification; closed thoracotomy was required in 4.2% of patients without viral identification and 3.2% of patients with viral identification; inpatient infection was present in 8.3% and 3.2% of patients without and with viral identification, respectively; and underlying disease complications were found in 25% of patients without viral identification and 38.1% of patients with viral identification. These differences were not statistically significant. Patients with chronic pneumopathy showed more complications in their underlying pathologies (77.3% vs. 20.3%, OR: 13.5; CI 95%: 3.5-52.7). A total of 14 (15.4%) patients died. However, two cases included either an inadequate sample for PCR or no PCR amplification; thus, the outcome analysis was performed for 12 patients. Mortality was reported for 4 cases (16.7%) in the group without viral identification and 8 cases (12.7%) in the group with viral identification (P = 0.23, OR: 0.72; 95% CI: 0.17-3.68) ( Table 4) . Mechanical ventilation was required for 33 patients (36.3%); this intervention was invasive in 24 (26.4%) patients, non-invasive in 13 (14.3%) patients and invasive and non-invasive in 4 (3.6%) patients. This outcome occurred among 7 patients (29.2%) without viral identification and 23 patients (36.5%) with viral identification (P = 0.41, OR: 1.4; 95% CI: 0.46-4.59). The average length of mechanical ventilation was 7 days, with a minimum of 1 day and a maximum of 20 days. Thirty-nine (42.9%) patients were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU); 3 had unsuitable samples or non-amplified PCR results, 9 (37.5%) were from the group without an isolated virus, and 27 (42.9%) were from the group with an isolated virus (P = 0.21, OR 1.25; 95% CI: 0.43-3.75). One case with viral identification was readmitted to the unit with an identification of Influenza subtype AH1N1. The average length of ICU stay was 8.4 days, with a range between 1 and 21 days. The group with an isolated virus had an average ICU stay of 3.8 days, with a range between 1 and 21 days, and the group without an isolated virus had an average stay of 2.8 days, with a range between 1 and 13 days (P > 0.05). The average hospital stay in the SARI group was 9.9 days, with a range between 1 and 45 days, with average stays of 10.6 and 9.8 days for patients with and without a virus, respectively (P = 0.6). Among patients without a virus, the hospital stay varied between 1 and 45 days, while patients with a virus had hospital stays that varied between 1 and 28 days.

Of the 8 patients from the viral infection group who died, Bocavirus was isolated in 5, Influenza was isolated in 4 (all cases of Influenza A), Metapneumovirus was isolated in 3, and RSV was isolated in 1. Of the patients with Bocavirus isolation, 19.2% died. Death occurred in 14.3% of those in whom Influenza was identified, 50% of those in whom Metapneumovirus was identified and 20% of those in whom RSV was identified. Among patients with viral identification who died, 5 (62.5%) had viral infections of 2 or more viruses (P = 1.7, OR: 2.4; 95% CI: 0.46-18.89), and fewer had only one virus detected. No statistically significant differences were observed in the outcomes of the remaining patients with mixed viral infection, which does not confirm higher morbidity in patients with more viruses isolated.

The diagnosis of acute respiratory infections is common and apparently easy to perform; however, the determination of the infection's causal agent is more complex, as current diagnostic tools are limited and rarely available in primary health care centres or even in hospitals in much of the world [10] . The role of viruses and their prevalence is a matter of debate and discussion, and findings vary worldwide. The results from studies in New Zealand, Spain and more recently in the United Kingdom report prevalence rates of 28% [11] , 18% [12] ,and 44% [13] , respectively. In our study, viruses were identified as the most frequent causal agents of SARI requiring hospitalization in 2012, with most cases showing a high rate of viral co-infection, a high degree of morbidity, prolonged hospital stays and frequent needs for ICU management and mechanical ventilation.

The definition of SARI used in this study is of great utility from an epidemiological surveillance perspective, which is known as syndrome surveillance or surveillance of syndromes [14] . Nonetheless, the results reported here demonstrate its clinical relevance and potential utility in this field, as it appears to identify potentially severe patients and those with high complication rates; thus, the definition's routine use should be considered during the performance of clinical duties. Furthermore, current challenges in the epidemiological surveillance of viral respiratory tract infections include the early and fast identification of aetiological agents, especially at the beginnings of outbreaks, and the optimal and timely management of a large number of samples [14] . Our study suggests that molecular technology makes it possible to closely follow circulating viruses in these groups of patients. In contrast to the epidemiological definition used, the CURB-65 index of pneumonia was not useful, as only 10 (26%) scored for general hospitalization and none scored for ICUs using these criteria. This finding contrasts with the high number of our patients who required ICU care, which agrees with findings in the literature that applied this scale in cases of viral pneumonia during the Influenza A subtype H1N1 pandemic of 2009; these results demonstrate its low value for detecting either severity or the need for ICU admission in patients with viral pneumonia [15] . These findings represent a marked difference in severity stratification between Influenza-related pneumonia and pneumonia caused by other aetiological agents, indicating the importance of clinical judgement in this scenario [16] . The application of these scales in non-Influenza viral pneumonia has yet to be assessed. Moreover, a recent multicentre study of adults with radiographically confirmed pneumonia has shown that viruses are now the most commonly identified pathogens. Human Rhinovirus and Influenza virus are more frequently found than Streptococcus pneumoniae [17] . Together, viruses represent a quarter of patients and more than half of the pathogens identified.

The mortality rate was relatively high for patients both with and without communityacquired pneumonia. A study performed in the United States reported a low mortality rate in patients hospitalized for viral infection; nonetheless, bacterial co-infection increased both the morbidity and the mortality [18] . This variable should be considered for our patients. Countries with marked seasons report a correlation of Influenza with high mortality due to respiratory infections, which is usually related to community-acquired pneumonia [19] . This seasonal pattern of acute respiratory infections, especially viral infections due to Influenza, is dependent on temperature, humidity and host factors, such as serum vitamin D levels [20] . Colombia is located in the tropics and thus lacks seasons; however, this study confirms that these infections, especially those caused by Influenza and RSV infections, increase during the rainy season in countries at these latitudes [21] . This pattern shows the importance of epidemiological surveillance, especially during the seasons when viruses circulate, because it may increase control and prevention strategies such as timely vaccinations.

Techniques based on identifying nucleic acids, such as those used in this study, can obtain more rapid and precise results for diagnosing viral infections in order to provide appropriate and managed medical care [22] . There is limited information on the diagnostic utility of these new tests. A study by Sultankulova et al. compared viral isolation of Influenza A with DNA [23] . Microarray technology showed a higher sensitivity (99.5%) and similar specificity (98.5%) to real-time PCR. However, another study with the same microarray kit used in this study showed a high specificity (100%) and low sensitivity (52%) in the clinical scenario of atypical pneumonia [24] . A study in Japan using near patient automated microarray technology showed not only a higher sensitivity and specificity compared to immunochromatographic antigen detection (the gold standard used was virus isolation) but also quicker results for children infected with Influenza and RSV [25] . A recent multicentre study in the United States using real-time PCR technology was able to precisely and reproducibly detect all Adenovirus infections in a group of children and adults with respiratory infections, which increased the possibility of establishing a clear diagnosis [26] . Taken together, use of molecular technology for the diagnosis of viral infections can improve detection and identify the cases in which antibiotic use might be inadequate. The use of antibiotics in acute respiratory infections is indiscriminate and excessive, and according to worldwide literature, is employed in more than half of all respiratory infections [27] . This study determined that 90% of the cases are treated with antibiotics, although most of the infections were viral in origin. Additional strategies, such as the measurement of procalcitonin, can identify patients who would not benefit from antibiotic therapy [28] . This study has several limitations. Although it was multicentre in design, the information was gathered from only one city in Colombia. One important limitation is that it is a retrospective study; thus, it was not possible to control viral and bacterial sampling, and there was limited access to relevant data, such as previous Influenza or pneumococcal vaccination history or co-morbidity measurement. The sample size was smaller than expected, although the prevalence of viral infection was higher than expected. Together, all of these limitations lead to difficulties in establishing significant comparisons among the groups and in appropriately assessing the impact of co-morbidity and bacterial co-infection in the outcomes, especially in relation to the role of pneumococcus [29] . Other limitations include the difficulty of defining the actual roles of certain viruses, such as Bocavirus and Rhinovirus, in respiratory infection, which are also detected in asymptomatic patients according to descriptions in the literature [4] . The empirical use of antibiotics in most cases, without using additional tools to confirm bacterial infection, is also a limitation.

Correlation of viral load of respiratory pathogens and co-infections with disease severity in children hospitalized for lower respiratory tract infection,"Background: The clinical significance of viral load and co-infections in children with respiratory infections is not clear. Objective: To evaluate the correlation of viral load as well as viral and bacterial co-infections with disease severity in hospitalized children with lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs). Study design: This is a prospective study conducted in children admitted for LRTIs for two seasons. To determine viral and bacterial load of respiratory pathogens we performed multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction and semiquantitative bacterial cultures on nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPA). Results: During the study period 244 (60%) children were hospitalized for LRTI with acute virus-induced wheezing and 160 (40%) for radiologic confirmed pneumonia. In the first NPA, viruses were identified in 315 (78%) of the 404 samples and bacteria in 198 (63.3%) of 311 samples. The viral load significantly decreased between the first and second NPA sample in most single and viral co-infections, except rhinovirus and human bocavirus infections. Viral load was inversely related to CRP in RSV infections, whereas a positive correlation was observed in adenovirus infections. Duration of hospitalization was significantly longer in RSV single infections compared to rhinovirus single infections whereas in the latter, leucocytosis and use of systemic steroids was more common. In RSV viral co-infections the presence of fever, leucocytosis, and the use of antibiotics was significantly more frequent. Positive cultures of Haemophilus influenzae dominated in RSV and rhinovirus single infections and Moraxella catarrhalis in RSV viral co-infections. Conclusions: Specific viral single and co-infections as well as viral load contribute to disease severity in children with LRTIs.","The majority of infections of the lower respiratory tract (LRTI) in children are caused by viruses. 1 A great variety of respiratory viruses have repeatedly been detected in acute LRTI including influenza virus types A and B, parainfluenza virus type 1, 2 and 3, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), rhinovirus, enterovirus and adenovirus. 2, 3 This panel of viruses has recently been expanded by newly discovered viruses like human metapneumovirus (HMPV), 4 coronavirus, 5 and human bocavirus (hBoV). 6 Several previous studies have shown that the virus type and viral load may influence the clinical characteristics of infection. 7, 8 The presence of more than one type of virus in the respiratory specimen may also affect the clinical presentation of LRTI. 7, 9 However, many aspects of the relationship between the type of virus, the number of viruses detected, their quantity in respiratory secretions and the severity of illness in children remain unclear.

Many of the bacteria detected during a respiratory infection in cultures from respiratory secretions are commensals of the upper respiratory tract. They often contaminate respiratory samples making the assessment of their causal role for lower respiratory tract infection difficult. 10 Interactions between viruses and bacteria have been described. 1, 3 Pneumococcal conjugate vaccination has been found to reduce the risk of virus-associated pneumonia, pointing to clinically relevant interactions between bacterial pathogens and viral pneumonia. 11 A correlation between bacterial colonization and viral infection in LRTI merits further investigation.

To perform a prospective clinical study to investigate the correlation between the type, number and quantity of respiratory viruses and bacteria in the nasopharyngeal aspirate by multiplex real-time (RT)-PCR and semiquantitative bacterial culture and the clinical characteristics of the infection in pediatric patients hospitalized for acute virus-induced wheezing or pneumonia.

The prospective clinical study was conduced at the University Children's Hospital Düsseldorf and at the Children's Hospital of Evangelisches Krankenhaus Düsseldorf during a 2-year period from November 2006 until October 2008. Children aged 0-16 years were recruited who were consecutively admitted to the two hospitals for LRTI. Patients with primary or secondary immunosuppression were excluded. The clinical respiratory diagnosis acute virus-induced wheezing or pneumonia was based on the diagnosis given by physicians in charge, attributed to a combination of clinical, laboratory and radiological findings. Initiation of an antibiotic therapy was also based on these parameters. A chest radiogram was not a study requirement. Sample collection and routine diagnostic procedures were conducted in adherence to the guidelines of good clinical practice under approval of the Institutional Review Board of the University Hospital Düsseldorf. Written informed consent was obtained from all parents prior to any study procedures being performed.

Nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPA) were collected on the day of admission (1. NPA) and on the 3rd or 4th day of hospitalization (2. NPA). The NPAs were submitted to the Institute of Virology of the University Hospital Düsseldorf and evaluated for RSV, rhinovirus, influenza types A and B, parainfluenza types 1, 2 and 3, enterovirus, adenovirus, human metapneumovirus, coronaviruses 229E, OC43 and NL63 and human bocavirus using quantitative real-time RT-PCR. 12 Briefly, a combination of duplex-and triplex one-step-RNA-and DNA-PCRs was used. All positive results were confirmed in a monoplex-assay and quantified using plasmid standards. The sensitivity and specificity was as demonstrated as described elsewhere. 12 The specimens were simultaneously submitted to the Institute of Medical Microbiology and Hospital Hygiene of the University Hospital Düsseldorf where standard bacterial cultures were performed. For standard bacterial cultures NPAs were plated on Columbia agar for aerobic and anaerobic cultures, chocolate agar and MacKonkey agar (bioMerieux, Nürtingen, Germany) and incubated at 36 • C for 48 h. Aerobic Columbia and chocolate agars were incubated in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO 2 . Cultures were examined after 24 and 48 h. The results of the bacterial cultures were expressed in semiquantitative steps: ""no bacterial growth"", ""occasional pathogenic bacteria"", ""moderate amount of pathogenic bacteria"" and ""abundant pathogenic bacteria"".

The clinical data was prospectively collected during the hospital stay using a standard data collection form. Upon admission, the demographic characteristics and medical history of the children were systematically recorded, using standardized written questionnaires and, after a complete physical examination, children with a LRTI with the diagnosis of acute infectious wheezing, based on well-established criteria, or pneumonia were enrolled. 13 Children known to have had previous similar episodes of wheezing related respiratory infections were diagnoses with recurrent wheezing. The diagnosis and classification of asthma was based on the criteria of the new 2002 Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) guidelines. 14 In patients who underwent chest radiography pneumonia was defined on WHO criteria. 15 Beside age, gender, presence of chronic underlying conditions, clinical disease correlates were collected continuously during hospitalization and included supplemental oxygen requirement, use of bronchodilators, systemic corticosteroids, antibiotics, and performance of a chest radiography examination and the presence of fever. Infectious parameters were obtained as clinically indicated. Leucocytosis was defined as values above 15,000/l and a significantly raised C-reactive protein (CRP) when raised above 5 mg/dl.

Values are expressed as percentages for discrete variables, or as mean and standard deviation for continuous variables, except age and days of hospitalization, which are described by their median. Clinical characteristics and laboratory variables are compared using the Pearson 2 test, Fisher's exact test, Kruskal-Wallis test, Wilcoxon signed rank test and Mann Whitney U-test as appropriate. A two sided p-value <0.05 was considered statistically significant.

A total of 404 pediatric patients aged 0-16 years were recruited during the study period. Two hundred and fourty-four (60%) children had a discharge diagnosis of LRTI with acute virus-induced wheezing, 160 (40%) with radiologic confirmed pneumonia. The mean duration of clinical symptoms before admission was 3 days. Seventy-two percent of the study population were below the age of 2 (0-3 months 24%, 4-11 months 31%, 12-23 months 17%, 24-59 months 21%, 5-16 years 7%). The median age was 0.8 years. 60% were male. In the age group below 1 year, acute virus-induced wheezing was the predominant diagnosis whereas pneumonia was increasingly found in older children (Supplemental Fig. 1 ). In 196 (48%) cases an underlying condition was identified, most commonly prematurity (17%) followed by cardiac (7%), and pulmonary conditions (18%). Recurrent wheezing and asthma was identified in 14% and 1% cases, respectively.

Respiratory viruses were detected in 315 (78%) of the collected specimen. The first NPA was collected in 100% of the cases, the second in 71% of the cases. The drop outs were due to earlier discharge or withdrawal of the approval by the parents. RSV type A and B were detected in 160 (51%) specimen followed by 87 detections of rhinovirus (28%) and 28 detections (9%) each of adenovirus and human bocavirus ( Fig. 1A and B ). An equal number of 80 RSV A and 80 RSV B infections were found. With all further analyses of clinical characteristics, viral load and co-infections there were no significant statistical difference between RSV A and RSV B infections (data not shown), therefore the results for the two RSV types were summarized.

Viral single infections were detected in 66% and co-infections in 34% of all viral infections (Table 1) . Two or more viruses were found in 67 cases (17%). A RSV viral co-infection with human bocavirus was the single most common observation (n = 14) (48%). The majority of the rhinovirus co-infections were in combination with enterovirus (n = 14) (47%). Overall, 30 viral co-infections were in combination with rhinovirus, 22 (73%) of these were dual infections, and 8 (27%) were infections with more than two viruses. Nineteen (68%) of the 28 detected infections with human bocavirus and adenovirus were viral co-infections. No viral co- infection between influenza A, influenza B, parainfluenza, RSV, and HMPV occurred.

The group of patients with RSV single infection (n = 131) was significantly younger than that with rhinovirus single infection (n = 57) (median age 0.5 vs. 1.4, p < 0.001) ( Table 2 ). 68% of patients with rhinovirus single infection were male vs. 52% in RSV (p = 0.054). Underlying pulmonary diseases dominated in rhinovirus infections (12% vs. 4%, p = 0.04). The mean duration of hospitalization, was 1 day longer in RSV infection (p < 0.001). Use of systemic steroids (p = 0.02) and leucocytosis (p < 0.001) were more frequent in subjects with rhinovirus.

Thirty-eight patients (29%) with a RSV single infection had pneumonia vs. 15 (52%) with a RSV viral co-infection (p = 0.05). The patients with viral co-infection were somewhat older (median age 0.8 vs. 0.5, p = 0.02). In RSV viral co-infections the use of antibiotics (p = 0.007) presence of fever (p = 0.003) and leucocytosis (p = 0.004) were significantly more frequent than in RSV single infections.

The viral load significantly decreased between the first and second NPA sample in single infections with RSV (p < 0.001), parainfluenza virus (p = 0.004), HMPV (p = 0.002) and viral co-infections with RSV (0 < 0.009), and adenovirus (p = 0.03) (Fig. 2) . In RSV, bocavirus and adenovirus viral co-infections the viral load of these viruses was significantly lower than in single infections (respectively, p = 0.04, p = 0.048 and p = 0.006) (Fig. 3) . In 24 of the 34 (70%) viral co-infections involving RSV, its viral load was higher than that of the concomitantly detected viruses (p = 0.03).

No statistically significant impact of the viral load in the NPA on the correlates of disease severity including duration of hospital stay, supplemental oxygen requirement, use of bronchodilators, use of systemic corticosteroids, use of antibiotics, use of chest radiography examination and presence of fever was found in RSV, rhinovirus, adenovirus or human bocavirus infections (data not shown). However, a significant negative correlation between the absolute viral load in RSV infections and infectious parameters in blood was detected for CRP (p = 0.005) and leucocyte count (p = 0.001) (Supplemental Fig. 2) . In adenovirus single infections (n = 9) the presence of an elevated CRP above 5 mg/dl in serum correlated positively with viral load (p = 0.01) (data not shown). No viral co-infections between Influenza A, Influenza B, Parainfluenza, RSV, and HMPV occurred. virus negative samples (44.4%), in which 15 (23.8%) samples had ""abundant pathogenic bacteria"" (Fig. 4C) .

In RSV and rhinovirus single infections H. influenzae (39% and 27%, respectively) detections dominated while in viral co-infections the rate of M. catarrhalis positive cultures (56% in RSV and 50% in rhinovirus infections, respectively) were the most frequently detected bacterial pathogens (Fig. 5) . S. pneumoniae was less frequently detected in RSV infections than in rhinovirus infections (28% vs. 10% of all infections). There was no significant difference in the rate of positive bacterial cultures between the two diagnosis groups acute virus-induced wheezing and pneumonia (32% vs. 26%, p = 0.32). Antibiotic treatment was initiated in 161 cases (40%). There was no positive correlation between a positive bacterial culture and initiation of an antibiotic treatment: 45 patients (46%) vs. 116 patients (50%) with and without a positive bacterial culture respectively received antibiotics during the hospital stay.

The major strengths of this pediatric clinical study were beside the prospective study design over 2 complete seasons, the use of a highly sensitive quantitative multiplex RT-PCR for a wide range of respiratory viruses, the simultaneous detection of bacteria, the evaluation of important clinical characteristics, the high number of patients included in the study.

The availability of multiplex PCR means a major breakthrough for the diagnosis of respiratory pathogens and makes the detection of co-infections easier or even possible. By means of modern multiplex PCR techniques at least one respiratory virus is detected in 66-89% of respiratory samples of patients with acute LRTI. 7, 19 The detection rate of 78% in our samples is comparable with these. In this study viral co-infections were detected in 34% of the cases. This rate is high, but also in accordance with the previously published data implicating the rate of dual and multiple infections to vary between 5% and 20% of all viral LRTIs. 2, 7, 9 Human bocavirus, rhinoand enteroviruses and adenoviruses were the four pathogens most frequently involved in dual infections. Due to the close relationship of rhinoviruses and enteroviruses we cannot completely exclude that in some cases a crossreactivity in PCR testing mimics a coinfection between these two groups of viruses. Interestingly no viral co-infections between members of the orthomyxoviruses (influenza) and the paramyxoviruses (parainfluenza, RSV, HMPV) were seen.

In this study population RSV (51%) was the main reason for hospitalization for LRTI followed by rhinovirus (28%). Previously published findings have repeatedly confirmed RSV to be the main viral pathogen causing LRTI in children. 1, 3, 16 Interestingly, twentytwo percent of our hospitalized children with LRTI had a single infection with rhinovirus, 32% of the rhinovirus single infections had pneumonia. Calvo et al. found only 3.5% of Spanish children infected with rhinovirus to be hospitalized for pneumonia, whereas others reported rates ranging between 16% and 24%. 1, 17, 18 However, a relatively high rhinovirus prevalence of 12-20% in asymptomatic children has been reported. 20, 21 According to our data rhinovirus is an important causative agent of lower respiratory tract infections in young children, second to RSV.

The comparison of clinical characteristics of RSV and rhinovirus infections revealed a shorter duration of hospitalization in rhinovirus infections, but a more frequent use of systemic steroids in rhinovirus infections. Physicians may tend to treat LRTI caused by rhinovirus with corticosteroids due to initial severity of presenting symptoms. A recently published controlled clinical trial demonstrated a benefit of systemic prednisolone in children with picornavirus (i.e. rhinovirus or enterovirus) LRTI. 22 The high incidence of fever and leucocytosis might explain the higher rate of antibiotic use in RSV viral co-infections compared to RSV single infections in our study. However, viral factors may be responsible for RSV subgroup-related disease severity differences, including differences in the ability of certain viruses to promote a pathogenic inflammatory host response. 23 Previous studies have investigated the relationship of viral load and viral dynamics to etiological role and disease severity in respiratory tract infections. 24, 25 Gerna et al. found a significant drop in RSV viral load between admission and discharge in children hospitalized for RSV LRTI. 8 In contrast, Bosis et al. did not find a significant impact of the RSV viral load on the disease severity in children admitted to hospital for the first episode of acute wheezing. 16 There were also no significant correlation of viral load and disease severity in human bocavirus infections. 26 This study is the first to investigate the influence of the viral load and viral dynamics of a broad range of respiratory viruses and different clinical correlates of disease severity and inflammatory parameters in blood in a multiplex PCR assay. We found a consistent fall of the viral load between admission and discharge in single infections with most of the viral pathogens (significant for RSV, parainfluenza virus and hMPV single and additionally adenovirus co-infections). Since patients were discharged from hospital when they were clinically improved, a relationship between viral load and disease severity can be assumed. Our findings are in agreement with a very recently published study in children with acute respiratory tract infections that has shown a correlation between clinical improvement and a reduction of viral quantity after 3 days of hospitalization. 27 A high initial viral load at presentation may represent a recent infection, a low viral load a past infection, but an additional study powered to confirm this aspect has to be performed.

However, we hardly found a strong correlation of viral load with clinical characteristics. A significant negative correlation between the absolute viral load in RSV infections and an elevated C-reactive protein in serum and presence of a leucocytosis was detected. Accordingly leucocytosis occurred in RSV infections significantly less frequently than in rhinovirus infections. It is possible that RSV could depress the signs of infection in blood. Suppression of the induction of interferons by the NS1 and NS2 proteins of RSV has also been demonstrated in human epithelial cells and macrophages. 28 Purcell et al. recently proposed that an abnormal white blood count is of limited use for the detection of concurrent bacterial infection in RSV infections. 29 In contrast, adenovirus infections have been demonstrated to promote acute-phase response with elevated CRP in children. 30 Respiratory infections with certain bacteria may be associated with predisposition for certain types of viral infection or vice versa. The colonization rates for M. catarrhalis, H. influenzae and S. pneumoniae in healthy children are high and depend on various factors. 31, 32 A few population based studies suggest a relationship between RSV infections and invasive bacteria. 33, 34 Increased numbers of non-typeable H. influenzae (NTHi) and Streptococcus pneumoniae adhering to human respiratory epithelial cells have been detected in RSV infections in vitro. 35 In this study M. catarrhalis and H. influenzae were the most commonly detected bacterial agents. In RSV and rhinovirus single infections H. influenzae detections dominated while in RSV and rhinovirus co-infections M. catarrhalis was more frequently found. Therefore, a positive link between infection or colo-nization with certain bacteria and viral co-infections may be assumed.

According to our results the clinical course of viral LRTI in children may be affected by virus type, viral load and viral and bacterial co-infections. Clinical improvement was associated for most respiratory viruses with a reduction of viral quantity. The viral load had a significant impact on the infectious parameters in blood in case of RSV and adenovirus, but no effect on clinical correlates of disease severity. The multiplex PCR is an excellent diagnostic tool that helps both to improve the clinical management and expand the understanding of the pathogenesis of viral LRTI.

Preventing respiratory syncytial virus infections in hospitalized children and adults: should we do better? Infection Prevention in Practice,"Objective: To compare the burden of nosocomial and community-acquired respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)-associated acute lower respiratory tract infections (ALRIs) in adult and pediatric patients concomitantly admitted to a French tertiary hospital, and to evaluate the effectiveness of existing infection control measures. Patients and methods: We prospectively included all adult and pediatric patients admitted to Necker hospital (Paris) between October 2018 and February 2019 with a diagnosis of RSV-associated ALRI. We compared characteristics of ALRIs between patients with community-acquired versus nosocomial infections and, in each group, between children and adults. Results: Community-acquired and nosocomial RSV-associated ALRIs were diagnosed in 229 and 11 inpatients, respectively. The burden of community-acquired infections was higher in children than in adults: 2.1% versus 0.2% of the total number of pediatric and adult inpatients, respectively (p < 0.0001); 4.2% versus 0.2% of the total number of hospitalization days in pediatric and adult units, respectively (p < 0.0001). Compared to inpatients with community-acquired ALRIs, those with nosocomial infections were more frequently adults (45.5% versus 2.6%, p ¼ 0.0005) and subjects with at least one chronic complex condition (100.0% versus 41.0%, p < 0.0001). The total number of hospitalization days due to nosocomial ALRIs was higher in adults than in children (0.32% versus 0.11%, p < 0.0001).","Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is associated with 19e81% of viral acute respiratory infections causing hospitalization in infants and children [1] . RSV also has a burden on healthcare services and winter mortality in older adults [2e4] . Published data on the epidemiology of nosocomial RSV infections are still limited. In infants, a severe course of nosocomial disease has been described, especially in subjects with comorbidities [5] , even more severe than community-acquired RSV infections [6] . In adults, RSV acquisition seems to be frequently nosocomial or healthcare-related, with a higher mortality than with influenza virus infection [7] . However, to the best of our knowledge, no previous study compared the burden of community-acquired versus nosocomial RSV-associated acute lower respiratory tract infections (ALRIs) in both adult and pediatric patients concomitantly admitted at the same hospital.

Necker hospital (Paris) is a French 600 bed tertiary hospital, where large cohorts of adult and pediatric patients with chronic complex conditions (CCC) are regularly followed. A bundle of measures has been implemented to prevent nosocomial RSV-associated ALRIs, including implementation of droplet and contact precautions for symptomatic patients, annual education and training of all healthcare personnel, providing instructional materials for patients and visitors on recommended hand hygiene, respiratory hygiene/cough practices and limitation of pediatric visitors during seasonal outbreaks of viral ALRIs. Infants predisposed to developing severe RSV disease receive passive antiviral immunization with palivizumab in accordance to French guidelines [8] . Finally, our hospital has recently been partly rebuilt and includes now a high rate of singlepatient rooms (91%), which may help to prevent healthcare-associated infections.

This study aims to compare the burden of nosocomial and community-acquired RSV-associated ALRIs in both adult and pediatric inpatients and to evaluate the effectiveness of our infection control measures.

Participants provided informed consent for the anonymous use of their clinical and biological data for biomedical research (for paediatric patients, informed consent was provided by parents/guardians). This study was reviewed and approved by the Necker Hospital Institutional Review Board (registration number in the registry of the Assistance Publique e Hôpitaux de Paris: 20190729122906).

We performed a prospective observational study in adult and pediatric patients admitted to Necker hospital between October 1, 2018 and February 28, 2019, with a minimum hospital stay of 2 days and a diagnosis of RSV-associated ALRI. RSVinfected patients were identified from the data provided by the virology laboratory. RSV-associated ALRI was defined as diagnosis of pneumonia, bronchiolitis, bronchitis or bronchial hyper-reactivity with concomitant detection of RSV in upper respiratory (nose/throat swabs) or lower respiratory (bronchial aspirate or bronchoalveolar lavage fluid) samples using PCR (RSV/hMPV r-geneÒ-ArgeneÒ, bioMérieux, Marcy l'Etoile, France). Patients with isolated upper respiratory tract infection and those without respiratory symptoms were excluded from this analysis, even if RSV was detected from their clinical samples.

Because the RSV incubation period may range from 2 to 8 days [9] , the origin of ALRIs was designated as ""possibly nosocomial"" and ""definitely nosocomial"" when the patient had been hospitalized continuously 2e7 days and ! 8 days before the onset of respiratory symptoms, respectively. ALRIs were considered community-acquired in patients whose symptoms occurred before hospitalization or < 2 days after hospital admission.

The clinical data collected included age, gender, term of birth (for infants), underlying complex chronic conditions (CCC; as previously defined [10] ), laboratory-confirmed bacterial and viral co-/supra-infections, level of care required (admission to the intensive care unit [ICU], ventilation requirement, prescription of antibiotics), length of hospital stay (in the case of nosocomial infection, the length of hospital stay after the onset of symptoms was recorded) and death.

The number of hospital admissions and total hospitalization days of patients with ALRIs were compared to those of all patients admitted to our hospital during the study period, in order to estimate the burden of RSV infection.

Finally, we evaluated the proportion of RSV-infected subjects who adequately received palivizumab-based prophylaxis before the onset of their ALRIs according to the 1999 marketing authorization of palivizumab by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) [11] , the 2007 guidelines of the French Health Authority (HAS), [8] and the 2014 guidance for palivizumab use of the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) [12] .

Categorical variables appear with their frequency distribution. Non-normally distributed continuous variables are expressed as the median and interquartile range. Chi-squared tests or Fisher's exact tests were used to compare discrete variables, and the Wilcoxon rank test was used to compare continuous variables between patients with communityacquired versus nosocomial ALRIs. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Between October 2018 and February 2019, 229 patients admitted to our hospital were diagnosed with communityacquired RSV-associated ALRIs. Their characteristics are summarized in Table 1 . The majority were less than 6 months old (60.3%) and, among them, few were born preterm (18.8%). At least one CCC was present in 40.1% of subjects, most frequently a respiratory CCC. Viral and bacterial co-/supra-infections were documented in 17.5% and 5.7% of cases, respectively, but around one in two patients received antibiotics. The proportion of patients requiring ICU admission was high (40.1%) but only 3 patients (1.3%) died. All of them were children with severe cardiovascular AE respiratory CCC and died from acute respiratory distress syndrome.

When compared to all other patients admitted to our hospital during the same period of time, patients with communityacquired RSV infections accounted for 1.6% of inpatients and 3.1% of the total number of hospitalization days. The burden of community-acquired RSV infections was disproportionately higher in pediatric than in adult patients: 2.1% versus 0.2% of the total number of pediatric and adult inpatients, respectively (p < 0.0001); 4.2% versus 0.2% of the total number of hospitalization days in pediatric and adult units, respectively (p < 0.0001).

Among children with community-acquired RSV infections, palivizumab ebased prophylaxis was given to 6/18 (33.3%), 6/6 (100%) and 4/4 (100%) of those for whom antiviral prophylaxis was recommended by the 1999 EMA, the 2007 French and the 2014 American guidelines, respectively.

Eleven patients were diagnosed with a possibly (n ¼ 6) or definitely (n ¼ 5) nosocomial RSV-associated ALRI (Table 1) . Almost half of them (45.1%) were 60 years old or older. All subjects with nosocomial RSV infection had at least one CCC but none of them died from RSV.

Compared to inpatients with community-acquired RSVassociated ALRIs, those with nosocomial infections were more frequently adults (p ¼ 0.0005) and subjects with at least one CCC (p < 0.0001). The rates of viral and bacterial co-/suprainfections, oxygen/ventilation requirement, ICU admissions, antibiotic treatments and deaths did not differ between inpatients diagnosed with community-acquired versus nosocomial infections. However, the length of stay was statistically longer in the latter than in the former (p < 0.0001).

When compared to all patients admitted to our hospital during the same period of time and free from communityacquired RSV-associated ALRIs, patients with nosocomial RSV ALRIs accounted for 0.08% of all inpatients and 0.17% of the total number of hospitalization days. The proportion of inpatients with nosocomial infections did not differ between children and adults (0.06% versus 0.15%, p ¼ 0.14). However, the total number of hospitalization days due to nosocomial RSVinfected patients was higher in adults than in children (0.32% versus 0.11%, p < 0.0001).

No children with nosocomial RSVreceived palivizumab ebased prophylaxis prior to the onset of their infection. Retrospectively, such prophylaxis was not recommended for any of these children by the EMA, the French or the American guidelines.

To the best of our knowledge, we report one of the first studies evaluating the efficacy of the same bundle of infection control measures to prevent RSV ALRIs in both adult and pediatric patients admitted to the same tertiary hospital.

Some results regarding community-acquired RSV infections requiring hospitalization are in line with previous reports: most of the subjects hospitalized with RSV were aged 12 months, and especially 6 months [13e21]. The median length of hospital stay was in the range of that reported in previous pediatric studies (between 2 and 11 days). However, the prevalence of admission to ICU and the mortality rate were higher than previously described in high-income countries (41.0% versus 2e12%, and 1.3% versus < 0.5%, respectively) [1] . This could be explained by the high prevalence of CCC in the population of children followed in our tertiary hospital, and, consequently, in those admitted for community-acquired RSV infections. This proportion was higher than in previous studies, where typically > 70% of children hospitalized with RSV-related ALRI/bronchiolitis had no underlying medical conditions [16e18,22e24]. Thus, the epidemiological characteristics of patients admitted at our hospital with community-acquired RSV infections cannot be extrapolated to other French pediatric centers.

In our study, the burden of RSV among community-acquired ALRIs requiring hospitalization was strongly lower in adults compared to infants and children, despite the high prevalence of CCC (especially immunodeficiency) among adults followed in our center (data not shown). Our findings suggest that, although RSV has the potential to cause severe communityacquired ALRIs in high-risk adults (such as immunocompromised patients) [25] , RSV infections seem to rarely require hospitalization in this population.

Few of our patients (2.6%) admitted with communityacquired infections received palivizumab-based antiviral prophylaxis prior to the onset of the infection. However, the retrospective evaluation of the medical files of all RSV-infected inpatients revealed that no other patient required palivizumab according to the 2007 French and the 2014 American guidelines [8, 12] . Our results suggest that guidelines of antiviral prophylaxis are appropriately applied in our center but that most of the patients admitted for RSV infections (and most of those admitted to pediatric ICU), did not fall into the recognized indications for RSV prophylaxis, as recently reported by Ghazaly et al. [26] . In light with the ongoing research into the development of new and more cost-effective strategies against RSV infections than palivizumab (including long acting monoclonal antibodies and vaccines), further larger studies defining the characteristics of patients hospitalized with severe RSV infections, may help to rethink the guidelines of RSV prophylactic strategies. RSV is known to be a major nosocomial hazard on paediatric wards, especially in cases of age less than 5 months, prematurity and chronic lung disease of prematurity [6] . Previous studies described rates of nosocomial RSV infections between 0.4 and 9.6% [6,27e29] , with poorer clinical outcomes than community-acquired RSV infections [6] . Contrasting with these results, we observed in our pediatric wards a low rate of nosocomial RSV-related ALRIs (0.06% of inpatients) and no death related to nosocomial RSV infection. This low rate of nosocomial infections could be related to our multifaceted infection control strategy including a high proportion of single-patient rooms (for both infected and uninfected patients), staff training repeated before each season of viral epidemics, screening of symptomatic patients, isolation/cohorting, hand washing, gloves and masks, gowns (for staff attending infants with respiratory symptoms) and restriction of visitors.

Interestingly, our study suggests that the efficacy of this infection control strategy may be less effective in adult than in pediatric wards. Indeed, nosocomial infections were proportionately more frequently diagnosed in adults than community-acquired ALRIs (p < 0.0001) and the total number of hospitalization days due to nosocomial RSV infection was higher in adults than in children (0.32% versus 0.11%, p < 0.0001). Similarly, Kestler M et al. recently described that RSV acquisition was frequently nosocomial or healthcarerelated in adults during flu season [7] . Although we did not observe the high RSV-related mortality described in adults by Kestler (14.7%), we described longer length of hospital stay in case of nosocomial versus community-acquired infections in adults. Our results suggest that, despite a low rate of nosocomial infections observed in adults (0.15% of inpatients), our multifaceted infection control strategy may be reinforced in adults wards in order to obtain similar results seen in pediatric units. Because of the low number of nosocomial infections during the 2018/2019 RSV epidemic, it could be interesting to repeat this study during several successive seasonal epidemics in order to evaluate the effectiveness of our bundle of measures in a larger population.

This study has five main limitations. First, RSV-related ALRIs were defined from the data provided by the virology laboratory. Because RSV may not have been screened in a significant proportion of patients with ALRI, this study may underestimate the real burden of RSV infection in our center. This underestimation may be more pronounced in patients with mild symptoms (especially those with isolated upper respiratory tract infection), where RSV may have been less frequently screened than in case of severe infection. However this potential limitation does not hamper evaluation of the efficacy of our infection control strategy, which mainly aims to prevent severe infections. Second, although the ALRIs were primarily attributed to RSV by clinicians in all patients described in this study, we cannot exclude that viral and bacterial co-infections may have influenced their clinical outcome. This confounding factor cannot be excluded in our non interventional study because all other respiratory pathogens may not have been screened for. In order to evaluate the impact of this potential bias, further prospective studies are needed with systematic screening of all potential viral and bacterial coinfections. Third, this observational study does not allow the effectiveness of individual components of our multicomponent control measures to be assessed. Similar observation was done by French CE et al. in the recent review of published and unpublished literature about the effectiveness of control measures to prevent nosocomial RSV transmission events [30] . However, because similar preventive strategies were applied in all units of our center, this limitation does not hamper the comparison of their efficacy on pediatric versus adult wards. Further studies are needed in order to evaluate to what extent the compliance with each measure of our infection control bundle differs between adult and paediatric populations. Because nosocomial infections may be transmitted by healthcare personnel, visitors and patients, it would be interesting to differentiate the compliance to measures targeting each of these populations in such further studies. Fourth, as previously discussed, the high prevalence of CCC among patients followed in our tertiary hospital hampers extrapolation of our results to other French hospitals. The higher prevalence of CCC among patients with nosocomial versus community-acquired RSV infections (100.0% versus 41.0%) may at least partly explain the longer length of stay in the former than in the latter. Fifth, we used a very large definition of a nosocomial case, by pooling ""possibly"" and ""definitely"" nosocomial infections. In previous studies investigating the risk of RSV transmission to patients and providing a clear definition of a nosocomial case, various cut-off were used to define it (mostly 5 days or more after hospital admission) [30] . Here, we chose a wider definition of a nosocomial case (i.e. infection occurring in a patient hospitalized continuously ! 2 days before the onset of respiratory symptoms), because (i) the RSV incubation period may be as short as 2 days [9] , and (ii) we did not want to minimize the real burden of RSV nosocomial ALRIs. Interestingly, although we used such a wide cut-off, the burden was not high in our center. This limitation does not hamper comparison of the burden of nosocomial infections between pediatric and adult wards at our center.

In summary, the burden of community-acquired infections requiring hospitalization is disproportionately higher in infants/children than in adults admitted to our center. Nosocomial RSV-associated ALRIs rarely occurred, suggesting good efficacy of our multi-component preventive strategy. However, the burden of nosocomial infection was higher in adults than in children, suggesting that education and training of healthcare workers, patients and visitors about the risk of nosocomial respiratory viral disease should be reinforced on adult wards. The fact than > 97% of patients hospitalized with communityacquired or nosocomial RSV-associated ALRI were not considered at ""high-risk"" (i.e. requiring immunoprophylaxis with palivizumab) according to the French and American guidelines, highlights the urgent need to develop new and more cost-effective antiviral preventive strategies, in order to decrease the burden of RSV infections requiring hospitalizations.

Does an Upper Respiratory Tract Infection During Pregnancy Affect Perinatal Outcomes? A Literature Review,"Upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) is a ubiquitous but often benign pathology most commonly of viral etiology. This review focuses on perinatal outcomes following URTI during pregnancy. Few data exist on the explicit topic of URTI and adverse perinatal outcomes. The entire URTI burden among pregnant women is not properly represented by the studies included in this review, because only those infections severe enough to warrant hospitalization have been studied. Most probably, the number of URTIs in pregnant women not requiring hospitalization is far larger, but this has yet to be quantified. Clearly, there are logistical barriers to obtaining such statistics. Severe URTI requiring hospitalization during pregnancy was noted to be associated with adverse perinatal complications. URTI was found to be positively correlated with preterm delivery (PTD; less than 37 weeks gestation), lower birth weight, and cesarean deliveries, without a significant effect on the rates of perinatal mortality or low Apgar scores. There appears to be a possible link between various infectious processes that occur during pregnancy and the outcome of a PTD. The inflammatory environment present during infection includes high levels of cytokines that are known to increase prostaglandins, which, in turn, can induce preterm birth. Further studies should evaluate whether URTI not requiring hospitalization has any effect on perinatal outcomes.","Upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) is a ubiquitous but often benign pathology most commonly of viral etiology. URTI usually presents with a prodrome known as the ""common cold,"" involving headache, myalgia, sneezing, nasal discharge, nasal obstruction, cough, hoarseness, sore and scratchy throat, and sometimes fever [1] . The common cold is the number one reason for doctor visits in the United States [1] . On average, healthy adults will experience between two and four URTIs every year, which last from 7 to 14 days each [1] . The most common etiologies are rhinovirus, coronavirus, and adenovirus; however, these entities are clinically indistinguishable, and a specific virologic diagnosis does not alter medical management [1, 2] .

Pregnancy affects the functioning of multiple organ systems. The alterations in pulmonary function are significant. The diaphragm is elevated an average of 4 cm [3, 4] . This leads to a decrease in the functional residual capacity and residual volume. There is a transition from abdominal to thoracic breathing and an increase in minute ventilation, resulting in a mild respiratory alkalosis, which allows for better gas exchange across the placenta [3] . When a pregnant woman experiences a respiratory infection, the fetus can be negatively impacted due to its unique sensitivity to hypoxemia and acidosis. This dangerous combination has been shown to stimulate preterm labor in the second half of pregnancy [4] . Additionally, there is an increase in oxygen requirement and critical closing volume, which, in conjunction, make respiratory disease more severe in pregnancy [4] .

In pregnancy, the immune system also undergoes various physiological alterations, resulting in depressed cell-mediated immunity and a reduced Th1 response [5•] . The Th1 response is a pathway of pathogen removal involving T-helper cells, macrophages, and B-cells. In a general sense, T cells produce a chemical called interferon-gamma, which excites macrophages, turning on their bactericidal properties. Simultaneously, B-cells are also activated, and they begin to make cell-coating antibodies. Together, the tagging of the pathogen by B-cell's antibodies and the bactericidal instincts of the macrophages lead to pathogen removal, if all goes according to plan.

If this system outlined above is not functioning adequately, as in pregnancy, there will be greater susceptibility to infection. Pregnant women have been noted to have an impaired immune response to multiple viruses; among them are many causes of URTIs, such as influenza, cytomegalovirus, and streptococcal organisms [6] . It is postulated that the proinflammatory environment of infection-specifically, the cytokines and microbial endotoxins that induce prostaglandin production and matrixdegrading enzymes-can contribute to preterm labor [7] . URTI can be complicated by pneumonia, a lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI). Pneumonia is usually caused by bacterial infection, unlike URTI. However, LRTI can follow a viral URTI (e.g., Group A streptococcal pneumonia may follow influenza) [1] . LRTI carries a much greater risk in pregnancy than does URTI. There is a much higher chance of hypoxemia and acidosis due to the severity and depth of the infection. Pregnant women with pneumonia are at risk for various medical complications, such as meningitis, pericarditis, empyema, and endocarditis. Therefore, pregnant women with pneumonia are usually hospitalized and monitored. Pneumonia has been linked to low birth weight, fetal distress, and preterm birth [8, 9] .

Few data exist on the explicit topic of URTI and adverse perinatal outcomes. The most recent study regarding this issue compared pregnant women who had been hospitalized for URTI with those who had not. This study was a large retrospective population-based study by Stiller-Timor et al., conducted at Soroka University Medical Center in Beer Sheva, Israel. Stiller-Timor et al. reviewed 183,373 deliveries from 1988 to 2008. From this large cohort, 0.132 % (n=246) of the women fit the necessary criteria of fever and symptoms of URTI that required hospitalization [7] .

A variety of perinatal outcomes were analyzed from this cohort, such as cesarean delivery (CD), premature rupture of membranes (PROM), Apgar score less than 7 at 1 and 5 min, perinatal mortality, preterm delivery (PTD), low birth weight, and labor induction. URTI was found to be positively correlated with PTD and CD (see Table 1 ). However, no difference was found in the rates of perinatal mortality or Apgar scores between those women with URTI and those without [7] .

Increased rates of PTD in the presence of URTI were also noted in a study done recently in Norway by Morken et al. In this study, which employed the use of the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort, a low-risk population of mothers was surveyed at two different points in their pregnancies regarding a variety of criteria. This article also investigated the relationship between spontaneous PTD (SPTD) and maternal febrile episodes resulting from urinary tract infections (UTIs), pneumonia, and ear-nose-throat infections. This investigation revealed that only those women with ear-nose-throat infections (URTIs) had an increased rate of SPTD. However, this correlation was noted only in the survey administered at week 17, which reflected any URTI that these women had incurred prior to week 17 [10] . Comparatively, in the study by Stiller-Timor et al., the time during gestation at which the infection had occurred was not included in the analysis [7] .

One of the unifying factors in the literature that documents an increase in adverse perinatal outcomes is the presence of fever. In a study published by Bensal et al., peripartum fever was found to be associated with an increase in PTD and was noted as an independent risk factor for perinatal mortality [11•] . Some of the more common causes of peripartum fever are UTI, pyelonephritis, and endometritis, all of which have been linked to PTD [12, 13] . Despite this association, it is important to note that in a study by Maayan-Metzger et al., which analyzed perinatal outcomes resulting from various causes of maternal fever, it was found that the fetus incurred no risk from the fever itself [14] .

Numerous studies were published in the aftermath of the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic. One of the subgroups most affected by the H1N1 influenza epidemic was pregnant women. H1N1 influenza is a viral infection that affects the upper respiratory tract; however, it is more virulent than the average community-acquired viruses. Pregnant women are highly affected by influenza, and even the yearly H1N1 influenza strains of less virulence have historically resulted in higher mortality and morbidity in the pregnant population [9] . The results from the United Kingdom Obstetric Surveillance System (UKOSS) published by Pierce et al. show that H1N1 infection in pregnant women requiring hospitalization was also linked to an increased rate of PTDs [15] . According to the UKOSS, the factors found to increase a woman's risk for PTD were admission to the intensive care unit and secondary pneumonia infection [15] . In regards to the relationship of fever as a contributory factor, the analysis of this study did not explicitly investigate the relationship of fever to perinatal outcomes, but fever was a commonly reported symptom with H1N1 infection.

A retrospective population-based study was performed to determine the effect of pneumonia on the outcomes of adverse pregnancies [8] . This analysis also revealed a relationship between pneumonia and PTD. In a multivariable model controlling for IUGR, placental abruption, and preeclampsia, pneumonia was found to be an independent risk factor for PTD (OR=5.4, 95 % CI 3.8-7.7, p<.001). However, pneumonia was not found to be an independent risk factor for perinatal mortality [8] . Using the same population (from Beer Sheva, Israel), an additional study was performed by Gershovitz et al., which investigated the population of women who had undergone splenectomy in this same time period and then become pregnant [16] . This investigation found that splenectomy was an independent risk factor for PTD (OR=2.1, 95 % CI 1.4-3.3, p<.001) [16] . An additional study conducted with the same cohort investigated pyelonephritis and pregnancy [17] . In this study by Farkash et al., it was found that pyelonephritis was an independent risk factor for PTD (OR=2.6; 95 % CI 1.7-3.9, p<.001) [17] .

URTI is the number one reason that people seek medical attention in the United States [1] . Therefore, it would be safe to assume that this trend must also be true among the pregnant population. The entire URTI burden among pregnant women is not properly represented by the studies included in this review, because only those infections severe enough to warrant hospitalization have been studied. Most probably, the number of URTIs in pregnant women not requiring hospitalization is far larger, but this has yet to be quantified. Clearly, there are logistical barriers to obtaining such statistics.

Influenza is one of the major causes of URTI, and it is responsible for a great deal of morbidity in the pregnant population. Influenza was indicated in 2.5 hospitalizations per 1,000 women in their third trimester, outside of influenza season [18] . One potential way to lower the burden of URTI, which may, in turn, lower the incidence of PTD, is through use of the influenza vaccine. This vaccine is not currently well utilized by the pregnant population. The American College of Gynecology and Obstetrics (ACOG) and the Advisory Committee of Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommend universal vaccination for pregnant women at all gestational ages [19] . However, currently, only 13 %-34 % of pregnant women are vaccinated [20] . The vaccine has been shown to reduce morbidity and is considered cost effective due to the reduction in supportive care required by the target population [18] .

There appears to be a clear link between various infectious processes that occur during pregnancy and the outcome of a PTD (Fig. 1) . The inflammatory environment present during infection includes high levels of cytokines that are known to increase prostaglandins, which, in turn, can induce preterm birth. The precise immunological cascade present in each of the above-mentioned infections is not equivalent. Consequently, more data would be necessary to understand the common component present in these infections that truly triggers preterm birth.

Romero et al. have extensively studied the immunologic profiles related to preterm labor and delivery. Initially, using mice models, they noted that inflammation is crucially linked to the process of preterm labor and, specifically, the process of cervical ripening that leads to preterm labor and delivery [21• ]. Subsequently, they further elucidated the role of the complement system, a component of the innate immune system responsible for assisting phagocytic cells in identifying and eliminating pathogens. Complement activation occurs uniquely in preterm labor, and not in the process of normal term labor and delivery [22] . This finding suggests that the inflammatory state present in preterm labor and delivery is potentially the catalyst that triggers cervical ripening preterm and allows for preterm labor to occur. PTD URTI Pneumonia Fever, infectious disease Pyelonephritis H1N1 infection Fig. 1 A link between various infectious processes occurring during pregnancy and preterm delivery However, it was noted that the mechanism through which preterm and term cervical remodeling occurs is identical; it is simply the trigger that was shown to be different [22, 23] .

The understanding of the process of preterm labor and delivery is ever-changing. Preterm labor has been suggested to exist on a continuum with cervical changes. Primarily, it is believed that cervical shortening can progress and lead to eventual cervical funneling, which is often, but not always, followed by preterm labor itself. However, as of late, Kim et al. have brought into question whether or not cervical changes are necessary for preterm birth to occur. They have questioned the medical criteria necessary for a diagnosis of preterm labor. The suspicions are based upon the fact that when sampling amniotic fluid of women who have preterm contractions, but not cervical change, it is noted that the women who had culture-confirmed infection had elevated rates of PTD and overall morbidity [24] . This observation led to questioning the belief that cervical change is a necessary process in the early stages of preterm labor and, when quantified, can predict rates of PTD. This sparked further investigation into the inflammatory states present in pregnancies with poor outcomes.

A great deal of research has been done on the immunologic response of the mother to the fetus. One of the changes that occur in pregnancy is a reduction in the immune response, particularly in regard to cell-mediated immunity and the Th1 response [4, 6] . It is thought that this change is one of the ways in which the body prevents a graft-versus-fetus response in the mother. However, when the immune system remains robust in this regard, one of the possible results is a condition referred to as chronic chorioamnionitis. This is a condition defined by a pathology report postdelivery that shows a lymphocytic infiltration of the chorioamniotic membranes. In the research of Lee et al., chronic chorioamnionitis was found in more than one third of spontaneous PTDs [25] . This inflammatory lesion, along with vilitis of the placenta of unknown etiology, has been found to resemble allograft rejection and graft-versus-host disease of the fetus in their immunologic markers [25] . Thus, the inflammatory environment referred to as a precursor of preterm labor and delivery may be intimately related to chronic chorioamnionitis. It would be beneficial to understand the differences between the conditions leading to chronic chorioamnionitis, which causes PTD, and the infections that lead to PTD. Perhaps the changes in the immune system (or lack thereof) that lead to chronic chorioamnionitis are related to the susceptibility to certain infections, which additionally increase the likelihood of preterm labor and delivery.

PTD is the number one contributor to infant mortality worldwide [26] . In 2005, 28,382 infants died in the United States before the age of 1 year, 66 % of which were attributed to PTD [4] . Further elucidating the processes that contribute to PTD would have massive implications in the world of obstetrics and gynecology. It is clear that the inflammatory environment present during preterm labor and delivery is unique to that of term delivery. There is a large body of data implicating infection as one of the primary causes of this inflammation; particularly important are those infections that induce fever and are severe enough to warrant hospitalization. Therefore, additional investigation into this subpopulation may contribute to decreasing this significant source of morbidity and mortality.

Prevalence of viral respiratory tract infections in children with asthma,"Background: Previous studies support a strong association between viral respiratory tract infections and asthma exacerbations. The effect of newly discovered viruses on asthma control is less well defined. Objective: We sought to determine the contribution of respiratory viruses to asthma exacerbations in children with a panel of PCR assays for common and newly discovered respiratory viruses. Methods: Respiratory specimens from children aged 2 to 17 years with asthma exacerbations (case patients, n 5 65) and with well-controlled asthma (control subjects, n 5 77), frequency matched by age and season of enrollment, were tested for rhinoviruses, enteroviruses, respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus, coronaviruses 229E and OC43, parainfluenza viruses 1 to 3, influenza viruses, adenoviruses, and human bocavirus. Results: Infection with respiratory viruses was associated with asthma exacerbations (63.1% in case patients vs 23.4% in control subjects; odds ratio, 5.6; 95% CI, 2.7-11.6). Rhinovirus was by far the most prevalent virus (60% among case patients vs 18.2% among control subjects) and the only virus significantly associated with exacerbations (odds ratio, 6.8; 95% CI, 3.2-14.5). However, in children without clinically manifested viral respiratory tract illness, the prevalence of rhinovirus infection was similar in case patients (29.2%) versus control subjects (23.4%, P > .05). Other viruses detected included human metapneumovirus (4.6% in patients with acute asthma vs 2.6% in control subjects), enteroviruses (4.6% vs 0%), coronavirus 229E (0% vs 1.3%), and respiratory syncytial virus (1.5% vs 0%). Conclusion: Symptomatic rhinovirus infections are an important contributor to asthma exacerbations in children. Clinical implications: These results support the need for therapies effective against rhinovirus as a means to decrease asthma exacerbations. (J Allergy Clin Immunol 2007;119: 314-21.) ","For more than 3 decades, viral respiratory tract infections have been reported as important triggers for exacerbations of asthma in adults and children. 1, 2 In early studies based on nonmolecular means of detection, viral infections were identified in fewer than 25% of acute asthma episodes. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] Results of recent studies based on PCR assays support a much greater role of viral respiratory tract infections in acute asthma. [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] A wide range of respiratory viruses, including rhinoviruses, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza viruses, coronaviruses, human parainfluenza viruses, enteroviruses, human metapneumovirus (HMPV), and the recently discovered human bocavirus, have been detected from patients with asthma exacerbations. [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] Rhinoviruses are currently recognized as the most common respiratory virus associated with acute asthma in school-age children, whereas RSV appears to be the most common respiratory virus associated with wheezing episodes and asthma in young children. [6] [7] [8] [9] 11, 12, 19, 20 Considering the discovery of new viruses and the recent progress in the development of drugs effective against respiratory viruses, 21-25 determining the spectrum of viruses associated with asthma exacerbation and the contribution of potentially treatable agents is important in the evaluation of intervention strategies aimed at decreasing asthma morbidity.

Thus additional epidemiologic studies are necessary to better understand the relationship between respiratory viruses and asthma exacerbations. We conducted this case-control study to evaluate the extent of association of different respiratory viruses with asthma exacerbations in children using a full panel of PCR assays for respiratory viruses, including the newly discovered bocavirus.

Pediatric patients with asthma who sought treatment at an urban children's medical center were invited to participate in an Abbreviations used HMPV: Human metapneumovirus OR: Odds ratio RSV: Respiratory syncytial virus observational case-control study. The study protocol, recruiting advertisements, and consent forms were approved by the institutional review boards of Emory University School of Medicine, Children's Healthcare of Atlanta at Egleston Hospital, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Legally authorized representatives of the children provided informed consent, and the children, when appropriate, provided assent, after which study coordinators collected clinical information and biologic specimens. All participants fulfilled the study criteria for current persistent asthma (Table I) . Participants were classified as case patients or control subjects by a physician investigator at the time of enrollment. Because of the difficulty in differentiation of asthma from wheezing episodes of other origin in very young children, the lower age limit in the study group was 2 years. Criteria for case patients and control subjects, as well as a clinically manifested respiratory tract viral illness, defined as 2 or more symptoms, are listed in Table I. Because the capacity to detect viral respiratory infections is time sensitive relative to the onset of symptoms, participants with acute exacerbations of asthma were enrolled within 48 hours of admission to the hospital. To account for the known age-related and seasonal variations in occurrence of viral infections, we frequency matched case patients and control subjects by age and season of enrollment.

We obtained respiratory secretions from all participants by using nasopharyngeal and throat swabs. Respiratory specimens were held at 48C until transport on ice pack to the virology laboratories at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Pulmonary function was measured with a calibrated spirometer (KoKo PDS; Ferraris, Louisville, Colo) from the best of 3 forced vital capacity maneuvers. The results fulfilled American Thoracic Society criteria for reproducibility and were expressed according to the reference standards of Hankinson et al. 26 

Respiratory swab specimens were placed in 1 mL of RNA Storage Solution (Ambion, Austin, Tex), and 200-mL aliquots of the fluid were added to NucliSens lysis buffer for automated nucleic acid extraction (bioMérieux, Durham, NC). Total nucleic acid extracts (approximately 40 mL) were supplemented with same volume RNA Storage Solution and tested immediately by using PCR or stored at 2708C.

The nucleic acid extracts were tested for picornaviruses (using primers detecting rhinoviruses and enteroviruses; RSV; HMPV; human parainfluenza viruses 1, 2, and 3; influenza viruses A and B; and adenoviruses) with a previously described PCR assay panel. 27, 28 In addition, all specimens were tested for human coronaviruses 229E and OC43 29 and human bocavirus 30 by using real-time PCR assays. To distinguish rhinoviruses from enteroviruses, amplicons from picornavirus PCR-positive samples were sequenced, and the sequences were compared with published sequences on the National Institutes of Health genetic sequence database GenBank. All nucleic acid extracts were also tested for the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase housekeeping gene to evaluate the integrity of the nucleic acid extract and to detect PCR inhibitors. The assay used for the study detected less than 10 viral target RNA transcript copies and all rhinovirus serotypes.

We performed bivariate analyses using x 2 and Fisher exact tests to compare the prevalence of respiratory viruses and other variables Current persistent asthma In children aged 2-5 y, all of the following: 1. physician diagnosis of asthma; 2. 2 previous episodes of cough, wheezing, and/or respiratory distress; 3. current treatment with asthma medications; and 4. having a parent or sibling with a current or past diagnosis of asthma or allergy and/or having current or previous evidence of atopy, as defined by seasonal rhinitis, eczema, or food hypersensitivity. In children aged 6-17 y, all of the following:

1. physician diagnosis of asthma; 2. symptoms of asthma in past 12 mo; and 3. current treatment with asthma medications. Case Current persistent asthma, hospital admission, or clinic visit for asthma exacerbation, and all of the following: 1. presence of signs and symptoms of airflow obstruction within past 48 h (eg, cough, wheeze, shortness of breath, and chest tightness); 2. increase in asthma symptoms resulting in hospital admission or clinic visit; 3. repeated use of short-acting b-agonists within past 48 h; and 4. increased dose or addition of a new asthma controller therapy within past week.

Current persistent asthma, routine clinic visit for asthma, and all of the following: 1. no systemic steroid therapy in past 4 wk; 2. no increase in the dose or the addition of new controller medications in past week; 3. no change in the frequency of use of short-acting rescue medications in past week; and 4. no increase in asthma symptom frequency in past week. Symptomatic acute respiratory viral illness More than 1 of the following: fever, stuffy/runny nose, headache, muscle aches, and eye redness or pain at the time of clinic visit or hospital admission.

between the study groups. 31 Trends in proportional distribution of FEV 1 by viral infection and by asthma exacerbations were analyzed by using the x 2 trend test. 31 The t test statistic was used to compare mean age and FEV 1 (expressed as percent predicted) by asthma exacerbation status. All P values were calculated on the basis of 2-sided tests. We used multiple logistic regression analysis to model the log odds of asthma exacerbations associated with respiratory tract viral infections and to calculate estimated odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs. 32 All logistic models were tested for potential confounders (eg, age, season, and sex) and effect modifiers. The final models were adjusted for factors (eg, race/ethnicity) that were not collinear and confounded the b coefficient for the association between the respiratory tract viral infections and asthma exacerbations by 10% or more. In addition, the final model included frequency-matched variables, such as age and season. All statistical procedures were performed with SAS version 8.2 software (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC).

, 337 children with a primary diagnosis of asthma were treated at the study hospital, and 374 were treated in the pulmonary clinic. From this population, 190 were eligible to participate in the study; of these, 48 refused, and 142 enrolled. The most common reason for refusal was anxiety related to the nasal swab procedure. Sixty-five enrollees had acute asthma exacerbations, and 77 had well-controlled asthma (Table II) . Of the 65 participants with acute asthma, 47 enrolled at the hospital (referred to as ''hospitalized case patients''), and 18 enrolled at the pulmonary clinic (''nonhospitalized case patients'').

The comparison of frequency-matched case patients and control subjects showed that the mean time since the onset of asthma did not differ between case patients and control subjects (6 years for both). Case patients were significantly more likely than control subjects to be of African American descent, to have visited a health care provider for acute asthma 3 or more times in the past 12 months, to have been hospitalized for asthma at least twice in the past 12 months, and to have ever been admitted to the intensive care unit for asthma or to have 2 or more symptoms of a respiratory tract viral illness at enrollment (Table II) . Children with acute exacerbations were more likely to have received in the past week inhaled b 2 -adrenergic agonists and ipratropium bromide, whereas children with well-controlled asthma were more likely to have been treated with montelukast. The 2 groups did not differ significantly with respect to treatment with inhaled corticosteroids (Table II) , and none of the children received antiviral agents. Forty-seven (72.3%) case patients had been treated with systemic steroids within the past week before enrollment. Prevalence of self-reported hay fever, atopy, family history of asthma, exposure to common allergens, and exposure to second-hand smoke did not differ significantly between the 2 groups (data not shown).

Case patients enrolled at the hospital and at the pulmonary clinic had comparable demographic features. There were no significant differences between these groups in recent use of medications, except ipratropium bromide (23.4% among hospitalized case patients vs 0% among case patients treated at the clinic, P < .05). Hospitalized case patients were significantly more likely to have had 2 or more hospital admissions in the past 12 months (46.8% vs 5.5%; OR, 15.0; 95% CI, 2.0-653.0), but there were no significant differences in the proportion of case patients with 3 or more health care provider visits for acute asthma treatment in the past 12 months and in the proportion of case patients ever admitted to the intensive care unit for asthma. The interval between the onset of asthma exacerbation and hospitalization or clinic visit for case patients was 7 or fewer days for 54 (91.5%) of 59 patients who provided this information (median, 2 days). PCR analysis of respiratory specimens was positive for 1 or more respiratory viruses in 41 (63.1%) of the 65 asthmatic patients with acute exacerbations and in 18 (23.4%) of 77 patients with controlled asthma (P < .001, x 2 test; Table III ). Children with acute asthma exacerbations were nearly 6-fold more likely to have been infected with respiratory viruses than children with controlled asthma (OR, 5.6; 95% CI, 2.7-11.6).

Results of PCR testing by agent are presented in Table  III . Picornaviruses were identified in 54 participants. In 53 of 54 instances, picornavirus-positive specimens were confirmed positive for rhinoviruses, which were by far the most common respiratory viruses detected among study participants. In addition, 3 rhinovirus-positive specimens were also PCR positive with enterovirus-specific primers, indicating mixed infection. A picornavirus detected by means of PCR from 1 child in the control group could not be further characterized. Five children were positive for HMPV, 1 was positive for RSV, and 1 was positive for coronavirus E229. None of the participants were positive for human bocavirus, coronavirus OC43, HPVI 1 through 3, influenza viruses, or adenoviruses (Table  III) . Four children were coinfected with more than 1 respiratory virus: 3 children were positive for both rhinoviruses and enteroviruses, and the RSV-positive child was also positive for HMPV.

Of the 41 children with acute asthma who had positive PCR results for respiratory viruses, 21 (51.2%) had 2 or more symptoms consistent with acute respiratory tract viral infection (median interval between onset of viral symptoms and specimen collection, 4 days). In the control group clinically manifested viral illness was present in 4 (22.2%) of the 18 children with positive results for any respiratory virus. When the presence of symptoms of viral infection was taken into account, the association between asthma exacerbation and respiratory viruses was significant only for children with 2 or more symptoms of acute viral illness of the respiratory tract but not for children without clinically manifested viral infection (Table III) . The association between the respiratory tract viral infections and asthma exacerbations remained significant after controlling for race/ethnicity, age, and season of testing (adjusted OR, 5.5; 95% CI, 2.5-12.3).

For both case patients and control subjects, the prevalence of viral infection did not differ significantly among children aged 5 or fewer years versus children aged 6 to 17 years (Table IV) . To assess the effect of asthma severity on the prevalence of viral infection, we analyzed the proportion of virus-positive children by using available surrogate indicators of overall asthma severity: number of health care provider visits and hospitalizations for asthma attacks in the past 12 months and past intensive care unit admissions for asthma. We found no indicator of asthma In one instance the detected picornavirus could not be further characterized. Four children were coinfected with more than 1 virus: all 3 enterovirus-positive patients were coinfected with rhinoviruses, and an RSV-positive child was positive for HMPV as well.

severity significantly associated with the prevalence of viral infection for case patients or control subjects (Table IV) . Also, there were no significant differences between hospitalized and nonhospitalized case patients in the prevalence of respiratory viruses (55.6% vs 66.0%, P > .05) or symptomatic respiratory tract viral infections (39.0% vs 27.8%, P > .05).

For case patients, the potential effects of the use of systemic steroids within the past week, race, and intervals between the onset of symptoms of asthma exacerbation or the onset of viral infection and study enrollment on the rates of PCR positivity for respiratory viruses was further analyzed. No significant differences by any of these parameters were noted (Table V) .

Because of the differences in montelukast use among case patients and control subjects and the paucity of data with regard to its potential effect on viral infections, we also analyzed virus positivity by montelukast use. For children with asthma exacerbation, 19 (55.4%) of the 34 specimens were positive for respiratory viruses among those who had received montelukast versus 22 (71%) among the 31 who had not. For the control group, the positivity rates were 20.4% (11/54) and 30.4% (7/23), respectively. The differences by montelukast use were not significant for either group. Other potentially relevant factors (eg, atopic status, use of inhaled corticosteroids, parental education level, family income, exposure to potential allergens at home, and family history of asthma) also did not affect the association between respiratory viruses and asthma exacerbations (data not shown).

Rhinovirus infections occurred throughout the year among both case patients and control subjects. For both groups, the highest overall activity was observed during April through June, accounting for 22 ( Fig 1) . Ninety-one participants (33 [50.7%] case patients and 58 [75.3%] control subjects) were able to perform spirometry according to American Thoracic Society standards. FEV 1 was distributed toward significantly lower values among children with acute versus controlled asthma (P < .001, Fisher exact test). Mean FEV 1 in the 33 children with acute asthma was 75% of predicted value versus 94% of predicted value in the 58 children with well-controlled asthma (P < .001, unpaired Student t test). Twelve (36.4%) children with acute exacerbations of asthma had moderate-to-severe airway obstruction (FEV 1 , <60% of predicted value) versus only 1 (1.7%) child with well-controlled asthma. The presence of virus in respiratory secretions was not associated with a reduction in FEV 1 among case patients (P > .05) and control subjects (P > .05).

In this study a high proportion of children with asthma had a rhinovirus detected in respiratory secretions, and rhinoviruses were the only respiratory viruses associated with asthma exacerbations. These results support the findings of previous investigators that acute exacerbations of asthma are significantly associated with rhinovirus infection in both children and adults. 5, 7, 9, 11, 33, 34 However, the association between rhinovirus infection and loss of asthma control was limited in this study to children with clinically manifested symptoms of a viral respiratory tract illness. There was a strong association between asthma exacerbation and symptomatic rhinovirus infections, and the extent of the difference between case patients and control subjects suggests that rhinoviruses might account for approximately 30% of asthma exacerbations in children. The overall rates of rhinovirus detection in our study for both case patients and control subjects were comparable with those reported in other studies of asthmatic patients. [7] [8] [9] [10] 12, 35 A number of factors could contribute to a role for rhinoviruses in asthma exacerbations, including their ability for replication in the cells of the lower airway tract; stimulate an inflammatory response that contributes to asthma exacerbations; or both. 34 It is also possible that patients with asthma are more susceptible to rhinovirus infections. For example, a deficient immune response to rhinovirus infection, such as impaired type 1 cytokine production and defects in IFN-b previously described in asthmatic patients with atopy, might increase susceptibility to rhinovirus infection or impair clearance and result in more frequent or persistent rhinovirus. 34, [36] [37] [38] A substantial proportion of study participants (29.2% of case patients and 18.2% of control subjects) were infected with rhinoviruses but did not meet the study definition of symptomatic. Although the rate of rhinovirus positivity without accompanying acute respiratory illness was higher among case patients than among control subjects, this difference did not reach statistical significance. In a recent longitudinal study of healthy children, 20.6% of all rhinovirus infections were asymptomatic. 39 In our study, the rate of rhinovirus infection in asthmatic children without clinically manifested acute viral illness was substantially higher: 47.8% for all rhinovirus-positive case patients and 100% for rhinovirus-positive control subjects. The basis for this high rate of rhinovirus infections without clinically apparent symptoms of acute respiratory illness in asthma is unclear but could indicate a high rate of persistent infections possible associated with a defect in ability to clear infection.

Rhinovirus infections have been associated with increased airway responsiveness and decreases in pulmonary function, although the latter has not been observed consistently among asthmatic patients or during experimental rhinovirus infections. 11, [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] In our study detection of rhinovirus RNA was not associated with a reduction in FEV 1 within either case patients or control subjects. However, recent treatment with bronchodilators and corticosteroids received by study participants could have masked the effects of rhinovirus infection on lung function. Treatment received for asthma attacks before enrollment might explain the relatively low proportion (12/33 [36.4%] ) of case patients with moderate-to-severe airway obstruction (FEV 1 , <60% of expected value).

Interestingly, although rhinoviruses are reported to have peak activity during the spring and fall, 46 we found no statistically significant difference by season of the year in the rate of rhinovirus positivity in children with poorly controlled asthma, with rates of rhinovirus infection ranging from 50% to 71%, but for both case patients and control subjects, the highest level of rhinovirus activity was observed during spring months.

Although other studies have suggested that other respiratory viruses might also play a significant role in exacerbations of asthma, 5, 8, 9, 15, 47 in the present study, using a panel of similarly sensitive PCR assays for 13 respiratory viruses, we only found an association between asthma exacerbations and rhinovirus. The seasonal, yearto-year, and geographic variability in activity levels for these respiratory viruses; differences in patient populations, specimen collection, or test methodologies; or both might have contributed to differences between our findings and those of other studies.

The relatively low prevalence of human RSV infection in our study is consistent with our exclusion of children younger than 2 years and with RSV being an important contributor to obstructive airway disease in children younger than 2 years of age but not older children. In addition, limiting enrollment to children with an established diagnosis of asthma eliminated children with transient wheezing episodes often caused by RSV. Similarly, limiting our study population to children older than 2 years might have also decreased HMPV detections in our study because most children appear to be infected with HMPV at a young age. 48 It does not appear that influenza was a substantial contributor to asthma exacerbation in the Atlanta area during 2003 and 2004. The absence of influenza virus detections in our study can be explained by the shorter than usual duration of the 2003-2004 influenza season in the state of Georgia, which might have reduced its overall effect. According to the Georgia Division of Public Health surveillance data, the peak in influenza activity in the state was limited to a 3-week period in December (http:// health.state.ga.us/epi/flu/fluupdall.asp). We might have missed influenza-positive children because of the small number of participants enrolled during the high-risk period (December enrollment, n 5 8).

We did not detect the recently discovered human bocavirus 22 in any of the study participants. Because bocavirus detections in asthmatic children have been reported, 18, 19 additional studies of potential association of this new virus with asthma are warranted.

Unlike many other studies of respiratory viruses in asthma, we collected respiratory secretions by using combined nasopharyngeal and throat swabs rather than nasal lavage specimens. Although it is possible that the use of swab instead of lavage specimens decreased our detection rates for some respiratory viruses, the potential loss in sensitivity with the swab was likely compensated for by the use of very sensitive PCR assays that have proved highly effective in other studies. 27, 49, 50 A major strength of this study is use of a panel of very sensitive PCR assays for a full range of respiratory viruses. By enrolling patients over a full calendar year and frequency matching of case patients and control subjects by age and season of enrollment, we reduced potential biases associated with temporal and age-related differences in respiratory tract viral infections. Although there were certain differences in baseline characteristics between the case patients and control subjects (eg, by recent treatment, race/ethnicity, number of clinic visits, or hospitalizations for asthma in the past 12 months) that might have contributed to the differences in viral infection prevalence, none of these variables was significantly associated with rates of virus positivity and thus should not have confounded our findings.

One limitation of the present study is the modest sample size and corresponding limited ability to more carefully look at subgroups that might have clarified or identified new findings. Studies with larger numbers of patients and conducted over multiple years are needed to fully understand the role of all respiratory viruses in asthma exacerbations and to better define the association with rhinoviruses.

In summary, we found a strong association between symptomatic rhinovirus infections and asthma exacerbations. These results underscore the need for additional research to better characterize this association and suggest that future studies should investigate a role for antirhinovirus treatment or prevention as a strategy for decreasing disease burden associated with asthma.

Potentially preventable urinary tract infection in patients with type 2 diabetes -A hospital-based study,"Aim: To investigate the prevalence of urinary tract infections in hospitalized patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and identify corresponding risk factors. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study on 7.347 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus as the principal diagnosis, using hospitalization discharge summary data from January 1 to December 31, 2015. Disease stages were classified as stages 1, 2, and 3. Results: Of 7.347 patients, 16.2% had urinary tract infections. The urinary tract infection prevalence was 24.4% in 428 patients in stage 1 and 4.8% in 2.840 patients in stage 2; it was higher among patients who underwent medical procedures than among those who underwent surgery (24.4% vs 4.8%). In multivariate regression analysis, age (OR = 1.031; 95% CI = 1.02-1.04), length of hospitalization (OR = 1.018; 95% CI = 1.013-1.024), sex (woman) (OR = 2.248; 95% CI = 1.778-2.842), comorbidity of stage 3 cerebrovascular disease (OR = 1.737; 95% CI = 1.111-2.714), and comorbidity of stage 1 colorectal cancer (OR = 2.417; 95% CI = 1.152-5.074) were found to be the risk factors of urinary tract infection in the ten hospitals considered. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that urinary tract infection prevalence was higher in women without evidence of organ injury and those receiving medical treatment. Comorbidities (cerebrovascular disease and colorectal cancer) were identified as risk factors.","The prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) has increased in recent years (Zheng et al., 2018; isk Factor Collabora, 2016) . In 2015, the International Diabetes Federation reported that approximately 415 million adults (aged 20-79 years) had T2DM; this number is expected to increase to 642 million by 2040 (Zheng et al., 2018) . Globally, the prevalence of age-standardized adult diabetes increased from 4.3% in 1980 to 9.0% in 2014 in men and from 5.0% to 7.9% in women in the same time frame (isk Factor Collabora, 2016) . By 2015, T2DM had occurred in 12.1% of men and 7.7% of women in Portugal (Sociedade Portuguesa de Diabetologia, 2015); only 7.3% of these patients received primary care (Sociedade Portuguesa de Diabetologia, 2015) .

T2DM and its complications have contributed to an increase in the rate of admissions (Zheng et al., 2018) . The admission rates for patient with T2DM are two to six times higher than those for patients without diabetes (Lara-Rojas et al., 2019) . In Portugal, 88-870 adults had T2DM in 2006, and hospital admission rates increased by 82.7% between 2006 and 2015, with acute myocardial infarction being the primary cause of hospitalization (Sociedade Portuguesa de Diabetologia, 2015) . Microangiopathic disease and stroke were identified as predictors of hospitalization within Portugal's National Health System (Sociedade Portuguesa de Diabetologia, 2015) . In contrast, cardiovascular disease is the primary cause of hospitalization in Spain (Lara-Rojas et al., 2019) .

In Portugal, urinary tract infections (UTIs) are frequent adverse events during hospitalization (https://apurologia.pt/. A, 2008), for which T2DM is a major risk factor (Wilke et al., 2015; Hirji et al., 2012) . However, the cause of UTI is considered to be multifactorial (https:// apurologia.pt/. A, 2008) . Studies (Wilke et al., 2015; Hirji et al., 2012) have reported that UTI is prevalent in those with diabetes, particularly in older women. Wilke et al. (2015) showed that 3.86% of UTI events were associated with inpatient hospitalization and 35.6% of UTI events were caused by more than one reported bacterium. It is difficult to determine the actual incidence of UTIs in Portugal, but approximately 15% of women aged 70 years have asymptomatic bacteriuria; this rate increases to 30-40% in elderly women admitted to geriatric institutions and practically to 100% in patients with permanent urinary tubes (https://apurologia.pt/. A, 2008). Mazzi et al. (2017) reported that other risk factors, such as severe hypoglycemic events, advanced age, and the presence of comorbidities, may increase the occurrence of infection in diabetes patients. Another study (de Decker et al., 2017) found that a high burden of comorbidities (stroke, heart failure, myocardial infarction, and functional cognitive impairment) increased the risk of hypoglycemic events in elderly patients (aged over 80 years) with diabetes. Mendez-Bailon et al. (2017) studied 715 patients with diabetes admitted for cardiovascular diseases who underwent invasive cardiac procedures, and found that obesity (18%), arterial hypertension (67.3%), lipid abnormalities (45.8%), renal failure (14.07%), and intermittent claudication (1.65%) were risk factors for adverse events during hospitalization.

Recently, a meta-analysis (Rodríguez-Acelas et al., 2017) revealed that the duration of surgery, duration of central venous catheterization, number of re-operations, type of hospitalization, admission to the intensive care unit, use of immunosuppressants, and use of cephalosporins were risk factors for adverse events during hospitalization in patients with diabetes. Akirov et al. (2017) reported that variability in glycemic levels (glucose ≥180 mg/dl) during hospitalization increases the length of stay, rate of infections and complications, and mortality risk.

This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of UTI events during hospitalization and corresponding risk factors in those with diabetes that were hospitalized.

The study was performed in 32 public hospitals in Portugal. The medical data of 7.347 patients with T2DM between January 1 and December 31, 2015 were reviewed.

Inclusion criteria were hospitalized patients with T2DM as the principal diagnosis, older than 18 years. Exclusion criteria included patients with type 1 of diabetes mellitus and patients with T2DM admitted to hospitals providing oncology services and mental health.

This retrospective study used medical data from the National Hospital Morbidity Database provided by the Central Administration of the Health System. We used (1) the Diagnosis Related Group (DRG) to identify episodes of T2DM (codes DX 250.00) as principal diagnoses during hospitalization and (2) Staging [13] version 5.26 to identify the severity of T2DM, its comorbidities and stages, and UTI events.

Staging uses a specific methodology -MEDSTAT-COC [13]that identifies potential UTI events (designated as complications-of-care [COC] Urinary) through principal and secondary diagnostic codes, ICD-9-CM, as well as ICD-9-CM procedure codes, age, sex, and the number of days of hospitalization. The parameters for COC Urinary were as follows: code 59010acute pyelonephritis not specified; code 5909infection of the kidney not specified; code 5950acute cystitis; code 5953trigonitis; code 5959cystitis not specified; and code 5990urinary tract infection not specified. UTI events that started from day 1 of admission until discharge from the hospital were investigated in this study.

Bivariate analysis was used to determine the prevalence of UTIs. The distribution and the rate of COC Urinary were calculated using the following formula14:

• COC Urinary infection rate = total number of patients with infection/sum of patients at risk without infection and at risk with infection * 100.

Through the Staging software (Thomson Reuteurs, 2009) , COC risk was explicitly assessed according to the relationship between the principal and secondary diagnosis codes, ICD-9-CM, and defined as (i) a patient at risk for a particular infection and (ii) a patient with evidence of potential infection of care during hospitalization.

To determine the risk factors of UTI, we used multivariate logistic regression analysis. The risk adjustment model was used to estimate the correlation between the occurrence of COC Urinary (dependent variable) and the various risk factors (independent variables). The forward conditional method was used for stepwise selection of the variables, whereas the Hosmer and Lemeshow (H-L) test was used to adjust the model with the independent variables. For the validation of the model, its discriminatory capability, sensitivity, and specificity were analyzed using the area under the curve of the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) (c). COC Urinary was set as the adverse outcome and dependent variable that assumed the values: 0 (without infection) and 1 (with infection). Independent variables were selected from variables previously reported to be associated with less favorable health outcomes (Iezzoni and Iezzoni, 2003) as follows:

(1) Length of hospitalization: the length of stay causes adverse outcomes because patients are more exposed to hospital infections. The variable was constructed based on the total number of days inhospital.

(2) Severity of primary disease: the severity of disease increases the risk of death or organ failure and weakens the immune system. We considered 3 stages (Thomson Reuteurs, 2009 ): stage 1, initial phase of the disease without evidence of organ injury; and stages 2 and 3, more advanced severity levels of the disease with evidence of organ injury and micro-and macrovascular complications, respectively.

(3) The comorbidities and stage: comorbidities increase the disease burden. We focused on the most relevant comorbidities (defined according to the number of in-and out-of-hospital deaths previously reported to represent a significant burden in those with diabetes. The following comorbidities were included: lipid abnormalities (NUT82); essential hypertension (CVS13); obesity (NUT02); coronary artery disease without prior coronary revascularization (CVS11); cerebrovascular disease (NEU04); congestive heart failure (CVS09); pneumonia: bacterial (RES15); renal failure (GUS08); other disorders of the respiratory system (RES83); rhino, adeno, and corona virus infections (RES24); neoplasm, malignant: colon and rectum (GIS27); neoplasm, malignant: lungs, bronchi, or mediastinum (RES13); and neoplasm, malignant: stomach (GIS30). For all comorbidities, we considered three stages (Thomson Reuteurs, 2009): stage 1, known diagnosis, without local or systemic complications; stage 2, disease limited to an organ or system, increased risk of adverse outcomes; and stage 3, generalized involvement of the system, with systemic complications and with even higher risk of adverse outcomes. (4) Treatment type: the treatment type may increase the risk of bacterial infections, particularly if preventive procedures are not taken. This was categorized as surgical (surgical treatments) and medical (other invasive diagnostic and therapeutic procedures) and was constructed based on the admission episode and was classified according to the DRG criteria. (5) Hospitals: some hospitals do not apply infection control programs.

This variable was constructed based on the volume of hospitalization (episodes/population) in descending order: hospital (1) represents the highest-volume hospital, and hospital (32) represents the lowest-volume hospital. Age and sex.

OR values were presented with their respective 95% confidence intervals (CI) or p-values. The p-value set to indicate statistical significance was p < 0.005. All statistical analyses were performed using the IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 22.0. (Armonk, NY: IBM Corp.).

This study was approved by the Central Administration of the Health System. The need for written informed consent from all participants was waived because this was a retrospective study with anonymized patient data.

Of the 7.347 patients with T2DM who were admitted, 3.757 (51.1%) patients were men, and 3.590 (48.9%) were women. The majority of patients were elderly, with 71.1% above 65 years. The median duration of hospitalization was 8 days (average 12 ± 18 days).

The total UTI rate was 16.2%. Patient characteristics are shown in Table 1 . Fig. 1 shows the proportion of T2DM patients by hospital. In hospital (1), 631 patients were admitted, corresponding to 7.9% of the population; meanwhile, in hospital (32), 101 patients where admitted, corresponding to 1.3% of the hospital production.

The UTI infection rate was significantly higher in women than in men (23.6% vs 10.5%; OR = 2.65; p < 0.0001), in those aged above 85 years than in those aged 18-64 years (27.5% vs 9%; OR = 3.84; p < 0.0001), and in those with stage 1 disease than in those with stage 2 (24.4% vs 4.8%; OR = 0.16; p < 0.0001). It was also significantly higher in those who received medical treatment than those who received surgical treatment (24.6% vs 4.8%; OR = 6.52; p < 0.0001). Table 2 shows the values of UTI rate by sex, age (stratified), severity of T2DM, comorbidities, and treatment type.

Multivariate regression analysis with COC Urinary as the dependent variable showed that the following variables were significant predictors of UTIs: age of at least 18 years (OR = 1.031; 95% CI = 1.02-1.041); length of hospitalization (OR = 1.018; 95% IC = 1.013-1.024); sex (woman) (OR = 2.248; 95% IC = 1.778; 2.842); comorbidity of stage 3 cerebrovascular disease (OR = 1.737; 95% IC = 1.111-2.714); and comorbidity of stage 1 colorectal cancer (OR = 2.417; 95% IC = 1.152-5.074). Table 3 shows the result of the logistic regression analysis with COC Urinary as the dependent variable.

Among hospitals, hospitals 19 and 32 showed the lowest and higher OR value of 2.167 and 4.741, respectively. Meanwhile, among the three stages of disease severity, stage 2 showed the highest OR of 0.604 (0.304,1.199).

The p-value found for the model was p < 0.0001 in Table 4 . The H-L test revealed a p-value of 0.848 in Table 5 , and the area under curve was 0.862, indicating that the model had a good sensitivity and specificity in Fig. 2 .

Collectively, the results of this model show that (1) the risk of UTIs was higher in hospitals 5, 8, 11, 12, 13, 19, 20, 27, 28, and 32; (2) the comorbidity of stage 3 cerebrovascular disease and comorbidity of stage 1 colorectal cancer are risk factors for UTIs; and (3) the severity of T2DM is not an explanatory factor of UTIs. Our study showed that UTI rate is higher in women without evidence of organ injury and in those receiving medical treatment.

A recent epidemiological study (Tandogdu and Wagenlehner, 2016) showed significant geographic variations in the frequency of UTIs in those with diabetes, with the rate being the highest in developing countries (24%) compared with that in the US (12.9%) and Europe (19.6%) (Tandogdu and Wagenlehner, 2016) . In our study, the rate of UTIs was 16.2%, indicating differences in healthcare delivery and systems between developing and developed countries.

We found a higher rate of UTIs in women than in men (UTI rate, 23.6% vs 10.5%). Further, it was also higher in those aged at least 85 years (27.5%). Popejoy et al. (2017) found that 48.5% of women with diabetes and aged above 65 years had UTIs. The discrepancy in the UTI rates may imply better healthcare in Portugal.

UTIs were also more common after medical treatment than after surgical treatment (24.6% vs 4.8%), consistent with the findings reported in a previous study (Shah et al., 2018) . This was attributed to (i) the excessive use of certain medical devices involving urologic Abbreviations: T2DM, type 2 of diabetes mellitus; SD, standard deviation. manipulation (e.g. catheters); (ii) failure to follow aseptic techniques; and (iii) procedures in patients with diabetes with poor glycemic control and/or with asymptomatic bacteriuria. The difference in the frequency of UTIs between the type of treatment may be due to the different therapeutic strategies employed; for example, antibiotic prophylaxis was administered in patients undergoing surgery. With respect to the severity of diabetes, we found a higher UTI rate in patients with stage 2 diabetes than that of those with stage 1 diabetes (4.8% vs 24.4% respectively; OR = 0.16), contradicting previous studies (isk Factor Collabora, 2016; Ljungqvist et al., 2005) . Increased hyperglycemia may occur after surgical stress (Ljungqvist et al., 2005) , and, thus, our results may indicate a non-effective glycemic control in those with stage 1 severity of diabetes. Typically, patients with diabetes are only diagnosed with UTI during their first hospital visit in the health services of the Portuguese National Health System because of the gap in follow-up of these patients in primary care (Sociedade Portuguesa de Diabetologia, 2015) . This may have caused a higher risk of UTIs in those with stage 1 severity T2DM than those with stage 2, because patients with stage 2 T2DM have previous glycemic control.

Logistic regression analysis showed the influence of hospitalization on the risk of UTI. This is consistent with the findings of some studies (https://apurologia.pt/. A, 2008; Wilke et al., 2015; Hirji et al., 2012; Mazzi et al., 2017; de Decker et al., 2017; Mendez-Bailon et al., 2017; Rodríguez-Acelas et al., 2017; Shwartz et al., 1994) that have reported a high number of unnecessary hospitalizations. One study (Rosenthal et al., 2014) showed that marked differences exist in the use of medical resources, hospital beds, diagnostic exams, and medical treatments putting the patient at risk of infection. The findings in the current study COC Urinary, urinary tract infection after procedure; NUT82, lipid abnormalities; CVS13, essential hypertension; NUT02, obesity; CVS11, coronary artery disease without prior coronary revascularization; NEU04, cerebrovascular disease; CVS09, congestive heart failure; RES15, pneumonia: bacterial; GUS08, renal failure; RES83, other disorders of the respiratory system; RES24, rhino, adeno, and corona virus infections; GIS27, neoplasm, malignant: colon and rectum; RES13, neoplasm, malignant: lungs, bronchi, or mediastinum; GIS30, neoplasm, malignant: stomach.

Step may be due to (1) discrepancies in the use of hospital resources;

(2) concentration of specific procedures to certain patient groups; and (3) differences in the clinical management of patients. Further, some studies (Galiczewski and Shurpin, 2017; Kummerow Broman et al., 2018; Fairfield et al., 2018) have reported unsafe treatments, inadequate human and technical resources, and, consequently, poor healthcare practices, leading to variations in the frequency of UTIs among geographic areas. Some hospitals do not observe safety protocols in the insertion, maintenance, and aseptic removal of devices and do not comply with guidelines for the prevention of UTIs, such as the assessment of the need for catheterization (based on individual risk); do not select the type of catheter according to the predicted duration of catheterization; do not implement prevention and control policies for asymptomatic bacteriuria; and do not follow clinical practice guidelines for managing hospitalized patients with diabetes who have UTIs. With respect to sex, women were at a higher risk of UTIs than men (OR = 2.248), consistent with other studies (Popejoy et al., 2017; Costantini et al., 2017) . This may be due to (i) hypotonic neurogenic bladder and (2) physiological changes in bladder associated with aging. This raises a question about the efficacy of treatment of urinary tract alterations.

With respect to diabetes severity, no difference was observed in the risk of UTIs between those with stage 2 and stage 1 T2DM, in contrast to other studies that reported that the severity of diabetes is a predictor of COC Urinary (isk Factor Collabora, 2016; Popejoy et al., 2017) . These findings may be due to the differences in clinical coding between health institutions and the definition of the severity of diabetes. This result raises a question about the use of the guidelines for T2DM diagnosis.

With respect to the comorbidities, we found that cerebrovascular disease and malignant neoplasm of the colon and rectum are predictors of UTIs, consistent with previous studies (Kwaan et al., 2017; Mi et al., 2018; Vermeij et al., 2018) . Particularly, the association between stage 3 cerebrovascular disease and UTI may be due to the use of ineffective prophylactic procedures and differences in clinical coding. These findings indicate the need for more effective clinical safety protocols for nursing staff. Meanwhile, the comorbidity of malignant neoplasm of the colon and rectum may be due to (1) ineffective prophylactic measures, (2) differences in clinical practice, (3) differences in clinical coding, and (4) differences in the use of hospital resources, as previously reported (Kwaan et al., 2017; D'Hondt et al., 2017; Eveno et al., 2010) . Some hospitals do not offer specialized care, and thus, we could assess what treatments are available in these hospitals.

Our study has several limitations. First, biochemical data, particularly, the glycemic values in pre-and post-treatment that may result in less favorable outcomes, were lacking. Second, inconsistences may have been present in the clinical coding of medical data (codes ICD-9-CM) among hospitals. Therefore, random audits of medical processes have caused better handling of medical data, in Portugal. Third, we do not know if the cause of UTIs was preventable or not. Lastly, this study has all the limitations and risks of bias inherent to cross-sectional study design, thus limiting the generalizability of the conclusions to other populations. Given the increasing incidence of T2DM worldwide, particularly in Portugal, diabetes-specific healthcare guidelines during hospitalization are needed, and the number of physicians and nurses in primary care should be increased to meet the increased need for proper management of comorbidities, in order to avoid more hospitalizations.

In this study, we identified individuals with diabetes, who were at a higher risk of UTI, which is the most common adverse event during hospitalization in patients with diabetes. Our findings suggest that women in stage 1 of T2DM have the highest prevalence of UTIs and those who have received medical treatment with fewer comorbidities. More effective health policies should be implemented to manage T2DM, particularly in stage 1 disease. Home visits by primary care physicians and nurses are crucial for those with limited healthcare access for better diabetes management and for reducing admission rates. In hospitals, health professionals should control hyperglycemia before and after medical treatments and should adopt safe protocols to reduce UTIs. Further, health education on diet and nutrition should be provided to reduce comorbidities due to increased risk for UTIs. This study can be beneficial for risk stratification of these patients and for the early identification of those at higher risk of infection, and the findings can be used to implement optimal healthcare measures to prevent UTIs.

"Hospital-Acquired Respiratory Viral Infections: Incidence, Morbidity, and Mortality in Pediatric and Adult Patients",Background. Hospital-acquired respiratory viral infections can result in morbidity and mortality of hospitalized patients. This study was undertaken to better understand the magnitude of the problem of nosocomial respiratory viral infections in adult and pediatric patients.,"Respiratory viruses are transmitted in the hospital setting from direct contact with infected visitors and family, infected healthcare workers, other infected patients, indirectly through contact with contaminated fomites, or from patient-to-patient spread due to poor hand hygiene practices among healthcare providers. The frequency of specific respiratory viruses causing nosocomial infections reflects their activity in the community [1] . Few studies have assessed the outcomes of nosocomial respiratory viral infections in noncritically ill, non-immunocompromised adult and pediatric patients. In one study, 1 in 5 children admitted to a pediatric intensive care unit (ICU) due to a respiratory viral infection had acquired the infection in the hospital. These children had an approximately 6-fold increased likelihood of mortality compared with those who had community-acquired respiratory viral infections [2] . In another pediatric study, 49% of nosocomial respiratory viral infections occurred in premature infants [3] . One study in adult patients noted that 24% of nonventilated hospital-acquired pneumonias were caused by viruses [4] . These publications suggest that nosocomial respiratory viral infections can lead to significant morbidity and mortality. We investigated such cases in our adult and pediatric hospitals to better understand the magnitude of the problem and the outcomes of such infections.

This was a retrospective, Institutional Review Board-approved study of patients who developed laboratory-confirmed respiratory viral infections and whose symptoms began during hospitalization at Rhode Island Hospital and Hasbro Children's Hospital (HCH) between April 1, 2015 and April 1, 2016. Rhode Island Hospital is licensed for 719 beds, 87 of which are licensed for HCH. The two hospitals are located in adjoining buildings on the same campus as part of the Lifespan Hospital System.

A nosocomial respiratory viral infection was defined as a hospitalized patient who had a positive respiratory viral panel ([RVP] Luminex, Austin, TX), rapid influenza test (Xpert; Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA), or rapid respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) test (Xpert; Cepheid) of a nasopharyngeal or bronchoscopic lavage specimen. The RVP assay included testing for influenza A and B, RSV A and B, coronavirus, parainfluenza, human metapneumovirus, adenovirus, as well as rhinovirus and enterovirus; however, the assay did not distinguish the latter 2 viruses, which heretofore will be noted as rhino/enterovirus.

Hospitalized patients with a positive result in one of these tests during the study period were identified using our institutional infection control software system (TheraDoc; Premier, Charlotte, NC). A definite nosocomial respiratory viral infection was defined as a patient whose number of days from hospital admission to symptom onset exceeded the upper range for the incubation period of the identified virus (Table 1) . A possible nosocomial respiratory viral infection case was defined as a patient in whom the number of days from hospital admission to symptom onset was within the range of the incubation period for the identified virus who were admitted without clinical signs or symptoms of a respiratory infection. A patient could be included more than once during the hospitalization if they had complete resolution of symptoms ascribed to the respiratory viral infection, recurrence of symptoms compatible with such an infection, and the time interval was greater than the above-noted incubation period. If the second such episode was due to a different virus, it was considered a definite case, and if it was due to the same virus, it was considered a possible case. Cases were assigned to a season based on the date when the symptoms of a respiratory viral infection were first documented in the medical record. Estimates of the incidence of nosocomial viral infections yearly in US acute care adult and pediatric hospitals were based on the number of such infections identified in the current study and the number of admissions to these hospitals during the 2014 fiscal reporting year based on data from the American Hospital Association.

A literature review was performed using the following PubMed search terms: nosocomial; hospital-acquired; and respiratory viral infections. Only studies written in the English language were included. Studies were excluded in our comparative analysis of the incidence of respiratory viral infections if the study was an outbreak investigation or if the reported incidence included nonrespiratory viral infections.

We identified 40 (32 definite and 8 possible) nosocomial viral respiratory tract infections in 38 patients during the study period, including 17 patients admitted to the adult hospital and 23 patients admitted to the pediatric hospital (5 and 44 cases per 10 000 admissions to the adult and pediatric hospital, respectively) ( Table 2 ). The median age of cases in the adult and pediatric hospitals was 56 and 1 year of age, respectively. Eleven (28%) of the cases were immunocompromised. In 6 cases, patients were in an ICU when they developed symptoms. In 5 other cases, after the nosocomial respiratory viral infection was identified, the patient was transferred to an ICU. The mean interval from symptom onset to ICU admission was 1.8 days. Two of these 5 cases, and 4 of the 10 cases already in an ICU, required mechanical ventilation after a mean interval of 5 and 0 days after symptom onset, respectively. In 17 of the 40 cases (43%), antibiotics were initiated at the time of symptom onset, and in 82% of the cases, the antibiotics were continued despite positive test results for the respiratory viral infection. It is unclear how many of these cases had bacterial coinfection. Fever (defined as temperature >38°C) and/or cough were the initial symptoms in over half of the cases (78% and 60%, respectively). Fever was the most common symptom among the pediatric patients (83%), whereas cough was the most common symptom among adult patients (77%). Congestion and rhinorrhea were present in 48% and 38% of patients, respectively. No adult patients had documented symptoms of vomiting or conjunctivitis associated with their viral infection; however, both were documented in pediatric patients (15% and 2.5%, respectively). No adult patients had a single isolated symptom at presentation, but fever was the only presenting symptom in 3 of the 23 pediatric cases. Forty-four viruses were identified in the 40 cases, including 4 cases of viral coinfection ( Table 3 ). The most common viruses identified were rhino/enterovirus in both adults (61%) and pediatric cases (54%). Influenza A only accounted for 3 cases (6.8%); no nosocomial influenza B cases were identified. During the study period, influenza activity was widespread in Rhode Island March 2, 2015 through April 1, 2016 per data from the Rhode Island Department of Health. Although 63% of cases occurred in the fall and winter, they were identified throughout the year (Figure 1) . Two adult and 3 pediatric patients (13%) died during the hospitalization involving rhino/enterovirus (2 adults, 1 pediatric patient), metapneumovirus (1 pediatric patient), and RSV (1 pediatric patient). The 3 pediatric patients were under 2 years of age. It is difficult to ascribe mortality to such infections in patients with multiple comorbidities; however, 1 pediatric patient with multiple congenital abnormalities decompensated shortly after the viral infection was diagnosed leading to intubation and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). The patient died 1 month after the respiratory virus testing was positive. Another pediatric patient with a hematologic malignancy decompensated shortly after the viral infection was diagnosed leading to intubation and ECMO. The patient died 11 days after respiratory virus testing was positive.

Forty nosocomial respiratory viral infections were diagnosed in 38 patients during 1 year, predominantly involving rhino/ enterovirus in both pediatric and adult patients. Our data are strikingly similar to a study done nearly 40 years ago [5] . These authors found an incidence of 55 nosocomial respiratory viral infections per 10 000 pediatric hospital admissions, and 4 such infections per 10 000 adult medical admissions. Overall, 1 in 229 admissions to our pediatric hospital developed a nosocomial respiratory viral infection. However, at its peak in the fall, 1 in 139 admissions to our pediatric hospital developed such an infection. Based on our data and the number of US hospital admissions during fiscal year 2014, we estimate that there are approximately 15 834 adult and 3121 pediatric cases of nosocomial respiratory viral infections in US acute care hospitals yearly.

Fever and/or cough were the most common presenting symptoms often leading to initiation of antibacterial therapy. Approximately half of the pediatric cases were under 1 year of age, and these patients appear to be at greater risk of acquiring such infections [6] . Twelve percent of cases were associated with ICU admission, and 15% required intubation a mean of 1.8 days after symptom onset. One fatal case involved a nosocomial RSV infection, and another involved nosocomial metapneumovirus infection; however, both cases were associated with deterioration requiring intubation and ECMO. Autopsy data have confirmed that nosocomial respiratory viral infections can cause or contribute to mortality [7] .

Respiratory viruses are clearly important pathogens causing hospital-acquired infections [8, 9] . In one study, 23% of severe nosocomial pneumonia in adults were due to respiratory viruses [10] . For decades, it has been known that nosocomial respiratory viral infections are a particular problem in pediatric patients [11] . In one study, 1 in 6 children under the age of 4 hospitalized for 1 week or more during winter or spring developed a nosocomial respiratory viral infection [12] . However, detailed studies of noninfluenza nosocomial respiratory viral infections are limited, and, to our knowledge, our study is the only one that broadly assessed the incidence of these infections in both adult and pediatric patients in a nonepidemic setting in approximately 40 years (Table 4 ). We found that rhinovirus and/or enterovirus were the predominant viruses identified among nosocomial respiratory viral infections. A previous prospective cohort study demonstrated that rhinovirus was the most commonly detected virus among children with viral respiratory infections, and approximately 20% of these infections were hospital acquired [13] . Similar to our findings, a pediatric study found that 73% of nosocomial respiratory infections were due to rhinovirus [14] . However, another pediatric study found that RSV and influenza were associated with 51% and 19% of such cases, respectively [2] . This may reflect differences in virologic diagnostic testing performed as well as the recognition of RSV in patients diagnosed with bronchiolitis at admission. Seventy-nine percent and 81% of our hospital rooms are single occupancy for our adult and pediatric patients, respectively. During the study period, our hospital infection control policy stated that adult and pediatric patients presenting with influenza-like illness should be placed in contact and droplet precautions. However, we realize that influenza-like illness may be insensitive indicator for some respiratory viral infections [15] . Nevertheless, such patients were placed in a private room, or if no private room was available, they were cohorted with patients identified to have the same respiratory virus. Despite this policy, nosocomial respiratory viral infections occurred. This most likely reflects inadequate screening of ill visitors and family or ill healthcare workers reporting for duty despite symptoms of a respiratory viral infection because these have not been stressed in recent educational efforts, and our hospital did not have a formal screening program for visitors and staff. However, based on an educational campaign and compliance monitoring, we believe that transmission of such infections in the hospital setting was less likely to be due to noncompliance with the policy, inadequate decontamination of the inanimate environment, or suboptimal hand hygiene compliance. Our hospital occupational health policy followed the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines for mitigating risk of influenza transmission from infected healthcare workers to patients that uses fever as a determining factor for which healthcare workers should not have patient contact [16] . However, such guidelines may be inadequate as previously noted [17] . Unfortunately, fever is an insensitive indicator of influenza infection in adult healthcare workers at onset of symptoms when there may be maximal risk of transmission [18, 19] . At least 1 reported influenza outbreak involved healthcare providers who apparently worked with mild illness [20] . Nevertheless, the vast majority of our patients' nosocomial respiratory viral infections were not due to influenza. Thus, hospital policies and national guidelines should focus on reducing patient risk from all respiratory viruses, not just influenza.

Unfortunately, many community hospitals may not perform testing for respiratory viruses beyond rapid influenza testing. Thus, cases of nosocomial respiratory viral infections are often unrecognized. In addition, healthcare providers may not have a high index of suspicion for such hospital-acquired viral infections. As more hospitals use improved laboratory testing for such viruses, there will be a greater appreciation of the risk of such infections in hospitalized patients, a better understanding of their modes of transmission, and ultimately fewer such cases in the future [21] . Educating healthcare providers regarding the risk they pose to their patients when they are infected with respiratory viruses is vitally important, as well as changes in the culture of healthcare providers by dealing with the guilt they feel when they do not report to work with symptoms of a respiratory viral infection [22] . Our study has several potential limitations. It is unclear whether all of the viruses identified were the cause of active infection, or whether their presence in some cases reflected respiratory tract colonization or recent respiratory viral infection. Although diagnostic testing is recommended in our hospital policy for patients admitted with suspected respiratory viral infections, we do not know the compliance with this policy, and we may have underestimated the incidence of such infections. We also may have missed cases in patients who had symptom onset after hospital discharge. Our data was collected over 1 year on 1 hospital campus in the Northeastern United States, and it may not reflect the risk of such infections in different geographic regions, in hospitals with different patient populations, or those with different infection control and occupational health policies. Finally, the retrospective nature of our study required us to rely on established documentation in the patient's medical record. Despite these limitations, we hope our findings will lead to a greater awareness of such infections and changes in hospital infection control policies regarding testing of patients with suggestive symptomatology, assessment of visitor restriction policies, and review of sick leave policies to potentially mitigate risk of such infections in future patients.

We report the second study that comprehensively investigated adult and pediatric patients with nosocomial respiratory viral infections. The first such study [5] involving patients hospitalized from 1977 through 1979 had a very similar incidence of such pediatric and adult infections compared with our findings.

That study tested for fewer respiratory viruses than our study; nevertheless, the data suggest that little has changed regarding the risk of such hospital-acquired infections now nearly 40 years later. We hope that our findings will provide additional support for more frequent testing to identify respiratory viruses, beyond influenza, in hospitalized patients with new onset of respiratory symptoms suggestive of possible viral infection to aid in focusing infection control efforts and to stimulate a search for effective therapies and vaccines.

Risk factors related to hepatic injury in patients with corona virus disease 2019,"Corona virus disease 2019 has rapidly become the most severe public health issue all over the world. Despite respiratory symptoms, hepatic injury has also been observed in clinical settings. This study aimed to investigate the risk factors involved with hepatic injury in the patients with COVID-19.","The corona virus disease 2019 ( COVID- 19) , a severe public health issue in the world, is a newly emerging infectious disease caused by a novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, which may develop to acute respiratory distress syndrome or multiple organs failure [1] [2] [3] . It's reported that this novel coronavirus is identified to the species of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome related-Coronavirus (SARSr-CoV) which belongs to the beta-coronavirus family and share 79.6% sequence identity to SARS-CoV 4 . Based on the phylogeny, taxonomy and established practice, it was officially named as SARS-CoV-2 5 , and the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 was named as COVID-19 6 .

Despite atypical pneumonia as the primary symptom, liver dysfunction has also been observed in many clinical cases [7] [8] [9] , indicating a possibility for the patients with COVID-19 may cause hepatic injury. Except that part of patients receiving lopinavir/ritonavir during hospitalization, which can cause drug-induced hepatic injury 10 .

The laboratory data of 85 patients at admission were collected. Laboratory assessments consisted of complete blood count, blood chemistry, coagulation test, liver and renal function, C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, lactic acid, cardiac markers.

Age and days were represented by median (range), categorical variables by number (%), and laboratory data by mean (interquartile range). Compared the differences between the two groups with t-test, chi-square test or Mann-Whitney U test. Logistic regression was used to select independent risk factors that affect abnormal liver function. Analyses were performed using SPSS 22.0 statistical package (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). P-value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

The characteristics of patients with COVID-19 in the present study were shown in Table 1 . The median age of the patients with COVID-19 was 49 years old, the sex ratio was similar. The average ALT value was 28U/L. The average value of total bilirubin and direct bilirubin were in the normal range. The average level of creatinine was normal.

The median value of creatine kinase was normal. In terms of clinical classification, the proportion of patients with ordinary type was 42.3%, followed by severe and critical patients.

There were 33 patients with abnormal liver function during the whole process of hospitalization, accounting for 38.8% (33/85), including elevated ALT and AST 14.1% of patients (12/85) had abnormal liver function during the whole process of hospitalization. All of them are mild and medium elevation of ALT. Six patients with chronic hepatic diseases were enrolled in our study. There was no abnormal liver function in two patients with HBV infection. There were two patients with alcoholic liver disease, one of them had moderate elevation of ALT (120U/L) within one week after admission, the other one had no liver injury. There were two patients with fatty liver, one patient had mild liver injury on admission, the other one had liver injury on 3 days after admission.

The results were shown in Table 2 . The median age of the two groups was statistically different, the ALT elevation group was 59 years old and the ALT normal group was 44.5 years old.

Albumin in ALT elevation group were significantly lower than those in the ALT normal group (33.4±4.3 vs 37.8±4.8, P = 0.000). The bilirubin level was normal between the two groups. The level of lactic acid was significantly higher in the ALT elevation group (1.5±0.6 vs 1.2±0.5, P = 0.037). The number of lymphocytes in ALT elevation group was significantly lower than that in ALT normal group (0.8 vs 1.4, P = 0.000).

However, the level of CRP was significantly higher in the ALT normal group (39.7 vs 37.4, P = 0.000). At the same time, the number of neutrophils and myoglobin also increased in ALT elevation group than in ALT normal group. The proportion of severe and critical patients in the ALT elevation group was significantly higher, reaching 61.5%.

Multivariate logistic regression was performed to analyze the factors including age, drinking history, baseline albumin, lactic acid, CRP, neutrophils, lymphocytes， myoglobin and clinical classification. It was found that the CRP ≥ 20 mg/L and lymphocyte count< 1.1×10^9/L were independently related to ALT elevation. ( Table   3 )

The present study mainly focused on the risk factors involved with hepatic injury in the patients with COVID-19.

As the number of patients with COVID-19 continues to rise, liver injury is frequently reported as extra-pulmonary clinical feature. Some recent studies revealed that nearly a half of patients experienced different degrees of liver injury 7.8 . However, as far as we know, there is no study on the factors of liver injury. Such as SARS, SARS-CoV-2 uses the same cell entry receptor angiotensin converting enzyme-II 4 , which is expressed in the liver tissue as well. A lately research showed that bile duct cells had higher specific expression of angiotensin converting enzyme-II than hepatocytes 12 , which indicated the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 infected bile duct cells directly and caused hepatic injury. It's suggested that bile duct epithelial cells may play a key role in immunoreaction. However, clinical data from two researches showed that the bile duct injury related indexes alkaline phosphatase, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase and total bilirubin did not increase significantly 10, 14 .

In our study, the hepatic injury of patients was mainly reflected through mild or medium elevation of ALT, and the level of serum TBIL was almost normal. Moreover, the pathological results of liver biopsy showed moderate microvascular steatosis and active inflammation in the hepatic lobule portal area 13 . Due to the use of lopinavir/ritonavir during treatment, it is difficult to distinguish the reason of liver injury according to the pathological results. Although the cell entry receptor angiotensin converting enzyme-II is highly expressed in bile duct cells, recent works .

is the (which was not peer-reviewed) The copyright holder for this preprint . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.28.20028514 doi: medRxiv preprint and our findings suggested that SARS-CoV-2 infection did not cause an obvious bile duct injury. Thus, SARS-COV-2 infection may not be the major reason related to liver injury.

In our study, there were a total of 33 patients with abnormal liver function during the whole process of hospitalization, accounting for 38.8%. And 24.7% (21/85) of them showed ALT elevation on admission. Among the 21 patients presenting with hepatic injury, only one of them had moderate elevation of ALT (179U/L), others had mild liver injury (ALT<2ULN). The results suggested that COVID-19-related hepatic injury was not serious at the beginning of the disease, which was consistent with previous researches. Compared with other study 9 , the higher proportion of patients with liver injury at admission might be related to the number of samples and the different periods from onset to hospitalization in our study.

Among the patients presenting with abnormal liver function in the present study, moderate and severe types of patients were more likely to have liver injury, accounting for 58.8% and 66.7%. This indication was consistent with Academician Nanshan Zhong 's recent clinical research on acute respiratory syndrome caused by COVID-19, which involved the largest scale of data so far 15 . It suggested that hepatic injury likely occurred in patients under critical care. Moreover, in our study, a positive correlative relationship between the lymphopenia and liver injury. Based on previous studies 16, 17 , lymphopenia is typical laboratory indicator during highly pathogenic coronavirus infections, such as the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infection, and is believed to be associated with disease severity. Recent studies revealed that 63%-70.3%

Therefore, our results suggested that the occurrence of hepatic injury was related to the deterioration of the disease with a dynamic process. In addition, six cases with chronic hepatic diseases were enrolled in our study, however there was no significant difference between the abnormal liver function group and normal liver function group.

This might be related to the fact that most of the inpatients were ordinary type 9, 10 .

Previous studies have shown that inflammatory cytokine storm is associated with severe lung injury and adverse outcomes of SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV infection 17, 19, 20 . Inflammatory cytokine storm is an overactive inflammatory response of the human body caused by virus infection, which leads to a persistent activation and reproduction of lymphocytes and macrophages that will secrete huge amount of inflammatory cytokine 21 . Inflammatory cytokine storm not only leads to pulmonary injury, but also the injury of non-pulmonary organs including the liver, kidneys and cardiac muscle. And some studies have found the liver damage is more common in patients with severe pneumonia, which is suspected to be associated with inflammatory factor storm 8, 9 . In our study, patients with liver damage had higher elevated CRP level. As a typical inflammatory index, CRP is an acute phase protein author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

While T cell counts drop to the lowest levels, serum level of inflammatory cytokines reach their peaks in a few days after the onset of COVID-19. It suggests that inflammatory cytokines are involved in the process at the early stage, which can explain the reason for the patients with mild liver injury.

Compared with the inflammatory damage of lung, the inflammatory damage of liver was relatively mild by autopsy analysis 13 . This result may explain that no one develop to liver failure or severe hepatitis in our study, even in severe cases. 14.1% of patients (12/85) had liver injury during the whole process of hospitalization. All of them are mild and medium elevation of ALT. After liver protection treatment, the liver function of most patients was improved within one or two weeks.

Our study also observed the patients had a decline of serum albumin, though there was no obvious difference between the two groups. It was more likely due to the patients' hyper metabolic state presenting with fever, malnutrition and low caloric intake, suggesting the importance of nutritional support therapy. Moreover, hyperlactatemia reflects hypoxia injury and may be related to liver injury, our results showed that hyperlactatemia was related to liver injury, but it turned to negative after multivariate analysis. The change of result may be related to our sample size, which needs further study and confirmation.

There were some limitations in our study. The data were collected from a single center at a certain timepoint. So, the sample size was relatively limited. And .

large-sample cohort studies are still needed to verify this in the future.

In conclusion, hepatic injury is likely a complication of COVID-19 infection.

Inflammatory cytokine storm may be the major mechanism. Early detection and timely treatment are helpful for the recovery of liver function.

Maternal Infection and Adverse Fetal and Neonatal Outcomes,"The relationship between pregnancy outcome and maternal colonization with a wide variety of bacterial, fungal, protozoan, and viral organisms has been studied for many years [1, 2] . The more classic sexually transmitted diseases, including syphilis, gonorrhea, herpes, trichomonas and Chlamydia, are almost always transmitted between adults as a result of sexual contact. The majority of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections in women of reproductive age are also transmitted sexually; however, there are other maternal infections that are not easily classifiable. Group B streptococcus, hepatitis B virus, cytomegalovirus, and the organisms associated with bacterial vaginosis, such as the mycoplasmas, Gardnerella vaginalis, Bacteroides, and Mobiluncus species, are all found more commonly in sexually active women than non-sexually active women, but their mode of transmission is often not apparent. Other maternal infections that are associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes, including malaria, parvovirus, rubella, and listeria, are not generally transmitted sexually.","retardation; and preterm birth and fetal growth restriction. Before we address specific adverse pregnancy outcomes, however, it should be noted that several sexually transmitted diseases, such as gonorrhea and chlamydia, have been associated with a failure to achieve pregnancy, predominantly through fallopian tube damage. Additionally, fallopian tube damage secondary to chlamydia and gonorrhea infection is the leading cause of ectopic pregnancy, which complicates close to 100,000 pregnancies in the United States each year [3] .

The specific definitions of the most important adverse pregnancy outcomes collected through the vital statistics reports are as follows: in most states, abortion is defined as a pregnancy which terminates or is terminated before 20 weeks' gestational age, whereas a stillbirth is usually defined as a fetus born at 20 weeks' gestational age or more having no heartbeat or respiratory effort. A liveborn infant is generally defined as an infant born at any gestational age having a heartbeat or respiratory effort. Death of a liveborn infant can occur in the neonatal period (in the first 28 days of life) or in the post neonatal period (between 28 days and 1 year of age). An infant death is defined as the death of a liveborn baby that occurs before 1 year of age, both neonatal and post-neonatal deaths. Perinatal mortality is frequently defined as the sum of fetal and neonatal deaths, although other definitions are used. Preterm birth is defined as a birth occurring before 37 weeks of gestation, and a growth-restricted infant is defined as one born at less than the 10th percentile birth weight for a specific gestational age. There are many definitions of long-term morbidity, but those children who have structural anomalies, blindness, deafness, cerebral palsy, or mental retardation are frequently defined as handicapped.

Adverse pregnancy outcomes associated with maternal infections can occur because of direct infections of the fetus or neonate, or because of infections that cause early delivery without directly involving the fetus. For those organisms that attack the fetus directly, the transmission may occur within the uterus via transplacental or ascending infection, or in the intrapartum period secondary to fetal contact with infected genital secretions or maternal blood. Postpartum transmission occurs through breast-feeding or other types of maternal contact.

In general, organisms causing intrauterine infections enter the uterus through the placenta or ascend from the vagina into the uterus through the cervix.

Organisms can be found in the space between the decidua and the membranes, within the membranes, in the amniotic fluid, or within the placenta or fetus. Over time, evidence has accumulated in support of the causal role of intrauterine infection in various adverse pregnancy outcomes. As a result, growing attention has been focused on the optimal criteria for diagnosing intrauterine infection. Obviously, finding organisms in one of the above locations, before possible contamination from the vagina after membrane rupture, conclusively proves colonization (but not necessarily an adverse outcome associated with that colonization); however, many of the early studies, and in fact many studies reported recently, do not use a positive culture or even a positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for bacterial or viral DNA as the standard for diagnosing intrauterine infection. Instead, histologic chorioamnionitis or white cell infiltration into the chorion and amnion is often used as the criterion for diagnosing an intrauterine infection. Furthermore, in recent years there have been many investigations in which various markers of intrauterine infection-including elevations in various cytokines such as interleukin(IL)-6, IL-1b, and IL-8, increases in some of the matrix metalloproteinases, and the presence of white cells in the amniotic fluidhave been used as surrogate markers for an intrauterine infection [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] . Although finding bacteria in the amniotic fluid or in the membranes must be considered the most important indicator of any intrauterine bacterial infection, in women in preterm labor, the correlations between bacteria in the membranes, histologic chorioamnionitis, and elevated cytokines are all reasonably strong [5] .

As stated above, infections within the uterus may be located: (1) in the space between the decidua and the membranes, (2) within the membranes themselves, (3) in the amniotic fluid, or (4) within the placenta or fetus. Studies suggest that infection is most commonly found adjacent to or within the membranes. Importantly, of the women who have infection in the membranes, only half also have bacteria in the amniotic fluid [10] . A far smaller percentage also have a fetal infection. This pattern suggests that most intrauterine infections move from the membranes to the amniotic fluid and then to the fetus.

Recent studies demonstrate that there are a wide array of clinical presentations associated with intrauterine bacterial infections. Some women who have an intrauterine bacterial infection develop clinical signs of a systemic infection, including fever, uterine tenderness, and an elevated white cell response. These women are labeled as having clinical chorioamnionitis; however, it is now clear that many women can have an intrauterine infection without having these clinical symptoms. For example, several studies suggest that only 5% to 10% of the women who have histologic chorioamnionitis or women who have organisms in the membranes have clinical chorioamnionitis [11] . Therefore, many investigators studying this issue now believe that intrauterine infection rarely presents as clinical chorioamnionitis. Instead, uterine contractions or preterm labor, or pre-term rupture of the membranes, appear to be far more common presentations of intrauterine infection. Furthermore, it is likely that many women who have an intrauterine infection will have no signs or symptoms at all.

The incidence of first trimester spontaneous abortion is highly dependent upon how one defines pregnancy. Using the standard obstetric definition, which includes a missed period and a positive urinary pregnancy test between 4 weeks and 6 weeks after the last menstrual period, approximately 15% to 20% of all pregnancies end in spontaneous miscarriage. The etiology of these miscarriages is generally secondary to maldevelopment of the ovum and associated chromosomal abnormalities. It is very rare to spontaneously abort a normally developing fetus during the first trimester. In fact, most of the pathologic material from spontaneous abortions fails to demonstrate any fetal tissue whatsoever. In some reports, maternal infections such as syphilis, rubella, and HIV have been associated with early spontaneous abortion; however, there is little evidence that these infections play an important role in first trimester spontaneous abortion [12] .

Second trimester abortions (ie, those that occur between the 13th and 20th week of pregnancy) differ substantially from first trimester abortions in that a fetus is nearly always present. Spontaneous second trimester abortions occur in approximately 1% to 2% of all pregnancies. Although the etiology of these losses is often less clear than that of those occurring at other times, second trimester losses certainly include anomalous fetuses, some having chromosomal abnormalities, and those losses which occur secondary to uterine malformations, incompetent cervix and leiomyomata [12] . Most of the spontaneous second trimester losses, however, occur in the face of a normal uterus and a normally developed fetus. In these cases, there is either ''spontaneous'' labor or rupture of membranes leading to delivery, or a fetal death that ultimately leads to delivery. Obstetric complications such as twin pregnancy, placental abruption, the presence of maternal anticardiolipin antibodies, or the lupus anticoagulant and fetal growth retardation are also associated with spontaneous pregnancy losses between 12 to 20 weeks' gestation; however, the relative importance of these etiologies is not well quantified. Because the etiology of so many of the second trimester losses is not clear, and a majority of them are associated with spontaneous labor and ruptured membranes, there is ample room to hypothesize that intrauterine infection, which has been implicated in both of these pregnancy complications, may also be an important etiologic component of spontaneous second trimester losses. Indeed, chorioamnionitis has frequently been described, and there are numerous case reports of amniotic fluid infection that have occurred during this gestational age period. Additionally, isolation of microorganisms from pregnancy products has been reported to be more common in women who have spontaneous midtrimester pregnancy loss when compared with women who have induced abortions [13, 14] . Furthermore, several treatment trials have shown a reduction in second trimester abortions with antibiotics.

A stillbirth is one of the most common adverse outcomes of pregnancy. In the United States, a stillbirth occurs in nearly 1% (or 7 per 1000) of all births, and in the year 2000, there were nearly 27,000 of these events [15, 16] . The fetal death rates are approximately twice as high in African American women compared with white women. Stillbirth occurs far more frequently in developing countries than in developed countries, with rates as high as 100/1000 reported in some areas. Worldwide, nearly 4 million stillbirths occur in developing countries yearly [17] . In many countries, and especially the most developed ones, over the last several decades there has been a significant reduction in stillbirths. For example, from 1970 to 1998 the stillbirth rate in the United States fell from 14.0 to 6.7 per 1000 births [16] . Much of this decrease has occurred in term or near-term stillbirths, and is mostly due to improvements in medical care [18, 19] . With these changes, stillbirths now account for about half of all perinatal mortality and more than a third of all mortality from 20 weeks' gestation to 1 year of age.

Because of the reduction in term stillbirths in the United States over the last several decades, most stillbirths now occur in the preterm gestational ages. In a US multicenter study [18] , approximately half of the stillbirths occurred before 28 weeks gestational age, and another third of the stillbirths occurred between 28 weeks and 37 weeks. In this study, and in a number of others, the etiology of many of the stillbirths was not clear; however, many of the early gestational age fetuses died in conjunction with spontaneous preterm labor or rupture of the membranes. Placental histologic changes consistent with chorioamnionitis are found frequently in association with these early stillbirths, and these mothers are also more likely to develop postpartum endometritis. Therefore, there is substantial reason to believe that intrauterine infection may contribute to the etiology of many stillbirths, either as an initiator of preterm labor, as an initiator of ruptured membranes, or as an initiator of fetal death that ultimately results in the birth of a stillborn infant.

In developed countries, 10% to 25% of all stillbirths appear to be caused by a maternal/fetal infection, whereas in developing countries, which often have far higher stillbirth rates, the relative contribution of infection may be even greater [19] [20] [21] . The authors have recently reviewed the relationship between various types of maternal infections and stillbirth [22] . In that review, we found that this relationship was strongly influenced by gestational age. The earlier the stillbirth, the more likely it will be related to an infection. For example, in one study [23] , 19% of fetal deaths at less than 28 weeks were associated with an infection, whereas only 2% of term stillbirths were infection-related.

For a number of reasons, the relationship between maternal infection and stillbirth is often not very clear [21] . First, it is often difficult to know exactly why a specific fetus died. For example, an autopsy of the fetus and histologic study of the placenta may have findings suggestive of both infectious and hypoxic etiologies. Second, simply finding histologic evidence of infection or specific types of organisms in the placenta or on the fetus does not prove causation, nor does finding serologic evidence of infection prove causation. Neither does the presence of organisms in internal fetal tissues, although this finding clearly increases suspicion of an infectious etiology. Third, infection may cause a stillbirth that initially may not appear to be related to infection at all. The stillbirths associated with rubella-induced congenital anomalies, or with the nonimmune hydrops caused by parvovirus, were not originally seen as infectionrelated. Finally, organisms that now are quite clearly associated with stillbirth, such as parvovirus and Ureaplasma urealyticum, are hard to identify, and are often not sought in studies of infectious etiologies of stillbirths [10] .

Conceptually, infection may result in fetal death through many different pathways [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] . First, a maternal infection may lead to a systemic illness whereby the mother is severely ill. Perhaps because of the high maternal fever, maternal respiratory distress, or other systemic reactions to the illness, the fetus may die, although the organisms are never transmitted to the placenta or fetus. The increased fetal mortality associated with influenza epidemics or maternal polio is likely due to this phenomenon [24, 25] . Second, the placenta may be directly infected without spread of the organisms to the fetus. In these situations, reduced blood flow to the fetus may result in stillbirth. The stillbirths associated with maternal malaria infection are likely due to placental damage [26] . Third, the fetus may be directly infected through the placenta or membranes, with the infectious organisms damaging a vital fetal organ such as the lungs, liver, heart, or brain. Examples of this type of infection include the fetal pneumonia associated with Eschericia coli or group B streptococcal chorioamnionitis, or systemic infections with viruses such as coxsackie A or B [27] [28] [29] .

If an infection occurs very early in gestation, the fetus may not die, but may develop a congenital anomaly, with a fetal death occurring later secondary to the anomaly. Rubella infection has been associated with stillbirths via this mechanism [30, 31] . And lastly, an infection in the uterus or anywhere else in the mother's body may precipitate preterm labor. Some of these fetuses, often deemed to be too small to be salvageable by cesarean section, cannot tolerate labor and are born dead. U urealyticum is an organism that may precipitate early preterm labor by infecting the fetal membranes without causing a fetal infection. A urinary tract infection with E coli is an example of a non-genital tract infection that might precipitate early preterm labor. Periodontal infections are also associated with preterm labor, but the mechanism by which periodontal disease is associated with preterm birth has not yet been elucidated [32] .

Ascending bacterial infection, both before and after membrane rupture, with organisms such as E coli, group B streptococci, and U urealyticum is usually the most common infectious cause of stillbirth; however, in areas where syphilis is very prevalent, up to half of all stillbirths may be caused by this infection alone. Malaria may be an important cause of stillbirth in women infected for the first time in pregnancy. The two most important viral causes of stillbirth are parvovirus and coxsackie virus, although a number of other viral infections appear to be causal. Toxoplasma gondii, leptospirosis, Listeria monocytogenes, and the organisms that cause leptospirosis, Q fever, and Lyme disease have all been implicated as etiologic for stillbirth. Table 1 , from our review, updated to reflect a few new reports, describes each of the organisms that to date have been studied in relationship to stillbirth [22] .

Neonatal deaths are defined as those that occur within the first 28 days of life. In most Western countries, these deaths occur at a rate of between 3 and 7 per 1000 live births. In general, about 70% of these deaths are associated with a preterm birth, and 25% are associated with a major congenital anomaly, with the remainder due to asphyxia, sepsis, meconium aspiration, birth trauma, and more rare conditions such as immune or nonimmune hydrops. Infection as a specific cause of neonatal death occurs predominantly in preterm infants, and is often part of the picture that includes RDS, IVH, and NEC. Because of the multiple system failures, it is often difficult to define a single cause of death in these cases, but infection frequently plays a role.

In developed countries, group B-streptococcus is one of the most common organisms implicated in systemic neonatal infection, but many other organisms, mostly gram-negative, including those that normally colonize the vagina (E coli, Klebsiella) and those that are acquired in the nursery (often staphylococcus), have also been implicated in sepsis related neonatal deaths [33, 34] . In many developing countries, neonatal group B streptococcal infections are rare and the contribution of gram-negative organisms to neonatal sepsis is proportionately greater. Many of these neonatal infections appear to be contracted in utero before delivery. For the most part, these organisms enter the fetus by way of the amniotic fluid, infecting the lungs, causing a fetal or neonatal pneumonia. Both group B streptococous and the gram-negative organisms cause meningitis as well. Finally, infections such as syphilis and some virus infections such as cytomegalovirus (CMV), varicella, echovirus, coxsackievirus, measles, and herpes simplex are clearly causal for neonatal death, as are other transplacentally transmitted infections such as listerosis and even occasionally tuberculosis. In any case, based on these reports, the authors estimate that in the United States and other developed countries, less than 10% of neonatal mortality is due to neonatal sepsis, pneumonia, and meningitis, with a much smaller portion of the mortality attributable to other infections. In lesser developed countries, the neonatal mortality rates are considerably higher and the contribution of infection considerably greater. For example, in Pakistan it is estimated that half of the neonatal mortality, or as many as 30 per 1000 live births, is infection related [35] . Overall, the World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that of the nearly 5,000,000 neonatal deaths that occur each year worldwide, up to 40%, or 2,000,000 deaths per year, are due to infection [36] . Of these, 800,000 deaths, mostly in developing countries, occur due to acute respiratory infections.

In developed countries, post-neonatal deaths occur in approximately three infants per 1000 live births. Sudden infant death syndrome is the most common etiology, and congenital anomalies, accidents, and infection account for most of the other deaths. The most common infectious-related causes of post-neonatal mortality include meningitis, pneumonia, and diarrhea. Although deaths from these causes are rare in middle class women in western countries, they are more frequently seen in rural areas and among the poor. In underdeveloped countries, infection may cause up to several hundred infant deaths per thousand live births. Nearly all the infectious causes of neonatal mortality cause postneonatal deaths as well. 

In addition to mortality, there has been a wide range of permanent structural and neurological morbidity associated with maternally transmitted infectious diseases. These include: (1) structural congenital anomalies with a defect in one or more organs; (2) structural or functional damage to the brain resulting in decreased cognitive ability, mental retardation, or both; and (3) a motor disorder such as a diminution of fine or gross motor skills, or an increase in spasticity or athetosis such as that associated with cerebral palsy. These morbidities, in addition to blindness, deafness, and hydrocephalus, have all been associated with infectious diseases [1] .

Cerebral palsy is found in about 2 infants per 1000, but is far more common in preterm infants. For example, among the lowest gestational age infants who survive (23 and 24 weeks), between 25% and 50% end up having cerebral palsy. Perhaps the most commonly used definition of cerebral palsy is that of Nelson and Ellenberg [37] , who defined cerebral palsy as ''a chronic disability characterized by aberrant control of movement or posture appearing early in life and not the result of recognized progressive disease.'' Cerebral palsy is associated with damage to the upper motor neurons within the brain, and most cases present as excessive muscular tonus, spasticity with increased stretch reflexes, and hyperactive tendon reflexes. The authors also emphasize that cerebral palsy is a neuromuscular condition only, and does not imply alterations in cognitive function. Although children who have cerebral palsy are statistically more likely to have low intelligence quotients (IQs), mental retardation, or various types of seizure disorders, many children who have cerebral palsy have normal intelligence and are free of other types of neurologic disability [38] .

Many bacterial and viral infections of the fetus, infant, and young child have been associated with cerebral palsy, although quantification is difficult [39] . For example, Stanley [40] notes that a fairly large number of cases of cerebral palsy associated with congenital rubella syndrome were described before the initiation of the rubella vaccination program, but this relationship rarely occurs in the United States today. Congenital infection with Toxoplasma gondii and CMV can also cause cerebral palsy. Older literature suggests that infection of the infant with measles, mumps, varicella, and rubella was once reported as a common cause of central nervous system (CNS) injury leading to cerebral palsy. Since the development of vaccines for many of the common childhood diseases, however, it appears that a viral etiology for postpartum acquired cerebral palsy is rare. Nelson [41] agrees, stating that although numeric documentation is lacking, judging from medical writing in the 19th century when infectious diseases were more frequent and less effectively treated, infection-related cerebral palsy was more common than it is now in developed countries. Because of these reductions, it appears that CMV has become the most common viral infection associated with a cerebral palsy-like syndrome [39] . In addition to the infections described, herpes virus infection as well as meningococcal, pneumococcal, and group B streptococcal infections of the neonate also may manifest later in life as a cerebral palsy-like syndrome.

More important numerically, many studies now link chorioamnionitis to the development of cerebral palsy [42] [43] [44] . Nelson and Ellenberg [37] , using data from the Collaborative Perinatal Project, showed that in low-birth weight infants, chorioamnionitis was associated with a tripling of the risk of cerebral palsy from 12 per 1000 to 39 per 1000 live births. Among term infants in that study, chorioamnionitis increased the risk of cerebral palsy from 3 per 1000 to 8 per 1000 live births. In a more recent study, Grether and colleagues [45] examined prenatal and perinatal factors related to cerebral palsy in very low-birth weight (VLBW) California infants. In this study, chorioamnionitis was associated with a fourfold increased risk of cerebral palsy. Even more recently, term infants who have evidence of chorioamnionitis had a significantly greater risk of cerebral palsy [46] . Murphy and coworkers [47] , investigating the relationship of various antenatal and intrapartum risk factors to cerebral palsy in infants born at less than 32 weeks' gestational age, showed that in such infants, chorioamnionitis increased the risk of cerebral palsy from 3% in controls to 17% in infected infants.

In a number of other studies, intrauterine infection has preceded neonatal IVH, a precursor of cerebral palsy. For example, Groome and colleagues [48] , using data from the March of Dimes multicenter study, showed that clinical chorioamnionitis was associated with a twofold to threefold increased risk of IVH. Damman and Leviton [49, 50] have also explored the relationship between maternal intrauterine infection and evidence of brain damage in the preterm newborn. They revealed an association between intrauterine infection in the mother and both IVH and white matter damage in the newborn. In a study of more than 1000 preterm infants, intrauterine infection was associated with a doubling of the infant's risk for having IVH, periventricular leukomalacia (PVL), and ventriculomegaly. Additional data from the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Neonatal Research Network [51, 52] confirm that both early-onset and late-onset sepsis in VLBW newborns is associated with an increased incidence of IVH.

Bejar and coworkers [53] found that chorioamnionitis was present in more than half of the preterm infants who developed white matter echolucencies within 3 days after birth. Leviton [54] notes that the histologic abnormalities of white matter have been associated with sepsis in the baby and with gynecologic and urinary tract infection in the mother. Mays and colleagues [55] report that acute maternal appendicitis is associated with IVH and PVL, even when the gestational age at birth is controlled for. Therefore, even extrauterine intra-abdominal infections appear to be able to initiate the cascade of events linking infection, labor, and neonatal brain injury [56] . Hansen and coworkers [57] studied the correlation between placental pathology and IVH in preterm infants. Placental characteristics of inflammation, including umbilical vasculitis, chorionic vasculitis, and inflammation of the subchorion, chorion, and amnion, were associated with an increased risk of IVH. Grafe [58] , Salafia and colleagues [59] , and others confirmed the relationship between both periventricular hemorrhage and leukomalacia and cerebral palsy and placental membrane and umbilical cord evidence of inflammation and associated thrombosis [60, 61] .

In a further attempt to understand this phenomenon, Kuban and Leviton [62] studied echolucent images in periventricular white matter in relationship to maternal uterine infection. The odds ratio for development of an echolucency was highest for infants whose placentas had vasculitis of the chorionic plate or umbilical cord (odds ratio = 9.8). Zupan and coworkers [63] , in a study of risk factors for PVL, found a strong link between intrauterine infection and the development of PVL, and that this relationship was increased in the face of premature rupture of membranes and infection. They also suggest that most of the PVL originates before birth, that susceptibility to the condition closely depends on the developmental age, and that the major etiologic components of white matter lesions in infants born late in the second trimester relate to the presence of an intrauterine infection. Perlman and colleagues [64] noted that cystic PVL, which occurred in 3% of infants weighing less than 1500 g, was associated with two clinical indicators: prolonged rupture of membranes and chorioamnionitis. The odds ratio for cerebral palsy after prolonged rupture of membranes was 6.6, and the odds ratio for cerebral palsy with chorioamnionitis was 6.8.

In recent years, much evidence has emerged suggesting that various cytokines mediate the relationship between cerebral palsy and intrauterine infection, IVH, and PVL. Certainly various cytokines, such as IL-6, IL-1, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha, and others, are elevated in the amniotic fluid of pregnant women who have chorioamnionitis. Andrews and coworkers [13] have emphasized that amniotic fluid cytokines are elevated even with infection confined to the amniotic membranes. Adinolfi [65] was among the first to propose that cytokines produced in relationship to maternal infection were harmful to the developing brain of the unborn infants. Figueroa and colleagues [66] showed that elevated amniotic fluid IL-6 predicted neonatal PVL and IVH. Yoon and coworkers [67] , Kashlan and colleagues [68] , and others showed that elevated IL-6 levels in the umbilical cord were also related to the subsequent development of periventricular echodensities and echolucencies. Recent papers document the association between elevated umbilical cord blood cytokine levels and cerebral palsy [69, 70] . From these data, there seems little question that intrauterine infection, a clear predictor of preterm delivery [14] , is also a predictor of white matter lesions, IVH, and ultimately cerebral palsy. If, as has been proposed [71] , 70% to 80% of VLBW births are associated with an intrauterine infection, the high rate of cerebral palsy in these infants may well be related to this intrauterine infection.

Mental retardation, usually defined by an IQ cutoff less than 70 or 75, is another outcome measure of great importance, but one whose prevalence in the population is difficult to determine with certainty. Prevalence is undoubtedly influenced by definition, timing of testing, and many other factors as well, but in most populations about 3% of all infants and children receive this diagnosis. Babies born prematurely and babies born following intrauterine growth retardation are all at greater risk for the development of mental retardation regardless of the definition [72, 73] ; however, most babies who have these diagnoses will eventually have IQs within the normal range. For example, on average, infants who survive weighing less than 1000 g at birth, have an average IQ about 10 points below appropriate controls. As with cerebral palsy, intrauterine infection is thought to play a role in this reduction in IQ. What is clear, however, is that the socioeconomic status and educational background of the parents greatly influence the ultimate rate of mental retardation in the population. Although perinatal infections that attack the fetus, such as group B streptococcus, herpes simplex virus, CMV, syphilis, and toxoplasmosis all are demonstrated causes of mental retardation, infection-initiated preterm birth, which will be described in detail, appears to be a more important cause of mental retardation from the overall public health perspective [74, 75] .

A variety of psychiatric and developmental disorders, and especially schizophrenia, have been associated with various maternal infections. Prenatal influenza has been the most studied [76] [77] [78] . Interestingly, several recent studies have shown that increased levels of amniotic fluid cytokines during the second trimester of pregnancy may contribute to a greater risk in offspring developing schizophrenia [79] . Those relationships that are positive are at best associations, with no proven causality. Relationships between pre-and perinatal infections with childhood autism have also been studied, and as with schizophrenia, the data supporting the relationship are mixed. Further research is necessary to confirm or refute each of these relationships.

Structural anomalies of the fetus occur in about 3% of all births. Among the most serious, and those that contribute to the most long-term morbidity and mortality, are neural tube defects, urinary tract anomalies, and cardiac defects. Overall, about 20% of stillbirths and neonatal deaths are caused by an anomaly, as is a portion of mental retardation. Although maternal virus infections clearly can cause structural anomalies, only a very small percentage of all anomalies are likely to be viral related. For example, rubella infections, especially those occurring in the first trimester, as well as varicella infections, are associated with a wide variety of anomalies. Because of routine vaccinations to prevent rubella and other viral infections, however, these anomalies are rarely seen today in de-veloped countries. Coxsackieviruses B3 and B4 have been associated with congenital heart disease [80] . Maternal parvovirus infection, especially in the second trimester, has been associated with a fetal nonimmune hydrops, sometimes leading to fetal death. Whether it is appropriate to consider these cases as congenital anomalies is not clear. In addition, there are isolated case reports of CNS anomalies associated with parvovirus infection, but this relationship has not been confirmed epidemiologically.

Fetal growth retardation is generally defined as a birthweight less than the 10th percentile birthweight for gestational age; however, the standards used to define the 10th percentile birthweight for gestational age are highly variable and often do not apply to the population being evaluated [81] . Also, because the gestational age measures used for defining the standard are so variable, it is difficult to compare rates of growth retardation from one time period to another, or from one study to another. Growth retardation has many etiologies, including low maternal height, low maternal weight, smoking, preeclampsia, congenital anomalies, and intrauterine infection. With changes in obstetric recommendations about maternal weight gain over the last several decades, it appears that the rate of growth retardation is decreasing.

Nearly all infections of the mother and fetus have been associated with growth retardation, but it is unknown whether maternally transmitted infections other than those that infect the fetus or placenta early and directly, such as rubella, toxoplasmosis, CMV, syphilis, and malaria, actually cause growth retardation. Assuming they do, the mechanism may lie in fetal cell death caused by direct infection or by changes in placental or fetal blood flow. Maternal malaria, for example, which often attacks the placenta and seems to inhibit gas and nutrient exchange, is associated with a two-or threefold increase in fetal growth restriction [26] . The impact of syphilis is similar, and in general, in developing countries, a wide variety of maternal infections are very likely responsible for a large proportion of the growth retarded infants. Because growth retardation in developed countries often appears to be associated with below average maternal size, poor nutritional status, various adverse health behaviors and hypertension, however, it is unclear what portion of the growth retardation in developed countries can be explained by an infectious etiology.

Preterm birth is the most significant problem confronting obstetricians in industrial countries today. Preterm births, defined as those occurring at less than 37 weeks' gestational age, are associated with approximately 75% of the perinatal mortality and as much as 50% of the long-term neurologic handicap [82] . In the last 20 years, the preterm rate in the United States has risen from approximately 9.5% to 12% [83] . Although we have made tremendous strides in keeping preterm infants alive, we have been less successful in reducing the long-term handicap rates among the survivors [84, 85] . Much of the mortality and the longterm handicap associated with prematurity occurs in the smallest or earliest gestational age newborns. For example, it is estimated that 60% of the neonatal mortality and much of the long-term handicap accrue to infants born weighing less than 1000 g and less than 28 weeks' gestational age. Many of these early preterm births occur secondary to an intrauterine infection [86] . This section explores the relationship between infection and preterm birth.

The relationship between genital tract infection and preterm birth has been appreciated by some physicians for more than half a century. For example, in 1950 Knox and Hoerner [87] noted that ''infection in the female reproductive tract can cause premature rupture of the membranes and induce premature labor.'' In their series, they noted that the membranes in all premature cases showed evidence of infection. Perhaps the most influential paper on infection and preterm birth was written in 1977 by Bobitt and Ledger [88] . In this study, they performed amniocenteses in 10 women in preterm labor with intact membranes. Seven of the women had bacterial colony counts higher than 1000 per mL, with anaerobic organisms predominating. These authors posited that bacteria can penetrate the fetal membranes and contaminate the amniotic fluid, and suggested that in patients in premature labor, the role of unrecognized amnionitis should be reevaluated. Elder and colleagues [89] approached the issue of infection and preterm birth somewhat differently. Believing that bacterial infection was causal for preterm birth, in 1971 they treated 279 ''non-bacteriuric women'' with a 6-week course of 1 g of tetracycline daily beginning at less than 32 weeks' gestational age, and compared the outcomes to women treated with a placebo. In the tetracycline-treated group there were statistically fewer preterm births.

Because of the more frequent use of amniocentesis, we now have ample data relating amniotic fluid infection to preterm labor. Beginning with Bobitt and Ledger's study [88] and extending to the present, there have now been a large number of studies in which women presenting with preterm labor and intact membranes have had an amniocentesis performed and the amniotic fluid cultured [90] [91] [92] [93] [94] . The percent of positive cultures in these studies has varied widely, ranging from no positive cultures in several small studies to as high as 50% in others. In a review of the studies performed before 1992, 100 of 863 or 12% of amniotic fluid cultures were positive. Knowing what we know now, the reason for the relatively low culture rates are quite apparent. First, many of these studies did not focus on early preterm infants, and we know that the percent of positive cultures are gestational age-related, with the proportion of positive cultures increasing with decreasing gestational age [86] . Second, few of these studies cultured for Ureaplasma or Mycoplasma or other hard-to-grow anaerobes. We now know that the most common organisms found in the uterus are Ureaplasma and Mycoplasma. We also know that in the presence of an intrauterine infection, the amniotic fluid will be positive on only half the occasions when organisms are present in the membranes [10] . For each of these reasons and possibly others, the rates of positive amnionic fluid cultures in women in preterm labor are lower than the actual rate of intrauterine infection.

A concept developed more than 20 years ago, but more widely held today, is that the relationship of intrauterine infection and preterm labor is not consistent across all preterm gestational ages. In 1979, Russell [95] , using histologic chorioamnionitis as a marker of infection, showed that virtually all births at 21 to 24 weeks were associated with an intrauterine infection, compared with only about 10% of the preterm births at 33 to 36 weeks. Mueller-Heubach and colleagues [96] and Chellam and Rushton [97] reported similar findings, which were also confirmed by Andrews and coworkers [5] in Alabama. Therefore, there is no question that the earliest preterm births are strongly associated with histologic chorioamnionitis.

Rather than evaluating histologic chorioamnionitis as the marker of intrauterine infection, in 1992, Watts and coworkers [98] studied amniotic fluid cultures in women in labor who had intact membranes. They showed that at 23 and 24 weeks' gestation, more than 60% of the women in preterm labor had organisms in the amniotic fluid. That number fell to less than 20% for women in labor at 33 to 34 weeks. To further investigate this issue, Hauth and colleagues in Alabama [99] cultured the chorioamnions of over 600 women having a cesarean section who had intact membranes. In this study, after delivery the placental membranes were opened and cultures were taken from the space between the chorion and amnion. This study design precluded vaginal or ascending infection following membrane rupture contamination of the membranes, because membranes were not delivered through the vagina and the membranes were intact at the time of delivery. The study authors found that in women in spontaneous labor delivering a less than 1000-g infant, 83% had chorioamnion cultures that were positive, whereas those delivering a more than 2500-g infant had a 20% positive culture rate [99] . For those women not in labor, undergoing an indicated cesarean section, and delivering a less than 1000-g infant, only about 10% of the cultures were positive. The researchers therefore believe that based on histology and culture results, 80% or more of women in early preterm labor, destined to deliver a less than 1000-g infant, will have organisms in the membranes before membrane rupture. They believe this association is likely to be causal for preterm birth.

There is also ample evidence suggesting that intrauterine infections are often chronic. As evidence, intrauterine infections have been documented weeks or even months before a preterm birth [100] [101] [102] . For example, in Alabama, at the time of routine genetic amniocentesis at 16 to 18 weeks, it was occasionally noted that the amniotic fluid was cloudy [100] [101] [102] . For this reason, fluids were sent for routine bacterial culture, and cultures for Ureaplasma and Mycoplasma were often performed. Occasionally the cultures were positive. In nearly all cases in which the amniotic fluid was found to be infected with Ureaplasma, the women were initially asymptomatic; however, many of these women went on to deliver spontaneously at 24 to 28 weeks' gestation without clinical chorioamnionitis. The placentas, however, were nearly always positive for histologic chorioamnionitis. Similarly, using PCR techniques for the diagnosis of Ureaplasma infection in amniotic fluid, it has been demonstrated that women who are PCR-positive are substantially more likely to experience spontaneous preterm labor later in the second trimester [103] . More recently, using IL-6 as a marker of infection, it has been observed in several series that women undergoing routine genetic amniocentesis at 16 to 18 weeks and who are found to have high amniotic fluid IL-6 levels frequently deliver at less than 32 weeks [104] [105] [106] .

Between 50 and 100 different organisms have been associated with intrauterine infections before the rupture of membranes [93, 94] . What is interesting about these infections is that certain common vaginal organisms, such as group B streptococcus and E coli, are rarely found in the uterus before rupture of membranes. Furthermore, gonorrhea or Chlamydia are hardly ever found inside the uterus before membrane rupture. On the other hand, a number of other organisms, such as Ureaplasma, Mycoplasma, Gardenerella, Mobiluncus, Peptostreptococcus, and Bacteroides, are quite commonly found in the uterus before membrane rupture. Why some organisms invade the uterus before membrane rupture and others do not is not clear. Galask and colleagues [107] showed that neither Chlamydia nor gonorrhea bind to the fetal membranes, and offered the failure to attach as an explanation for their lack of entrance into the uterus before membrane rupture. What is clear about the organisms generally found in the uterus before delivery is that they generally are of low virulence. It may be that this low virulence accounts for both the chronicity described above and the fact that most of the intrauterine infections do not cause a clinical chorioamnionitis.

The mechanisms by which an intrauterine bacterial infection precipitates preterm labor are relatively clear. Placing either living organisms or bacterial endotoxin into an animal's uterus under experimental conditions precipitates preterm labor in a fashion similar to that which occurs in humans with naturally acquired organisms [108] . In both cases, the intrauterine infection elicits an immune response that includes an increasing production of a wide variety of cytokines, prostaglandins, and metalloproteinases [4, 5, 86] . These analytes are capable of causing contractions, cervical softening, and membrane rupture, which together ultimately result in spontaneous preterm birth.

Conceptually, there are at least several pathways by which bacteria can enter the uterus. For example, if the mother has a bacteremia or viremia, organisms can enter the uterus hematogenously through the placenta. Although it is believed that hematogenous spread through the placenta is rare, it almost certainly does occur. As evidence, fetuses have been infected by a wide variety of organisms during maternal septicemia, including those causing Listeria and tularemia. These organisms appear to reach the fetus through the maternal circulation [22] . Dental organisms such as Capnocytophaga and various fusiform organisms are also most likely to enter the uterus through the placenta [109, 110] . Theoretically, bacteria can enter the uterus through the fallopian tubes; however, the abdominal cavity is usually sterile. Organisms have been introduced inadvertently into the amniotic cavity at the time of amniocentesis, but this route of infection seems quite rare. Finally, and most commonly, it appears that bacteria from the vagina can ascend into the uterus through the cervix. The organisms most commonly found in the uterus are those typically found in the vagina, of which Ureaplasma is the most common. It is therefore widely believed that the organisms responsible for most early preterm birth are vaginal organisms that ascend directly from the vagina through the cervix into the uterus.

It is widely held that organisms from the vagina ascend into the uterus during the pregnancy, traversing the space between the membranes and the decidua. The bacteria then take up residence in the membranes, and in about 50% of the cases enter the amniotic fluid. In a much smaller percentage of the cases, the fetus is infected as well. An alternate hypothesis is that the organisms that ultimately cause histologic chorioamnionitis actually reside in the uterus before the pregnancy. Korn and colleagues [111] observed in 1995 that nonpregnant women who had bacterial vaginosis were nearly ten times more likely to have bacterial vaginosis-associated organisms residing in the uterus than were women who did not have bacterial vaginosis. These women were far more likely to have an associated chronic plasma cell endometritis. Andrews and coworkers [112] also observed a large number of bacterial vaginosis related organisms in the uterus in healthy nonpregnant women. These data suggest that there are women who have their endometrium colonized with bacteria before pregnancy. These women are, for the most part, asymptomatic, and would probably remain so until pregnant, because these colonizations do not seem to cause much in the way of symptoms, do not hinder conception to any large degree, and have little impact on the pregnancy until the second trimester. It has been hypothesized by the authors' group [71, 86] that once the membranes become tightly applied to the decidua, essentially forming an abscess, only then do these colonizations become symptomatic. With the adherence of the membranes to the decidua at about 20 weeks' gestation, the inflammatory process accelerates, ultimately leading to a preterm birth, which usually occurs before 28 or 30 weeks' gestational age.

Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a vaginal syndrome associated with an alteration of the normal vaginal flora, rather than an infection specific to any one microorganism. BV is diagnosed clinically by the Amsel criteria, which include: (1) the presence of clue cells, (2) a pH higher than 4.5, (3) a profuse whitish discharge, and (4) a fishy odor when that discharge is treated with potassium hydroxide (KOH) [113] . For research purposes, bacterial vaginosis is often defined by the Nugent criteria, whereby air-dried vaginal smears are Gram-stained, and are scored based on the number of lactobacillus (which tend to be low), and the presence of organisms that look like Mobiluncus and Bacteroides, which tend to be high [114] . A score of 7 to 10 has traditionally been used to diagnose BV; however, a recent study [115] suggests that only the very highest scores (ie, 9 and 10) may be associated with preterm birth. Nevertheless, BV diagnosed by a score of 7 to 10 has been associated with a one and a half-to threefold increased risk of preterm birth in more than 20 studies [116] [117] [118] . Therefore, there is more evidence for this association than for most epidemiologic associations reported in the literature. Interestingly, black women are considerably more likely to have BV than white women [119] . Though not explained by different rates of sexual intercourse or feminine hygiene practices, this two-to threefold difference may explain part of the racial differences in spontaneous preterm birth [120] . In fact, nearly 50% of the excess preterm births and preterm-associated mortality in black versus white infants may be explained by the increase in vaginal and intrauterine infections. Importantly, from a mechanistic point of view, women who have large quantities of these bacteria in the vagina appear more likely to have the same bacteria in the uterus associated with histologic chorioamnionitis. Gravett and colleagues [91] , Silver and coworkers [121] , Watts and colleagues [98] , Hillier and colleagues [122] , Krohn and coworkers [123] , and others have all shown that there is an association linking BV and subsequent amnionitis, often with similar organisms. The mechanism by which BV is associated with amnionitis and preterm birth is uncertain, but it likely is the result of ascension of the vaginal organisms into the uterus either before, or early in, the pregnancy.

One of the difficult questions to answer related to genital tract infections with gonorrhea, chlamydia, trichomonas, group B streptococcus, and other organisms is whether they are causally associated with preterm birth. With virtually each of these organisms, a range of associations has been reported, varying from none to a strong relationship with preterm birth. In total, it appears that spontaneous preterm birth (defined as a birth following labor or rupture of the membranes) occurs more frequently in women who have and infection than in those who do not; however, even though gonorrhea, chlamydial infection, and other sexually transmitted diseases are usually found more frequently in women who have a spontaneous preterm birth, these women often have other risk factors as well. Furthermore, most studies claiming an association between various infections and preterm birth have not considered many of these confounding variables. As an example, gonorrhea has been associated with spontaneous preterm birth in a number of studies [124] . Almost none of these adjusted for most risk factors and especially for the presence of BV [125] . Therefore, although it is likely that maternal gonorrhea infection is associated with an independent two-or threefold risk for spontaneous preterm birth, this conclusion is not certain. As opposed to the organisms associated with BV, the gonococcus is rarely found in the amniotic fluid or the fetal membranes in women who give birth prematurely. Syphilis is widely reported to be associated with a twofold increased risk of preterm birth, and this relationship is relatively consistent in most studies [126] .

Chlamydial infection has been associated with prematurity in some studies but not in others, with the majority of the studies showing no increased risk [118, 127] . Sweet and coworkers [128] , however, reported that women who had Chlamydia trachomatis infection and IgM antibodies were more likely to have a spontaneous preterm birth compared with women who have chlamydia infection and IgG, but not IgM, antibodies. In the Preterm Prediction Study [129] , women tested for Chlamydia trachomatis at 24 weeks' gestation had about twice as many preterm births associated with the presence of this organism as did uninfected women; however, after adjusting for other risk factors, this association was no longer significant, contributing to the continuing uncertainty about whether chlamydia infection plays a causative role in preterm birth. Many of the other sexually transmitted diseases, such as HIV, hepatitis B, and genital herpes simplex virus, have been associated with an increased risk for spontaneous preterm birth in some, but not most, studies. In general, the evidence for a causative link between maternal infection with these organisms and spontaneous preterm birth is poor [75] .

Several non-genital tract infections seem to be related to, and are probably causal for, preterm birth. The first of these is urinary tract infection. In a metaanalysis of the existing literature by Romero and colleagues [164] , urinary tract infection was clearly associated with preterm birth, and antibiotic treatment of urinary tract infection did result in a reduction of preterm birth. Maternal pneumonias and other systemic infections such as appendicitis also appear to increase the risk of preterm birth. Recently, research efforts have focused on exploring the relationship between maternal periodontal disease and subsequent preterm birth [110, 130] . This association has now been confirmed at several study sites. Importantly, recent evidence suggests that treatment of the periodontal disease with deep cleaning, as opposed to the use of antibiotics, may reduce the associated preterm birth [131] .

In comparison with bacterial infections, the evidence that viral infections are causal for preterm birth is quite sparse; however, in cases of viral infection when the mother has a severe systemic illness, such as varicella pneumonia or polio, a preterm delivery may occur [22, 23] . Recent reports suggest that a maternal infection with the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus can result in preterm birth as well [132] . In the absence of major systemic disease, the evidence for a relationship between maternal viral infection and preterm delivery is based mostly on case reports. For example, a number of fetuses that had an intrauterine CMV infection have been noted to deliver preterm, although the denominator for such observations is unknown. In the several studies in which asymptomatic women undergoing genetic amniocentesis were evaluated for intraamniotic viral infection using PCR techniques, a number of different viral DNAs were identified in the amniotic fluid, but their presence was not related to subsequent preterm birth [133] . Therefore, it seems unlikely that maternal viral infection plays an important role in preterm birth. Because of the limited information available, however, further study of this potential relationship is in order.

Based on the authors' review of the literature, Table 2 [76, [134] [135] [136] presents a summary of the types of adverse perinatal outcomes that have been associated with specific maternal infections.

Many of the infants infected with a specific organism during fetal life or during delivery and who manifest disease, do so in the neonatal period. These include most of the infants infected with herpes simplex virus, syphilis, and gonorrhea; however, for many others, the disease will not become apparent for months or years later. For example, although the ophthalmologic damage caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae and C trachomatis becomes apparent within several days or weeks after birth, the pneumonia associated with chlamydia infection may occur months after delivery [137, 138] . The deafness associated with neonatal cytomegalovirus is often not apparent until later in childhood, and the neurological sequelae of fetal or neonatal infections with toxoplasmosis, CMV, rubella, herpes virus, Group B streptococcus and syphilis are often not apparent until later as well [40, 139] . The most important outcome in HIV-infected neonates, childhood acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), does not usually appear until after infancy. The chronic hepatitis resulting from perinatal infection with the hepatitis B virus is usually not symptomatic in the neonatal period, and the late sequelae of perinatal hepatitis B infection, including cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, generally occur decades later [140, 141] . Congenital infection with the human papilloma virus has been implicated in laryngeal papillomas and several childhood cancers [142, 143] .

There are many definitions of ''prenatal,'' ''perinatal,'' and ''intrapartum'' in use today. In the following discussion, prenatal refers to the period between 

Occurs rarely if at all; +, established relationship; F, may occur, uncommon. Data from Refs. [75, [134] [135] [136] .

conception and the events leading to delivery, perinatal refers to the time between the onset of labor or rupture of membranes and approximately 1 month after delivery, and intrapartum refers to the period between the onset of labor and delivery. The numerical values used for infection and transmission rates and the percentage of infected infants who had various sequelae used in the following tables are based on a wide variety of sources with widely discrepant estimates [76, 134] . These differences may reflect differences in study design, laboratory methodology, or population differences (race and socioeconomic status or size of study population), or case definition. Table 3 describes the maternal prevalence of a number of infections, as well as the timing of transmission and the percent of neonates infected when the mother is colonized. For example, syphilis, hepatitis B, and HIV infections are currently found in approximately 0.10% to 0.2% of pregnant women in the United States [144, 145] . Gonorrhea infections are found in about 1% of all pregnant women, and trichomonas and chlamydia in about 5% [146] [147] [148]

Cytomegalovirus infection is estimated to be present in about one third of all pregnant women [149, 150] . Infants are virtually never infected with Trichomonas. Manifestation of bacterial vaginosis in the infant is unknown; however, neonatal infections with U urealyticum, Mycoplasma hominis, various bacterioides spp, Gardnerella or other bacterial vaginosis-related organisms have been reported, although rarely [151] . Congenital syphilis is usually transmitted after the first trimester, but can be transmitted at any time during the pregnancy or at delivery. N gonorrhoeae, C trachomatis, and the hepatitis B virus rarely infect the fetus in the prenatal period and are almost never found in the uterus before rupture of the membranes [1, 74, 124, [152] [153] [154] . Instead, the fetus generally acquires these organisms as it passes through the birth canal. Fetal infections with herpes simplex virus rarely occur before the rupture of the membranes [155, 156] . Instead, the vast majority of transmissions occur after the rupture of the membranes or in the intrapartum period. Transmission rates to the fetus vary depending on whether the infection is primary or recurrent. Neonatal HIV infection may be acquired prenatally, but studies of second trimester abortuses suggest that early in utero infection is rare. Using a mathematical model, Rouzioux and colleagues [157] estimated that one third of the transmissions occur in the last 2 weeks of pregnancy and two thirds occur in the intrapartum period. Women who have an HIV infection and whose membranes rupture more than 4 hours before delivery or who are delivered vaginally are, in most studies, more likely to transmit this infection to their neonates [158] [159] [160] .

If the mother is infected, variable percents of the exposed infants, depending upon the disease, become colonized (see Table 3 ). Without treatment, these rates of transmission range from 0.2% for herpes simplex, to 3% for cytomegalovirus, and up to 25% to 40% for syphilis, hepatitis B virus, and HIV [161] . If routine ophthalmic prophylaxis is not used, approximately 30% to 50% of the infants [52] of infected mothers acquire gonorrhea or chlamydia ophthalmic infections.

Because the influence of maternally transmitted organisms on adverse outcomes of pregnancy are generally presented in individual papers, it may be instructive to compare their impact. For a subset of maternal infections that are associated with fetal infection, Table 4 indicates not only the maternal and infant prevalences in the 4 million births per year in the United States, but also the approximate number of mothers and infants who have an infection. Also displayed in this table is the approximate number of infants each year in the United States who have specific types of sequelae associated with direct fetal or infant infection. The potential excess in preterm births attributable to various infections and the sequelae associated with those preterm births are discussed later. When translated into the total US population, this means that there are approximately 4000 to 8000 pregnant women per year who have syphilis, hepatitis B, or HIV; about 40,000 pregnant women per year infected with gonorrhea; about 80,000 pregnant women who have Trichomonas; perhaps 200,000 pregnant women who have chlamydia; and approximately 800,000 pregnant women per year who have herpes simplex virus or BV. It is estimated that approximately 1.3 million pregnant women are infected/colonized with CMV. Again, these numbers are our best estimates for infection for the entire population of pregnant women who give birth in the United States each year. Subpopulations of women who have markedly higher and lower prevalences have been described. For both herpes simplex virus and cytomegalovirus, it is assumed that previous infection, as defined serologically, is associated with persistent infection. 

The next several columns in Table 4 show potential outcomes associated with fetal and perinatal infection with each of the organisms. These are estimates of outcomes achieved in the United States with current medical practices. From the existing literature, it is estimated that of the 1920 infants infected with syphilis at the time of birth, approximately 600 will be stillborn or will die as neonates, and about 600 will have long-term neurological or other sequelae. Approximately 720 of these 1920 infants will live and not have apparent long-term sequelae. With gonorrhea, assuming no ophthalmologic disease because of prophylaxis, there will be few major sequelae in the infant from neonatal infection. Of the 100,000 infants infected with chlamydia at birth, again assuming no long-term ophthalmologic sequelae because of prophylaxis, it is estimated that there will be approximately 20,000 cases of chlamydial pneumonia, nearly all of which will regress spontaneously or respond to antibiotics and not result in long-term sequelae or death [135] . Without immunoprophylaxis, of the 12,000 infants infected with hepatitis B virus at birth, approximately 4000 will ultimately develop cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma [140, 162] . These numbers should be substantially reduced with routine neonatal hepatitis B immunoglobulin prophylaxis and vaccination, and although the numbers are unknown, the authors estimate that about 300 will develop cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma sometimes in their lives. Of the 1200 infants infected at birth with herpes simplex virus, an estimated 400 will die during the perinatal period, approximately 400 will have neurological sequelae, and 400 will have neonatal disease but no long-term sequelae. Of the 40,000 infants infected with CMV, approximately 7% will have signs of disease in the neonatal period. Of these 2800 infants, some 300 will die, whereas 2000 more will have major neurological sequelae. Newell [163] estimates that as much as 7% of all cases of cerebral palsy are due to CMV infections. Later in life, an additional 5000 infants will have significant hearing loss associated with the CMV infection [147] . As stated above, it is estimated that with maternal and infant prophylaxis, fewer than 100 infants per year in the United States will be infected with HIV. It is assumed that even with treatment, each of these infants will ultimately manifest AIDS and die of the disease.

As discussed above, it is not absolutely clear whether maternal infections such as gonorrhea, syphilis, chlamydial infection, Group B streptococcal infection, or trichomoniasis result in preterm birth. The data supporting the association of BV with spontaneous preterm birth are more solid. Although the relationships are uncertain, based on the authors' assessment of the literature, we assumed that gonorrhea is associated with a threefold increase in the preterm birth rate, and that syphilis and chlamydial infection are associated with a twofold increase in pre- [75, 135] .

goldenberg et al term birth. Bacterial vaginosis is associated with a twofold increase and trichomonas with a 1.3-fold increase. From these numbers and the rates of maternal infection, assuming a 10% rate of prematurity in the general population, the excess number of preterm births per year in the United States associated with maternal infection with each organism can be calculated ( Table 5) . As an example, if 40,000 pregnant women in the Unites States are infected per year with gonorrhea, and if these women have a 30% instead of a 10% rate of spontaneous preterm birth, maternal gonorrhea infection may be associated with an estimated 8000 excess preterm births. Of the 4800 women who have syphilis, assuming a twofold increase in preterm birth, approximately 480 excess preterm births due to syphilis may occur in the United States each year. Assuming a twofold increase in preterm birth, with 200,000 mothers having chlamydial infection each year, as many as 20,000 excess preterm births may be associated with maternal chlamydial infection. Applying this same logic to maternal BV infections and assuming a twofold increase in preterm birth associated with BV, of the 800,000 women who have BV, an excess of 80,000 preterm births may occur.

The last two columns in Table 4 show the estimated number of perinatal deaths and infants who have major neurological handicaps associated with maternal infections and preterm birth, if it is assumed that 5% of the preterm infants die and 5% are neurologically handicapped with such conditions as blindness, hydrocephalus, mental retardation, or cerebral palsy. If these assumptions are correct, prematurity secondary to maternal gonococcal infections may be responsible for approximately 400 perinatal deaths and 400 children experiencing long-term neurological sequelae. Through its influence on preterm birth, syphilis would be responsible for an additional 16 perinatal deaths and for 16 children who have long-term neurological sequelae. Through its impact on preterm birth, chlamydial infection might account for as many as 1000 excess perinatal deaths and 1000 children who have long-term disability. Maternal BV, because of its high prevalence in the population and an associated twofold increase in preterm birth, may be responsible for approximately 80,000 excess preterm births, 4000 perinatal deaths, and 4000 children who have long-term neurological sequelae. The authors emphasize that most of these adverse outcomes associated with preterm birth occur without apparent fetal or neonatal infection.

Fetal or neonatal infections with the agents of sexually transmitted diseasessyphilis, herpes simplex virus, and HIV -ay have a devastating effect, including either death or long-term neurological disability. In the United States, associated with each of these infections, between 1000 and 2500 infants per year die or are severely damaged. In contrast to these relatively rare outcomes, approximately 400,000 infants are born prematurely each year, and of these, more than 20,000 die in the fetal or the neonatal period, and another 20,000 have neurological sequelae. If the projected effect on preterm birth by BV and the other organisms proposed here is correct, as many as 100,000 preterm births and 5000 or more of the deaths, as well as a similar number of the major disabilities, may be associated with maternal infections. Because some studies suggest that some of the preterm births associated with BV and intrauterine infection may be prevented, it seems that the greatest potential for reducing adverse outcomes of pregnancy associated with maternal infection lies in preventing or treating BV and intrauterine infection-associated preterm births.

"Epidemiology of Severe Acute Respiratory Illness and Risk Factors for Influenza Infection and Clinical Severity among Adults in Malawi, 2011-2013","Data on the epidemiology of severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) in adults from low-income, high human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) prevalence African settings are scarce. We conducted adult SARI surveillance in Blantyre, Malawi. From January 2011 to December 2013, individuals aged ³ 15 years with SARI (both inpatients and outpatients) were enrolled at a large teaching hospital in Blantyre, Malawi. Nasopharyngeal aspirates were tested for influenza and other respiratory viruses by polymerase chain reaction. We estimated hospital-attended influenza-positive SARI incidence rates and assessed factors associated with influenza positivity and clinical severity (Modified Early Warning Score > 4). We enrolled 1,126 SARI cases; 163 (14.5%) were positive for influenza. Human immunodeficiency virus prevalence was 50.3%. Annual incidence of hospital-attended influenza-associated SARI was 9.7-16.8 cases per 100,000 population. Human immunodeficiency virus was associated with a 5-fold greater incidence (incidence rate ratio 4.91, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.83-6.32). On multivariable analysis, female gender, as well as recruitment in hot, rainy season (December to March; adjusted odds ratios (aOR): 2.82, 95% CI: 1.57-5.06) and cool, dry season (April to August; aOR: 2.47, 95% CI: 1.35-4.15), was associated with influenza positivity, whereas influenza-positive patients were less likely to be HIV-infected (aOR: 0.59, 95% CI: 0.43-0.80) or have viral coinfection (aOR: 0.51, 95% CI: 0.36-0.73). Human immunodeficiency virus infection (aOR: 1.86; 95% CI: 1.35-2.56) and recruitment in hot, rainy season (aOR: 4.98, 95% CI: 3.17-7.81) were independently associated with clinical severity. In this high HIV prevalence population, influenza was associated with nearly 15% of hospital-attended SARI. Human immunodeficiency virus infection is an important risk factor for clinical severity in all-cause and influenza-associated SARI. Expanded access to HIV testing and antiretroviral treatment, as well as targeted influenza vaccination, may reduce the burden of SARI in Malawi and other high HIV prevalence settings.","Pneumonia is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in adults in sub-Saharan Africa. 1 However, the burden of severe respiratory illness and the contribution of influenza and other respiratory viruses are not well documented in the region. Lack of diagnostic capacity, similarity of influenza presentation with common febrile illnesses such as malaria and bacterial pneumonia, and prioritization of other high-burden public health problems are likely contributory factors. A recent systematic review concluded that most of the sub-Saharan African countries had insufficient epidemiological data to develop rational strategies for influenza prevention and control. 2 It is, therefore, unsurprising that although the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends seasonal influenza vaccine for high-risk groups, such as young children, pregnant women, and Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected individuals, 3 few African countries have implemented these recommendations or have national policies. 4 Following the 2009 influenza A(H1N1) pandemic, respiratory viral surveillance capacity has increased substantially in Africa. 5 Currently, 23 sub-Saharan African countries contribute data to the WHO Global Surveillance and Response System. 6 Emerging data suggest that influenza viruses are frequently detected in mild (6.7-40.4%) and severe (4.6-25.5%) acute respiratory presentations in the region 7 and are associated with a higher mortality compared with developed settings because of the high prevalence of HIV infection and other comorbidities. 8 However, only a handful of studies have focused on adults 9, 10 and few have comprehensively ascertained HIV status.

Malawi is a low-income country, ranked 170th of 188 countries in the Human Development Index. 11 Active surveillance for influenza and other respiratory viruses was established at a large urban teaching hospital in Malawi in January 2011. In this high HIV prevalence and malaria-endemic setting, we aimed to describe the epidemiology and viral etiology and factors associated with clinical severity and influenza positivity among individuals aged ³ 15 years with severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) during 2011-2013.

Study site and setting. Malawi has hot rainy (mean temperature > 22°C and rainfall > 100 mm; December to March), cool and dry (mean temperature < 22°C and rainfall < 50 mm; April to August), and hot and dry (mean temperature > 22°C and rainfall < 50 mm; September to November) seasons. The Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital (QECH) is the only government inpatient facility providing free health care to the 1.3 million residents of Blantyre District. Consequently, most individuals requiring hospitalization from this community will present to QECH. Human immunodeficiency virus prevalence in Blantyre is estimated at 17.7%, 12 but up to 74% of patients admitted to the QECH medical wards are HIV infected. 13 Malaria is endemic in Malawi (peak transmission months January to June), and malaria rapid diagnostic test (RDT) positivity is 8% among adult inpatients at QECH. 14 Lower respiratory tract infections are the commonest cause of medical admission at QECH. 13 There is no national influenza vaccination policy in Malawi. A WHO-led influenza A(H1N1) pdm09 vaccine campaign targeting health-care workers and pregnant women occurred in 2010. 15 Study procedures. Patients aged 15 years and older presenting to the QECH Emergency Department during surveillance hours (8 AM to 3 PM on weekdays) were screened for study eligibility. Consecutive patients from the start of the day fulfilling the SARI case definition were recruited (maximum four per day). Study staff collected demographic, clinical, and risk factor information using structured questionnaires and obtained nasopharyngeal aspirates and blood specimens for malaria and HIV testing.

SARI was defined as 1) an acute respiratory illness with symptom onset < 7 days, 2) reported or recorded fever (³ 38°C), 3) cough or sore throat, and 4) shortness of breath or difficulty breathing. In our resource-limited setting, patients with severe illness requiring admission were often sent home. Therefore, hospital attendance (not admission) was required for study enrolment.

Laboratory procedures. The processing of respiratory specimens has been described previously. 16 In brief, nasopharyngeal aspirates were stored at −80°C in Universal Transport Medium (Copan, Brescia, Italy). These were batch-tested for influenza A and B by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) using the CDC human influenza reverse transcription-PCR diagnostic panel (CDC Influenza Division, http://www.cdc.gov/ncird/flu. html). Influenza-positive specimens were subtyped using the CDC rRT-PCR protocol. The FTD respiratory pathogens 33 kit (Fast-track Diagnostics Ltd., Luxembourg, http://www. fast-trackdiagnostics.com) was used to detect coronaviruses OC43, NL63, HKU1, and 229E; parainfluenza viruses 1-4; respiratory syncytial viruses (RSV) A and B; enterovirus; human metapneumovirus; rhinovirus; adenovirus; and bocavirus. Samples with a Ct value < 40 were recorded as positive.

Human immunodeficiency virus testing (Alere Determine ™ HIV-1/2, Waltham, MA, and Trinity Biotech Uni-Gold ™ HIV, Bray, Co., Wicklow, Ireland) was performed according to WHO guidelines. 17 Rapid diagnostic test for malaria (Paracheck Pf ® , Orchid Biomedical Systems, Bamboli, Goa, India) was also performed in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions.

Climatic data. Data on rainfall (millimeters), temperature (degree Celsius), and relative humidity (percentage) were obtained from the Malawi Department of Climate Change and Meteorological Services for 2011-2013.

Statistical analysis. Analysis was performed using Stata (Version 12.0; StataCorp Limited, College Station, TX). Monthly mean temperature, rainfall, and relative humidity were plotted against the number and proportion of influenza-positive SARI cases over the surveillance period to assess the association between climatic variations and influenza activity.

Numerators for minimum adult influenza-associated SARI incidence estimates were generated from the number of enrolled SARI with a positive influenza PCR that resided in the Blantyre district and adjusted for non-enrolment (during weekends and outside of surveillance hours on weekdays) by multiplying by the reciprocal of the proportion of recruited cases among all SARI cases attending the emergency department. The latter was recorded on the Surveillance Program of Inpatients and Epidemiology (SPINE) electronic data collection system. 13 The annual incidence of hospitalattended influenza-positive SARI per 100,000 persons was estimated using the adjusted number of medically attended influenza-positive SARIs, divided by the census estimates of Blantyre District population aged ³ 15 years for each year, 18 and multiplied by 100,000. Incidence by HIV status was also calculated for individuals aged 15-49 years (in whom HIV prevalence is available 18 ). Human immunodeficiency virusassociated incidence rate ratios (IRRs) were calculated by dividing the incidence in HIV-infected strata by the incidence in HIV-uninfected strata. 95% Confidence intervals (CIs) for incidence estimates and HIV-associated IRRs were calculated using the Poisson distribution.

Logistic regression was used to calculate odds ratios (OR) and 95% CIs to compare clinical variables between influenzapositive and influenza-negative patients. Multivariable logistic regression models were developed for two outcomes of interest: 1) influenza positivity and 2) clinical severity (defined as Modified Early Warning Score (MEWS) > 4). 19 Modified early warning score is a simple physiological score based on five parameters (respiratory rate, heart rate, systolic blood pressure, temperature, and conscious level). It has been widely used in developed health-care settings to identify patients at risk of deterioration. A score of greater than 4 has been shown to be predictive of inpatient mortality in both well-resourced 19, 20 and African settings. 21, 22 Covariates with a P value of < 0.2 on univariable analysis, in addition to age, gender, and year of surveillance considered a priori confounders, were assessed for significance using backward stepwise selection. Odds ratios and 95% CIs were reported. Factors with 2-sided P values of < 0.05 were considered significant.

Ethics approval. Ethical approval for this study was obtained from the University of Malawi College of Medicine Research Ethics Committee (P.07/10/958), Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine (10.76), and the CDC through an ethical reliance. All participants provided written informed consent.

Demographic characteristics. Between January 2011 and December 2013, 1,126 SARI cases aged 15 years and older were enrolled ( Table 1 ). The median age was 33 years (interquartile range 26-42 years) and 489 (43.4%) were male. Of 1,109 patients with available HIV status (98.5%), 558 (50.3%) were HIV infected. Thirteen individuals reported receipt of influenza vaccination in the previous year.

Viruses detected among SARI patients. One or more respiratory viruses were identified in 533 (47.3%) enrolled SARI cases (Table 1) . Influenza viruses were detected in 163 (14.5%) SARI cases. When tested for the extended panel of respiratory viruses (N = 1,123) (Figure 1 ), rhinovirus was detected in 149 (13.3%), coronavirus OC43 in 49 (4.4%), RSV in 48 (4.2%), and adenovirus in 47 (4.2%). Influenza A and B were detected more frequently in HIV-uninfected than in HIV-infected SARI cases (influenza A, 12.0% versus 8.2%; influenza B 6.0% versus 3.1%; Supplemental Table 1 ), whereas the prevalence of other respiratory viruses did not differ by HIV status.

A single virus was isolated in 253 (22.5%) patients, whereas 154 (13.7%) individuals had two or more viruses detected. The highest proportion of viral co-detection was observed for bocavirus (21/24, 87 .5%) and enterovirus (27/32; 84 .4%), whereas the lowest proportion was observed in influenza A (26/108; 24.1%).

Seasonality of influenza virus and malaria. Among the 163 influenza-positive SARI cases, 61 (37.2%) were influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, 47 (28.7%) were influenza A(H3N2), and 59 (30.5%) were influenza B. Three cases had influenza A and B coinfection and one influenza A sample was unsubtyped. Figure 2 illustrates the temporal distribution of influenza types and subtypes, as well as malaria RDT positivity. There were annual cycles of influenza activity, but timing of peak detection varied year to year. In 2011, influenza activity had a bimodal peak-in April and July. In 2012, influenza was detected between March and June only. By contrast, influenza was detected throughout 2013 but peaked in January and February. Peaks in influenza activity coincided with months with high relative humidity, but there was no correlation with rainfall or temperature (Supplemental Figure 1A Of 911 SARI cases with available malaria RDT result, 28 (3.1%) were positive. There was no correlation between influenza and malaria activity ( Figure 2 ). None of the cases with malaria were positive for influenza.

Incidence estimates for hospital-attended influenzapositive SARIs. The mean annual incidence of hospital- Factors associated with influenza positivity in SARI patients. Compared with influenza-negative patients, a higher proportion of influenza-positive SARI patients reported headache (90.1 versus 83.6%, OR: 1.79, 95% CI: 1.02-3.13, P = 0.04). No other clinical feature differences by etiology were found (see Supplemental Table 2 ).

In the multivariable analysis (Table 2) , female gender was associated with increased odds of influenza positivity compared with male gender (adjusted OR [aOR]: 1.57 (95% CI: 1.10-2.26). Greater influenza activity was observed in the hot, rainy season (17.5%; aOR: 2.82, 95% CI: 1.57-5.06) and the cold, dry season (16.5%; aOR: 2.37, 95% CI: 1. 35-4.15 ), compared with the hot, dry season (6.7%). Furthermore, influenza positivity was inversely associated with HIV infection (aOR: 0.53, 95% CI: 0.36-0.76, P < 0.001) and codetection with another respiratory virus (aOR: 0.46, 95% CI: 0.31-0.70, P < 0.001). Small numbers prohibited the evaluation of specific viral co-detection combinations with influenza.

Factors associated with clinical severity. We found that 238 of 1,126 patients with SARI (21.1%) had clinically severe disease (MEWS > 4). In multivariable analysis ( Table 3 ).

Comprehensive hospital-based sentinel surveillance in our high HIV prevalence, malaria-endemic African setting has identified influenza as an important contributor to SARI in adults, substantiating data from other African studies. 9,10 In the immediate post-pandemic period, influenza A(H1N1) pdm09 was the predominant strain in Malawi in 2011 and 2013 and was associated with increased clinical severity compared with other subtypes. Influenza activity corresponded to months with higher relative humidity, but not with malaria activity. Among adults with SARI, female gender, in addition to recruitment in hot, rainy and cool, dry seasons, were associated with influenza positivity. Although HIV-infected adults with SARI were more likely to have an alternative etiology to influenza, HIV-infected adults aged 15-49 years had a 5-fold greater incidence of hospital-attended influenza-positive SARI compared with HIV-uninfected adults. Furthermore, HIV infection predicted clinical severity in all-cause SARI and influenza-associated SARI.

The estimated annual incidence of hospital-attended influenza-positive SARI ranged from 9.7 to 16.9 per 100,000 adult population, similar to that reported in rural Kenya (0.3/1,000) 23 but substantially lower than estimates by another Kenyan study (2.8/100 for influenza A and 0.2/100 for influenza 24 This wide variation could be due to geographical and seasonal differences in disease burden, but is also likely attributable to varying methodologies and case definitions, in addition to differing health-seeking behavior and thresholds for hospital admission. Furthermore, the latter two studies included children aged 5-14 years, a group that typically has higher rates of influenza infection. 9, 24 It is important to stress that our incidence estimates represent minimum estimates because our surveillance only detected persons accessing care at QECH. A small proportion of patients may have presented to a traditional healer or to one of the two private hospitals in Blantyre; SARI cases may not consider their symptoms severe enough to warrant care; they may be too ill or too poor to attend, or may have died before presentation. 25 Human immunodeficiency virus infection, identified in more than 50% of adults with SARI, was the sole individual risk factor associated with increased clinical severity. Indeed, several African adult pneumonia cohorts have reported a high prevalence of HIV infection (52-94%). [26] [27] [28] Our result supports findings from others that HIV is an important driver of severe respiratory infection, 29 including influenza, in sub-Saharan Africa.

Influenza was less commonly identified in HIV-infected compared with HIV-uninfected SARI cases. This likely reflects the different spectra of organisms affecting HIV-infected adults, with greater relative contribution of opportunistic pathogens such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Pneumocystis jirovecii, and Streptococcus pneumoniae, rather than a lower absolute risk. This has also been described in HIV-infected children 30 and adults 10 in South Africa. In fact, after taking into account population denominators, HIV-infected adults aged 15-49 years had a 5-fold greater incidence of influenza-positive SARI than HIV-uninfected adults. Having comprehensively ascertained HIV status, our study corroborates with studies in Malawi, Kenya, and South Africa that have identified HIV as a major risk factor for influenza burden 25 and severe disease. 24, 31, 32 These results suggest that early HIV testing and expanded access to antiretroviral treatment, in addition to targeted influenza vaccination, could potentially have a substantial impact on burden of SARI in urban Blantyre and other similar high HIV prevalence settings. Annual influenza vaccination is recommended for HIV-infected individuals. 3 Influenza vaccination in HIV-infected adults is safe and effective (pooled efficacy 85%), 33 but influenza vaccines are currently unavailable in most African countries. 4, 34 SARI cases recruited in hot, rainy season were associated with a 5-fold increased odds of clinical severity, compared with those recruited in the hot, dry season. This was also observed in our pediatric surveillance. 16 The reason for this is unclear but could be related to other unmeasured infections (we were unable to determine the presence of bacterial pathogens in our SARI cases), seasonal patterns of health-care utilization, and seasonal malnutrition. The hot, rainy season in Malawi coincides with the ""lean"" season before harvest. 35 A recent casecontrol study in Malawi identified food insecurity as a risk factor for influenza severity, 31 thus supporting our latter hypothesis. We identified at least one respiratory virus in nearly half of all SARI cases, higher than that described in South African adults, 10 and in developed settings. 36 ,37 Viral coinfections were common, occurring in 14% of adult SARI cases. We also found a nonsignificant trend toward increased severity in adults with viral coinfection (26.7% versus 20.3% with MEWS > 4, P = 0.11). There is growing recognition that viruses other than influenza, such as rhinovirus, adenovirus, hMPV, and parainfluenza viruses, can cause clinically severe disease. However, whereas the detection of influenza, RSV, and hMPV in adults with SARI likely indicates an etiologic role, 38, 39 the presence of other respiratory viruses is of uncertain significance, particularly as we did not enroll accompanying controls. Further understanding of the interactions and contribution of these viruses to severe respiratory disease will help to narrow the focus on pertinent targets for vaccine and antiviral development.

Our study has a number of limitations. First, we conducted single-site hospital-based surveillance. Although there are no other large inpatient facilities in Blantyre, we have not sampled from elsewhere in Malawi. Second, limiting recruitment to the first four cases of the day could have resulted in selection bias because individuals who present to hospital at different times of the day may have varying characteristics, such as healthseeking behavior or distance of residence from hospital. Third as discussed earlier, patients with SARI could have sought health care in facilities other than QECH, leading to an underestimation of our influenza-associated SARI rates. Underascertainment of SARI cases and resultant underestimation of incidence were also possible if SARI cases were not systematically recorded onto SPINE. Fourth, although we had nearcomplete ascertainment of HIV status (98.5%), data on CD4 + cell count and antiretroviral treatment status were not available. Comorbidities were also poorly recorded; thus, we were unable to evaluate chronic lung disease as a potential risk factor for influenza or adjust for underlying comorbidities in the multivariable analysis for clinical severity. Last, data on hospitalization and mortality were not systematically captured. Instead, we used the MEWS score as a surrogate marker for clinical severity. The score has been widely used in developed health-care settings to identify patients at risk of deterioration, and a threshold of greater than four is predictive of inpatient mortality. 19 It has also been validated in other African settings. 21, 22 This study provides a baseline for understanding the complexities of SARI epidemiology in adults in Malawi and other similar settings. In this high HIV prevalence setting, respiratory viruses were commonly identified in adults with SARI and influenza has a prominent etiological role. Human immunodeficiency virus-infected adults are at particular risk of severe disease and have a higher burden of influenzaassociated SARI than HIV-uninfected individuals. Ongoing surveillance for influenza and other respiratory viruses, with specific focus on severe disease in high-risk groups such as HIV-infected individuals and pregnant women, and greater effort to capture outcome data are critical to further characterize disease burden in these high-risk groups to inform public policy decisions. Improved HIV testing and early ART initiation, as well as targeted influenza vaccination could potentially substantially reduce the burden of SARI in Malawi and other sub-Saharan African countries with high HIV prevalence.

Obesity and risk of respiratory tract infections: results of an infection-diary based cohort study,Background: Respiratory tract infections (RTIs) are a major morbidity factor contributing largely to health care costs and individual quality of life. The aim of the study was to test whether obesity (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m 2 ) is one of the risk factors underlying frequent RTIs in the German adult population. Methods: We recruited 1455 individuals between 18 to 70 years from a cross-sectional survey on airway infections in Germany and invited them to self-report in diaries incident RTIs experienced during three consecutive winter/ spring seasons. RTIs reported in these 18 months and summary measures adding-up individual RTIs were the outcomes of interest.,"Frequent and severe respiratory tract infections (RTIs) constitute an important morbidity factor in our society and a considerable cost burden in terms of medical treatment and time of work-loss [1, 2] . RTIs are divided into upper RTIs (URTIs) including common cold, pharyngitis, otitis, sinusitis, laryngotracheitis, epiglottitis and lower RTIs (LRTIs) including bronchitis, pneumonia and bronchiolitis [3] . Individual exposure to infectious agents and host factors such as smoking [4, 5] and vitamin D status [6, 7] are believed to contribute to observed differences in RTI risk. In addition, the role of overweight (body mass index (BMI) = 25.0-29.9 kg/m 2 ) and in particular obesity (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m 2 ) in predisposition to RTIs is increasingly discussed [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] . This growing interest is driven by the rising number of overweight and obese individuals worldwide [14] and the emerging knowledge of notable immunological imbalances in association with obesity [15] . Most of the studies targeting adults explored the association of obesity with specific RTIs and their outcomes. Thus, obesity was associated with non-allergic rhinitis [8] and influenza like-illness [9] . Moreover, two population-based studies which investigated the role of obesity as risk factor for community acquired pneumonia (CAP) in the general population resulted in controversial findings [10, 11] . Two recent Danish population-based studies reported an excess of a large spectrum of RTIs including pneumonia among obese people [12, 13] . The overall aim of our study targeting the adult population in South Baden, Germany, is to identify risk factors for the susceptibility to RTIs. Here we present data on the role of obesity as contributing factor to a high RTI burden in the German society and explore effect modification by gender, sports activity and nutritional patterns.

Study participants (n = 1455) were recruited from the airway infection susceptibility (AWIS) cross sectional study querying RTI burden in an adult population in South-Baden, Germany [16] . The study protocol was approved by community officials and the Ethics Committee of the University of Freiburg (Ref. No. 258/11_120365). Based on the RTI history-score individuals of putative low, medium and high risk of future RTIs were invited to the actual sub-cohort. The RTI history score is summarizing information on the frequency and severity of RTIs and antibiotics use over the past two years, selfassessed RTI susceptibility, and occurrence of selected severe infections [16] . Study participants were requested to fill-in an additional questionnaire (baseline questionnaire) on lifestyle factors and co-morbidities and to complete monthly diaries registering the monthly occurrence and the duration (< 2 weeks, > 2 weeks) of RTIs, namely sinusitis, rhinitis, otitis media, pharyngitis/laryngitis, tonsillitis, influenza-like illness, bronchitis, pneumonia, pleurisy and other acute RTIs, from the beginning of November to the end of April of three seasons: 2012/13, 2013/14 and 2014/15. Furthermore, the intake of antibiotics, doctor visits, hospitalisation for RTIs and the impact of RTI symptoms on their daily activities were queried. Further recruitment details into the AWIS study and the present sub-cohort are presented under Additional files 1 and 2. Informed consent was obtained from all individual participants included in the study.

In order to describe the association between obesity and RTIs, different outcome indicators were considered: outcomes at the level of each month [""any RTI"", ""any URTI"" (sinusitis, rhinitis, otitis media, pharyngitis/laryngitis and tonsillitis), ""any LRTI"" (bronchitis, pneumonia and pleurisy), ""≥3 RTIs"", ""any long lasting infection"" (> 2 weeks)]; at the level of each winter season (""≥4 months with infections"", ""≥3 long lasting infections""); and at the individual level (i.e. are defined once per individual and covering the overall study period). The ten specific RTI symptom categories were considered with the binary symptom indicators ""infection reported"" or ""no infection reported"" for each month.

When counting the episodes for the outcome indicator ""≥3 long lasting infections"", different infection symptoms were counted as separate episodes, even if they overlapped in time. However, within one symptom category at least one month without this specific infection was required to call it a new episode. We also calculated a monthly diary RTI score, averaging the ten RTI symptom categories with the coding ""0"" for ""no infection reported"", ""1"" for ""reported infection with duration < 2 weeks"", and ""2"" for ""reported infection present with duration >2 weeks"". Missing values for individual infection items were treated as zero. If an individual RTI symptom was reported, but information on duration was missing, it was counted as ""reported infection with duration < 2 weeks"". If all items were missing, no diary score was computed. The diary RTI score at the monthly level was expanded to a score at the seasonal level by averaging over the six months (November-April) of each season, and to an overall score at the individual level by averaging over all available months. The respective upper 10% of these diary scores within each month, season and overall served as additional outcome indicators.

Further variables considered in the study were age, gender, self-reported weight and height for BMI calculation (BMI was categorized as < 30 (non-obese), 25 ≤ BMI < 30 (overweight) and ≥30 (obese)), educational level, contact with children, comorbidities, removed immunological organs, smoking status, sports activity and dietary intake patterns. Details on these variables are described in the Additional file 1 and supplementary information on dietary intake patterns is presented in Additional file 3.

Statistical analysis was performed using Stata (version 14 STATSCorp, USA). Descriptive statistics: Monthly prevalences of individual RTI symptoms were computed by taking the average over all subjects available at each month and then averaging over all 18 months covered. Prevalences at the seasonal level were computed accordingly averaging over all three seasons covered. The corresponding confidence intervals (CIs) and p-values are based on a generalised linear model with identity link and binomial type variance together with robust variance estimates. The frequency of long lasting infections among all months with infections was analysed accordingly. However, due to the limited number of cases for tonsillitis and otitis media we determined the monthly frequency of long-lasting infections by pooling the data over all seasons and for pneumonia by pooling all indicated months.

At the monthly level ORs were computed using a logistic regression model with a random intercept applied to the individual data for each month taking the 18 months as a categorical covariate into account in addition to the obesity status indicator. Due to its small prevalence, pleurisy was not considered as single outcome in these analyses. Outcomes at the seasonal level were analysed accordingly with the individual data for each winter season and taking into account the three seasons as a categorical covariate. Outcomes at the individual level were analysed using a logistic regression model. Results are ORs and 95% CIs. Adjusted ORs are based on including age groups and education as simultaneous categorical covariates. Furthermore, in order to study the stability of the obesity-RTI association with respect to potential confounders, ORs were adjusted by respective variables. Subjects with incomplete covariate data were excluded from multivariate analyses.

Effect modification by a binary variable was assessed by fitting an overall model with the corresponding interactions parametrized so that we could directly read off the two subgroup-specific ORs. Effect modification by sports activity and nutrition patterns was explored among those representing the lower and upper third of respective scores.

The study population comprised 1455 individuals (931 female and 524 male) with a median age of 51.08 years. Based on BMI calculated from self-reported weight and height, 2.1% of the population was underweight (BMI < 18.5 kg/m 2 ), 54% had a normal weight (18.5 kg/m 2 ≤ BMI < 25 kg/m 2 ), 31.1% was overweight, and 12.8% was considered obese (Table 1 ). In women, the distribution was 2.8%, 60.21%, 25.0%, and 12.1% and in men 0.76%, 43.1%, 41.8%, and 14.3%, respectively. The study participants were mainly of medium and high educational level, non-or ex-smokers, moderately affected by selected co-morbidities and they reported rather infrequent contact to small children. Further information on the study population and completed diaries is reported in Table 1 and Additional file 4.

Missing rates of single items in the returned diaries were limited and ranged from 1.2% for rhinitis and pharyngitis/laryngitis to 2.6% for other acute respiratory infections. Study participants reported most frequently rhinitis (26.6%), followed by influenza-like illness (11.4%) and pharyngitis/laryngitis (10.5%), whereas pleurisy (0.10%) was rarely experienced. Any URTI (31.5%) was more frequent than any LRTI (7.9%). Apart from the LRTIs bronchitis, pneumonia and pleurisy, which more men than women reported, all other RTIs were more prevalent among women (Table 2 ). Seasonal patterns of reported infections show a February peak for two of the three assessed infection seasons (2012/13 and 2014/15, see Additional file 5). Respiratory infections with a high fraction of long duration were almost exclusively LRTIs, namely pneumonia (59%), followed by bronchitis (48.2%). Men were overrepresented among those with long-lasting RTIs ( Table 2) .

Compared to normal weight individuals, overweight and obese people consistently had a higher prevalence (Table 3) for the single RTIs, URTIs, LRTIs, as well as the other outcome parameters we looked at with other acute infections and pneumonia as the exceptions. For pneumonia, only obese subjects had a higher prevalence. The overweight group was typically falling in between the groups with normal weight and obesity ( Table 3 ). The strongest association was seen for pneumonia and bronchitis, and accordingly, any LRTI was more strongly associated with obesity than any URTI. Long-lasting RTIs, frequent RTIs and high diary scores were also more strongly associated with obesity than the individual symptoms. Adjustments by age and education did only marginally change these estimates. Among subjects with an infection, long lasting infections were again associated with obesity, reaching significance for any RTI, rhinitis, pharyngitis/laryngitis, influenza-like illness, and bronchitis ( Table 3) .

For a better understanding of the robustness of the relationship between RTI burden and obesity, the effect of adjusting for putative confounders was explored (Additional file 6). The studied demographic and lifestyle variables (age, gender, education level, smoking status, contact to children, asthma, sports activity, dietary patterns and previous removal of immune organs) did only marginally affect ORs. However, adjustment for asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or a summary score covering all queried co-morbidities weakened the relationship between obesity and all outcomes considerably. Adjustment for vitamin D levels among those for which serum was available (n = 508), had only a slight effect on the magnitude of the association between obesity and RTI outcomes.

The association between obesity and RTI outcomes was more prominent for women than for men and reached statistical significance only for the former (Table 4 ). For most outcomes this interaction was not significant, with the individual level diary score as an exception. When looking at sports activity, for most outcomes the association with obesity was confined to those physically more active and not seen for those reporting little sports activity (Table 5 ). For all outcomes the association was less pronounced in the latter group (compare the ratios of ORs in Table 5 ), a difference that reached significance for all outcomes except those with low prevalence. Typically the prevalence of an outcome was only increased in the small group of people with obesity and higher sports activity whereas all other groups presented rather similar patterns. Similarly, the prevalence of outcomes was increased among people with obesity and a more favourable nutritional pattern, but comparable among the other groups ( Table 6 ). The interaction reaches significance for the majority of outcomes.

RTIs constitute an important morbidity factor considering the high health care costs, the time lost from work, and the impaired quality of life among those recurrently affected [1, 2, 17] . Obesity belongs to one of the host risk factors for RTI and has possibly an emerging role due to the dramatically increasing prevalence of obesity worldwide. In the present study, we report on the association of obesity with individual RTIs as well as with a diary score summarising different incident RTI symptoms over a period of 18 months. Our investigation could demonstrate an association between obesity and RTIs confirming previous findings on influenza-like illness [9] , bronchitis [18] and pneumonia [10, 12] . We also saw an association between obesity and rhinitis, sinusitis and pharyngitis/laryngitis. An elevated risk for sinusitis among obese was also reported in a populationbased cohort of Danish women [13] . None of the two Danish population-based studies [12, 13] used ORs of monthly prevalence, but hazard ratios (HRs), as they could identify events on a daily basis. The HR of 1.6 [12] for the association with RTIs and the HR of 1.48 [13] for the association with URTIs are, however, of similar magnitude to the risk estimates which we observed. Mechanistically, excess adiposity might weigh down host defence as several mouse as well as human studies have suggested [19, 20] . The here observed associations were more prominent for LRTIs compared to URTIs, but evident for both, and more pronounced when considering long lasting or frequent RTIs compared to single symptoms. Based on the infection diary data, we generated a RTI diary score summing-up all ten symptoms and allowing to average per month, per whole season or over the whole period of three years. Considering the upper ten percentile of the distribution of such scores as an outcome, associations were typically stronger than when considering single symptoms, and interactions were more pronounced. Moreover, the results of the seasonal score were very similar or even stronger than those of the three-years score, arguing for the adequacy to query six months infectious events in future studies to identify the infection-prone sub-group of the population. Lifestyle habits seem to contribute to an individual's risk for RTI. Among them, cigarette smoking has been reported as a major environmental risk factor for recurrent and severe RTIs [4, 5] . Frequent contact to small children [21, 22] , vitamin D deficiency [23, 24] , and lack of physical activity [25, 26] constitute other exposures associated with heightened RTI risks. Moreover, higher levels of education were associated with a lower risk of CAP [27] . Based on those previous findings we investigated their role as possible confounders. The association between obesity and RTIs remained nearly unchanged after adjustment for age, gender, educational status, contact to children, smoking status, sports activity and nutrition scores, suggesting that the association is not markedly confounded by the effects of these factors on both BMI and the risk of infections. Also additional adjustment by measured serum vitamin D in a subgroup for which measurements were available did not change the risk estimates considerably. This supports arguments that the observed associations between obesity and RTI burden are due to physiological differences in the immune responsiveness between obese and non-obese individuals rather than lifestyle differences. In addition, some chronic diseases, foremost asthma and COPD, are associated with both an increased risk of RTIs and obesity [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] . Considering these associations we investigated the effect of asthma, COPD and a comorbidity scoresummarizing the other chronic conditionson the relationship between obesity and individual RTIs and the RTI diary score. Adjusting for these conditions individually and even more so in a combined fashion resulted in a considerable attenuation of the association between obesity and considered RTI outcomes. Hence part of the association between infections and obesity might be explainable by associations of co-morbidities with both. We see a gender difference in the observed associations with more noticeable findings for women. A significantly increased risk for combined RTIs was also restricted to women in a Danish blood donor cohort [12] . Several lines of research support this notion: Szabova et al. and Ilavska et al. reported gender-dependent effects of obesity on the immune system [33, 34] . The effect of BMI on a variety of immune parameters including those with relevance for immune defence was much more apparent in women than in men [34] . NK cells (CD3-/CD16+/CD56+), represent first-line cells for the clearing of virus-infected cells. Reduced levels of these cells reported for obese women, but not for respective men, might underlie the gender effect seen in our study. We also investigated a potential effect modification by sports activity and nutrition. Interestingly, an association between obesity and RTIs was evident only for those obese individuals who reported a higher level of sports activity. Thus, only the group of obese people who engaged in more intensive sports activity reported RTIs more frequently whereas obese people with low sports activity and non-obese with low or high sports activity showed comparable lower prevalences for most outcomes. We hypothesize that oxidative stress induced by vigorous aerobic as well as anaerobic sports activity is exacerbated in people with obesity, but not in normal weight individuals. Evidence supporting this has been previously published [35] . An imbalanced oxidative stress status may have negative consequences on mounting an appropriate immune response towards respiratory pathogens. Excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) was shown to hinder T cell responses to viral infection [36] and ROS accumulation was detected in autophagy-deficient effector T cells rendering them incapable of controlling viral infections [37] .

A similar surprising result was found when studying the effect modification by dietary patterns. Here we queried the participants' dietary habits and classified them as adhering to a more favourable or more unfavourable dietary pattern according to Winkler et al. [38] . Aware of the limitations of a one-time assessment of a habitual diet, we found a more pronounced relationship between obesity and infections among obese people who reported an apparent healthier diet. Thus, again only the group of obese individuals who presumably eat a healthier diet showed an increased risk of RTIs. The question arises as to whether misreporting of dietary habits among these individuals with and without RTIs may explain the puzzle. One can imagine that obese individuals may have an increased perception of RTI related symptoms experiencing the contradiction between living a healthy lifestyle and being affected by excess weight and frequent infections. On the other hand the inconspicuous results from the non-obese population with respect to favourable and unfavourable diet pattern would somewhat argue against this explanation. Alternatively, among the group of people with obesity a genetically defined subgroup may exist predisposing to both, excess body weight and proneness to infections.

As strengths of our study we count 1) its sample size, allowing for the analysis of effect modification, 2) its prospective design involving 18 months infection diaries for the exploration of the relationship between BMI and subsequent RTI frequency and severity, 3) the comprehensive information on lifestyle and co-morbidities allowing to study the interplay of such factors on their effect on infections, and 4) the wide range of outcome indicators considered. The uniformity of the results with respect to these outcomes also suggests that in the field of airway infection morbidity, studies may be comparable despite the fact that they often concentrate on different RTI outcomes. In line with the majority of epidemiological studies in this area of research, our study suffers from some limitations, including the reliance on self-reported outcomes and exposure data with the risk of misclassification. However, we found -for instance -a good agreement between BMI derived from self-reported weight and height data and BMI calculated from measured values available for a sub-cohort (n = 508). Moreover, differential misclassification which would substantially bias the relationship between obesity and RTIs is rather unexpected in this setting. The disproportional selection of women into the study may negatively impact the generalizability of some of our results.

Estimating the Risks from COVID-19 Infection in Adult Chemotherapy Patients,"The SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) novel corona virus represents a significant health risk, particularly in older patients. Cancer is one of the leading causes of death in most rich countries, and delivering chemotherapy may be associated with increased risk in the presence of a pandemic infection. Estimating this risk is crucial in making decisions about balancing risks and benefits from administering chemotherapy. However, there are no specific data about chemotherapy risks per se. Here we develop a simple model to estimate the potential harms in patients undergoing chemotherapy during a COVID outbreak. We use age-related case fatality rates as a basis for estimating risk, and use previous data from risk of death during influenza outbreaks to estimate the additional risk associated with chemotherapy. We use data from randomised trials to estimate benefit across a range of curative and palliative settings, and address the balance of benefit against the risk of harm. We then use those data to estimate the impact on national chemotherapy delivery patterns.","The world is experiencing an outbreak of a novel coronavirus known as severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2; COVID-19) and WHO has recently declared the disease a pandemic. Although the overall case fatality rate is lower than some other recent respiratory infections, the widespread pattern of infection puts many more people at risk 1 . Patients with cancer are more susceptible to infection than individuals without cancer because of their systemic immunosuppressive state caused by the malignancy and anticancer treatments 2 .

There are not yet any clear models to guide risk predictions in patients infected with COVID-19. One report by the Centres for Disease Control in China provided numbers of patients and fatalities divided by age, and by comorbidities. However, there was no cross-tabulation of factors, and so it is not clear how many patients in each age group had each comorbdity, nor how the risks associated with those co-morbidities interact with each other 3 . There is one small series of 18 patients with cancer, which suggests higher risks of intubation or death, but it is so small it difficult to draw robust conclusions, and the authors' conclusions have been criticised 4 . One other study suggests patients with a history of cancer have a higher risk of becoming infected with COVID. The data from CDC China have been used to simulate a population and then develop a risk model based on that simulated population 5 ; Although a useful step, it almost certainly leads to ""double counting"" of risk (i.e. the increased risk of death in older patients and in those with hypertension is related, as hypertension is commoner in the elderly). Data from patients admitted to hospital show an increased risk of death in older patients 6 .

Previous work in seasonal and pandemic influenza has highlighted that a history of cancer receiving chemotherapy within the last 6 months (ref) or immunosupression (including chemotherapy) 7-10 were all risks for death in patients infected with pandemic influenza. The risk estimates vary considerably, with odds ratios ranging from 3 to 12.

The available data indicates a strong age effect in the risk of death from COVID-19. There is probably an increased risk of death in patients with comorbidities, of which cancer is one. There are several studies indicating an increased risk of death in patients with cancer who are infected during influenza pandemics. There is limited data to suggest that patients who have recently received chemotherapy may be at increased risk of death from influenza infection. There are no good models to estimate the risk of death in patients who have chemotherapy and acquire COVID infection, but there are parameters from previous viral pandemics, all of which point to a higher risk of death in patients with cancer or those who are immunosupressed.

Medical practice does not always require precise estimates of risk. If a decision is binary (i.e. treat/ don't treat) then what we require is an estimate of risk that is good enough to make a decision, rather than being precise.The majority of adult chemotherapy offers modest benefit, particularly in patients with solid tumours. Although there are some diseases where chemotherapy offers very large benefits (e.g. germ cell tumours), the majority of patients derive modest benefit, and in the context of a COVID pandemic, the risks may outweigh the benefits. The immunosuppressive effect of chemotherapy may last for a considerable period of time, exposing patients to risk as infection rates rise. There has been little guidance so far: to date, we are aware only of individual centres publishing general information 11 , and one charity-led initiative in the UK 12 .

In this paper we estimate risks of death in patients who undergo chemotherapy and become infected with COVID. We use that model to illustrate several common chemotherapy scenarios in both adjuvant and palliative scenarios, and provide code online for others to use. We use national chemotherapy data to estimate the number of patients whose treatment might be affected by these decisions.

We used combined data from the China CDC 3 , Italian public health authorities 13 and a COVID outbreak on a cruiseship 14 to estimate case fatality rates (CFR) by age group. We identified studies that estimated risk of harms (including death) in patients with cancer or immunosupression during influenza outbreaks and extracted data on risks of harm. We explored sensitivity by constructing models using central estimates of risk of harm and most optimistic estimates. We constructed clinical scenarios by identifying key clinical trials in the curative and palliative setting in five sentinel tumours sites (breast, lung, colorectal, prostate and brain), and extracted data on absolute benefit from treatment in those trials. For trials in the curative setting, we extracted data on the absolute difference in OS at the timepoint specified by the trial (typically 3 or 5 years). For palliative chemotherapy trials, we extracted data on the difference in absolute survival at 3, 6 and 12 month timepoints. We then compared the improvement in absolute survival from treatment with the potential harm if COVID infected, and visualised these results.

There is a clear impact of age on risk of death (Table 1 ). Data on risk of death with cancer in the context of influenza infection suggests and increased risk in the range of 3 -12 fold. We chose the lowest reported odds ratio (3.67) as our optimistic estimate of risk. Combined with our agebased CFRs, these lead to estimates of risk by age in patients receiving chemotherapy who become COVID infected (Table 2) . We summarise these results in figure 1, highlighting some potential benefit thresholds (3%, 5%, 10%) that are typically seen in adult solid tumour chemotherapy. Of the 9 scenarios, risk of death if COVID infected was higher than expected benefit in six of the seven, balanced in one and favoured chemotherapy in two cases. Readers can explore these data in a small associated program, available at https://gitlab.com/computational.oncology/covidcancerrisk Although the instantaneous risk of COVID infection is small, the risk over the entire duration is likely to be considerable. While we can assume that the risk of infection in patients is the same as the expected population-level infection rate, population level infection may take many months to occur. A more time limited horizon is given by estimating the number of cases of time, and integrating that number.

It is clear that age is a significant risk factor for death in patients infected with COVID-19. In both this and previous viral pandemics, other comorbdities have been additional risk factors. There is reasonable evidence to suggest that patients who have cancer are probably at higher risk of death, and it seems unlikely to administration of chemotherapy will reduce that risk fur-.

Estimated case fatality rates by age group with chemotherapy ther, although providing an exact estimate of risk is difficult, and not yet possible. Due to the epidemic nature of the disease, with exponential growth in cases, while the risks today may seem small, the predicted risks over the next few months are very much higher.

There is consistent evidence to suggest that patients with a history of cancer are at higher risk of adverse outcomes when infected with COVID-19. A study of 138 patients with a baseline risk of ITU admission of 26%, 40% of those with a history of cancer required ITU admission 24 , but included only 10 patients with cancer. A review of 18 cancer patients who developed COVID-19 infection showed a higher risk of harm (defined as requiring ventilation in ITU or death) 7/18 (39%) than the general population 124/1572 (8%). 12 of these 18 were being followed up after surgery, while the 4 who had undergone chemotherapy or surgery within the last month had higher risk still 4 . There is some evidence that patients with cancer might be at higher risk of infection 25 .

It is worth noting that the risks associated with cancer are based on small samples: aside from the two studies above (which included a total of 28 patients with cancer), the original dataset included only 107 patients with cancer. In contrast, the data on increased risk in older patients is much more robust, although the existing models do not adequately distinguish between risk due to age and that due to increased presence of co-morbidities in older patients.

Our model provides two estimates of risk in order to inform decisions. This model is based on the best available data, but is imperfect. We hope that better models will soon be available, but in the meantime oncologists need to make decisions about chemotherapy. Our model only requires oncologists to be able to specify the absolute improvement in overall survival, and then balance that against the predicted risk if the patient becomes COVID-19 infected. Most older adult patients with solid tumours have a level of elevated risk such that, even if we assume lower rates of infection and case fatality rates, the harms are likely to outweigh the benefits for most chemotherapy in most patients. The uncertainty about whether increased risk is due to having .

Scenarios exploring absolute survival benefit and potential risks in a variety of common chemotherapy settings [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] cancer, or receiving chemotherapy is of secondary importance. If it is due to having cancer, then we would suggest that receiving chemotherapy would simple increase in further. We would stress that any additional risk from administering chemotherapy is likely to be a multiplier on the risks seen here; thus small relative risks may translate to large changes in absolute risk for some patients. We have also assumed that both harm and benefits accrue over the same time period, whereas in reality, most improvements in cancer survival with chemotherapy are calculated at 2 and 5 years. For patients undergoing palliative chemotherapy, it is probably more reasonable to assume that the risks and harms accrue over a similar time period; for those having adjuvant treatment, where chemotherapy increases the chance of cure, the benefits may accrue over a much longer time period. In this sense, treatment is more valuable (in that it leads to more years of life) but harm from treatment also weighs more heavily.

Palliative chemotherapy may be given primarily for symptom relief, rather than to improve survival. Nonetheless, the risks of death are still elevated. Although radiotherapy incurs some of the same risks associated with hospital attendance, there are some situations where palliative radiotherapy might be substituted for chemotherapy with a reasonable expectation of it being safer.

Where they have been, it may be worth exploring the incremental benefit in light of the increased risk. At the very least, because informed consent relies in part on understanding the balance between risk and benefit, given that the risk has changed, we would suggest confirming informed consent in patients who are continuing on chemotherapy. Non-cytotoxic agents (e.g. immunotherapy and bisphosphonates) almost certainly have different risk profiles. Nonetheless, there are some common concerns with patients receiving cytotoxic agents, in that they still attend hosptials, and may not be able to access care if services are overwhelmed.

The most striking finding is that under a range of conditions, most cancer patients are at > 5% risk of death if infected with COVID-19. It is notable that the 5% is greater than or equal to the benefit from most adjuvant chemotherapy for adult solid tumours. Although we accept that exact negative impact of COVID-19 in subgroups remains unclear, previous data during outbreaks of seasonal respiratory viral infections suggests that they are associated with an approximate doubling in risk. However, in contrast to outbreaks of seasonal infections, the majority of the population is expected to be infected with COVID-19 over a short-time period (3 -6 months), there is no pre-existing immunity or vaccine, and the case-fatality rate is approximately 5 fold higher. For those reasons, decision-making in seasonal viral outbreaks does not directly transfer to the COVID-19 pandemic. Decisions about initiating or continuing cytotoxic chemotherapy in the context of a COVID pandemic need to be made carefully, and in light of the available data.

Pregnancy and infection: using disease pathogenesis to inform vaccine strategy,"Vaccination is the mainstay of preventative medicine for many infectious diseases. Pregnant women, unborn fetuses, and neonates represent three at-risk populations that can be simultaneously protected by strategic vaccination protocols. Because the pathogenesis of different infectious microbes varies based on tissue tropism, timing of infection, and host susceptibility, the goals of immunization are not uniform across all vaccines. Mechanistic understanding of infectious disease pathogenesis and immune responses is therefore essential to inform vaccine design and the implementation of appropriate immunization protocols that optimize protection of pregnant women, fetuses, and neonates.","Vaccination significantly reduces the health burden of many infectious disease, especially in high-risk populations. Pregnant women, unborn fetuses, and neonates represent three populations of high-risk individuals that can all be simultaneously protected from vaccine-preventable infectious disease with strategic maternal immunization protocols. Infectious microbes that pose significant health risks during pregnancy can be divided into three broad categories, based on the pathogenesis and disease outcome (Fig. 1) , with some microbes falling within more than one category. First are maternal infections, which are defined by heightened disease severity in pregnant females, but with rare or inconsequential transmission and disease in the fetus. Second are fetal or congenital infections, which are characterized by mild or no disease in pregnant females, but occasional vertical transmission and severe congenital disease in the fetus. Third are neonatal and infant infections, which are not considered to pose significant risk to pregnant women or unborn fetuses, but can cause severe, and sometimes fatal disease in neonates and infants that lack protective maternal immunity following birth.

The vaccination strategies employed differ for micobes within each of these categories and vary based on the at-risk individual (i.e., mother, fetus, and/or neonate/infant), the timing of the greatest risk of infection (i.e., early pregnancy, late pregnancy, or post-natal), and on the duration of protective immunity following vaccination. In this review, we discuss evidence to suggest that immunization strategies for pregnant women should be tailored to optimize protection for the mother, fetus, neonate, infant, or all individuals. We review vaccine-preventable infections during pregnancy and the current vaccination strategies employed to reduce the burden of infectious diseases, including influenza. Further, we examine novel vaccine platforms and consider how their application may provide safe alternatives for enhancing protection of pregnant women. Finally, we discuss vaccine development and prevention strategies for combatting emerging infectious diseases, including Zika, that pose a threat to pregnant women and their fetuses.

Owing to physiologic and immunologic changes that support pregnancy and tolerance of a semi-allogenic fetus, 1 pregnant women demonstrate increased susceptibility to certain infectious agents including hepatitis E, varicella zoster, and influenza viruses. Infection with these viruses during pregnancy results in severe maternal disease, increased maternal mortality and associated pregnancy complications, which are observed most frequently during the third trimester and peripartum period. For example, the case fatality rate among pregnant women infected with hepatitis E virus is estimated to be 5-25%, 2,3 compared with 1-3% in the general population. 4 Approximately 28% of cases of varicella pneumonia in adults reported from 1965-1989 were from pregnant women 5 ; and pregnant women infected with the pandemic 2009 H1N1 influenza A virus (IAV) were reportedly 4 times more likely to be hospitalized or die than the general population. 6 Overall, vertical transmission of these viruses is relatively uncommon, but adverse pregnancy outcomes, including spontaneous abortion and pre-term birth can still occur as an indirect consequence of maternal inflammation. 7, 8 Reports during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic in Australia and New Zealand indicated that among pregnant women who were hospitalized with suspected H1N1 IAV infection, 50% of their infants required intensive care, and 10% were either stillborn or died shortly after birth; only 2 infants, however, had detectable 2009 H1N1 infection. 9 The primary goal of vaccination strategies for protecting against maternal infections is the generation of protective maternal immunity either prior to or during early pregnancy. Optimally, vaccination should prevent or reduce disease by inducing sterilizing immunity (i.e., immunity that completely prevents infection). Despite reported reductions in antiviral proteins during pregnancy, 10 studies comparing vaccine responses between pregnant and nonpregnant women find no difference in either the magnitude or duration of antibody responses against influenza A viruses. [11] [12] [13] In fact, surveillance data from Taiwan reveal that influenza vaccination during pregnancy results in higher levels of seroprotection than does vaccination prior to conception, 14 with no effect of gestational age on vaccineinduced antibody responses. 15 As of 2004, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) categorizes pregnant women as a target population for receiving the inactivated influenza vaccine and recommends that pregnant women be immunized during any trimester. 16 Several studies evaluating adverse vaccine reactions in pregnant women have concluded that there is no link between pregnancy complications or adverse fetal outcomes among women who are vaccinated during pregnancy. [17] [18] [19] [20] Although the live attenuated intranasal influenza vaccine is not recommended for pregnant women, accidental administration during pregnancy was not associated with an increased risk of adverse reactions. 17, 21 Despite the plethora of data that support the benefits and safety of influenza vaccination during pregnancy, coverage remains low, with a less than 50% maternal vaccination rate during the 2010-2011 influenza season in the United States. 22 Misconceptions about the safety and benefits of influenza vaccination represent the largest barriers to vaccine acceptance among pregnant women. 23 Varicella zoster virus (VZV) is another vaccine-preventable infection associated with increased severity during pregnancy. 24 VZV is an alpha herpes virus and the causative agent of varicella or chickenpox. In temperate climates, seroprevalence among individuals over 30 years of age is estimated to be 95%, with almost 90% of infections occurring prior to 15 years of age. 25 The first modified-live vaccine against varicella zoster virus was licensed in the United States in 1995, and is now recommended for children over 12 months of age. 26 Primary VZV infection during pregnancy is therefore uncommon, as most women of childbearing age have been either infected or immunized. In women who have not been previously exposed, however, primary VZV infection between weeks 8 through 26 of gestation is associated with a 2% risk of congenital transmission and disease in the offspring. 27 Because all licensed VZV vaccines contain live-attenuated virus, their use during pregnancy is contraindicated. Instead, the CDC recommends that nonpregnant women of childbearing age be vaccinated against VZV at least one month prior to conception. 26 As a herpes virus, infection with VZV is life-long, and reactivation occurs in approximately 10-30% of individuals, which results in a painful skin condition known as shingles or herpes zoster. 28 Reactivated VZV, however, is not associated with increased disease severity or congenital infection during pregnancy. 24 Acute viral hepatitis caused by hepatitis E virus (HEV) is an emerging infectious disease that causes severe disease in pregnant women, with a fatality rate of up to 30% in endemic regions. 29 In addition to heightened maternal disease severity, HEV infection during pregnancy is associated with increased rates of premature birth and prenatal mortality. 30 Although vertical HEV transmission rates are high, with estimates between 23-50%, 31 the relative contributions of fetal HEV infection to adverse perinatal outcomes is unclear. 32 A recombinant HEV subunit vaccine has been developed and proven safe and effective following completion of Phase II and III clinical trials, 33 but commercial use is currently limited to China. Furthermore, the vaccine is not approved for use in pregnant women despite being 100% efficacious in participants receiving all three doses. 34 Additional HEV vaccine candidates are being tested in preclinical pregnant animal models, and one recombinant HEV vaccine has been shown to be safe and highly immunogenic in pregnant mice. 35 Additional studies in a susceptible animal model are needed to confirm efficacy following virus challenge.

Developing fetuses are extremely vulnerable to both infectious and noninfectious insults. Certain infectious agents that are often clinically silent in healthy adults can cause severe birth defects if Fig. 1 Infectious microbes that cause maternal, congenital, or postnatal complications. The infectious microbes are categorized according to the mechanism of transmission and disease, and the population at greatest risk for severe outcome during or after pregnancy. Infection with some pathogens (e.g., SARS coronavirus, hepatitis E virus, and Ebola virus) during pregnancy cause severe disease in pregnant women, but are not transmitted to offspring. Other infectious microbes (e.g., Toxoplasma gondii, rubella virus, parvovirus B19, cytomegalovirus, and Zika viruses) infect and cause mild or asymptomatic disease in pregnant females, but can be vertically transmitted to the fetus and congenital complications. Another category of microbes (e.g., Bordetella pertussis, Clostridium tetani, and respiratory syncytial virus) pose the largest risk to neonates after birth. Many infectious microbes (e.g., Listeria monocytogenes, Plasmodium spp., HIV, VZV, influenza viruses, Chlamydia trachomatis, GBS, Treponema pallidum, and herpes viruses) may cause overlapping syndromes depending on the timing of infection during pregnancy. Understanding the pathogenesis of infectious diseases during pregnancy should inform vaccine design and the implementation of appropriate immunization protocols that optimize protection of pregnant women, fetuses and neonates they breach the placental barrier during critical developmental periods during pregnancy. An increasing number of pathogens are being recognized for causing congenital disease, and what was originally designated as the TORCH complex (Toxoplasma gondii, ""other,"" Rubella virus, Cytomegalovirus, and Herpes Simplex virus) is now expanded to include other infectious agents including Zika virus. Development of congenital disease can depend on the timing of infection during gestation, the infectious burden, and the pathogenesis in the fetus. The congenital syndrome for each pathogen is characterized by a variety of different developmental abnormalities, and commonly impact hearing, vision, and central nervous system function. 36 For many congenital infections, the timing of infection during gestation determines the relative risk to the fetus and dictates the spectrum of disease that results. For example, while infection with rubella virus during the first 9 weeks of gestation is associated with an 85% risk of congenital rubella syndrome (CRS), this is reduced to a 52% risk between 9-12 weeks, and minimal risk for infections occurring after 16 weeks of gestation. 37 In contrast, the risk of congenital toxoplasmosis has been demonstrated to be highest during third trimester pregnancy, which is hypothesized to be due to differential expression of placental toll-like receptors, including TLR6, within first compared with third trimester trophoblast cells. 38 Similarly, maternal infection with Listeria monocytogenes is typically associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes during the third trimester, 39 though infection during the first trimester in nonhuman primates also leads to rapid fetal demise. 40 The primary goal of vaccination strategies for protecting against fetal infections is generation of protective maternal immunity prior to pregnancy. Because congenital infections can occur in the absence of maternal symptoms, vaccines against congenital agents should ideally provide complete sterilizing immunity. Rubella is included in a live-attenuated combination vaccine for measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR), which confers lifelong protective immunity. 41 Because of the long duration of protective immunity following rubella vaccination, target populations include children and adolescent girls. However, incomplete vaccination coverage can lead to paradoxical increases in CRS due to an increase in the average age of infection, 42 and so it is also recommended that unvaccinated women of childbearing age be counseled to receive the rubella vaccine at least one month prior to conception. 43 The implementation of large-scale rubella vaccination programs has resulted in sufficient population-level immunity, significant reductions in CRS, 44 and elimination of rubella virus from several developed countries, including the United States. 45 Following successful implementation of MMR vaccination programs, cytomegalovirus (CMV) has emerged as the most common congenital viral infection in the developed world. 46 The incidence of congenital CMV varies based on geographic region and socioeconomic status, but overall birth prevalence is estimated to be 0.64%, which is similar to the incidence of Down syndrome and fetal alcohol syndrome. 47 In contrast to rubella virus, however, there is currently no licensed vaccine available for CMV, and with seroprevalence approaching 100% in some developing countries, 48 vaccine development has been identified as a priority public healthcare goal. 49, 50 While CMV infection of healthy adults is usually asymptomatic, adaptive immune responses are insufficient to clear the infection, which results in lifelong latent infection of myeloid precursor cells. 51 Although latent or reactivated CMV is less likely to cause congenital infection than a primary CMV infection during pregnancy, 52,53 preconception immunity does not completely eliminate transplacental transmission and congenital disease. Moreover, pregnant women with latent CMV infection are still susceptible to primary infection with different CMV strains, which have been shown to have distinct virulence patterns. 54, 55 Overcoming the challenges associated with latent infections and strain variability are significant hurdles in the development of an effective CMV vaccine, and despite significant advances in our knowledge of CMV pathogenesis, the precise immune targets that constitute fetal protection remain unknown. Of the several CMV vaccine candidates that have been tested, none have provided complete protection against infection, and all have failed to protect against reactivation of latent CMV. 56 More research on the pathogenesis CMV infection is needed to define immunological correlates of protection against CMV transmission during pregnancy to inform vaccine development.

Although not associated with congenital disease, hepatitis B virus (HBV) is another vaccine-preventable infection that can cross the placenta during pregnancy. Mother-to-child-transmission remains the most common route of infection in endemic regions, 57 and women with active viral replication have up to a 90% chance of vertical transmission. 58 Of those that are infected perinatally, up to 90% develop chronic HBV infection. 57 Since the initial recommendation of routine HBV vaccination of children in 1991, the rate of new HBV infections has significantly declined in the United States, but chronic HBV remains prevalent in sub-Saharan Africa and East Asia. Although combined passive and active immunoprophylaxis of infants has significantly reduced perinatal HBV infection, perinatal transmission occurs in up to 20% of infected mothers. 59 To augment neonatal prophylactic strategies, the CDC ACIP recommends that pregnant women who are identified as being at risk for HBV infection be vaccinated with the recombinant HBV vaccine. 60 Immunity following receipt of the HBV vaccine is long-lived, with anti-HBV antibodies persisting in most adults for at least 20 years. 61 Because of the long-term protection conferred by the HBV vaccine, immunization is not necessary for pregnant women who have already been vaccinated and are at low risk of infection. 60 

Owing to the limited exposure to foreign antigen and blunted innate immune responses in utero, the neonatal immune system is immature at birth, making neonates (i.e., less than one month of age) particularly susceptible infections. 62 Infectious diseases are responsible for over 60% of child mortality, and over 40% of these deaths occur within one month of age. 63 During the neonatal period of immune system maturation, protection against pathogens relies primarily on passive immunity from maternal-derived IgG antibodies. In humans, most maternal antibodies are transferred into the fetal circulation through the placenta prior to birth, which contrasts with most veterinary species, in which maternal antibody is transferred via colostrum immediately following birth. Regardless of species, vaccination during pregnancy increases circulating maternal antibodies and enhances transfer to the fetus/neonate. 14 The goal of vaccination strategies for protecting against neonatal infections is generation of robust maternal antibody responses during pregnancy to enhance placental transfer. Further, because neonatal protection is exclusively conferred by maternal-derived antibody, vaccines aimed at protecting infants should prioritize induction of humoral over cellular immune responses, with the induction of IgG1 being most important because this IgG isotype is associated with the highest placental transport efficiency in females. 64 Moreover, the kinetics of maternal vaccine-induced antibody response, the efficiency of placental antibody transfer, and the half-life of the antibody in the neonate should inform the optimal timing of vaccination during pregnancy. Because the peak antibody response is typically observed 1-3 weeks following immunization, vaccination during pregnancy as opposed to before conception is likely to result in the greatest benefit to the neonate. Further, the efficiency of placental antibody transfer in females increases throughout gestation, with less than 8% maternal IgG transferred to the fetus in the first 16 weeks of gestation, 65 significantly more transferred during the second and third trimesters, and at delivery fetal IgG often exceeds maternal levels. 66 Vaccination of females during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy is most likely to generate the greatest level of protection in the neonate, but the precise timing for maximum protection is debated. Controversy over the timing of pertussis vaccination in pregnancy has been reviewed elsewhere, 67 with some reports claiming peak cord blood antibody concentrations following vaccination in the second trimester, and others reporting peak antibody concentrations following vaccination in the third trimester. Antibody avidity also influences the efficiency of placental transfer, with higher avidity antibodies crossing the placenta with greater efficiently than low avidity antibodies. 68 More consideration should be given to the development of high avidity antibodies in the timing of vaccination during pregnancy, as protective immunity in the infant depends on both the concentration and avidity of the maternal-derived antibody.

The half-life of maternal antibodies in infants also must be considered in vaccine development and administration. Maternalderived IgG1 is reported to have a half-life of approximately 48 days in serum, 69 and depending on serum antibody titers present at birth, this translates into protective immunity for approximately the first 3-9 months of life for most infant pathogens. 70 The half-life of the antibody also dictates the vaccination schedules for infants, as the presence of maternalderived antibody interferes with vaccine efficacy, and it is not until maternal-derived antibody has waned below a certain threshold that an infant can mount its own active vaccine response. The goal of the infant vaccine series is to time vaccination to coincide with the time that maternal-derived antibody drops below the threshold at which it can neutralize the vaccine antigen. Because the precise timing of these events is unpredictable, infant vaccination schedules are designed so that vaccines are administered in a series that spans the duration of this window, and minimize susceptibility to natural infection. In the United States, infant vaccines are recommended at 2, 4 and 6 months of age. 41 Bordetella pertussis is a vaccine-preventable respiratory pathogen of significant public health importance, and it is a major cause of mortality in infants lacking protective maternal immunity. Vaccination of women during pregnancy, however, significantly enhances the transfer of maternal antibody to the fetus, 71,72 and these newborns are 11 times more likely to have protective antibody titers at birth compared with those born from women who were not vaccinated during pregnancy. 71 Inactivated pertussis antigen is combined with tetanus and diphtheria toxoids in a single vaccine (Tdap), which the CDC ACIP recommends for all pregnant women, regardless of previous vaccine history. 73 In contrast to vaccine formulations that contain killed whole B. pertussis organisms, the Tdap vaccine contains only select antigens and confers relatively weak and only transient protective immunity that declines after 1 year. 74 Vaccination of women either prior to conception or during early pregnancy does not provide adequate neonatal protection against pertussis. 75 Consequently, the CDC considers the third trimester to be the optimal time to administer the Tdap vaccine to pregnant women. 73 Adverse events reported following Tdap vaccination are generally mild, and there are no reported risks of adverse pregnancy outcomes related to Tdap vaccination during pregnancy. 76 Despite consistent evidence that supports the benefit and safety of Tdap vaccination during pregnancy, coverage remains low, with an estimated 42% of pregnant women receiving the Tdap vaccine in the United States in 2013. 77 Receipt of the Tdap vaccine during pregnancy also confers protection against neonatal tetanus, which is associated with case fatality approaching 100% in the absence of medical care. 78 Disease is caused by the toxin produced by Clostridium tetani, and infection occurs most commonly due to contamination of the umbilical stump following delivery. Consequently, the incidence of disease is much greater in developing countries, where maternal vaccination is scarce and perinatal hygiene practices are poor. 79 In 1989, the World Health Assembly called for the elimination of neonatal tetanus, which has inspired an initiative to improve vaccination coverage and birth hygiene in 59 countries with high disease prevalence. As part of this initiative, immunization standards have been expanded and recommend that pregnant women with unknown or inadequate vaccination history receive two doses of the toxoid-containing vaccine, administered one month apart. 80 Maternal anti-tetanus antibodies are passively transferred to the fetus, and it is estimated that maternal immunization reduces neonatal tetanus mortality by 94%. 81 Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most common respiratory viral pathogen of newborns and infants, and accounts for 50-90% of acute bronchiolitis and 5-20% of pneumonia cases in hospitalized children less than 2 years of age. 82 RSV is also reported to cause severe disease and hospitalization in pregnant women when infection occurs during the third trimester, 83, 84 and therefore dually qualifies as a maternal infection as well. A licensed vaccine against RSV is currently unavailable, but several vaccine candidates have shown promise in various animal models. [85] [86] [87] [88] Given the importance of this pathogen during early life, vaccine development strategies have focused on maternal immunization, with three maternal vaccines currently in clinical trials. 89 Maternal vaccination against RSV has direct and indirect benefits to the neonate; neonates are directly protected through passive transfer of maternal antibody through the placenta, and they are indirectly protected because a vaccinated mother is less likely to transmit the infection to her infant. 90 

Vaccination of pregnant women is controversial, and immunization with live (i.e., replication-competent) viral or bacterial vaccines is generally contraindicated due to the theoretical risk of congenital infection and teratogenic effects from the vaccine strains. However, in a report of over 2000 pregnant women who were unknowingly immunized with live attenuated rubella vaccine, there were no cases of vaccine-associated congenital rubella infection, 91 and live virus strains of influenza or yellow fever viruses administered to pregnant women also have no link with pregnancy complications. 21, 92 Vaccination with inactivated vaccines such as influenza and Tdap during pregnancy have low uptake, with concerns of safety among both patients and their healthcare providers being a primary barrier. The safety of vaccine adjuvants is debated, and although neither the Tdap nor seasonal influenza vaccine recommended during pregnancy contain adjuvants, retrospective studies evaluating safety of the adjuvanted pandemic H1N1 influenza vaccine in pregnant women found no relationship with adverse pregnancy outcomes. 93 The conservative approach to vaccination protocols for pregnant women stems from the lack of controlled safety and efficacy studies for this population. For ethical reasons, pregnant women are exempted from almost all clinical and vaccine trials, and heath care providers are less likely to endorse prophylactic treatments for which safety and efficacy profiles have not been adequately characterized.

Whereas study in pregnant women is not possible, pre-clinical testing in animal models may provide a useful alternative, and vaccine preclinical trials in pregnant animal models may provide information to inform healthcare policies for pregnant women. Although there are some differences in the length of gestation, placental structure, and fetal development between humans and animal models, many structural and functional parallels exist, [94] [95] [96] which serve as tractable platforms for evaluating the safety and efficacy of various therapies during pregnancy. Similar to humans, pregnant mice, rats, and rabbits have a hemochorial placenta, and their relatively short gestation and large litters are advantageous for performing high throughput screening of candidate therapeutics for safety and efficacy. Preclinical behavioral testing of rodent offspring has proven to be a promising avenue for identifying and predicting adverse effects associated with prenatal drug exposure in children. 97 Both rodent and rabbit models have been instrumental in testing teratogenic effects of artemisinin-based combination therapies for treating malaria in pregnant women. These studies concluded that drug-related teratogenic effects are limited to the first trimester, which supports the World Health Organization (WHO) recommendation that artemisinin may be administered only during the second or third trimester in pregnant women. 98, 99 One limitation of mouse and rat models, however, is their inability to recapitulate certain elements of human congenital disease. For instance, because murine CMV is not transmitted vertically as it is in humans, other animal models, including guinea pigs and nonhuman primates, are required for studying this aspect of disease pathogenesis. Studies in pregnant nonhuman primates have been instrumental for the identification of CD4 + T cell responses as critical for early control of CMV infection and transmission during pregnancy, 100 and studies in guinea pigs have demonstrated that a single-cycle infectious CMV vaccine induces immune responses similar to natural infection and protects against congenital infection. 101 Guinea pigs are also a useful model of chlamydial genital infection in humans. Experimental venereal infection with Chlamydophila caviae mimics disease associated with C. trachomatis in humans, including both sexual and perinatal transmission. Guinea pigs have therefore served as a useful model for testing candidate vaccines and treatments. 102 Rabbits continue to serve as an important model of venereal infection with Treponema pallidum, the causative agent of syphilis, which is associated with congenital disease in humans. While natural infection in rabbits is associated with the species-specific T. paraluiscanuculi, rabbits can be experimentally inoculated with human T. pallidum, and have been instrumental in testing the efficacy of candidate vaccines. 103 Many mammalian species, including rodents, 104 ruminants, 105 and nonhuman primates, 40, 106 are susceptible to infection with Listeria monocytogenes and demonstrate similar fetal complications when infection occurs during pregnancy. Studies in various animal models have uniquely contributed to our understanding of placental listeriosis and serve as a platform for evaluating prevention strategies. 107, 108 Finally, mice, 85 cotton rats, 86 guinea pigs, 88 and sheep 87 are all susceptible to infection with RSV, and vaccination of pregnant animals has facilitated the development and testing of maternal immunization strategies for protecting against neonatal RSV. Based on preliminary studies in guinea pigs, 88 an experimental RSV recombinant F nanoparticle vaccine is now being evaluated in third-trimester pregnant women (Clintrials.gov, NCT02247726).

Beyond the direct modeling of human congenital infection in animals, information can also be gained from the study of related veterinary pathogens. For example, bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) is an important reproductive pathogen that infects cattle worldwide, and infection during pregnancy causes congenital infection and disease. Persistently infected animals serve as reservoirs within a herd and can have a huge agricultural financial impact. 109 As a result, significant resources have been dedicated to the development and optimization of BVDV vaccines and vaccine protocols, considering variables such as the type and timing of vaccination on immune response and protection against challenge. 110 The information gleaned from these studies may inform vaccine development and optimization protocols for related pathogens in pregnant women, for which similar studies cannot ethically be performed.

Zika virus (ZIKV) is a unique Flavivirus that causes mild or subclinical disease in pregnant women, 111, 112 but can have devastating effects for the fetus and neonate. Infection during pregnancy is linked with spontaneous abortion and a variety of birth defects, including microcephaly and impaired neurocognitive function. 113 Since its initial discovery in African macaques in 1947, ZIKV has expanded its geographical range and evolved into separate virus lineages, with environmental pressures resulting in the emergence of virulent substrains, raising concerns about vaccine escape mutants once a vaccine is approved. 114 The combination of its unique pathogenesis, diverse modes of transmission, and rapid global spread has increased efforts toward development and licensing of a ZIKV vaccine.

A basic understanding of ZIKV biology and pathogenesis is essential for development of an effective vaccine against ZIKV. Although we can extrapolate some biological information from related Flaviviruses, such as yellow fever, West Nile, and dengue viruses, ZIKV has unique characteristics following in vivo infection, which pose significant challenges to vaccine design. Unlike other Flaviviruses, ZIKV has a tropism for reproductive tissues, including the testes, semen, and sperm in males 115, 116 and the placenta in pregnant females, [117] [118] [119] which is hypothesized to contribute to sexual and vertical modes of transmission, respectively. In addition to unique tissue tropisms, ZIKV persists in reproductive tissue following clearance of systemic viremia. In males, ZIKV RNA can be detected for months following recovery from symptomatic infection, 120, 121 and virus persistence in the placenta of pregnant women is hypothesized to contribute to prolonged viremia in this population. 122 Evidence of virus persistence suggests that ZIKV may have evolved mechanisms for evasion of host immune responses when infection occurs in certain immune-privileged tissues. Scenarios involving persistent ZIKV infections should be considered in developing and testing candidate vaccines. Considering the potential for viral persistence in the semen, vaccinating men may serve as an additional strategy to reduce transmission to the fetus, as pregnant women may be infected by their sex partners.

Characterization of the immune response to ZIKV infection is essential for determining correlates of protection for vaccine efficacy. Following infection of both humans and nonhuman animals, ZIKV induces neutralizing antibodies against the ZIKV E protein, which prevent fetal infection and demise when administered to pregnant mice. 123 Further, 26 MHC Class I epitopes have been identified that conferred protection against ZIKV challenge in immunocompetent mice. 124 To date, 45 candidate ZIKV vaccines have been developed, and as of February 2017, nine have entered Phase I clinical trials. 125 Vaccine candidates have been developed using diverse platforms, including DNA, mRNA, and purified inactivated and live-attenuated virus, many of which have been tested in non-pregnant mouse and nonhuman primate models for their ability to generate immune responses that mimic responses to natural infection and protected against ZIKV challenge. A candidate DNA plasmid vaccine induced robust cellular immunity and neutralizing antibody responses in both nonhuman primates and immunocompetent mice, and conferred complete protection against lethal ZIKV challenge in type I interferon receptor deficient (IFNAR −/−) mice. 126 LNP-mRNA vaccines induced similar protective immunity, which was characterized by high neutralizing antibody titers and sterilizing immunity against ZIKV challenge in non-pregnant mice and nonhuman primates. 127, 128 Whether these candidate vaccines induce protective immunity in pregnant females that is sufficient to prevent fetal and neonatal infections 117 requires further evaluation. Also, whether pre-existing immunity to other Flaviviruses that co-circulate with ZIKV, including dengue virus and West Nile virus, affects the efficacy of ZIKV vaccines in pregnant females should be considered in both preclinical animal models and human clinical trials.

Conventional vaccines are formulated from either live, attenuated pathogen strains or from inactivated pathogens, but there are notable disadvantages to each of these platforms. Live, attenuated vaccines are replication-competent with the potential of becoming virulent and causing adverse effects in individuals with weakened immune systems. Due to the unknown risk to the developing fetus, live virus vaccines are not recommended for use in pregnant women. Inactivated vaccines, on the other hand, are not associated with a risk of reacquisition of virulence, but they tend to induce a weaker host immune response. 129 Efforts to balance safety with immunogenicity have led to the development of several novel vaccine technologies, including replicationdeficient nanoparticle-based vaccines and self-assembling recombinant virus-like particles (VLPs), replication-competent recombinant viral vectors, and single-cycle infectious viruses that can infect, but not replicate in host cells. Nanoparticle delivery platforms, including liposomes and synthetic polymers, can be engineered to enhance selective tissue homing for high potency, targeted delivery of antigen in its native conformation. 130 Recombinant VLPs combine highly immunogenic surface viral proteins with encapsulated adjuvants that are devoid of infectious nucleic acid, but induce strong cellular and humoral immune responses. 131 Both nanoparticle and VLP vaccines are devoid of genetic material and are therefore replication incompetent, enhancing safety in vulnerable individuals. Although current production yields and costs associated with these technologies may prohibit large-scale use, these platforms may be well-suited for targeted use in high-risk populations, including pregnant women. Since the first nanoparticle-based vaccine was licensed for hepatitis B virus in 1981, the technology has been applied to develop licensed vaccines against human papilloma virus, hepatitis E virus, and malaria. 131 Demonstration of safety and efficacy during pregnancy has not yet been documented.

Recombinant viruses can be engineered to combine the antigenic genes of one virus with the structural genes of another. This targeted manipulation of the virus genome is used to remove virulence genes to enhance safety and alter envelope proteins to change cell tropism. Recombinant viruses can be engineered to retain the ability to infect and replicate in the host, while preserving infectious potential and enhancing the generation of innate and adaptive immune responses that mimic natural infection. Recombinant virus vaccines, however, warrant careful consideration of the safety of the vector itself, especially in pregnant women. Once the safety and efficacy profiles of a viral vector platform have been established, engineering new antigenic targets into the viral genome are relatively simple, and do not require extensive re-validation, as safety and efficacy is most influenced by the vector virus. This can significantly reduce the time to develop and manufacture vaccines against new viral pathogens. 132 Viruses from many different families can be used as vectors provided they can infect the host and elicit a productive immune response without causing disease. Of note, poxviruses are practical vectors due to ease of growth and manipulation in vitro, wide host range, and robust induction of protective immune responses. Although vaccinia virus vectors are contraindicated during pregnancy due to risk of disseminated disease, recent testing of a raccoonpoxvirus-vectored rabies vaccine in pregnant mice proved safe and effective. 133 Other novel vaccine platforms are based on genetic engineering and creation of targeted loss-of-function mutations in the viral genome. Reverse genetics technology has contributed the identification of the sequences within the viral genomes that are essential for infection and replication in vivo. It is now possible to engineer recombinant virus vaccines with targeted mutations in a cost-and time-efficient manner. In contrast to inactivated vaccines, reverse genetics allows for controlled manipulation of the viral genome that targets a specific process in the virus life cycle. This enables production of a vaccine strain with maximum efficacy and safety, and represents another promising alternative to conventional attenuated or killed virus vaccines. Among the safest recombinant vaccine approaches are the single-cycle infectious (sci) viruses, which have been developed from influenza A virus (IAV) backbones by deleting or truncating viral proteins necessary for completion of the virus life cycle within the host. 134 Such genetic modifications render the virus replication-incompetent, but capable of infecting and inducing an immune response in the host. 135 The infectious capacity of sciIAV vaccines results in strong cellular and humoral immune responses, without the risks and adverse effects associated with live-attenuated vaccine strains. Studies in nonpregnant mice have demonstrated that a single dose of sciIAV vaccine confers protection against heterosubtypic lethal challenge without any adverse effects. [136] [137] [138] [139] [140] [141] Similar safety and efficacy profiles of sciIAV have been replicated in ferret and pig models, 136, 142 but studies in pregnant animals have not been performed. Compared with the risks associated with live virus vaccination and concerns of efficacy with inactivated vaccines, novel vaccine platforms, such as nanoparticle-based technologies, VLPs and replication-deficient viruses have proven benefits. 130 Additional safety and efficacy studies in pregnancy models are warranted to validate and expand the use of these vaccine platforms for pregnant women. (Table 1) CONCLUSIONS Strategic immunization of women, either prior to or during pregnancy, can eliminate or substantially reduce the risk of maternal, fetal, and neonatal infection and disease. The effectiveness of an immunization protocol depends on both the efficacy of the vaccine in inducing protective immune responses and on the timing of vaccine delivery during pregnancy to synchronize the peak vaccine response with the period of greatest susceptibility in the host. Optimization of vaccination protocols to achieve this goal requires an understanding of the mechanisms of infection and pathogenesis of disease during pregnancy. Successful implementation of vaccine protocols for pregnant women requires consideration of additional challenges, such as the frequency of unplanned pregnancies and access to prenatal health care. Human surveillance data provide correlative clues of the character of specific infections, but mechanistic understanding requires additional study in comparative animal model systems.

"Comparing Human Metapneumovirus and Respiratory Syncytial Virus: Viral Co- Detections, Genotypes and Risk Factors for Severe Disease","It is unclarified as to whether viral co-detection and human metapneumovirus (HMPV) genotypes relate to clinical manifestations in children with HMPV and lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI), and if the clinical course and risk factors for severe LRTI differ between HMPV and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV).","hospital provides care for 58,000 children younger than 16 years and 18,000 children younger than five years of age from Sør-Trøndelag County in Mid-Norway (Statistics Norway). Written informed consent to participate was collected from children !12 years and caregivers to most of the children during the hospital stay. However, due to practical challenges, including dealing with children 24 hours a day, we also enrolled some children after hospital discharge. Their caregivers received written information per regular mail, and the child was included if the caregivers did not resist enrollment by contacting the hospital within two weeks. The latter inclusion method was also approved by the Regional Committee for Medical and Health Research Ethics. Some children were included more than one time if they were hospitalized with distinct RTI episodes, whereas recurrent hospitalizations due to the same RTI were only registered once. Exclusion criteria were children evaluated for RTI who were hospitalized mainly due to other diseases, such as newborns not dismissed from the hospital, children with cytostatic or immune-suppressive treatment, and children with other infections such as gastroenteritis and urinary tract infection. We systematically collected baseline characteristics and past and current medical history from caregivers, who filled out a questionnaire, while clinical information was abstracted from medical records. Characteristics included gestational age at birth, age, gender, siblings, day care attendance and chronic diseases. Preterm birth was defined as a gestational age <36 weeks of gestation, and age was categorized according to clinically relevant groups. Chronic airway diseases, other than asthma, included bronchopulmonary dysplasia, congenital airway malformations, cystic fibrosis and neuromuscular disorders with hypoventilation in need of respiratory support and daily inhalations for mucus clearance. Tachypnea was defined as a !10 increase in normal respiratory rate according to the child's age [34] . Several children had more than one chronic disease, i.e. both asthma and other chronic airway disease, or both cerebral palsy and epilepsy. Hence, for the logistic regression analyses, we used a combined binary variable: ""!1 chronic disease"" (coded: no chronic disease or !1 chronic disease). Nasopharyngeal aspirates were collected within 24 hours of presentation in the vast majority of the children. Children with a stay <24 hours were categorized as outpatients, while children who stayed !24 hours and were admitted to the wards of the Pediatric Department, were categorized as inpatients. From the main cohort of children with acute RTI, we selectively included HMPV-and RSV-infected children hospitalized with LRTI into the present study (Fig 1) . Consequently, outpatients, children admitted with isolated upper RTI (URTI) and children admitted with LRTI and viruses other than HMPV or RSV, and virus negatives, were excluded (Fig 1) . The Regional Committee for Medical and Health Research Ethics approved the study.

All children were routinely treated at the discretion of the medical doctors at the Department of Pediatrics. Children with one or more characteristic manifestations of rhino-pharyngitis, tonsillitis, conjunctivitis, otitis media or acute laryngitis were diagnosed with URTI. LRTI was categorized into five categories based on clinical manifestations and radiological findings: 1) Bronchiolitis: age <24.0 months old, tachypnea or signs of lower airways obstruction and a normal radiogram or a radiogram with air trapping/hyperinflation, perihilar infiltrates and/or atelectasis, 2) Obstructive bronchitis: age !24.0 months old, signs of lower airway obstruction and a normal radiogram or a radiogram with air trapping/hyperinflation, perihilar infiltrates and/or atelectasis, 3) Pneumonia: presence of dyspnea with or without auscultatory findings such as muffled respiratory sounds and a radiogram with localized or lobular infiltrates, or pleural effusion, 4) Asthma exacerbation: signs of lower airway obstruction and either a current asthma diagnosis or two or more previous episodes with lower airway obstruction during the previous year, or one or more episodes of lower airway obstruction and atopic status (eczema, allergy), and 5) Unspecified LRTI: cough or other signs of LRTI without signs of lower airway obstruction, with or without auscultatory findings and a normal radiogram or radiogram with perihilar infiltrates and/or atelectasis. Some asthmatic children who developed symptoms and signs of pneumonia were categorized with pneumonia.

Respiratory support (RS) with a non-invasive ventilator (NIV) included positive airway pressure via mask in continuous or bi-level modes, or via a high-flow nasal cannula. Prior to 2011, all children in need of NIV were admitted to the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU). During 2011, respiratory support with high-flow nasal cannula was introduced at the wards, which reduced the need for PICU admissions. Invasive ventilator (IV) support was defined as RS applied by endotracheal tube or tracheostomy, and children with acute respiratory failure in need of IV were admitted to the PICU. Initiation of any RS, or an increase in baseline RS for those with chronic RS, were defined as RS related to the acute RTI. To adjust for our new practice performing NIV treatment at the wards, we defined a disease severity score reflecting disease severity independently of treatment location. This score, ranging from 0 to 4 points, was defined as the sum of: 1) a need for oxygen to maintain oxygen saturation !93% (1 point); 2) length of stay !6 days, corresponding to or above the 75 percentile limit for all hospitalized children with LRTI (1 point); 3) a need for respiratory support with NIV (1 point); 4) a need for respiratory support with both NIV and IV (2 points); and 5) need of IV support (2 points). In addition, admission to the PICU, was reported as a disease severity measure. Severe disease was defined as a disease severity score !2 points, corresponding to-or above the 75% percentile limit among all hospitalized children with LRTI.

Nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPA) were collected and placed into a standard virus transport medium without antibiotics, and analyzed at the Department of Medical Microbiology, St. Olavs Hospital. The detection of respiratory pathogens was done using in-house TaqMan real-time PCR assays, and semi-quantitative results were reported based on the cycle threshold value (Ct-value). A high viral load was defined as a Ct-value <28, a medium viral load with Ctvalues of 28-35, and a low viral load with Ct-values >35. Ct-values above 42 were regarded as virus-negative. In-house real-time PCR panels included analysis for human adenovirus, human bocavirus, human coronavirus OC43, NL63, 229E, human enterovirus, human parechovirus, HMPV, influenza A virus, influenza B virus, parainfluenza virus types 1-4, RSV, human rhinovirus, Bordetella pertussis, Chlamydophila pneumoniae and Mycoplasma pneumonia [35] . Conventional viral cultures were also performed. The detection of HMPV as a single virus in the NPA is named single HMPV, while HMPV co-detected with !1 other virus is named HMPV with co-detection. Similar expressions are also used for RSV. The HMPV-positive specimens were genotyped by real-time PCR and DNA sequencing using primers targeting the F-gene of HMPV [11] . A 527-bp amplicon was sequenced using a Big Dye Terminator v.3.1 cycle sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Sequences were analyzed on an ABI 3130XL (Applied Biosystems). Genotypes were determined by comparing sequenced data with the nucleotide BLAST database (www.ncbi.nlm.nih. gov/BLAST/). Some of the NPA were not type-able due to a low viral load, and others were empty after regular PCR tests.

Blood samples were collected to measure the concentration of C-reactive protein (CRP) in mg/L and white blood cell count x 10 9 /L.

To compare categorical variables, we used the χ or Fisher exact tests when expected values were <5. Means of normally distributed continuous variables were compared by Student t-test or ANOVA, and non-normally distributed continuous or ordinal variables were compared by use of Mann-Whitney U or Kruskal-Wallis tests. We compared HMPV and RSV using stratified analyses among those with single virus infections and those with viral co-detections. Children with both HMPV and RSV were excluded from these analyses. Due to significant age differences between HMPV-and RSV-infected children, we also used a stratification strategy to control for age. We analyzed risk factors for severe disease in HMPV-and RSV-infected children separately, using logistic regression. We dichotomized the combined disease severity score, defining cases as a score !2 and controls as a score <2, and used this as a binary outcome in the logistic regression analyses. We predefined factors related to exposure and outcome to be age, prematurity, !1 chronic disease, viral co-detection and Ct-values. All factors were entered into full multivariable logistic regression models. Final models for HMPV and RSV, respectively, were obtained by stepwise removing factors with P > 0.1. Testing for a possible covariance between variables such as prematurity and !1 chronic disease showed that both variables could be entered into the same models, but that it was not possible to include specific chronic diseases. The results from the final models were presented as odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) and P-values, and used for inference.

Missing data has been specified in Fig 1 and tables, and no imputation of missing data has been done. P-values < 0.05 (two-sided) were considered as statistically significant, and IBM SPSS Statistics 22 were used in all analyses.

During nearly 9 years, we included 3,214 children out of 3,932 (81.7%) with acute RTI into our main study cohort (Fig 1) . Among the 56.5% (1816/3214) of hospitalized children with LRTI, HMPV was detected in 9.4% (171/1816) and RSV in 47.3% (859/1816), while 0.6% (11/1816) had both HMPV and RSV (Fig 1) . In total, 1,041 HMPV-and RSV-infected children were included in the present study (Fig 1) . Their median age was 8.7 months (range 0.3-189.1 months) and the majority was younger than 5 years old (97.9%, 1019/1041). NPA were collected from 85.7% (892/1041) of these children within 24 hours after presentation, and within 48 hours in 96.0% (999/1041).

Tables 1-3 and S1 Table summarize baseline characteristics and details of the hospital courses among HMPV-infected children (n = 171). The children had a median age of 17.2 months and the majority were boys (59%). Nearly every fourth child was born premature. Every third child had !1 chronic disease. Asthma was the most common chronic disease at 20%, while 13% had other chronic airway diseases. The children presented at the hospital at a median of 4.0 days after onset of the symptoms, which most often were a cough (91%) and fever (88%). Symptoms of breathing difficulties and clinical signs of respiratory difficulty, such as chest retractions and tachypnea, appeared in half or more. The median peak CRP level was slightly elevated at 35 mg/L, whereas one-third had otitis media. Sixty-nine children had bronchiolitis (40%), which was slightly more frequent than pneumonia, appearing in 61 (36%). Obstructive bronchitis, asthma exacerbation and unspecified LRTI were less common. The majority of the patients received several treatment modalities, in particular inhalations (91%) and oxygen (60%), while fewer received antibiotics (39%) and corticosteroids (33%). Twenty-three (13%) children received respiratory support, among whom the majority were admitted to the PICU. The median length of stay at the hospital was 4.0 days, and the median severity score was 1.0. HMPV was detected as a single virus in 106 out of 171 (62%) children, while 65 (38%) had HMPV with a co-detection of one or more viruses (rhinovirus (n = 27), enterovirus (n = 22), parainfluenza virus 1-4 (n = 9), human bocavirus (n = 8), adenovirus (n = 6), human parechovirus (n = 3) and influenza A and B viruses (n = 4)). All baseline characteristics, symptoms, clinical findings, diagnoses and disease severity measures, such as a need for oxygen, length of hospital stay, a need for respiratory support and admission to the PICU, appeared at similar rates among both the children with a single virus infection and those with HMPV co-detection. Hence, the combined disease severity score was also equal.

HMPV genotypes were available from 147 out of 171 (86%) children (S2 Table) . Genotype B was most frequent, detected in 80 NPA (54%), of which 26 were B1 and 54 were B2. Genotype A was detected in 67 NPA (46%), of which 12 were A2a, 28 were A2b and 27 were A2 (unassigned). No samples were positive for A1. There were no differences between infections elicited by genotypes A and B in demographic characteristics, medical history and disease Table 1 Data presented as absolute numbers and percent in parenthesis, except from ""Age, months"", which is median and interquartile range (IQR) in parenthesis.

Table) , though with one exception: Children infected with genotype B more often received respiratory support compared to children with genotype A (14/80, 18%, vs. 4/67, 6%, P = 0.034). However, when we only included single HMPV-infected in this analysis (n = 90), this difference disappeared (genotype B: 7/47, 15% vs. genotype A: 4/43, 9%, P = 0.419). Finally, when we compared subtypes B1 vs. B2, and A2a vs. A2b vs. A2 (unassigned), both as single virus infections and co-detections, no differences were found in disease severity score (data not shown).

Tables 1-3 and S1 Table summarize baseline characteristics and details of the hospital courses among RSV-infected children (n = 859). The children had a median age of 7.3 months, and the majority were boys (56%). Bronchiolitis was the most common diagnosis, appearing in nearly two-thirds, and approximately one-fifth had pneumonia. Single virus infection with RSV appeared in 540 out of 859 children (63%), while 319 out of 859 (37%) had RSV with the co-detection of other viruses (rhinovirus (n = 178), human parechovirus (n = 54), human bocavirus (n = 53), coronavirus (n = 46), adenovirus (n = 28), parainfluenza virus 1-4 (n = 12) and influenza A and B viruses (n = 11). Children with single virus infection were younger compared to those with RSV and co-detection (median 5.4 vs. 12.5 months, P < 0.001). Children with RSV infection and co-detection more often had fever before admission, whereas other symptoms appeared at similar rates in both RSV groups. Furthermore, more children with RSV and co-detection were born premature and had ! 1 chronic disease; they also developed a higher peak temperature, higher peak CRP levels, more often had pneumonia and less often had bronchiolitis. There was a tendency that less children with RSV and co-detection needed respiratory support and admission to the PICU, whereas the need for oxygen, length of hospital stay and the combined disease severity score did not differ between the two RSV groups (Table 3) .

Eleven hospitalized children had both HMPV and RSV (Fig 1) . They were diagnosed with pneumonia (n = 6), bronchiolitis (n = 2), asthma exacerbation (n = 2) and unspecified LRTI (n = 1), and their median age was 24.3 months. The median length of stay was five days (IQR 2.0-8.0) and the severity score median 1.0 (IQR 0.0-2.0). Seven out of 11 (64%) needed oxygen, but no received respiratory support. There were no differences in length of stay, need for oxygen and the combined disease severity score when comparing children with both HMPV and RSV (n = 11) with the entire groups of children with HMPV and RSV (n = 171 and n = 859, respectively). Tables 1-4 show comparisons of baseline characteristics, medical details and details of the hospital courses of the children with HMPV and RSV. First, we compared single virus-infected children with HMPV and RSV ( Table 1 ). The single HMPV-infected children were older (14.7 months vs. 5.4 months, P < 0.001), more often were born premature and more often had chronic diseases including asthma, other chronic airway diseases, epilepsy and cerebral paresis, compared to children with a single RSV infection (Table 1) . Age-stratified analyses showed that these differences primarily appeared in children aged 12-23 months (prematurity) and 6-11 months (chronic diseases), respectively (Table 4 ). More children with a single HMPV infection had otitis media and pneumonia, and were treated with antibiotics and corticosteroids (Table 2 ). In contrast, more children with a single RSV infection had bronchiolitis and received inhalations (Table 2) . However, when we controlled for age we found no significant differences in the distribution of diagnoses (Table 4) . Interestingly, among children aged <6 months, nine out of 10 children with HMPV, as well as those with RSV, had bronchiolitis (Table 4 ). Children with a single HMPV infection had a higher peak temperature and higher peak CRP levels, but adjusted for age, these differences also disappeared (Tables 1 and 4 ). When we compared the entire single virus-infected groups with HMPV and RSV, there were no differences in disease severity, i.e. there were no differences in need of oxygen and respiratory support, PICU admission and length of hospital stay. The combined disease severity scores were also equal (Table 3 ). However, age was a strong factor for explaining the disease severity (Table 4 and Fig 2) . The effect of age differed among HMPV and RSV infected children. In the youngest age group of <6 months old, the children with HMPV infection had a milder disease because they less frequently needed oxygen, and they had a shorter hospital stay and a lower severity score (Table 4 and Fig 2) . On the other hand, the single HMPV-infected children in the age group of 12-23 months had a more severe disease than the children with RSV; they were treated more days with oxygen, more often received respiratory support, more often were admitted to the PICU, had a longer hospital stay and more often had a severity score !2 (Table 4 and Fig 2) .

We also compared the children with a co-detection of other viruses, in addition to HMPV and RSV (HMPV: n = 65 and RSV: n = 319) (Tables 1-3 and S1 Table) . We retrieved the age difference seen in single virus-infected children, although it was less pronounced (HMPV: 18.5 months vs. RSV: 12.5 months, P < 0.001) ( Table 1) . More children with HMPV and co- Peak temperature in˚C sampled from 104 HMPV-infected and 499 RSV-infected. c CRP, C-reactive protein, sampled from 105 HMPV-infected and 520 RSV-infected. d detection had one or more chronic diseases, including chronic airway diseases other than asthma. There were no differences in peak temperature, peak CRP levels and LRTI diagnoses. The clinical courses also differed to some extent (Table 3) . Although the same rate of children with HMPV and RSV co-detections needed oxygen, HMPV-positive children needed oxygen longer (P = 0.022). Invasive respiratory support was also given more often to HMPV-infected children (P = 0.016), whereas non-invasive respiratory support was given at similar rates (Table 3) .

Two children died because of RTI during the entire nine-year-long study period. One was only 2.5 months old and had a single RSV infection. The other child was two years old and had a single HMPV infection. Both had severe comorbidities.

In the logistic regression analyses we found that age was strongly associated with disease severity (Table 5 ). In HMPV-infected children, age groups 12-23 months (OR = 3.01, P = 0.067) and !24 months (OR = 3.97, P = 0.021) were associated with the highest risk for severe disease, while in the youngest age group (<6 months) RSV-infected children had the highest risk for severe disease (OR = 2.11, P = 0.002). Prematurity was associated with higher risk in both HMPV-(OR = 3.36, P = 0.005) and RSV-infected children (OR = 1.58, P = 0.035). Chronic disease was also an important factor, being significantly associated with higher risk in RSVinfected children (OR = 2.26, P < 0.001) and close to significant in HMPV-infected children (OR = 2.22, P = 0.059). High viral load was associated with higher risk for severe disease in RSV-infected children only (OR = 7.91, P = 0.047) and not in those with HMPV. No significant interactions were present among variables included in the two final models, respectively. Finally, viral co-detection was not associated with increased risk for severe disease, and this factor was not included in the final models for HMPV and RSV. Other factors, not included in the predefined models, such as genotype (HMPV), gender, siblings and day care attendance, were also analyzed with logistic regression, but none of these factors yielded any significant contributions (data not shown). 

The present data from our large population-based study collected during a nearly 9-year-long period show that LRTI with HMPV clinically manifests itself independently of the co-detection of other viruses, and does not differ in relation to HMPV genotypes. Furthermore, clinical manifestations and final diagnoses in children with HMPV and RSV LRTI are quite similar. However, the clinical course varies in relation to age, and the age effect differed among single virus HMPV-and RSV-infected children. Lastly, our data confirm that hospitalized children born preterm and children with chronic diseases have an increased risk of developing severe LRTI among HMPV-and RSV-infected.

Using a broad panel of sensitive nucleic-acid based viral tests, we detected more than one virus in 38% of the children with LRTI and HMPV. All patient characteristics, including rates of prematurity and chronic diseases, clinical manifestations and clinical courses were surprisingly equal in those with single HMPV infection and HMPV with viral co-detection. On this basis, and on observations done by others [14, 17, 23] , it seems evident to conclude that viral co-detections in HMPV-infected children usually have no cumulative clinical effects to that of HMPV alone. Our population-based data also clearly shows that HMPV/RSV-coinfection is a rare event, and is usually not associated with increased severity, as has been suggested from smaller studies based on selected groups of children [21, 22] .

We detected a broad spectrum of HMPV genotypes (A2, A2a, A2b, B1 and B2), but no samples were positive for genotype A1. In other studies, genotype A1 has also been the most seldom genotype detected [13] [14] [15] 17, 36] . Our data clearly show that the present HMPV genotype variations do not relate to any particular premorbid condition, and causes infection with quiet similar clinical manifestations and outcomes in children. Consequently, our findings confirm results from previous studies with smaller sample sizes [13] [14] [15] 36, 37] . However, Schuster et al. [17] genotyped 192 HMPV-positive in children <2 years old in Jordan enrolled during three years, and found that HMPV genotype A infection was associated with an increased need for oxygen compared to genotype B infection. In another study, including 68 HMPV-positive hospitalized children <3 years of age enrolled during four winter seasons in Canada by Papenburg et al. [18] , infection with HMPV genotype B was associated with either an increased oxygen need, PICU attendance or a hospitalization >5 days. The diverging findings in these two studies compared to our study may be explained by different age of the included children, and because the outcome ""severe disease"" in the two other studies probably included less ill children than in our study. Furthermore, naturally occurring genotype variations over shorter time intervals may also increase the risk of random findings.

The most prominent factor differing between HMPV and RSV in the present study was the difference in age distributions, which has been observed before [18, 23, 29, 38, 39] . Twothirds with HMPV infection were 1 to 5 years old and less than one-fifth was <6 months old, and nearly half of RSV-infected children were <6 months old. In addition, we confirmed findings from previous studies that more HMPV-infected children were preterm born [18, 29] and had a chronic disease [2, 32] . On the other hand, HMPV and RSV in many ways caused a quite similar spectrum of LRTI types. Looking at the entire groups of children with HMPV and RSV infections, bronchiolitis was the most common diagnosis in both viruses, although a 50% higher rate was observed in children with RSV. By contrast, HMPV-infected children apparently had pneumonia and otitis media more often. However, these findings were confounded by age. In children <6 months old with a single virus infection, 90% of both viral infections were classified as bronchiolitis, and in children older than 6 months, no significant differences in bronchiolitis and pneumonia rates were found. In previous studies, it has been shown that temperature and CRP may increase to higher levels in children with HMPV infection than in those with RSV [3, 38] , but we could not confirm this after adjusting for age.

We found that disease severity was very similar when we compared the entire groups of children with HMPV and RSV, and others have also previously reported this [23, 25, 26] . However, age was strongly related to disease severity, and the age effect differed among single virus HMPV-and RSV-infected children. First of all, only one-fifth of the hospitalized children with single HMPV infection were younger than 6 months, compared to half of those with RSV. Secondly, HMPV infection was associated with a milder disease than RSV infection among children aged <6 months, as indicated by a less frequent need for oxygen, a shorter hospital stay and a lower severity score. Furthermore, the data provided evidence that in children aged 12-23 months old, HMPV infection may be more severe than RSV infection, with a longer need for oxygen treatment, more children in need of respiratory support, more children admitted to PICU, a longer hospital stay and a higher severity score. A possible explanation for these observations might have been that neonates attain higher concentrations of maternally derived protective antibodies against HMPV, as compared to RSV, during pregnancy and the first six months of life. However, data from a recent clinical study measuring HMPV and RSV antibody concentrations did not confirm this hypothesis [40] . Another explanation might have been that HMPV-infected children more often than children with RSV had a primary and potentially more severe infection among those children aged 12-23 months, but it was not possible for us to assess whether children had a primary or secondary infection. In general, clinical manifestations in children with airway infections are related to the net effect of physical and genetic factors, as well as viral-and immunemediated reactions in the maturing child, which are strongly correlated to the child's age [41, 42] . We found that high RSV viral loads, but not high HMPV viral loads, were associated with severe disease. Thus, based on these clinical observations among our population of hospitalized children, it may be tempting to claim that RSV is a more potent virus than HMPV among infants, and that RSV infection more than HMPV is a virally driven disease. Recently, other researchers have published data supporting a similar assumption [43] . In accordance with our findings, Roussy et al. [37] found that HMPV viral loads were not associated with increased disease severity among hospitalized children (inpatients), but hospitalized patients had higher HMPV viral loads than outpatients [37] . It has also been shown by others that LRTI may be associated with higher HMPV viral loads than URTI [44] . For this reason, it seems that HMPV viral loads may relate to disease severity to a certain extent, but not among those with the most severe disease.

Most previous studies on risk factors for severe HMPV infections in children focused on age groups younger than 2-3 years old [17, 18] , high-risk patients [29] or for children admitted to PICU [33] , and disease severity has been defined by the use of various outcome variables [17, 18, 29, 33] . We included a population-based sample consisting of all children aged <16 years who were admitted with acute RTI, although the vast majority were aged <5 years. We used a compound severity score combining several outcome measures. Although this score has not been validated, it fit the routines at our department and rather rigorously defined severe disease, and provided reliable risk factor estimates. We confirmed that independent risk factors for both severe HMPV and RSV infections were the presence of chronic diseases and a history of prematurity. Children aged 12 to 23 months had a three-fold increased risk of developing severe HMPV infection, and those aged !24 months had a nearly four-fold increased risk. Among RSV-infected children, infants less than six months had a nearly double risk compared to older children. Having one or more chronic diseases doubled the risk in both virus types, but due to a significant co-variation, our data set could not be used to identify which chronic diseases more precisely increased the risk. Prematurity with a gestational age less than 36 weeks increased the risk of severe HMPV infection three-fold, as shown by others [31] , and severe RSV infection for approximately 50%. However, prophylactic use of palivizumab in high-risk children may have confounded this risk estimation in relation to RSV. Hence, in hospitalized children, our data confirm the findings from other studies that particular age groups, prematurity and the presence of chronic diseases independently increase the risk of developing severe LRTI among children with HMPV infection [2, 17, 18, 29, [31] [32] [33] and RSV infection [18, 24, [27] [28] [29] [30] .

It is a strength of the present study that we prospectively enrolled children of all ages from the same county in Mid-Norway, and to the only existing hospital in this region during a nearly 9-year long period. NPA were taken from the majority of the admitted children, and 81.7% were included in the main study cohort. Moreover, we analyzed all NPA using a broad panel of sensitive virus tests during the entire period, which allowed us to examine viral codetections thoroughly. Nonetheless, it may be a limitation that bacterial co-detections were not considered, but most children had low or moderately increased CRP values. Furthermore, during the entire study period almost all Norwegian children received conjugated pneumococcal vaccines, which has reduced the incidence of pneumococcal infections [45] . Although this does not completely exclude pneumococcal coinfection, at least HMPV-and RSV-infected children may have been similarly influenced. Diagnostic and work-up biases could have affected our results negatively, since the clinicians were not blinded for the NPA results, and because patients were not treated after a study protocol.

In conclusion, HMPV infections among hospitalized children with LRTI were manifested independently of viral co-detection and HMPV genotypes. HMPV and RSV infections differed clinically to a certain extent, and these differences were mostly related to age. Among single virus-infected children, HMPV-infected aged <6 months had a milder disease and those aged 12-23 months had more severe disease, than children with RSV. A history of prematurity and chronic disease increased the risk of severe LRTI among HMPV-and RSV-infected children.

Outcome Risk Factors during Respiratory Infections in a Paediatric Ward in Antananarivo,"Background: Acute respiratory infections are a leading cause of infectious disease-related morbidity, hospitalisation and mortality among children worldwide, and particularly in developing countries. In these low-income countries, most patients with acute respiratory infection (ARI), whether it is mild or severe, are still treated empirically. The aim of the study was to evaluate the risk factors associated with the evolution and outcome of respiratory illnesses in patients aged under 5 years old.","Respiratory infections are a major cause of infectious diseaserelated morbidity, hospitalisation, and mortality among children under 5 years old worldwide, and particularly in developing countries [1] .

These diseases are responsible for 4 million deaths worldwide every year [4] : they are thus among the leading causes of death and the most common infectious cause of death [2] . Although many episodes of respiratory infection are mild, 7 to 13 percent are severe enough to warrant hospitalisation [3] . These diseases are responsible for at least 6% of the world's disability and death [1] . It is estimate that there are 33.7 million cases of respiratory infection annually among African children and longitudinal studies suggest that the overall mortality rate among children in developing countries is between 6.6% and 14.1% [5] .

Despite respiratory infections being a public health priority, data on their epidemiology in Africa are sparse. Diagnostic methods to identify the pathogen rapidly are not available in lowincomes settings, so most patient with respiratory infections are treated empirically with antibiotics based on local epidemiology [6] . Administering appropriate therapy at the appropriate time would improve outcomes. These diseases also have an economic impact, as they lead to substantial consumption of antimicrobial agents in both community and hospital settings. Furthermore, the high frequency of respiratory infections and the excessive use of antimicrobial agents are major contributors to the development of antibiotic-resistant pathogens.

Knowing the local epidemiology of respiratory infections is essential if appropriate empiric therapy is to be prescribed. Evaluation of mixed infections and the relative importance of each potential pathogen may also contribute to improving the understanding of the pathogenesis of these infections [7, 8] . Our study aimed to evaluate the risk factors associated with the evolution and outcome of respiratory illnesses in patients aged under 5 years old hospitalised in one of the four main public hospitals in Antananarivo.

The study was conducted at the ''Centre Hospitalier de Soavinandriana'' (CENHOSOA) in Antananarivo, the capital city of Madagascar, which is located in the central highlands. Antananarivo consists of administrative, commercial, industrial and residential areas, with patches of agricultural land, mostly rice fields. The city is divided into six administrative districts. In Madagascar, Hib vaccine was introduced in 2008, and Pneumococcia vaccine in 2012 CENHOSOA is a national referral hospital in the third district of the urban municipality of Antananarivo; hospitalization and care at this hospital is paid for by the patients. It is located near the Institut Pasteur of Madagascar (IPM). The paediatric and neonatology ward of CENHOSOA has 54 beds, and the annual number of children hospitalized for respiratory infection was estimated to be 150.

A prospective, hospital-based, study was conducted at CEN-HOSOA from November 2010 to July 2012.

The case definition and eligibility criteria used during this study are described in figure 1 .

Demographic, socio-economic, clinical and epidemiological data were recorded in case report forms (CRFs). Paediatricians completed the CRFs which were then validated by a clinical research officer. Instruction sheets were provided to clinical research officers to ensure accurate data collection. The data collected was managed by a senior medical epidemiologist.

On admission, trained personnel using standard operating procedures had collected nasal and throat swabs, and sputum sample by aspirating airway secretion from the hypopharynx through the nose or tracheal aspirates. Nasopharyngeal secretions, tracheal aspirates and sputum were obtained before start of antibiotic therapy. Specimens were transported within 30 minutes of sampling to the IPM for tests of respiratory pathogens.

HIV serostatus was not determined; the prevalence of HIV in Madagascar is low, estimated to be around 1 per 1000 [7] .

The study was approved by the national ethics committee of the Ministry of Health of Madagascar. Written informed consent was obtained from parents or legal guardians of children enrolled in the study. Consenting to be enrolled in the study required consent to provide samples for diagnosis of influenza and other respiratory pathogens and to fill out a case report forms (CRFs). Refused consent and hospitalization within the two weeks before consultation were reasons for exclusion from the study.

Virological analyses were performed by National Influenza Centre (NIC).

A panel of multiplex real-time RT-PCR was used for the detection of viral pathogens in nasopharyngeal swabs. Primers and probes were obtained from the authors of reported studies or were developed at the NIC [8] . Viral RNA and DNA were extracted from 140 ml of each specimen using the QIAamp viral RNA mini kit and QIAampMinElute virus kit (QIAgen, Courtaboeuf, France) according to the manufacturer's protocols. An ABI 7500 Fast real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems) was used for amplifications. Each sample was subjected to five different amplification reactions, each containing primers and probes specific for two or three viruses such that the following 12 respiratory viruses were targeted as previously described: parainfluenza virus 1-3 (PIV), human coronaviruses (hCoV) -OC43, -229E, -NL63 and HKU1, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human metapneumovirus (hMPV), human rhinovirus (hRV), adenovirus (AdV) and bocavirus (BoV).

As part of our routine influenza surveillance, screening for influenza viruses is performed by MDCK cell inoculation and realtime RT-PCR according to the CDC protocols [9] .

Bacteriological analyses were performed by the medical analysis laboratory of IPM Gram-stained sputum preparations were examined for polynuclear neutrophils (PN) and epithelial cells. The areas of maximal purulence were examined and graded as follows: class 1: more than 25 cells and fewer than 10 PN, class 2: more than 25 cells and 10-25 PN, class 3: more than 25 cells and more than 25 PN, class 4: 10-25 cells and more than 25 PN and class 5: fewer than 10 cells and more than 25 PN. Only the classes 4 and 5 present a high positive predictive value. If the laboratory determined that the sample was of oral origin it had been rejected. So, classes 1 to 3 had been considered as rejection criteria.

Quantitative sputum cultures were performed on each specimen by a previously described method [10] : sputum specimens were homogenized with an equal volume of Digest-EURH on a vortex mixer; 10 ml aliquots of the homogenate were serially diluted in saline and 10 ml aliquots of the dilutions were plated with a sterile inoculator on Blood Columbia agar with nalidixic acid and colistin (ANC), Chocolate Polyvitex (PVX) agar, and Drigalski agar. Plates were incubated under 5% CO 2 at 35uC for 24 to 48 hours. Colonies growing on plates inoculated with suitable dilutions were counted to enumerate each bacterial species present. The threshold of significance was set at $10 7 /ml (for one or two species only). Isolates were identified by standard laboratory methods.

Mono-infection was defined as the presence of only one pathogen as determined by viral and bacterial analysis. Patients for which more than one pathogen was detected were considered to have co-infections.

The outcome was scored as severe if the patient died, or presented a wrong clinical evolution during hospitalisation (complication) or the hospitalization was longer than 10 days (3 rd quartile).

Analyses were performed with R software [11] . The nonparametric Wilcoxon test was used to compare means. Qualitative variables were compared with the Fisher exact test. Statistical differences were considered significant for p-values,0.05. Multivariate backward step-by-step logistic regressions were performed to take into account confounders, bias and interactions involving pathogens linked to the dependent variable. All variables with a pvalue,0.20 were included in the initial model.

Five age groups were defined for the analysis: [0-5] months, [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] months, [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] months, [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] months, [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] months, .36 months.

From November 2010 to July 2012, 290 children were recruited from the 301 hospitalized patients eligible. Eleven eligible patients refused to participate in the study, and they did not differ from included patients for age, sex or diagnosis on admission.

The baseline demographic and clinical characteristics of the patients are shown in Table 1 . The sex ratio (male/female) was 1.3. The mean of age was 1.1 years [95% CI: 1.0 to 1.2], the age range was from 1 day to 5 years, and 250 (86%) patients were 2 years old or younger. The diagnoses on admission (Table S1 ) were significantly different between the age groups: bronchiolitis was found more frequently among patients under 6 months old (55%, p,0.01); LTRI and pneumonia were more frequent among patients aged over 12 months (respectively, 68% and 85%,p,0.01).

Forty-nine (17%) patients had at least one underlying disease, with asthma being the most frequent (5%). Some of the children had underlying conditions, particularly atopy (52; 18%) and passive exposure to tobacco smoke (113; 39%). Seventy-one (24%) had been hospitalized during the previous 12 months. Patients aged under 18 months had significantly more prior hospitalisations (p = 0.01). The difference between sexes was not statistically significant.

Around 45% (131/290) of patients had been treated with antibiotics before hospitalisation (Table S2 ). Significantly more patients under than over 12 months old had received antibiotic treatment before hospitalisation (p,0.01). The difference between sex was not statistically significant. The frequency of bacterial detection was lower in the group with prior antibiotic treatment (49% versus 65%, p = 0.01). No such relationship was found for viral results.

Accurate information about immunisation was available on vaccination cards for 82 (26%) children. Eighty-seven percent of children had completed vaccination against BCG, 77% had received one Haemophilus influenzae type B vaccination. No child was vaccinated against Streptococcus pneumoniae and only two were vaccinated against influenza.

The average of duration of hospitalisation was 7.9 days [95% CI: 7.1 to 8.6], range 1 to 79 days. The median duration of hospitalisation was 7 days, and 61% of patients were hospitalised for more than 7 days. The duration of hospitalisation for living patients was 8.0 [7.2-8.7 ] days, and for fatal cases was 3.9 [1.4-9.2]. There were no significant differences between sex and age groups.

Discharge information was available for all cases: 79% (230/ 290) of patients fully recovered without any complication during their hospital stay; the condition of 60 children worsened during hospitalisation, and nine patients (3%) died. All deaths were of children under 18 months of age, and six (67%) were of children less than 6 months old. For the patients who died, Streptococcus pneumoniae (56%, 5/9) was the pathogen most frequently detected, followed RSV (33%, 3/9) and Influenza type A virus (22% 2/9).

For multivariate analysis of factors possibly associated with coinfection, sex, age group, number of rooms in the home and antibiotic treatment before hospitalisation were included in the initial model.

The multivariate analysis indicated that children under 36 months of age were more often infected by more than one pathogen; the difference was statistically significant for the 19-24 months old group (adjusted OR = 8.0) ( Table 1) . Previous antibiotic treatment before hospitalization was a significantly protective factor against co-infection (OR = 0.5).

In univariate analysis, Influenza A, Rhinovirus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Haemophilus influenza type B were significantly associated with co-infections. Haemophilus influenzae and S. pneumo- niae were most often associated with co-infection (Adjusted OR = 20.5 and 11.1, respectively) ( Table 1) . Univariate analysis showed that a severe outcome was significantly more frequent for patients with comorbidity (OR = 3.9), including prematurity or congenital disease (such as heart disease or cerebral malformation). Also, two of the three patients presenting with malnutrition died. Hospitalization during the 12 months prior to admission was also associated with a severe outcome (OR = 2.1). A low household income, of less than 455 US$ (less than 182 US$ OR = 4.4 and between 182 and 455 US$ OR = 3.5) was associated with severe outcomes.

For multivariate analysis, age group, monthly household income, admission diagnosis, comorbidities, previous hospitalisation, and infection with influenza virus type A, RSV and rhinovirus were included in the initial model.

Multivariate analysis (Table 3 ) adjusted for these variables showed that age below 6 months (OR = 5.3), living in a household with low income (OR = 4.1), and the presence of comorbidities (OR = 4.6) were significantly aggravating factors. Infection with an influenza type A virus was a significantly protective factor against a severe outcome (OR = 0.4 [95% CI = 0.2-0.9]).

In the paediatric ward of CENHOSOA, most children under 36 months, hospitalised for respiratory infections, were co-infected, and the most frequently encountered pathogens were H. influenza, S. pneumonia, Influenza A and Rhinoviruses. During hospitalisation, the evolution of respiratory infections was worse for the youngest children and for those presenting comorbidities and living in lowincome household.

Over all, viral infections made a large contribution to the burden of infectious respiratory disease. Viral pathogens were found in 85% of the patients and bacterial pathogens in 57%, although for 45% of the patients had been treated with antibiotics before hospitalisation, and this presumably affected the observed prevalence of bacterial infections.

Our findings for viruses were similar to those of other studies. For example, the detection rate for viral pathogens was 72% in a study in Vietnam [12] , 50% in a study in Mozambique [13] , both focusing on hospitalised children. These results are consistent with those for the paediatric ward in CENHOSOA. Our findings are also consistent with another report from Madagascar indicating that RSV (30.5%) and by Influenza A (22.6%) are the most frequent viral causes of community respiratory infection [8] .

Few studies in developing countries have addressed the role of bacterial co-infection in severe respiratory illness. Most focus on the viral aetiology because molecular diagnosis tools are available for these pathogens allowing to identify the infection in 80%-95% of cases [14, 15] . In developing countries, laboratory methods to identify bacterial pathogens are more difficult to implement, because of the lack of appropriate facilities and material in hospital laboratories and then, long transit times are prejudicial for stability of specimens. In our study the transit time was reduced because of the proximity of the CENHOSOA and the IPM. Unfortunately, our findings for the rate of bacterial infection may be artificially low due to prior antibiotic use. In our study, Streptococcus pneumoniae was the most common bacterial pathogen as in other studies of hospitalised patients with acute respiratory illness, and Haemophilus influenzae type B was the next most frequent [16] [17] [18] [19] .

Primary infection by a respiratory virus increases the risk of secondary bacterial pneumonia, and viral and bacterial coinfection is common in young children with pneumonia in developing countries (about 20-30% of episodes) [20, 21] .

Evidence of probable mixed viral-bacterial infection has been recorded in up to 45% of cases of community acquired pneumonia in children [22] [23] [24] [25] . A large proportion of our patients had coinfection (70%; 192/273) and the [0-6] months age group had the highest risk. These results are consistent with a study of patients with community respiratory infection in Madagascar [8] . Viral and bacterial co-infection was found in 57% of our patients; the most frequent combination was Streptococcus pneumoniae with one of several respiratory viruses (88%). Data from Gambia and Nigeria indicate that mixed bacterial and viral infections may occur in 8 -40% of cases of childhood pneumonia [26, 27] . Recent data from South Africa indicate that in at least 31% of cases, viral-associated pneumonia may be due to concurrent infection with Streptococcus pneumoniae in the absence of vaccination with pneumococcal conjugate vaccines [28] .

Appropriate management of respiratory infections can have a significant impact on child mortality and it is important to target priority groups of children most at risk of dying: these groups include very young infants, children infected with HIV and malnourished children [29] . In our study, the outcome was severe for all of the children who presented malnutrition and 67% (2/3) died. Chisti et al show that the combination of pneumonia with severe or moderate malnutrition is associated with a high risk of death: the RR ranges from 2.9 to 121.2 for severe malnutrition, and from 2.5 to 15.1 for moderate malnutrition. For moderate malnutrition, RR = 1.2 to 36.5. Several other studies also lead to the same results [30] [31] [32] [33] . Ballard et al. report that malnutrition and level of parental education both have an impact on the incidence of respiratory infections [34] .

Pneumonia is the leading causes of childhood mortality, and is responsible for approximately 21% of deaths of African children under five years of age each year. However, little information is available about the causes of childhood pneumonia in developing countries. In our study, only 3% of the patients died; this value is low. Note that the study population consists of patients from families with a socioeconomic level that is above the average for the general population in Madagascar. The patients who died were more frequently co-infected and under 6 months old. These results are consistent with other studies on this topic in developing countries [35, 36] . However, study design may have an impact on the mortality rate observed: indeed all fees for hospitalisation were paid by the study to allow follow-up to be optimised.

The study identified living in a low-income household as a risk factor for severe outcome. This is important for patient management during hospitalisation and also highlights the consequences of financial barriers to access to vaccination against influenza and pneumococci. These vaccinations were not included in the panel of vaccinations in expanded programme of immunisation (EPI) during this period in Madagascar. They were only available in private centres and were expensive, and therefore inaccessible for much of the population. Only two of the patients included in this study had received vaccination against influenza and none had received vaccination against pneumococci according to their vaccination cards.

Our statistical analysis identified influenza A infection as a protective factor against a fatal outcome; however, it is well-known that influenza A may have an impact on high mortality during major epidemics [37] [38] [39] .

The co-circulation of influenza A virus, RSV and the high frequency of Streptococcus pneumoniae in co-infections in children aged less than 5 years raised issues about the indirect impact of influenza vaccination on respiratory infections. In particular, the benefits of establishing a system of vaccination against infectious agents for which a vaccine is available should be considered to provide access to a larger proportion of the population.

In conclusion, we advocate to further research in developing countries to document in more detail the impact of viral and bacterial co-infections on the prognosis of severe respiratory illness. As numerous infections found in our study could be avoided by immunisation, we recommend that appropriate vaccination must be rapidly available for all the Malagasy children. This would reduce mortality among the youngest children, as this age group currently suffers the greatest burden of morbidity and mortality associated with respiratory infections.

Viral Infections and Associated Factors That Promote Acute Exacerbations of Asthma Viral Infection and Asthma Exacerbation Viral Infection and Asthma Exacerbation Viral Infection and Asthma Exacerbation,"This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial License (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/) which permits unrestricted non-commercial use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.","In the past few decades, highly sensitive and specific tests for virus detection have been developed, resulting in accurate detection of a long list of viruses associated with wheezing in early life, the risk for developing asthma, and exacerbation of established disease. Human rhinovirus (RV) and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) top the list, but recently discovered or re-emerging viruses (e.g., human metapneumovirus [HMPV] coronaviruses and enterovirus [EV]-D68) also contribute to acute wheezing in infancy and virus-mediated exacerbations. However, most viral infections are not associated with acute exacerations, and cofactors, including allergic inflammation and airway bacteria, have been described that increase the severity of infection and the probability of exacerbation. 1,2 Detection of both viruses and airway bacteria are associated with acute wheezing illnesses; specifically, co-infections of respiratory viruses and Moraxella catarrhalis, Hemophilus influenza, and/or Streptococcus pneumonia increases the risk for more severe respiratory illnesses and exacerbations of asthma. 3 The addition of antibiotics to treatment regimens for asthma exacerbation could materialize in the near future.

Several recent studies have also shown that respiratory allergy may partner with certain viral infections to synergistically produce airway inflammation and increase cold and asthma symp-toms. 4 Since there is currently no safe and effective antiviral for RV, the targeting of allergic inflammation may prove beneficial in reducing risk of severe virus-induced asthma symptoms. 5 There are several possible immunopathologic mechanism(s) that connect viral and bacterial infection, allergy, and acute asthma, as discussed in the following sections.

Asthma exacerbation is defined as an acute or subacute worsening of symptoms and lung function as compared to the patient's usual health status or, occasionally, the initial presentation of asthma. 6 Exacerbations often represent essentially an exaggerated lower airway response to an environmental exposure, with airway inflammation being a key component that promotes airflow obstruction and increased airway hyperresponsiveness. 7 Early treatment of asthma exacerbation is con-sidered the best strategy for management, 8 and increases in eosinophilic inflammatory markers have been shown to be good predictors of asthma exacerbations. 9 Utilizing this idea, tailoring patient treatment based on the direct and objective measurement of the eosinophil, a key component of airway inflammation in asthma, has proven more efficacious (e.g., less frequent and severe asthma exacerbations) than treatment based on clinical symptoms and lung function. 10 Exacerbations usually occur in response to a variety of external agents (e.g., respiratory pathogens, allergens, air pollutants, smoke, and cold or dry air); however, it is estimated that up to 85% of asthma exacerbations in children 11 and a considerable proportion in adults (76%-80%) 12 are linked to viral infections. The severity of the situation is compounded by the lack of specific antiviral strategies. Virus-induced asthma exacerbations are most often associated with detection of RV, 5 RSV, 13 human parainfluenza virus (HPIV), 14 human influenza virus (HIFV), 15 and human adenovirus (HAdV). 16 More recently, human bocavirus (HBoV), HMPV, 17 certain strains of human coronavirus (HCoV) (e.g., HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43, and HCoV-229E), 18 and EV-D68 19 have been associated with asthma exacerbation.

Viral identification in early childhood wheezing illness may provide prognostic information regarding short-and long-term consequences. In the short term, RSV-induced bronchiolitis is associated with longer hospitalization than RV-induced bronchiolitis. 20 The risk of reinfection with certain viruses varies; for example, there is a strong likelihood of RSV reinfection in the absence of ongoing passive immunity. 21 Two studies found this risk to be as high as 74% 22 and 76% 23 if the initial infection occurred within the first year of life. Fourth, certain respiratory viruses have a well-documented association with subsequent asthma development and then exacerbation. More severe RSV illnesses in early childhood increase the risk of asthma development, 24 and the risk for developing asthma is even greater after a RV wheezing episode in early life. 25 Some children may have genetic risk factors for wheezing with RV 26 or with RSV. RV and EV infections also contribute to exacerbations of asthma, especially in children. 11 Notably, many commonly used polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based tests cannot distinguish RV from other EV (e.g., EV-D68). 19 Viral sequencing analysis to specifically identify EV-D68 can be performed. 27

RV is the most prevalent human respiratory virus and is classified into 3 species (A, B, and C), with each of these species comprised of a number of different types: A (80 types), B (32 types), and C (up to 55 types). 28 Within each species, there is considerable genetic and antigenic heterogeneity; 28 while among species, A and C are phylogenetically closer than B and C. RV-A and RV-B were originally classified according to sensi-tivity to capsid-binding drugs, and RV-C was classified by sequence-based criteria. 29 RV circulates throughout the year but in many geographic areas appears to have distinct peaks of incidence in the fall and spring. 30 Infection rates remain substantial for the rest of the year.

In both adults and children, RV is the most frequently identified virus associated with acute asthma exacerbation. 31 RV enters the body through the respiratory route and infects and replicates in epithelial cells. It was first thought that RV infected only the upper airway, but it is now known that it can also infect the lower airway. 32 One of the proposed reasons why asthmatics are predisposed to viral infection is damaged epithelium, which may increase susceptibility to infection and ultimately lead to airway obstruction. Cellular mechanisms involved in this response include higher intracellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) expression on respiratory epithelial cells, disruption of epithelial barrier function, impaired apoptosis, increased cell lysis, deficient Th1 response (e.g., interferon [IFN]-γ), and enhanced neutrophil recruitment. 7 RV infection also induces proinflammatory mediators, including interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), IL-β, regulated on activation normal T expressed and secreted (RANTES), and granulocytemacrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF). 33 In addition to increasing airway neutrophils, RV-induced asthma exacerbation can also be associated with increases in airway eosinophils (Eos). 2 Airway Eos bind to RV and may participate in virus-specific immune responses through antigen presentation and T cell activation. 34 Eos may contribute to antiviral responses to RSV in vitro, 35 but the clinical significance of these effects is unclear. Eos can have immunomodulating effects, including inducing T cell activation, and eosinophilic cationic protein (ECP) can upregulate ICAM-1 expression on respiratory epithelial cells. 36 It should be noted that 90% of RV-A and RV-B serotypes use ICAM-1 as a receptor, which has a pivotal role in movement of inflammatory cells into the airways. 37 RV-C types bind to cadherin-related protein-3 (CDHR3), and the corresponding gene has been linked to childhood asthma associated with severe wheezing episodes in early life. 38

The 2 antigenic/genetic subtypes of RSV (A and B) exhibit seasonality, with RSV-A predominating in the fall/early winter and RSV-B in the winter and early spring. 39 RSV-A is associated with more severe illness, while RSV-B has been characterized as the milder strain. 40 Knowing which subtype a patient is infected with may, therefore, have some clinical value-such as treatment, prognosis, and even prevention-as more therapeutic and prophylactic modalities become available. 39 In addition to causing acute wheezing and bronchiolitis in infants, RSV can also contribute to asthma exacerbations in children and adults. 41 RSV infection of the airway induces airway inflammation and can promote airway hyperresponsiveness.

Airway epithelial cells initially respond to RSV infection by releasing type I IFNs, IL-12, IL-18, 42 and a variety of cytokines and chemokines, including IL-8, IL-10, RANTES, macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1α, monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP)-1, and eotaxin. 43 After migration to the lymph nodes for viral antigen presentation to T cells, dendritic cells migrate back to the infected epithelium, release mediators again (e.g., IFN-γ, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-9, and IL-12), and recruit additional inflammatory cells (e.g., CD8+ T cells and B cells), and granulocytes (neutrophils and Eos). 44 Under some circumstances, RSV infection may promote a T helper 2 (Th2) bias in immune responses in humans 41 and animals. 42 This was also found in a study comparing differential airway inflammatory responses in RSV-and influenza-induced asthma exacerbations. IFN-γ and TNF-α levels were significantly lower in RSV-induced asthma exacerbation when compared to asthmatics infected with influenza. 45 Indeed, the weaker Th1 response during viral infection in these individuals may lead to reduced viral clearance and prolonged and/or more serious disease. RSV infection is a potent inducer of chemokines, 46 and RANTES and eotaxin in particular have been associated with increased eosinophilia and RSV disease severity in mice. 47 Eotaxin appears to be a key component of Th2-driven disease, 48 and eotaxin levels correlate closely with eosinophil degranulation (i.e., eosinophil-derived neurotoxin [EDN] and ECP) in pediatric asthma. 49 Consequently, it may be a good therapeutic target in asthma and other eosinophil-related disease.

Host factors may be critical in determining RSV-induced disease severity, even when taking age-related effects, current/recent infection, air pollution, and allergen exposure into account. 44 Host genetic studies have found several polymorphisms to relate to RSV severity, including those in the chemokine receptor CCR5 50 (which binds a number of inflammatory CC-chemokines, including MIP-1α, MIP-1β, and RANTES), CXCL8, IL-4, and promoter variants of IL-9, IL-10, and TNF-α. 51 Thus, gene-environment interactions may contribute to susceptibility to virus-induced disease.

All EVs, including poliovirus, circulate mostly in the summer and fall in temperate and year-round in tropical climes. 52 There are more than 100 nonpolio human EVs, with the newer numbered ones being classified into 4 species, EV-A, EV-B, EV-C, and EV-D. EV-D includes 3 serotypes known to cause disease in humans: EV-D68, EV-D70, and EV-D94. 53 Although EV-D68 is not new, having first been isolated in 1962 from a small group of US children with lower respiratory tract infection, it has emerged in the past decade as an important respiratory pathogen, with reports from North America, Europe, and Asia. Its association with severe respiratory disease is of special note in children with asthma. 19 Exactly how it is able to cause lower respiratory tract disease is currently unknown because the virus binds specifically to cell receptors found predominantly in the upper respiratory tract; 54 however, additional mediators are required for EV-D68 to enter cells. 55 There is evidence that recent strains of EV-D68 that are associated with lower respiratory tract infection may have gene mutations that influence antigenicity or trophism for lower airway cells.

Most asthma exacerbations are associated with viral infection. However, infections with RV and other respiratory viruses are quite common, and most natural (or experimentally induced) infections in asthmatics do not result in exacerbations. 1,2 As discussed above, RV species and host genetics can influence the severity of illness and the probability of wheezing illnesses. Additional factors that influence the severity of viral infection and the risk of developing an asthma exacerbation are allergic sensitization and the airway bacteria (Figure) .

RV infection and allergic sensitization synergistically increase the risk of wheezing illnesses. 56 Atopic asthma can be associated with reduced virus-induced IFN responses, decreased viral clearance 57 and increased viral shedding. 58 In some studies, atopic asthmatics vs non-atopic controls have reduced peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) IFN responses. 59 Furthermore, some studies have found that bronchial epithelial cells of atopic asthmatics permit increased RV replication, enhanced cell lysis, and deficient release of IFN-β. 60 Studies of children with allergic asthma treated with omalizumab indicate that neutralizing immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated inflammation

Factors that can influence the severity of RV infections and the risk of RV-induced exacerbations of asthma. In children and adults with asthma, the severity of RV infection is positively related to the probability of exacerbation. Factors that increase the likelihood of more severe RV illnesses and exacerbations of asthma include the species of RV, the presence of bacterial pathogens in the airway, allergic inflammation, and polymorphisms in CDHR3 and the 17q21 region of the genome. RV, rhinovirus; CDHR3, cadherin-related protein-3; IgE, immunoglobulin E; Eos, eosinophils.

can lead to improvements in IFN responses and reduced virusinduced exacerbations. 61 This suggests that IgE-mediated inflammation can inhibit antiviral responses and increase the risk for virus-induced exacerbations of asthma.

Several studies have shown that viral infections precede bacterial infections of the upper and lower airways and may affect disease severity (e.g., increased invasive pneumococcal disease during high RV and RSV activity). 62 This may occur for several reasons, including virus-induced expression of airway receptors used by bacteria for cell invasion and disruption of airway epithelial layers. 63 Viruses and bacteria also increase release of inflammatory cytokines and mediators from epithelial cells and leukocytes, causing increased inflammation with a concomitant increase in symptoms and risk of asthma exacerbation. 3 Patients with stable asthma have even exhibited increased colonization of upper and lower airways with Proteobacteria, a group of bacteria predominantly composed of gram-negative species. 64 The possible role of bacteria in the early stages of asthma has been demonstrated by Bisgaard et al. 65 who found that S. pneumonia, H. influenzae, or M. catarrhalis colonization of the upper airway in early infancy was associated with increased risk of recurrent wheezing leading to asthma. Furthermore, wheezing illnesses in young children are similarly associated with detection of either viral or bacterial pathogens in the airway. 66 RV infections can promote increased detection of bacterial pathogens, and the combination of RV infection with detection of respiratory pathogens is associated with a greater risk for illness, including exacerbation of asthma. 3 Similarly, acute wheezing illnesses in infants or school-aged children are associated with both viral infections and airway microbiota that are dominated by bacterial pathogens. 67 This raises the possibility that selective use of antibiotics or vaccination could be useful in asthma. In wheezing infants, 2 controlled studies have reported that azithromycin produced clinical benefit in infants with acute wheezing. 68 Whether this is due to antimicrobial effects or anti-inflammatory effects of the macrolide is uncertain. Given that repeated antibiotic therapy could have adverse effects on commensal bacteria, and could also add to the problem of drug-resistant bacteria, more research is needed on long-term effects of this approach.

Improved testing methods have helped demonstrate that infections with several respiratory viruses are important contributors to asthma exacerbation and possibly the development of asthma in early childhood. Cofactors, such as genetics, allergic inflammation, and the airway microbiome, also modify the risk of more severe viral illness and exacerbation of established asthma. While practical antiviral strategies are lacking, there may be other opportunities to prevent or treat virus-induced exacerbations by reducing airway inflammation or perhaps targeting microbial cofactors.

The CCQ assessed nine symptoms over four domains (general: fevers, chills, muscle pains; nasal: watery eyes, runny nose, sneezing; throat: sore throat; chest: cough, chest pain), which were scored as none (0), mild (1), moderate (2) , or severe (3). 14 A cold was ""probable"" when symptoms were moderate in at least two domains or mild in at least three domains. Unless otherwise indicated, a common cold was defi ned as instances wherein the CCQ indicated a ""probable cold."" Common cold severity was assessed by the total CCQ score (possible score, 0-27) and by the proportion of colds with a score Ն 10. 14 Baseline scores are given in e- Table 1 . Colds in early pregnancy and post partum were retrospectively assessed by self-report at the fi rst study visit and 6 months post partum, respectively. Subjects with a current cold (women with and without asthma) or current asthma exacerbation were offered additional visits either at home or hospital within 48 h. If a new cold was reported 14 days after a previous report, it was considered a separate clinical event. 7 

Nasal and throat swabs were collected from women with common colds. Viruses were identifi ed using real-time quantitative PCR for rhinovirus, enterovirus, respiratory syncytial virus A and B, infl uenza A and B, coronavirus, and human metapneumovirus. 15 

Statistical analysis was performed using Stata 11 (StataCorp LP). Results are presented as mean Ϯ SD or median (interquartile range [IQR] ) with Student t test and Wilcoxon rank sum tests as appropriate and Wilcoxon signed rank test for paired data. The x 2 test was used to compare proportions. Two-sided tests with P , 05 were considered signifi cant, with the exception of data on the frequency of common colds and PCR-positive colds ( P , .025, because this outcome was assessed by two similar methods). The rate difference between the groups for colds was compared using a Poisson regression model adjusted for BMI, atopy, and parity, with a robust option when data were overdispersed. Secondary outcomes were cold severity (analyzed as panel data using Stata's xtreg with random effects and adjusted for baseline CCQ score, BMI, atopy, and parity), impact of colds on asthma, and impact of colds on pregnancy outcomes. We assessed the relationship between PCR-positive colds in asthma and preeclampsia/pregnancyinduced hypertension with logistic regression, adjusting for smoking, parity, age, BMI, and multiple pregnancy. Receiver operator curve (ROC) analyses were used to evaluate different diagnostic cutoff levels for the CCQ score in PCR positive infections (e- Fig 3) . Kaplan-Meier survival estimates were used to investigate the time to fi rst cold (e- Fig 4) .

Two hundred eighty-fi ve pregnant women were recruited (168 with asthma, 117 control subjects) ( Fig 1 ) . Pregnant women with asthma had signifi cantly higher BMI ( P , .002), signifi cantly worse lung function ( P , .05), and were more likely to have atopy ( P , .0001) than control subjects ( Table 1 , e-Appendix 2, e- Table 2 ).

Pregnant women with asthma had more questionnairedetected common colds during pregnancy (71%) than pregnant women without asthma (46%; P , .0001; asthma compared with women without asthma. 1 Respiratory viral infections are reported to be a signifi cant cause of asthma exacerbations during pregnancy 5 and may be associated with adverse outcomes, such as low birth weight. 6 The characteristics and mechanisms of these effects are not well understood. Among nonpregnant women with asthma, susceptibility to respiratory viral infection is not increased, but colds are more severe with more lower respiratory tract symptoms, which are longer lasting. 7 However, pregnant women may be more susceptible to viral infection because of a pregnancyrelated impairment in antiviral interferon responses 8, 9 or defi ciencies in epithelial cell function, overproduction of mucus, or alveolar macrophage dysfunction. 10 We hypothesized that during pregnancy, women with asthma experience more frequent and more severe respiratory viral infections than pregnant women without asthma. We assessed these effects prospectively during pregnancy by assessing common colds by selfreport and using the common cold questionnaire (CCQ) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing and retrospectively in early pregnancy and post partum.

Pregnant women with and without asthma were recruited from April 2007 to November 2009 ( Fig 1 ) at the antenatal clinic of John Hunter Hospital, Newcastle, Australia. Written informed consent was obtained and ethics approval granted by the University of Newcastle and Hunter New England Area Health Service Research Ethics Committees (approval number 07/02/21/3.06). Women between 12 and 20 weeks' gestation who were . 18 years of age were included. Exclusion criteria were the presence of a chronic medical disease (other than asthma), drug or alcohol dependence, and an inability to attend study visits or perform spirometry. Control subjects had never received a diagnosis of asthma, whereas women with asthma had a doctor's diagnosis of asthma and asthma symptoms or therapy in the prior 3 months.

Women completed monthly clinical visits and were telephoned fortnightly (e-Appendix 1, e- Fig 1 ) . The majority (157 of 168, 93%) of the women with asthma also commenced participation in the Managing Asthma in Pregnancy (MAP) study. 11, 12 Regardless of coparticipation in MAP, all women, with and without asthma, had the same schedule of study visits and telephone contacts and were eligible for additional visits based on the same criteria (current common cold). Some women consented to donate blood for in vitro studies of responses to viral infection. 8, 9 Clinical Measures At each visit and telephone contact, asthma symptoms over the past 7 days were collected by self-report and using the Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ7). 13 Exacerbations were assessed by direct questioning and defi ned as those requiring medical intervention (hospital admission, ED presentation, unscheduled doctor visit, or the use of oral corticosteroids).

Common colds were assessed by direct questioning (self-report: ""Do you currently have a cold?"") and using the CCQ (e- Fig 2) Table 2 ) . More women with asthma had multiple common colds than women without asthma (33% vs 16%; P 5 .0028; RR, 1.25; 95% CI [1.09, 1.42]). There were 223 common cold events in the asthma group and 83 in the control group (e- Table 3 ). The rate of common cold events adjusted for follow-up time, atopy, parity, and maternal BMI was signifi cantly higher in the asthma group compared with the control group ( Fig 2 ) (incidence rate ratio [IRR], 1.77; 95% CI [1.30, 2.42]; P , .0001). The control group had the same proportion of common colds detected in the second and third trimesters, whereas the asthma group had signifi cantly more common colds detected in the second compared with the third trimester ( Table 2 ) (P , .0001), despite longer follow-up times for the third trimester. In addition to questionnaire-detected colds, women with asthma also self-reported more colds prospectively during pregnancy and retrospectively in early pregnancy and post partum (e- Table 4 ).

Nasal and/or throat swab samples were collected from 80% of common cold events (20% were not collected because of refusal by the participant or lack of a clinical visit at the time of the event), within a median time from symptom onset of 3.5 days (IQR, 3-7 days) in the control group and 4 days (IQR, 2-7 days) in the asthma group (e- Table 5 ). Thirty-one percent of women with asthma and 18.8% of women without asthma had one or more PCR-positive colds during pregnancy (RR, 1.18; 95% CI [1.03, 1.34], asthma vs control) ( Fig 3 , Table 3 ), but this did not reach our signifi cance level of P , .025 ( P 5 .0305). There were 26 PCR-positive cold events in the nonasthmatic control group and 60 PCR-positive cold events in the asthma group (e- Table 5 ). There was no signifi cant difference in the rate of PCR-positive colds between groups (adjusted for follow-up time, atopy, parity, and maternal BMI; IRR, 1.18; 95% CI [0.72, 1.94]; P 5 .505) ( Table 3 ). The number of second trimester PCR-positive colds was higher than the number of third trimester colds in the asthma group ( P 5 .0442) but not in the control group ( P 5 .4524) (e- Table 5 ). In addition to questionnaire-detected colds, women with asthma also self-reported more colds prospectively during pregnancy and retrospectively in early pregnancy and post partum (e- Table 4 ).

The median total CCQ score was higher among common cold events in the asthma group (median, 8; IQR [5, 10] ) compared with the control group (median, 6; IQR [5, 8] ) and was statistically signifi cant when baseline values were adjusted for (xtreg, coeffi cient 1.16; 95% CI [0.11, 2.21]; P 5 .031) (e- Table 6 ). However, in PCR-positive colds, the total CCQ score was not different between groups (e- 

One-third of the PCR-positive viral infections were associated with exacerbation requiring medical intervention and a further one-third with loss of control (e-Tables 7, 8). Total CCQ score signifi cantly correlated with ACQ score (Spearman r 5 0.3187, P 5 .0131, Spearman rank correlation) (e- Fig 5) .

Among the subgroup of women with asthma participating in the MAP study, those randomized to fractional exhaled nitric oxide-based management (n 5 69) were signifi cantly less likely to report common colds 

In the control group, women with at least one PCR-positive cold had babies of signifi cantly lower birth weight ( P 5 .0274) and length ( P 5 .0236) compared with control subjects with PCR-negative colds ( Table 4 ) . Women with asthma with PCR-positive colds had signifi cantly increased odds of preeclampsia or pregnancy-induced hypertension when adjusted for known preeclampsia risk factors (maternal smoking, age, BMI, parity, multiple pregnancy; OR, 8.48; 95% CI [1.41, 51.11]; P , .02) ( Table 4 ) compared with women with asthma with PCR-negative colds.

Pregnant women with asthma have more common colds during pregnancy than pregnant women without asthma, both by self-report and questionnaire. The severity of symptoms was higher in subjects with asthma with common colds than control subjects, when adjusted for baseline differences. Although PCRpositive colds were of similar severity in the two groups, virus-confi rmed colds in subjects with asthma frequently resulted in exacerbations and were associated with perinatal effects.

Previous studies in nonpregnant adults with asthma have suggested that subjects with asthma are no more 7 months; however, it was unclear if follow-up time and early deliveries had been accounted for. Asthma exacerbations also peak in the late second trimester. 5, 17 Further evidence is required to determine if this is due to a pregnancy-specifi c rise in susceptibility to infection.

One-third of PCR-positive colds were associated with exacerbations requiring medical intervention. In previous studies, 60% of cases with a positive virus identifi cation were associated with asthma exacerbation, 18 whereas cold severity was predictive of subsequent asthma worsening. 19 Viral infection is a signifi cant asthma trigger, possibly because of the infl ammatory pathways activated during infection. Understanding the relationship between viral infection and asthma 20 is important, as preventing viral infection could also prevent exacerbations. We have evidence that improved asthma management through fractional exhaled nitric oxide monitoring is associated with a reduction not only in exacerbations 11 but also in PCRpositive viral infections.

Pregnant women with asthma who had PCR-positive colds were more likely to have preeclampsia than susceptible to respiratory tract infections than subjects without asthma. 7 The evidence in the present study suggests that in pregnancy, women with asthma may be more susceptible to common colds than women without asthma but that cold symptoms associated with PCR-positive colds are similar to those in women without asthma. In a large prospective study, 14.4% of women had a common cold during pregnancy, with one-half of these colds medically recorded. 16 The CCQ we used identifi ed more common colds than selfreport, and not all of these were virus-positive by laboratory testing. The prospective nature of our study likely contributed to a high rate of reporting of common colds. It is possible that confounding by symptoms of rhinitis may have contributed to a high proportion of women with questionnaire-detected colds.

Common colds were more likely to occur in the second trimester than the third trimester in the asthma group only. Bánhidy et al 16 found that there was a lower prevalence of the common cold in the eighth and ninth months of pregnancy compared with the fi rst women without PCR-positive colds, consistent with studies suggesting an association between maternal infection (bacterial or viral) and the risk of preeclampsia, possibly due to changes in the maternal immune sys-tem. 21 Pregnant women with asthma are at increased risk of preeclampsia compared with pregnant women without asthma. [22] [23] [24] [25] No previous reports have linked asthma, preeclampsia, and viral infection during pregnancy. It .3348 n 5 21 n 5 20 n 5 51 n 5 51 Apgar at 1 min a 9 (8, 9) 8 (8, 9) .5328 9 (7, 9) 9 (6, 9) .8501 n 5 21 n 5 21 n 5 50 n 5 51 Apgar at 5 min a 9 (9, 9) 9 (9, 9) .5561 9 (9, 9) 9 (9, 9) . is possible that infl ammation associated with the response to viral infection and/or asthma exacerbation may contribute to the underlying endothelial dysfunction in preeclampsia.

There are limitations to our study. The CCQ is an unvalidated tool, which limits the conclusions we can make using this instrument, particularly since the CCQ is not validated to distinguish between viral infections and rhinitis. There was the possibility of recall bias for colds assessed retrospectively, although for the majority of pregnancy we collected data prospectively. The pregnant women with asthma had higher parity than pregnant women without asthma, which might increase their exposure to virus infections from other children. 26, 27 However, we adjusted for this as well as other confounders, such as atopy and BMI (a known risk factor for exacerbations in pregnancy 28 ), when considering the rate of colds. Our sample collection time was not ideal, with swabs collected within a median of 3 to 4 days from symptom worsening. We contacted women fortnightly by phone and sent mobile phone text reminders every other week to try to increase participation and offered home visits during colds. The CCQ covers only 2 days of the past 14, and since we did not administer it daily, it is possible colds were missed. The number of PCRpositive colds experienced by women with asthma, when adjusted for follow-up time, was not significantly different from the control group. This may be due to a lack of power, since only a proportion of common colds were tested in the laboratory, or rhinitislike symptoms and cough may be amplifi ed by asthma or pregnancy themselves, resulting in more colds being detected that were not true infections. Although we found second trimester colds to be more frequent than third trimester colds, it is possible that rhinitis of pregnancy may have contributed to this fi nding.

Common colds were more frequently reported among pregnant women with asthma compared with women without asthma. They occurred more often in the second trimester than the third, perhaps explaining the greater exacerbation risk at this time. There was an impact on maternal health, with one-third of infections associated with exacerbations requiring medical intervention. Prevention of respiratory viral infections may improve asthma outcomes during pregnancy.

Open Forum Infectious Diseases ® Febrile Rhinovirus Illness During Pregnancy Is Associated With Low Birth Weight in Nepal,"Background. Adverse birth outcomes, including low birth weight (LBW), defined as <2500 grams, small-for-gestational-age (SGA), and prematurity, contribute to 60%-80% of infant mortality worldwide and may be related to infections during pregnancy. The aim of this study was to assess whether febrile human rhinovirus (HRV) illness is associated with adverse birth outcomes.","Adverse birth outcomes, including low birth weight (LBW), small-for-gestational age (SGA), and preterm birth (PTB), contribute to 60%-80% of infant mortality worldwide [1] . Infections during pregnancy impact risk of adverse birth outcomes and congenital anomalies [2, 3] . Respiratory viruses have been recognized as significant contributors to morbidity and mortality worldwide. Influenza during pregnancy, in particular avian influenza and pandemic H1N1, has been associated with spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, and prematurity [4, 5] . A prospective randomized trial in Bangladesh and an observational US-based study each found an association between influenza immunization during pregnancy and a reduction in SGA and an increase in mean birth weight [6, 7] . An impact on LBW and PTB was additionally noted in a meta-analysis of 5 randomized trials of maternal influenza immunization [8] .

Human rhinovirus (HRV) is a respiratory virus first isolated in the 1950s and historically implicated as the etiology of the common cold [9, 10] . With improvements in molecular diagnostics, HRV has been increasingly recognized to cause serious illness requiring hospitalization and death among infants and young children, immunocompromised individuals, adults with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or asthma. Human rhinovirus has also been identified as the most common etiology of pneumonia in hospitalized adults [11] [12] [13] . However, the clinical presentation of HRV infection during pregnancy and effect on birth outcomes is not well established.

The risk of increased susceptibility and severity associated with certain infections during pregnancy is likely related to a complex interplay of the maternal-placental-fetal unit that is not well understood. It has been postulated that infection causes activation of the innate immune system stimulating the release of proinflammatory cytokines, which may underlie the pathogenesis of both PTB and LBW [14] . Identification of a relationship between HRV infection during pregnancy and adverse birth outcomes has the potential to drive improvement of diagnostics, infection control measures, and treatment options for HRV infection. METHODS We conducted an analysis using samples and clinical data collected in a community-based, prospective placebo-controlled, randomized trial of maternal influenza immunization of 3693 pregnant women and their infants conducted in rural southern Nepal from 2011 to 2014. Methods of the parent study have been previously published [15] . In brief, illness episodes were identified through longitudinal household-based active weekly surveillance of women from the second trimester of pregnancy until 6 months postpartum. Mid-nasal swabs were collected from women meeting criteria for respiratory illness episode, which was defined as subjective fever plus 1 or more symptom (cough, sore throat, runny nose, or myalgia). Fever was included in the illness episode definition as part of the primary trial of maternal influenza immunization to capture influenza-like-illness during pregnancy [3] . Febrile HRV respiratory illness was defined as a respiratory illness episode with a nasal swab with HRV detected by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay. A unique illness episode was defined as an illness episode followed by 7 symptom-free days. Only the primary HRV illness episode was included in the analysis.

Adverse birth outcomes were defined as LBW (birth weight less than 2500 grams), PTB (birth at less than 37 weeks gestation), and SGA (birth weight <10 percentile of weight for gestational age). Gestational age was calculated based on last menstrual period according to a house-to-house census conducted every 5 weeks of all women of childbearing age [16] . If a woman had a missed period, then a urine pregnancy test was performed and she was enrolled in the study if her urine pregnancy test was positive. Therefore, the last menstrual period was used to date the infant's gestational age in the study with a 5-week recall period. The frequencies of each adverse outcome were compared between infants born to mothers with febrile HRV respiratory illness during pregnancy and those without febrile HRV respiratory illness during pregnancy. Infant weights were included if they were obtained at less than 72 hours after birth. Small-for-gestational age was calculated based on the INTERGROWTH-21st criteria [17] . A composite adverse birth outcome was defined as an infant being preterm, LBW, and/ or SGA.

Real-time PCR for detection of HRV was performed as described, with the modification of a degenerate C/T base at the 3' end of the forward primer [18] . Real-time PCR for additional respiratory viruses, including respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus, parainfluenza viruses 1-4, influenza, coronavirus, bocavirus, and adenovirus, was performed using previously published methods [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] . Although the HRV RT-PCR assay has been shown to detect some enterovirus from culture lysates in which enterovirus was present in high copy numbers, this assay has not been positive when enterovirus-positive clinical respiratory specimens were tested as part of other studies and therefore less likely in this case to misdiagnose enterovirus as rhinovirus [23, 24] . Rhinoviruspositive samples collected from pregnant and postpartum women with cycle threshold values less than 30 were selected for sequencing using a previously published protocol [23] . For sequencing, previously extracted samples were used to generate complementary deoxyribonucleic acid using random hexamers, and sequencing was performed using primers targeting the 5' noncoding region. Gel-extracted amplicons were sequenced (GeneWiz) and analyzed using Sequencher 4.1 software and compared with HRV reference sequences from GenBank using the nucleotide-nucleotide Basic Local Alignment Search Tool ([BLAST] www.blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) algorithm. Trimmed sequences were aligned using Geneious R6.1 (Biomatters) and Seaview 4.4 [25] . Phylogenetic reconstruction was performed using the maximum likelihood method with 100 bootstrap replicates using PhyML 3.0 within DIVEIN [26] . Neighbor joining trees were drawn and edited using FigTree v1.4.1. Sequences were considered to be divergent genotypes if they differed from other study sequences by >2% when compared using BLAST [23] . Sequence data were not of sufficient length to be submitted to GenBank but are available upon request.

Log-linear regression was used to assess the association of baseline characteristics of pregnant women with the incidence of HRV respiratory illness during pregnancy; person-years (p-y) at risk of infection was included as an exposure. Adverse birth outcomes such as LBW, SGA, and PTB were also assessed using log-linear regression. Potential risk factors analyzed include (1) maternal febrile respiratory illness during pregnancy and, simultaneously, (2) a specific history of HRV-associated respiratory illness. For the outcomes of LBW, we also included a term indicating HRVassociated respiratory illness in the second trimester, to assess whether timing during pregnancy was influential. To avoid confounding, additional covariates included season of birth and infant sex in the analysis. The Wilcoxon-rank sum statistic was used to compare symptom duration between pregnant and postpartum women with febrile HRV as well as pregnant women who gave birth to LBW infants compared with those who did not.

Institutional review board (IRB) approval for the parent study was obtained from the Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg School of Public Health, Seattle Children's Hospital, Cincinnati Children's Hospital, the Institute of Medicine at Tribhuvan University, and the Nepal Health Research Council. Oral consent was obtained from study participants due to low literacy rates in the population. This procedure was approved by the IRB. The trial in which this substudy was conducted is registered at Clinicaltrials.gov (NCT01034254).

A total of 191 (5%) of 3693 women had a febrile HRV respiratory illness episode, 96 (50%) of which occurred during pregnancy and 95 (50%) occurred after delivery. The median person-weeks (p-w) of follow up was 51 weeks (interquartile range [IQR], 46-56) for febrile HRV respiratory illness during pregnancy and 49 weeks (IQR, 43-55) for those without HRV-associated illness while pregnant. Febrile HRV respiratory illness incidence was 58.3/1000 p-y. The incidence of febrile HRV illness while pregnant was 95 of 1497 p-y, or 64.1/1000 p-y, and incidence after delivery was 95 of 1799 p-y, or 52.8/1000 p-y (P = .51). Characteristics of women with and without febrile HRV respiratory illness during pregnancy and their infants are outlined in Table 1 . The median gestational age at infection among the febrile HRV respiratory illness group was 28 weeks (IQR, 12-39). Incidence of HRV was similar by baseline characteristics, including maternal age, maternal literacy, nulliparity, indoor biomass cookstove use, and number of children in the household. In particular, no difference in maternal body mass index was observed. In addition, no difference was observed in influenza vaccination status between the 2 groups. Other viruses detected in association with febrile respiratory illness episodes included respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus, parainfluenza viruses 1-4, influenza, coronavirus, bocavirus, and adenovirus each occurring at notably lower frequency compared with HRV.

Seventy-four of 96 (77.1%) infants born to pregnant women with febrile HRV respiratory illness and 2678 of 3597 (74.5%) infants born to mothers without HRV-associated illness were weighed within 72 hours of birth and therefore included in the assessment of LBW and SGA. Of 2752 infants with birth weight measured in the first 72 hours, 84% (2302) were taken on the day of birth. Median weight in those measured on days 2 and 3 of life was approximately 0.1 kg lower than those measured on day 1 (2.73 at day 2 and 2.69 at day 3 vs 2.80 on day 1), and the proportion determined to be of LBW increased from 24% on day 1 to 27% on day 2 to 36% on day 3. Had all 3 days observed exactly the same rate of LBW designations of 24%, it is expected then that approximately 27 infants (9 weighed on day 2 and 18 weighed on day 3 of life) would not have been determined to have LBW. With 689 infants classified as LBW, however, 27 is only 4% of that group, so this comprises a very low potential misclassification rate.

Prevalence of LBW was significantly higher among infants born to pregnant women with febrile HRV respiratory illness compared with those born to mothers with a febrile respiratory illness of another viral etiology during pregnancy, after adjusting for season of birth and gender of the infant, with a 1.6-fold increased risk of LBW ( (Figure 1 ; Table 2 ). When comparing pregnant women with non-HRV febrile viral respiratory illness to those .01) in the group of infants exposed to maternal febrile HRV illness compared with 2.80 kg (2.50-3.08) among infants not exposed to respiratory illness during pregnancy. Three HRV infections occurred in the first trimester of pregnancy, 40 in the second and 53 in the third. The lack of HRV infection in the first trimester is due to enrollment of women into the study beginning at 17 weeks gestation or later rather than lack of rhinovirus infection during the first trimester of pregnancy. Low birth weight prevalence was not affected by the trimester of pregnancy in which the HRV infection occurred (P = .91). Febrile HRV respiratory infection occurred yearround with a peak in October ( Figure 2 ) and accounted for a consistent 5% of respiratory virus infections each month. Low birth weight occurred at a monthly rate of 20%-30% (Supplementary Figure 2) . Due to the nature of enrollment, the number of patients under surveillance and therefore the numbers of samples collected were not constant over time, and this is reflected in the numbers of proportions of births and specimens tested (Figure 2 and Supplementary Figure 2) . Small-for-gestational age appeared higher among infants born to mothers with febrile HRV respiratory illness versus those with non-HRV febrile respiratory illness, although this did not reach statistical significance (34 of 74 [46.0%] vs 176 (1) Illness and symptom duration subdivided by LBW and pregnancy status are outlined in Table 3 . The median duration of illness was 5 days (range, 1-49) among pregnant and postpartum women. No difference between overall illness duration was observed when comparing women with febrile HRV respiratory infection with and without LBW infants or when comparing women with febrile HRV respiratory illness during pregnancy versus after delivery. Six women died during the period of surveillance, none of whom had febrile HRV respiratory infection.

Thirty-seven of 96 (39%) women with febrile HRV respiratory illness during pregnancy sought medical care. Overall, 7 women sought care from a physician or a hospital. Among women with febrile HRV respiratory infection during pregnancy, care-seeking behavior was similar between women who had LBW infants and those who did not (10 of 28 [35. 7%] vs 20 of 46 [43.5%]; P = .51). In this same group with febrile HRV respiratory illness during pregnancy, the proportion seeking the care of a physician or hospital was also similar by LBW status of the infant. Three of 28 (10.7%) who had LBW infants saw a physician, compared with 4 of 46 (43.5%) who did not (P = .77). Of the 3 women with LBW infants who sought care from a physician, 1 woman sought care for severe headache and fever, whereas the reason for seeking care from a physician for the 2 other women was not documented.

Of successfully sequenced (Supplementary Figure 1 ). Of these, 27 (65.8%) were from pregnant women, whereas the remainder were from women who had rhinovirus after giving birth. Species A (24 of 27 [89%]) accounted for a majority of the samples sequenced, whereas Species B and C accounted for 2 of 27 (7.4%) and 1 of 27 (3.7%), respectively. Among women who gave birth to LBW infants, 6 of 7 (86%) were Species A and 1 of 7 (14%) were Species B. However, the proportion of samples sequenced compared with the total was small. Eleven (11%) pregnant women with HRV had an additional respiratory virus detected including coronavirus (n = 2), human metapneumovirus (n = 5), adenovirus (n = 1), and bocavirus (n = 2), and respiratory syncytial virus and bocavirus (each, n = 1). Coinfections occurred at equal frequencies among mothers with and without LBW infants (3 of 28 [11%] vs 6 of 46 [13%], respectively; P = .77). The association between LBW and febrile HRV-illness episode remained when infants born to mothers with febrile HRV with viral coinfection illness episodes were excluded from the analysis (RR, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.1-2.4; P = .0089). No HRV-associated respiratory illness was found in association with influenza coinfection.

Over a 3-year period of prospective active home-based weekly surveillance in a rural subtropical setting, we characterize the incidence of febrile respiratory illness due to rhinovirus in pregnant women. Limited data exist examining the relationship between HRV infection during pregnancy and adverse birth outcomes. In this study, we found that pregnant women with a febrile HRV respiratory illness were at 1.6-fold increased risk to have a LBW infant, compared with pregnant women without HRV illness.

Several aspects of the study design allowed for an accurate assessment of the impact of febrile rhinovirus illness during pregnancy on adverse birth outcomes. The study was conducted in a region of the world where PTB and LBW are common. In addition, in a setting with limited antenatal care and frequent home births, birth weight was measured within 72 hours of birth in the majority of infants. Dating of gestational age was performed using last menstrual period obtained through 5-weekly surveillance for pregnancy in women of childbearing age, leading to more accurate dating of gestational age compared with recall of last menstrual period at time of birth. Finally, intensive active weekly home-based respiratory illness surveillance allowed for collection of daily symptom data, and specimen collection in temperature-stable buffer permitted detection of rhinovirus and other respiratory viruses by sensitive molecular assays.

Similar to other subtropical regions, we found that febrile HRV respiratory infection occurred year-round with a peak in October and a nadir in June. Low birth weight has been shown to vary by season due to factors such as food insecurity [27] ; however, we observed a relatively steady rate of LBW among infants born to women without febrile HRV respiratory illness ranging from 20% to 30% without significant fluctuations.

Pregnant women are at high risk for severe complications due to influenza, with increased rates of morbidity, mortality, and adverse fetal outcomes most clearly demonstrated with 2009 pandemic H1N1 [28] . Previous studies, including a study in our region, showed that febrile respiratory infection due to RSV was rare during pregnancy [29] . Limited data exist regarding the clinical presentation and severity of rhinovirus illness among pregnant women. Human rhinovirus accounts for 18%-26% of cases of viral pneumonia in hospitalized children and was detected in approximately half of children admitted to the intensive care unit for lower respiratory tract infection [30, 31] . In adults, HRV is the most frequent cause of community-acquired pneumonia requiring hospitalization in the United States [12, 32, 33] . We find that 39% of women with rhinovirus infection sought care for their illness, and that 7% of these were seen by a physician or at a hospital. This compares to an international study of community-based elderly adults, where 15% of those with rhinovirus illness were hospitalized [34] .

The relationship between febrile rhinovirus infection during pregnancy and LBW has not been well studied. Low birth weight is the result of either preterm delivery or poor growth of the fetus resulting in intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR). Rates of PTB did not differ in women with and without febrile HRV respiratory illness during pregnancy, suggesting that IUGR was the primary mechanism leading to LBW associated with HRV during pregnancy. We did not find a significant effect of febrile rhinovirus illness during pregnancy on PTBs or SGAs. We note that approximately half (52%, or 719 of 1380) of infants with any poor outcomes are affected by only 1 of 3 adverse birth outcomes (LBW, PTB, or SGA); and only 41 (1%) of infants are affected by all 3 adverse birth outcomes. Of 688 infants with LBW, 76% are also SGA (compared with 25% of 2063 who are not LBW but are SGA). Likewise, of 688 with LBW, 26% are also preterm (compared with only 8% of 2063 who are not LBW but are preterm). Therefore, although there is evident correlation between these outcomes, they are not completely overlapping. Therefore, these outcomes are defining distinct populations and, in our study, may demonstrate different associations with risk factors.

Factors associated with IUGR, including low socioeconomic status, literacy, parity, poor nutritional status, smoking, and alcohol use, were similar between the groups with and without rhinovirus in our study [35] . Nepal has one of the highest rates of malnutrition in South Asia, with up to 41% of the general population having evidence of undernourishment [36] . More importantly, in our study, pregnant women with and without HRV-associated respiratory illness had similar mean body mass indices of 21 at the time of enrollment, suggesting that poor nutritional status associated with chronic illness is unlikely to be the etiology of the association with LBW.

We also note that febrile illness during pregnancy alone was not associated with an increased risk of LBW in our study. Of mothers with febrile non-HRV respiratory illness, only 24% of the infants were LBW, which is similar to the 25% without febrile respiratory illness during pregnancy. Fever is associated with increased circulation of cytokines, in particular interleukin-8, and has been postulated to be part of the reason why women with influenza may be at increased risk of severe disease and adverse birth outcomes [3] . We did not find an effect of febrile respiratory illness without the detection of rhinovirus in this study, however, making this less likely to be responsible for the birth weight effect seen in this study.

The birth weight effect in our study additionally does not appear to be due to increased duration or severity of illness in pregnant women with LBW infants. Prolonged illness during pregnancy may be associated with decreased intake and poor weight gain. Poor weight gain in pregnancy has been associated with IUGR [37] . We find that pregnant women with rhinovirus had a median 5 days of symptoms, and that this did not differ in those with LBW or in those who had rhinovirus during pregnancy or after birth. No significant difference in hospitalizations, physician visits, or other care seeking was observed among pregnant women with febrile HRV illness who did and did not give birth to LBW infants. Because of the potential for flu vaccination to reduce risk of LBW or PTBs, we evaluated for a difference in the incidence of rhinovirus febrile illness in women who did and did not receive the flu vaccine during pregnancy. We found no difference with flu vaccination. In addition, no mothers with rhinovirus febrile illness had evidence of influenza coinfection as a potential etiology of LBW.

Limitations of our study include our lack of active surveillance for respiratory viruses among asymptomatic or afebrile women, thereby limiting our ability to discern whether LBW was more strongly associated with HRV specifically or with any respiratory illness episode and its associated inflammation. Use of subjective fever as criteria for respiratory illness rather than use of a measured temperature may have also decreased our ability to detect respiratory illnesses. We also did not conduct surveillance before 17 weeks gestation, and, therefore, it is possible that some women had infections earlier in pregnancy that we were not able to identify in our study. Gestational age dating was limited by lack of first-trimester ultrasound; however, 5-weekly prospective home surveillance minimized maternal recall error of last menstrual periods. Illness episode severity measures, such as radiographic evidence of pneumonia or use of supplemental oxygen, were not evaluated because medical records of healthcare visits were not reviewed in this study. We were also unable to assess medical comorbidities in the participants, given the lack of access to primary or antenatal care in the study region. Other limitations include lack of detection of bacterial pathogens in this study. Human rhinovirus infections have been shown to augment respiratory bacterial colonization and infection; therefore, it is possible that bacterial infections may be contributing to the described febrile illnesses and play a role in the relationship with LBW. Mid-nasal samples were only obtained once weekly, and brief episodes of viral shedding, as commonly observed in adults with pre-existing immunity, could have been missed. The association of virologic factors, such as viral load or subtype, with disease severity, were also unable to be assessed due to a lack of a method to quantify rhinovirus by our RT-PCR assay and our limited ability to sequence the majority of the isolates. The study was performed within a single geographic locale with specific demographics and risk factors, compromising generalizability. Finally, because this is an observational study, we were unable to assess for a causal association between rhinovirus febrile respiratory illness and LBW. The groups with and without rhinovirus infection were similar in baseline sociodemographics, including factors that may affect LBW or risk of respiratory viral infections, such as maternal parity, maternal body-mass index, maternal literacy, household smoking, household density, and running water.

In conclusion, we demonstrate that HRV is the most common cause of febrile respiratory illness in pregnant women in rural southern Nepal during our study period, and that HRV during pregnancy was associated with an increased risk of LBW. Because LBW infants have an increased risk of mortality compared with their heavier counterparts and HRV is a highly prevalent respiratory virus, this may represent a potential modifiable risk factor to reduce risk of LBW infants, particularly in developing countries. Interventions to reduce the burden of febrile respiratory illness due to rhinovirus during pregnancy, such as measures to improve infection control, development of targeted therapies, or improvement of diagnostics, may have a significant impact on LBW and subsequent infant mortality worldwide.

Postnatal Infections and Immunology Affecting Chronic Lung Disease of Prematurity,KEYWORDS,"Each year, approximately 1 in 9 infants in the United States, more than 440,000 infants yearly, are born prematurely (<37 weeks gestation). 1 These infants suffer from complications of exposure to a diverse environment at a time in development when the respiratory tract and immune system are intended to be protected and maintained in a relatively naïve intrauterine state. During infancy and early childhood, premature infants suffer significant inflammatory and infectious respiratory morbidities with extended negative consequences for health, quality of life, and health care costs.

As compared with approximately 8% of full-term newborns, 17% of late-preterm (LPT, born at 34 0/7-36 6/7 weeks) and 30% to 40% of early preterm infants (EPT, born at <32 weeks) are rehospitalized within the first year of life, most commonly for viral respiratory infections. [2] [3] [4] Respiratory infections that are less severe, not requiring hospitalization, are even more common, recurrent and, in total, costly in the very young. 5 The incidence and severity of respiratory tract infections in infants younger than 1 year is attributed at least in part to immune immaturity, a problem magnified by preterm birth and influenced by genetic traits and environmental exposures. Differences in gastrointestinal tract colonization patterns and the development and balance of the intestinal microbiome have been shown to influence immunologic development in fullterm infants, and have begun to be evaluated in the premature. [6] [7] [8] Viral infections, either subclinical or severe, may also alter immunologic development both directly and by altering the bacterial microflora. Preterm infants are exposed to maternal and hospital-based flora, frequently with additional pressures of antibiotics, indwelling catheters, and tubes, that alter the establishment of diverse, health-promoting microbiota on the skin and respiratory mucosa, as well as in the gastrointestinal tract, and increase the risk of invasive disease with predominant organisms.

Recurrence of respiratory symptoms in the first year of life correlates inversely with gestational age at birth, directly with in utero exposure to inflammation (chorioamnionitis), and with non-white race. The pathogenesis of chronic lung disease of prematurity, bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), has been recently reviewed and is closely correlated with in utero inflammation, oxygen toxicity, ventilator-induced trauma, and prealveolar lung development at birth (Fig. 1) . [9] [10] [11] Premature birth induces a slowing or arrest of lung development that underlies BPD and likely occurs in a spectrum of severity in all prematurely born infants. Perinatal therapeutic and environmental exposures, most notably oxygen exposure and environmental tobacco smoke, have been reproducibly related to chronic respiratory morbidity, independent of mechanical ventilation and Pryhuber the diagnosis of BPD. A recent study of very low birth weight (VLBW) infants without BPD demonstrated significant relationships between an integrated estimate of oxygen exposure in the first 3 to 14 days of life and symptomatic respiratory disease (SRD) over the first year of life. 12 Lower gestational age, non-white race, greater oxygen exposure, and chorioamnionitis significantly increased the odds ratio of infants having SRD. A recent murine model demonstrated that early neonatal exposure to hyperoxia dramatically increases, in a dose-responsive manner, the severity of influenza infection when induced in adulthood, with markedly enhanced inflammation and fibrotic repair. 9, 10 These observations, and an increasing understanding of the preterm infant immune system, as well as their exposures, colonization, and infections with microorganisms, suggest that interventions to modify the immunologic response may significantly improve respiratory and general outcome for these children. This article reviews prenatal and postnatal exposures that induce lung inflammation in preterm infants in the context of unique susceptibility factors that occur because of premature delivery.

Several lines of evidence suggest that the inflammatory response of the fetal or premature lung to injury or infection, if not causative of disease, exacerbates the severity of chronic lung disease in infants at risk. 11, 13 Recent reviews highlight the current understanding of the role of inflammatory mediators and the immunobiology of BPD. [14] [15] [16] Increased levels of proinflammatory mediators in amniotic fluid, 17,18 early tracheal effluents, 19-24 lung tissue, 23 and serum 25,26 of at-risk premature infants support a role for both intrauterine and extrauterine inflammation in the development and severity of BPD. Airway and bronchoalveolar lavage samples demonstrate increased inflammatory cells and multiple proinflammatory mediators in ventilated, oxygen-exposed infants progressing toward BPD. 19-23 Genome-wide expression profiling of BPD lungs, as compared with gestational age-matched controls, identified 159 differentially expressed genes. 27 Pathway analysis identified cell cycle, immunodeficiency signaling, and B-cell development pathways associated with BPD. In addition, of the top 25 differentially expressed gene sets, 9 were related to chymase-expressing mast cells, the presence of which was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and immunohistochemistry. Consistent with active inflammation, the transcription factor, NF-kB, a prototypical regulator of inflammation and cell survival, was elevated in neutrophils and macrophages in preterm infant airways, correlating with the presence of Ureaplasma urealyticum and need for prolonged mechanical ventilation. 28 Interestingly, NF-kB activation in fetal lung and fetal lung macrophages has been shown to inhibit airway morphogenesis and activity of fibroblast growth factor 10, a critical factor in lung development, linking inflammation to the growth arrest of the preterm lung. 29,30 Several animal models demonstrate that mediators of inflammation, including endotoxins, tumor necrosis factor a (TNF-a), and transforming growth factor a, enhance lung maturation but also impair alveolar septation and vascular remodeling, and thus contribute to the development of BPD even without frank tissue destruction. [31] [32] [33] Proinflammatory stimuli come from multiple sources in the premature infant both prenatally and after birth. The most common causes are considered next.

Once thought to be sterile, modern molecular techniques independent of culture demonstrated that amniotic fluid and placental tissues frequently contain microbes. 34-40 Maternal-fetal inflammation is clinically identified as chorioamnionitis by Immunology and Chronic Lung Disease maternal fever with one or more of maternal/fetal tachycardia, maternal leukocytosis, uterine tenderness, and/or foul amniotic fluid. A recent study, using amniocentesis to sample amniotic fluid of 46 mothers with signs and symptoms of clinical chorioamnionitis, detected microorganisms by culture and/or PCR/mass spectrometry, frequently more than one microbe, in 61%. 41 Fifteen percent had neither inflammation nor infection and 24% had amniotic fluid evidence of inflammation without detectable microorganisms, suggesting other noninfectious causes of clinical symptoms. Of those with clinical chorioamnionitis, 51% to 62% also have histologic evidence of placental inflammation. 41, 42 Severity of acute histologic chorioamnionitis has been correlated with amniotic fluid matrix-metalloproteinase-8 and interleukin (IL)-6 levels supporting the presence of active inflammation. 43, 44 It is not uncommon, however, to have evidence of acute histologic chorioamnionitis without detectable microorganisms, ranging from 30% to more than 50%. The cause of ""sterile inflammation"" of the fetal-placental tissues may be noninfectious disease or lack of sensitivity for microbial detection. Inflammatory placental lesions of a more chronic form, characterized by lymphocytes, plasma cells, and macrophages, sometimes eosinophils, also occur in association with preterm birth and recurrent placental failure. Most frequently, these lesions are of unknown etiology. 45 Chorioamnionitis has been associated with chronic lung disease of prematurity in multiple small series 46 and in focused studies of specific organisms, such as Ureaplasma. 47 In experimental models, chorioamnionitis caused by intra-amniotic injections of endotoxin or Ureaplasma initially cause fetal lung inflammation followed by persistent low-grade inflammation and evidence of enhanced lung maturation. [48] [49] [50] A more aggressive inflammatory response to oxygen or mechanical ventilation in newborns with a history of chorioamnionitis has been suggested in animal models 51 and some clinical reports. 52 The severity of the fetal inflammatory response to infection, as indicated by amniotic fluid IL-6, is inversely related to gestational age, suggesting that more premature infants are at greater risk of inflammatory injury. 44 The most common organisms isolated from infected amniotic fluid and placentas are Ureaplasma parvum and U urealyticum. Likewise, it is relatively common to identify these organisms in the bodily fluids of preterm infants. Compelling evidence for an association between pulmonary Ureaplasma colonization and BPD in preterm infants has been recently reviewed. 53, 54 Further details and discussion of clinical trials for treatment of Ureaplasma found in respiratory secretions of preterm infants are reviewed by Viscardi and Kallapur. 55 However, the role of chorioamnionitis as a risk factor for BPD remains controversial and recently debated. 56, 57 Several large studies question the relationship of in utero infection to chronic lung disease. As part of the Extremely Low Gestational Age Newborns (ELGAN) Study, exhaustive placental bacterial cultures were done from deliveries at 23 to 27 weeks of gestation. 58 There was no correlation between placental culture results and the phenotypes of the infants assessed by oxygen need at day of life 14 or the development of BPD. The Canadian Neonatal Network also reported that 3094 infants born at less than 33 weeks' gestation exposed to clinical chorioamnionitis had no increase in the incidence of BPD. 59 Further, Lahra and colleagues 60 reported, using a 13-year experience from Sydney, that a fetal inflammatory response was protective for BPD.

These and other similar studies demonstrate that clinical or culture-proven chorioamnionitis are not good predictors of BPD. Chorioamnionitis/infection has a major association with preterm premature rupture of membranes and preterm labor at early gestations. 61, 62 Also, chorioamnionitis is associated with inflammation in lungs of preterm infants soon after birth 63 and causes lung inflammation and altered immune modulation in animal models where the type and duration of fetal exposures can be controlled. 64 Clinically, variation in detection and virulence of causative organisms, as well as in the duration of infection and the maternal-fetal inflammatory response, complicates the determination of effect on outcomes. The assessment of influence on preterm infant chronic lung disease is further confounded by the imprecise diagnosis of BPD. 65

As outlined in Fig. 1 , there are a number of other maternal-fetal-placental abnormalities that alter lung growth and/or induce fetal inflammation. The association of maternal preeclampsia, placental insufficiency, and associated intrauterine growth restriction with BPD, however, remains controversial, with some studies suggesting increased and others decreased or no effect. [66] [67] [68] [69] [70] [71] [72] Antenatal corticosteroids enhance fetal lung maturation and likely reduce inflammation but, although one study suggested that corticosteroids reduced BPD in those with histologic chorioamnionitis, overall they have had little effect on rates of BPD. 73 

Many exposures in the postnatal period promote inflammation. 52

Both oxygen and mechanical ventilation, together and independently, induce inflammation via direct cellular injury, induction of cytokines and chemokines, recruitment of neutrophils and macrophages, and oxidation of DNA, lipids, and proteins. Oxygen toxicity and barotrauma or volutrauma are important hazards of mechanical ventilation that are associated with the release of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines that cause pulmonary injury. 74 Higher levels of cytokines correlate with more prolonged duration of ventilation. 74 Supplemental oxygen also contributes to inflammation through biochemical pathways of oxidant stress. [75] [76] [77] Bacterial Infection and Sepsis Sepsis beyond the first days of life is frequent in extremely low birthweight (ELBW) infants at risk of BPD and often presents with respiratory instability. 60 Both early and late microbial presence in neonatal lung fluid samples was significantly associated with the development of chronic lung disease, suggesting that both antenatal and postnatal infection play a role in the development of disease. 24 Numerous studies associate postnatal sepsis, both early-onset and late-onset and typically with common infectious agents, such as coagulase-negative Staphylococcus and gram-negative bacteria, with BPD, suggesting that sepsis-induced inflammation compromises lung development and healing. 52, [78] [79] [80] [81] [82] Administration of intravenous immunoglobulin, however, although associated with a small reduction in sepsis, was not shown by meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials to reduce the incidence of BPD. 83 

Broad respiratory virus surveillance in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) is a relatively new approach augmented by more readily available culture-independent methods of detection. Previous NICU viral studies targeted patients with threshold symptoms. With this approach, small pandemics of viral infection, such as with adenovirus or respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) were detected, but the overall infection rate in

NICUs appeared relatively low. 84 As example, using a symptom-based testing strategy, viral infection was confirmed in 51 (1%) of 5396 infants admitted to the NICU; of these, 20 (39%) had an enterovirus/Parechovirus infection, 15 (29%) RSV, 5 (10%) rotavirus, 3 (6%) cytomegalovirus (CMV), 2 (4%) adenovirus, 2 (4%) parainfluenza virus, 2 (4%) herpes simplex virus, 1 (2%) rhinovirus, and 1 (2%) rubella virus. 85 Recent data, including that from our collection of expedited autopsy human neonatal distal lung tissue, suggest a relatively high prevalence of lung viral infections in those who succumb to respiratory failure in the NICU; 21 of 63 samples tested were virus positive (Ref. 86 and data not shown). Coronavirus, rhinovirus, parainfluenza, and CMV were detected by reverse-transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR). Interestingly, in this small postmortem sample, RSV, influenza A and B, parainfluenza type 1, and metapneumovirus were not detected.

Surveillance studies using PCR and genomic sequencing for detection have begun to report a closer to true incidence of nosocomial viral respiratory infections (NVRI) in neonates and children hospitalized in pediatric intensive care units and NICUs. In a NICU surveillance study, nasal brush samples were taken weekly from all neonates (age 28 days) and children (age >28 days) hospitalized through a winter viral season. Of a total of 120 patients enrolled (64 neonates and 56 children), 20 patients were virus positive by PCR (incidence 16.7%). Seven positive samples for human coronaviruses were detected (incidence 11%). Risk factors for NVRI in the neonates were duration of hospitalization, antibiotic treatment, and duration of parenteral nutrition (P<.01). 87 A 1-year NICU surveillance study of infants born at less than 33 weeks' gestation, using PCR detection of 17 viral subtypes, identified at least one positive respiratory virus during the hospitalization in 26 of 50 subjects, most asymptomatic. Testing positive was associated with longer length of stay and length of mechanical ventilation, as well as diagnosis of BPD. Similar ongoing studies should determine if viral infection is such a common occurrence in the NICU as to warrant more frequent surveillance and development of interventions to reduce exposure and illness.

Human CMV, a Betaherpesvirinae virus, latent in leukocytes, is highly prevalent in the human population; approximately 50% of adults are CMV seropositive and 60% of mothers of preterm infants. Congenital, in utero, infection of the fetus occurs in 0.1% to 2.0% of all pregnancies and may arise through primary infection of the mother, reactivation during pregnancy of a latent infection or reinfection with a different strain of CMV. Postnatal, the virus is spread even more efficiently from mother to the newborn via breastmilk. Because it reactivates in 95% or more of CMV-seropositive women in the postpartum period and can be detected in breastmilk as early as 3.5 days after delivery, CMV is a relatively common viral infection of the newborn period. 88 Transmission to full-term newborns is reported in approximately 40%, whereas in preterm infants it varies from 6% to 55%, potentially due to differing strains, use of fresh/frozen milk, and maternal factors affecting viral shedding. 88 A surveillance study of 175 NICU neonates, testing serum CMV-titers and CMV-DNA, demonstrated an overall prevalence of CMV of 12.6%. Ten (5.71%) of the infants had congenital infection, whereas 12 cases (6.86%) had perinatal infection. 89 Postnatal infection in the newborn can be detected by molecular diagnostics as early as 12 days of life. Infection remains clinically silent in most, but 9% to 12% of postnatally infected low birth weight preterm infants have been reported to demonstrate severe, sepsislike infection. 90 Although infants at lower gestational age are at increased risk of developing symptoms with postnatal infection and are also at greatest risk of BPD, there remains relatively little evidence of cause and effect. Prosch and colleagues 91 found approximately 29% of VLBW infants with BPD to be CMV positive, but 12% of those without BPD. This study and others have found postnatal infection symptoms in preterms to be transient and to have no effect on neonatal outcome including BPD or necrotizing enterocolitis. 92, 93 A review of PubMed articles describing CMV pneumonitis, however, concludes that CMV infection can be protracted with diffuse interstitial pneumonitis associated with fibrosis and BPD. 94 It would appear that more surveillance and outcome studies are needed to determine if a causative relationship exists and if anti-CMV therapy or methods to reduce transmission of CMV to the fetus and neonates could effectively reduce disease.

Interestingly, CMV has a notable influence on the human immune system inducing a substantial cytolytic CD81 T-cell population. 95 CMV infection in infants induces the differentiation of not only phenotypically mature cells, but also functionally active cells that produce interferon gamma (IFN-g) on restimulation. 96 Serum cytokine concentrations measured in CMV congenitally infected infants show evidence of a strong Th1 bias with a predominance of IFN-g, IL-2, IL-12, and IL-8 production and diminished IL-4. 97 Because the generation of IFN-g secreting T cells and CD81 effector cells is associated with successful recovery from viral infections in general and RSV in particular, such data suggest that CMV infection in infancy could be beneficial. There is, however, concern that CMV-induced immuno-ageing of lymphocytes may ultimately result in immunosuppression suggested by poor vaccine response in the elderly. 98 

Recurrent wheezing in later childhood has been associated with infections with RSV, metapneumovirus (hMPV), parainfluenza (PIV), rhinovirus, and human coronavirus NL63. [99] [100] [101] [102] [103] RSV infections have best demonstrated that effects of viral respiratory tract infections in infancy may be long-lived. In premature infants born at less than 32 weeks' gestation, with and without BPD, those with a history of RSV lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) were found to have more days of cough and wheeze at merely a marker for children with more severe preexisting lung disease, as has been suggested for term infants (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01789268). This question is important when evaluating selective vaccine strategies to prevent severe LRTI and chronic disease.

The immune system is a double-edged sword: too little response and microbes invade and injure, too robust a host response may result in bystander injury and disease. In addition to exposure to infectious agents, there appear to be certain intrinsic factors that result in enhanced inflammatory responses in some individuals as adult, child, or preterm infant, when compared with others. There is evidence to suggest that preterm infants may be affected by both relative immunosuppression and more robust immune responses than full-term infants. We conclude this article with a review of susceptibility factors identified or suggested to enhance inflammation in the prematurely born.

Genetics that predispose to shortened pregnancy, especially if related to increased inflammation, naturally increase the risk of inflammatory lung disease of prematurity. For example, elevated mid-trimester vaginal IL-1b is associated with increased risk for spontaneous preterm birth. Homozygous carriers of IL1RN*1, a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra) gene, a genotype associated with elevated IL-1b, are at increased risk for preterm birth and an example of genetic polymorphisms that affect the innate immune system and risks of prematurity. 110 In women who had a preterm birth, the combination of clinical chorioamnionitis and IL-10 (-1082)*G allele was associated with an increased risk for delivery before 29 weeks' gestation, suggesting a geneenvironment interaction. 111 In infants, twin studies suggest significant genetic susceptibility to BPD. 112 Relative to inflammation, genotype analysis, after multiple comparisons correction, revealed 2 significant SNPs, rs3771150 (IL-18RAP) and rs3771171 (IL-18R1), in African American individuals with BPD (vs African American individuals without BPD; q <0.05). No associations with Caucasian BPD, African American or Caucasian respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), or prematurity in either African American or Caucasian individuals were identified with these SNPs. 113 Functional polymorphisms in the promoter of NFKBIA that encodes IkBa, a negative regulator of NF-kB, is associated with differential susceptibility to severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia, as well as other common inflammatory diseases of infant lung. 114 A number of additional studies, evaluating exome sequencing in extremes of disease, epigenomic regulation, transcriptome responses to exposures such as hyperoxia, and pathway analyses are ongoing to identify gene and gene regulatory susceptibility factors involved in pathogenesis of BPD.

Recent developments in miniaturization of technologies, including assays based on polychromatic flow cytometry, multiplexed protein assays, and low-input transcriptional analyses, have begun to advance the field of neonatal immunology. Dowling and Levy 126 provide a recent review of both in vivo and in vitro approaches to studying early-life immuno-development, as well as a summary of unique characteristics of the preterm and term innate and adaptive immune systems.

The innate immune responses of full-term infants, including the function and recruitment of granulocytes, natural killer (NK) cells, and antigen-presenting cells are characterized as immature and functionally suppressed. 126 Innate immune responses in human preterm infants have been less well characterized. 127, 128 Fetal cells, including NK cells, have enhanced sensitivity to the immuno-suppressive effects of transforming growth factor beta. 129 Early-life antigen-presenting cells tend to produce more IL-6, IL-10, and IL-27, predominantly immunosuppressive cytokines. Intriguingly, a recent study has in addition suggested that CD711 nucleated red blood cells (erythroid precursor cells) that are typically increased in fetal blood, especially in pregnancies complicated by placental insufficiency, appear to suppress phagocyte and antigen-presenting cell stimulus-induced TNF-a production suggesting an immunosuppressive function. 127 Lymphocytes and the adaptive immune system provide a critical defense against intracellular, including viral, infections. Reduced CD41 T cells result in impaired immune response to pathogens. CD81 T cells and NK cells provide protection from viral infection but also contribute to immunopathology by contact-dependent effector functions (eg, perforin and FasL). IFN-g and, particularly, TNF-a are thought to be primary perpetrators of T-cell-mediated lung injury, yet are also important for antimicrobial defense. 130 The fetal and neonatal periods are unique immune developmental stages in which adaptive responses are highly plastic and dependent on gestational age. 131, 132 Although relatively little literature refers to detailed phenotyping of lymphocytic maturation in the prematurely born infant, investigators have numerically evaluated classes of lymphocytes in the human fetus and young child. The total circulating white cell counts increase through the latter half of gestation until term delivery and then decrease slightly to adult levels. The percentage of lymphocytes decreases from approximately 80% at 18 to 36 weeks (median 26 weeks) to 40% at term delivery to 21% in the adult human, based on cord blood sampling at delivery or cordocentesis. 133, 134 The proportion of CD31 cells, however, increases with gestational age and in the presence of an infection. In normal pregnancies, circulating CD41 T-cell numbers are inversely related to gestational age and the fetal percentage of CD81 T cells was reduced, increasing before term (9.5%-15.7%) such that CD41/CD81 ratios also vary inversely with gestational age, higher in VLBW infants than full-term. 135, 136 Maternal disease may alter fetal lymphocytes. Preeclampsia had a significant effect on T-cell distribution associating with fewer CD41 cells and CD41CD81 double-positive cells, decreased CD41/CD81 ratios, reduced Th2 and regulatory T-cell subsets in cord blood, whereas maternal betamethasone therapy also associates with higher CD31 cell proportion and a lower proportion of NK cells. 137, 138 Evidence for Lymphocytic Abnormalities in Premature Infants with Lung Disease Several lines of investigation suggest a role for dysregulation of CD41 responses in BPD. In animal models, T cells accumulate in the lungs of preterm lambs exposed to lipopolysaccharide in utero 139 and preterm baboons that develop BPD were found to have abundant CD41 T cells in the lung parenchyma. 140 Significant infiltrates of T cells were noted in distal lung of infants who died with BPD as compared with gestational age-matched infants without lung disease. 141 In serial blood samples from premature infants with RDS born 1200 g and less than 30 weeks' gestation, Ballabh and colleagues 142 demonstrated a reduction in absolute lymphocyte count, as well as the percentage and the absolute number of CD41 T cells, in those who progressed to BPD (P<.03), significant even on day 1 of life. More activated T cells in those who go on to develop BPD may reflect sequestration and activation of cells within the lung. 142, 143 CD41 T-cell percentage continued to decrease with postnatal age. Berrington and colleagues 144 measured lymphocyte subclasses in premature infants just before first immunizations. At 7 to 8 weeks of age, prematurely born infants had lower absolute lymphocyte, T-cell, B-cell, and T-helper cell counts, and lower CD41/CD81 T-cell ratio, than term infants, as well as increased proportion of Tregulatory (Treg) (CD41CD251) cells and decreased CD45RA 1 naïve cells. By 6 months, the B-cell population had numerically normalized but T-cell abnormalities persisted.

Recent studies have challenged the concept that CD31 T-cell responses are uniformly impaired in neonates, especially in preterm infants. Although most of the newborn CD41 T cells are naïve, activation markers like CD25, CD69, and CD45RO1 are enhanced on CD41 cells of prematurely born infants. 145 Likewise, the proportion of cord blood CD81 T cells that are CD45RO1, suggesting activation, is also higher at lower gestational age. 146 Several reports now demonstrate a correlation between T-cell activation, as measured by CD45RO expression, and premature infants' adverse outcomes, such as BPD, necrotizing enterocolitis, and periventricular leukomalacia. 25,142,147 CD41 and CD81 T cells at lower gestational age are also shown to have enhanced cytokine production with in vitro stimulation, suggesting that enhanced CD45RO expression in preterms is accompanied by inducible effector functions that may contribute to the severity of lung disease. 146, 148 A report that regulatory CD41 T cells (CD41CD25 hi FoxP31CD127Dim) were significantly reduced in cord blood of preterm infants who developed BPD further raises the potential for enhanced inflammation due to reduced inhibitory control. 148 It has been suggested that the relatively activated CD41 and CD81 T-cell phenotype at early gestational ages is reminiscent of recovery from bone marrow ablation in adults and represents rapid homeostatic expansion in a lymphopenic host. 147 Further, intra-amniotic administration of IL-1beta to rhesus monkeys at 80% gestation resulted in reduction in frequency of Treg cells in lymphoid organs, whereas Th17, IL-17A-producing, cells were increased, potentially linking in utero innate immune activity to inflammatory lymphocyte-mediated injury. 149 Some insight into potential T-cell immunopathology in BPD may be gained from animal and adult models of inflammatory lung disease. In a baboon model of BPD, thymic involution, increased peripheral T cells carrying markers of maturation, robust nonspecific cytokine secretion, and increased autoreactive CD41 T cells in the lung interstitium, were associated with an increase in bombesin-like peptides (BLP). 140, 150 Treatment with a neutralizing antibody to BLP corrected the thymic and lung pathology seen in preterm baboons treated with 100% oxygen. 140 BLP is also elevated in preterm human infants with BPD, 151 suggesting a mechanism linking lymphocyte dysregulation and BPD.

The degree of lung and immune system maturation at the time of infection influences cytopathogenic responses to virus and perhaps bacteria but also appears to set a trajectory of immune response to subsequent challenge. Newborn mice infected with RSV have, compared with mice infected at a slightly later age, increased bronchoalveolar lavage fluid numbers of Th2 type CD41IL-41 cells and fewer CD41IFN-g1 cells when reinfected in adulthood. 152 Likewise, mice infected with influenza A within 1 week of birth showed enhanced airway hyperreactivity, chronic pulmonary inflammation, and diffuse emphysematous-type lesions as adults. An adaptive immune insufficiency was most apparent in the neonatal CD81 T cells. Newborn infection was associated with reduced and delayed IFN-g responses as compared with infection in older animals. RSV-infected neonatal mice recruited CD81 T cells defective in IFN-g production in association with mild symptoms. Reinfection as adults, however, resulted in limited viral replication but enhanced inflammation and T-cell recruitment, including Th2 cells and eosinophils. 153, 154 Depletion of CD81 T cells (but not CD4) cells during the primary neonatal infection was protective against the adult challenge. Recall responses from neonatal-primed and adultprimed mice were associated with IFN-g secretion, indicative of a Th1 response. However, IL-4 and IL-5 secretion were enhanced only in neonatal-primed mice. Rechallenge of these mice, primed as newborns, was also associated with increased concentrations of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), macrophage inflammatory protein-1a (MIP-1a), and RANTES in the lung. It is suggested then that neonatal T cells, in particular IFN-g-deficient CD81 T cells, play a crucial role in regulation of immune responses after neonatal infection. In these neonatal animal models, adoptive transfer of naive CD81 cells, from wild-type but not from IFNg-deficient donors, significantly lowered pulmonary viral titers and greatly improved pulmonary function as adults, supporting the importance of IFN-g secreting CD81 T cells in determining disease outcome. 155 A strong argument has now been advanced that childhood wheezing and atopy are related to reduced cord blood IFN-g. In a study of infants predisposed to asthma and atopy, less robust mitogen-induced or specific antigen-induced IFNg and IL-13 responses from cord blood cells were associated with more wheezing episodes in the first year of life in children infected with RSV and rhinovirus. 156 In the Childhood Origins of Asthma (COAST) Project, cytokine-response profiles of cord blood and 1-year mononuclear cells stimulated in vitro identified that cord blood IFN-g responses were inversely related to the frequency of viral respiratory infections and wheezing in infancy while enhanced IFN-g responses at 1 year correlated positively with the frequency of preceding viral infections. 157 Severity of asthma has been associated with excessive IFN-g production, particularly by CD81 T cells, potentially reflecting the cytotoxic effect of the cytokine. These data suggest that neonatal IFN-g responses influence subsequent antiviral activity. Conversely, the frequency of viral infections in infancy can influence IFN-g responses.

Neutralizing antibodies provide important antiviral protection in infants. Higher RSV neutralizing antibody titers in both premature and term infants are associated with protection from infection and LRTI, an effect also supported by the success of palivizumab in preventing severe RSV disease in premature infants. 158 Transplacental transfer of maternal antibodies is inversely related to length of gestation such that the more preterm infants have relatively less humoral protection contributing to disease risk. Because viral loads of RSV, hMPV, PIV, and rhinovirus correlate with the severity of clinical disease, [159] [160] [161] [162] it is suggested that infants with a greater ability to control viral replication on first infection, via the presence of neutralizing antibody and a more robust IFN-g response, are successful in limiting excessive antigen presentation, generating protective immune responses associated with viral clearance, and avoiding immuno-pathogenesis. To date, no study has evaluated antibody and cellular immune phenotype together with viral load measurements in infants with respiratory infections. Additionally, the association between these factors and disease severity has not been explored in premature infants.

Overall, alterations in lymphocyte-related immunity occur and are dependent on gestational age, maternal influences, postnatal oxidant stress, and viral diseases. There are burgeoning data in this area in premature infants, although as yet minimal knowledge of specific mechanisms by which lymphocytes participate in respiratory outcomes in premature infants.

A developing body of research suggests that both the acquisition and maintenance of bacterial populations in the gut soon after birth are important drivers of the development of both systemic and mucosal immunity. 7 Recent advances in highthroughput sequencing technology have provided insight into the gut microbiome and are beginning to describe the diversity and dynamics of the microbial populations in both health and disease. Although the exact factors that control the interactions between the gut epithelial cells, the gut-associated lymphoid tissue, and the gut microbiome are not yet clear, all 3 components appear to play a significant role in the induction of immune tolerance to luminal bacterial antigens and the maintenance of homeostasis. Proposed mechanisms identified in animal models include the blocking of innate signaling via Toll-like receptor-4, the development or expansion of Fox P31 Treg cells, and enhanced IL-10 production in the gut induced by commensal bacteria. 163, 164 The presence of specific species of bacteria also may be crucial to the development of gut tolerance as suggested by the relatively decreased amounts of Bacteroides, Bifidobacterium, and Lactobacillus species in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. 7 Additionally, the timing of acquisition of gut bacteria may be critical for the positive effects on health. Neonatal IL-10-deficient mice exposed to bacterial antigens had delayed development of colitis at 18 weeks of age compared with those not exposed. Decreased IFN-g and IL-17 production in explanted intestinal tissue and spleen cells following stimulation with gut bacteria also suggests that exposure of the neonatal immune system to antigens of the microbiome is associated with both mucosal and systemic immune tolerance. 8 These findings may be especially relevant to the preterm infant in view of recent data showing an inverse relationship between antibiotic therapy and parenteral nutrition with fecal diversity in the infants born at less than 29 weeks' gestation. 165 A recent study in elderly adults also suggests improved protection from influenza infection with oral provision of a Bifidobacterium longum species. 166 Attention has recently turned to determining the microbiome of the respiratory tract in premature infants. The conventional theory that the lower airways are sterile has been challenged by identification of organisms in the deep lung of adults and now infants and children, initially, not surprisingly associated with diseases such as cystic fibrosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and asthma, but also now as a ""normal microbiome"" in healthy patients. [167] [168] [169] In preterm infants, Lohmann and colleagues 170 described nonsterile tracheal aspirates with a predominance of Acinetobacter in samples taken at intubation in the delivery room, and a persistent decrease in diversity of organisms over the first month of life in those who went on to develop BPD. Early sustained airway bacterial colonization in infants less than 1250 g at birth and intubated for at least 3 weeks was detected within 7 days of life, dominated by Staphylococcus and Ureaplasma. 171 Ongoing studies promise further longitudinal intestinal and respiratory microbiome and viral infection data and correlations to respiratory outcomes in preterm and full-term infants (Clinicaltrials.gov: NCT01607216 and NCT01789268, funding U01HL101813 and HHSN272201200005C, respectively).

That the microbes, the bacteria, viruses, fungi, and others, that flourish on human skin and mucosa affect the metabolism, immune system, health, and disease of their host is becoming more clear. Just what those effects are in the premature infant and how they affect susceptibility to infections and alter respiratory outcomes is an important area of current research.

Disease Associated with Equine Coronavirus Infection and High Case Fatality Rate,Background: Equine coronavirus (ECoV) is associated with clinical disease in adult horses. Outbreaks are associated with a low case fatality rate and a small number of animals with signs of encephalopathic disease are described.,"E quine coronavirus (ECoV) infection was initially reported in neonatal foals (≤2 weeks of age) with and without clinical signs suggestive of enteritis. 1, 2 Outbreaks of ECoV are described in adult horses at racing facilities and boarding stables. [3] [4] [5] Descriptions of outbreaks of ECoV infection involving breeding farms and young horses (<1 year of age) are not reported.

Case fatality rates in the outbreaks have ranged between 0 and 7%. [3] [4] [5] In a case series of four boarding stables, two of the horses that died had acute onset of neurologic disease. A definitive cause for the neurologic signs is not determined, but authors speculated that hyperammonemia had contributed to the death of these horses. 3 Fecal shedding of ECoV after infection occurs in a median of 4 days (range of 3-9 days). 3 However, more information is needed to confirm this finding as longer periods of shedding could lead to unanticipated disease transmission if quarantine periods are ended prematurely. In addition, a high viral load has been associ-ated with adverse outcome in people with respiratory coronavirus infection, 6 but this has not been demonstrated in horses.

The purpose of this study was to describe the epidemiological and clinicopathological features of two outbreaks of ECoV infection that likely originated at a large equine competition and subsequently spread to two separate locations in Idaho and California. The high case fatality rate, documentation of hyperammonemic encephalopathy, and association between viral load and death has not been previously reported.

Both reported outbreaks from California (CA) and Idaho (ID) initially involved horses that had recently returned from the American Miniature Horse Association World Show in Texas in October, 2013. Clinical examination findings were recorded at presentation for veterinary care.

In each outbreak, initial cases of ECoV infection were confirmed by real-time PCR on feces. The PCR assay was based on the detection of a specific 142 base-pair product of the N gene of ECoV. 3 Viral load was reported as genome equivalents per gram of feces. A plasmid was constructed with the 142 bp amplicon and 10-fold dilutions were used to obtain the slope and y-intercept for load calculations. The equation is the absolute value of the CP-y intercept/slope. Furthermore, a real-time PCR assay targeting a universal sequence of the bacterial 16s rRNA gene was used as quality control (ie, efficiency of DNA purifications and amplification) and as an indicator of fecal inhibition. 7 After identification of ECoV in affected horses, subsequent screening of the remaining horses in the herd was completed. Repeated testing was performed daily on six horses from the CA outbreak until at least three consecutive negative samples were obtained. Other common enteric pathogens of horses, including Salmonella enterica, Clostridium difficile, Clostridium perfringens, Lawsonia intracellularis, and Neorickettsia risticii were also investigated in feces of four of the sick horses by specific PCR. 3 

Complete blood cell count and biochemical panels were performed on 8 horses. Blood ammonium concentration was measured in 6 ECoV-infected horses with clinical signs. For a complete list of variables that were evaluated refer to Table 1 .

Data are reported as median (range). A Mann-Whitney test was used to compare viral load between horses testing positive for ECoV that died versus those horses that survived. Significance level was set at P < .05.

Available clinical examination and clinicopathological data for animals from both outbreaks (CA and ID) are combined in Table 1 . The total number of horses in each farm was 19 (CA) and 8 (ID). ECoV testing was performed with all horses for a total of 27 animals from both farms combined (19 from CA and 8 from ID). Fifteen of the animals (56%) tested positive. 10 of the 15 animals (67%) testing positive (6 from CA and 4 from ID) manifested clinical disease including but not limited to colic, fevers, lethargy, and inappetance, while 5 (33%) of 15 positive animals remained asymptomatic. Four of the horses positive for ECoV (27%) tested negative for S. enterica, C. difficile, C. perfringens, L. intracellularis, and N. risticii.

In the CA outbreak, the first horse displayed clinical signs including fevers (39.2°C), lethargy, and inappetance approximately 9 days after leaving the competition. Over a 5-day period, 2 additional horses that had not attended the show displayed similar clinical signs (fevers up to 39.2°C) and were quarantined as a group for approximately 14 days. At the end of the quarantine period, the horses were returned to the herd and approximately 3 days later, another individual with severe clinical signs died. Despite isolation and enhanced biosecurity protocols at the farm, 7 other animals tested positive for ECoV over the next 12 days. These animals showed a range of clinical signs from no significant changes to fevers, lethargy, and mild colic.

In addition to the initial animal that died in transport to the hospital, an 11-year-old miniature horse mare died during hospitalization. She initially was presented for veterinary care with mild signs of colic, but had a normal rectal temperature (37.6°C), increased heart rate (60 bpm), and increased respiratory rate (30 bpm). Initial blood work showed leukopenia (990 cells/lL) because of lymphopenia (640 cells/lL) and neutropenia (340 cells/lL), and hyperlactatemia (3.3 mmol/L). Eight hours after examination, the mare exhibited circling, head pressing, nystagmus and decreased pupillary light reflex. There was hyperlactatemia (12.7 mmol/L) and severe hyperammonemia (677 lmol/L, reference range ≤63 lmol/L). Over a 2-hour period, clinical signs progressed and the mare became recumbent, developed respiratory and cardiovascular arrest, and died.

Both horses that died in the CA outbreak were submitted to the California Animal Health and Food Safety Laboratory in Davis, CA for complete postmortem examination (data not shown). In both animals, small intestinal content tested positive for ECoV by PCR. In the first animal that died, there was severe, diffuse necrotizing enteritis. In the second animal with hyperammonemia, there was Alzheimer Type II astrocytosis in the cerebral cortex.

Serial testing for ECoV was completed for 6 horses that tested positive in the CA outbreak. The mean shedding time was 3.5 days, however one horse continued shedding for a total of 11 days (range 2-11 days). The daily fecal sample collection began on the first sick day (first day that clinical signs were observed), but healthy individuals were not repeatedly tested. In the CA outbreak, 3 animals had clinical signs compatible with ECoV infection approximately 2 weeks before the remaining animals became symptomatic. PCR testing was not performed at that time and these 3 horses tested PCR negative for ECoV at the time the resident horses developed disease.

In the ID outbreak, resident farm horses displayed clinical signs of disease including decreased appetite, lethargy, and fevers ≤38.9°C approximately 2-3 days after show horses returned from competition (American Miniature Horse Association World Championship Show). The 4 horses that returned from the show did not exhibit clinical abnormalities. A total of 7 horses tested fecal positive for ECoV on real-time PCR. Of these 7 horses, 4 (57%) had clinical signs of disease whereas 3 (43%) animals did not have clinical abnormalities. The first horse had signs of lethargy and anorexia 48 hours after exposure to the show horses. This horse was severely ill by 60 hours post exposure. Clinical signs in affected horses included fevers up to 38.9°C (three horses), tachycardia (one horse), encephalopathic signs (circling, head-pressing, and/or nystagmus in two animals), and lethargy (all horses). Of the 4 horses with abnormal clinical signs, 2 (50%) died during the course of disease. A miniature donkey (one of the animals that died) displayed signs of rapidly progressive nystagmus, decreased mentation, and recumbency. The donkey presented for veterinary care 36 hours after the onset of clinical signs, but because of rapid progression over the next 12 hours, the donkey was euthanized. The other animal that died, a miniature horse, developed an acute decrease in packed cell volume from 33% to 16% with ulcerations of the oral mucosa and tongue.

Maximum viral loads measured in the feces for each horse (n = 15) had a median of 9.7 9 10 6 (1.2 9 10 4 to 2.4 9 10 9 ) ECoV genome equivalents per gram of feces with a corresponding Cp value of 27.10. Horses with ECoV that died had a significantly higher viral load as compared to horses that survived (P = .02). The median viral load was 9.5 9 10 4 (1.1 9 10 4 to 1.4 9 10 7 ) ECoV genome equivalents per gram of feces in survivors with a corresponding Cp value of 33.93. This compared to horses that died 2.9 9 10 7 (1.4 9 10 7 to 2.4 9 10 9 ) with a corresponding Cp value of 25.01. The specific mortality rate for the 2 outbreaks combined was 15% (4/27). This was calculated as the number of animals that died divided by the number of all animals. The number of animals testing positive for EcoV that died was 27% (4/15).

In addition to the severe hyperammonemia documented in the animal that died, blood ammonium was measured in 5 other animals that tested positive for EcoV and no other animals had values outside of the reported reference range ( Table 1) and none of the other tested animals displayed any neurologic abnormalities.

The proportion of positive animals that died (27%) in this report is higher than the case fatality rate reported in previous outbreaks (7%). 3 The deaths did not occur in stressed show horses, but in resident horses. The increased rate could reflect the virulence of the ECoV strain, host or environmental factors.

Amount of viral particles being shed in manure was evaluated in horses. While the 4 animals that died had variable viral loads, as a group they were statistically significantly higher than surviving animals. The miniature horse that died in the ID outbreak initially had a low viral load despite significant clinical disease, but had a much higher viral load on the second fecal sample submitted. In human coronavirus infections, clinical outcome and death are highly correlated with viral load. 8 Results in this group of horses suggest that viral load in ECoV infection is related to case fatality as well.

Two of the 4 deaths described in a previous outbreak were associated with the onset of signs of encephalopathic disease. 3 Hyperammonemia may have been responsible for the neurological signs and contributed to the death of the horses. 3 The current study documents a fatal case of hyperammonemia associated with ECoV infection. It is possible that hyperammonemia could be common when encephalopathic signs are present in horses with ECoV and that severe cases are associated with an increased risk of death.

Severe hyperammonemia is likely because of increased ammonia production within or absorption from the gastrointestinal tract. Reports of equine hyperammonemia have speculated that overgrowth of urease producing bacteria and increased absorption might contribute to the increased levels of ammonia. 9,10 Early treatment for presumptive hyperammonemia might be prudent, if there is a high suspicion for an ECoV outbreak with associated encephalopathic signs in cases where testing of ammonium levels is not readily available.

Idiopathic equine hyperammonemia has been reported in case reports and retrospective case series. 9, 10 The majority of these reported cases had clinical signs consistent with ECoV infection (inappetance, depression, fever, colic, and diarrhea). Some of these cases have occurred as outbreak situations. Some of these cases of previously reported idiopathic hyperammonemia could have been associated with ECoV infection.

Further study would be needed to determine if younger animals or certain breeds are more severely affected. The recent studies have described outbreaks in larger boarding stables or competition barns in full sized horses. [3] [4] [5] Four of the horses in the present study were tested for other common enteric pathogens and were negative, but the findings of the paper would have been stronger if all other horses had been tested for other pathogens. EcoV was commonly identified as a coinfection with other pathogens in foals with diarrhea. 1 To the authors' knowledge, this has not been described in adult horses.

Fecal shedding in this study was as long as 11 days in one animal, compared to 9 days in a previous study. 3 The presumed initially infected animals were quarantined for 14 days after the cessation of clinical signs in CA. After return to the herd, other animals became sick within a few days. This suggests that fecal shedding could have occurred for longer than 14 days. If confirmed, this would indicate that longer quarantine periods might be needed for animals returning from competition or being newly introduced into the herd. One horse in the ID outbreak that was initially negative on PCR for ECoV despite showing clinical signs. This could have been because of the ileus and delayed passage of manure exhibited by this horse. That the horse was positive on retesting shows the importance of repeat testing in horses that are negative initially, particularly if they are not passing normal amounts of feces.

In conclusion, these outbreaks of ECoV were associated with younger animals, a higher case fatality rate, and a longer fecal shedding period. Severe hyperammonemia was recognized in one animal with acute encephalopathic signs and death. If acute neurologic signs develop, hyperammonemia should be suspected and treated aggressively. In addition, viral load might be a factor to consider when determining prognosis.

The Impact of Respiratory Viral Infection on Wheezing Illnesses and Asthma Exacerbations,"The etiology and morbidity associated with asthma are thought to stem from both genetic factors and potentially modifiable environmental factors, such as viral infections. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] Although it is unclear whether respiratory viral infections cause asthma, observational studies have demonstrated a high rate of asthma in children with a history of severe viral lower respiratory tract infections during infancy, and viruses are the associated with the majority of asthma exacerbations among both children and adults. This review will discuss the pathogens associated with virus-induced wheezing illnesses during infancy and early childhood, the association of bronchiolitis during infancy with an increased risk of childhood asthma, and the association of respiratory viruses with asthma exacerbations in older children and adults.","respiratory infections associated with wheezing include respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), rhinovirus (RV), influenza, parainfluenza (PIV), adenovirus, and more recently identified viruses such as human metapneumovirus (hMPV) and human boca virus (hBoV). [11] [12] [13] [14] RSV causes epidemics of bronchiolitis and typically circulates in temperate climates during November to April with peaks in the winter months. [11, 15, 16] In tropical climates peaks are related to temperature and level of rainfall. [17] RSV infects the majority of children during their first year of life and essentially all children show evidence of RSV infection by age 3 years. [18] The initial RSV infection is typically the most severe, causing lower respiratory tract disease, such as bronchiolitis, in 20% to 30% of infants. [11, 18, 19] Other viruses such as RV, PIV, and adenovirus circulate nearly year-round with seasonal peaks of illness. [10, 11, 19, 20] Although RSV has long been identified as the major cause of infant bronchiolitis, the use of molecular techniques such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays, has allowed for more sensitive detection of RV and other viruses in respiratory infections. [21, 22] RV circulates yearround with major peaks during the autumn and spring, is a leading cause of upper respiratory tract infections, and most children show evidence of having had an RV infection by age 2 years. [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] Although, RV historically was thought to be limited to the upper respiratory tract, investigations have demonstrated that RV can infect the lower airways, is associated with infant bronchiolitis, and becomes a more dominant pathogen in wheezing illness as children get older. [13, [28] [29] [30] 

Observational studies have described the viral etiology of bronchiolitis and/or wheezing illnesses in infants and very young children (Table 1) . [11, 13, 14, 19, 20, [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] The first descriptive studies of the viral etiology of bronchiolitis in the 1960-80s primarily used detection methods such as cell culture, antigen detection, and serologic testing. Kim and colleagues studied the epidemiology of RSV infection in infants and young children admitted to a children's hospital in Washington, D.C. from 1960 to the mid-70s and found that 40% of children with bronchiolitis had evidence of infection with RSV. [11] In a Norwegian study 1972-1979, the authors used immunofluorescence (IF) and/or cell culture to investigate the epidemiology of respiratory viruses in young children admitted to the hospital with respiratory illness. [31] Of the 979 infants diagnosed with a respiratory virus infection, RSV accounted for 58% of all diagnosed infections, and 87% of RSV infections were associated with lower respiratory tract illness. The study also described the typical distribution of known viruses at the time, including the winter epidemics of RSV, Influenza in the late winter and spring, and the seasonal distribution of RV with peaks in the autumn and spring. [31] Using multiple virus detection methods including PCR, Jartti and colleagues investigated the etiology of wheezing illness in 293 hospitalized children in Finland, September 2000 through May 31 2002 . Of the 76 infants studied, RSV (54%) was the most common virus detected, followed by picornavirus (42%) and HMPV (11%). [34] Calvo and colleagues studied consecutive respiratory admissions of 382 children less than 2 years of age to a single hospital in Spain from September 2003 to July 2005. In total, nasopharyngeal samples were obtained in 340 children. Among the 244/340 subjects (71.7%) in whom virus was isolated, RSV accounted for 41.5%, RV 34.8%, adenovirus 8.3%, influenza 6.5%, and hMPV 5.9%. In children in whom RV was detected, recurrent wheezing and bronchiolitis were the leading diagnoses. [36] Birth cohorts-Cohorts of children recruited at birth have allowed longitudinal follow-up of children, including those with less severe disease that did not require hospitalization. In the Tucson Respiratory study, a birth cohort of 1,179 infants enrolled May 1980 to January 1985, Wright and colleagues described the epidemiology of LRTIs during infancy. [38] Overall, 80% of infants were followed through the first year of life. In total, 348 children contributed 460 LRTIs evaluated by physicians, among which 292 respiratory cultures were obtained at the initial illness. The cumulative incidence rate of lower respiratory tract illnesses in the first year of life was 32.9/100 children. One percent of infants were hospitalized for their illness. IF and viral culture were employed to detect infection by RSV, PIV 1-3, influenza A and B, adenovirus, enterovirus, cytomegalovirus, and rhinovirus. An infectious agent was identified by viral culture in 193/292 (66%) of the available samples obtained from infants with lower respiratory tract illness. RSV accounted for 65% of the 183 first bronchiolitis diagnoses. [38] Other viruses detected in infants with bronchiolitis diagnoses included PIV 1-3 (14%), Influenza A and B (4%), and adenovirus (2%). An Australian cohort of 263 infants with at least one parent with doctor diagnosed atopy, recruited infants from July 1996 to July 1999 and followed them through the first year of life. [39] Nasopharyngeal aspirates and detailed information were collected prospectively during acute respiratory illnesses and PCR was used to identify viral respiratory pathogens. Acute respiratory illnesses associated with wheeze or ""rattly chest"" were classified as lower respiratory infections. Of the 329 lower respiratory infections, 28.9% were associated with wheeze. Rhinovirus was isolated in 45% of ""wheezy"" lower respiratory infections, and RSV in 16.8%.

Newly identified respiratory viruses-The role of newly identified viruses, such as hMPV and hBoV, in infant wheezing illnesses is still being defined. [12, 14, [41] [42] [43] Williams and colleagues investigated the role of hMPV in lower respiratory tract infections in children enrolled at birth and followed to age 5 years in a vaccine clinic. HMPV, first identified in 2001, was detected in 20% of 248 available samples obtained from children with lower respiratory tract illness in which no respiratory pathogen was previously detected. [12, 44] HMPV therefore accounted for 12% of lower respiratory tract illnesses in this cohort of otherwise healthy young children. [12, 44] Kesebir and colleagues used available respiratory specimens submitted to a hospital-based clinical virology laboratory (January to December 2004) to investigate the prevalence of hBoV, first identified in 2005. [14, 45] HBoV was detected in 5% of the study samples which were obtained from children less than 2 years of age and negative for other viruses, although testing for RV was not performed. Wheezing illness was associated with approximately 50% of the hBoV-associated cases. [14] Allander and colleagues found hBoV as the sole virus isolated in approximately 5% (12/259) of respiratory samples from children <3 years of age who were hospitalized with acute wheezing. [43] In general, the use of sensitive molecular techniques has confirmed the major role of RSV in infant bronchiolitis, broadened the role of viruses that were previously difficult to detect by culture, and allowed for the identification of new respiratory viruses. Furthermore, studies using PCR have demonstrated that while RSV appears to be the virus most commonly associated with wheezing in infants, RV plays a more prominent role after the age of 2 to 3 years. [30, 46] The increasing importance of RV in wheezing illnesses in older children-Epidemiologic studies in infants and children have highlighted the importance of RSVassociated wheezing in infants and RV-associated wheezing in older children. [30, 46, 47] Rakes and colleagues conducted a cross-sectional study of 70 children who presented to the emergency department with wheezing compared to 59 controls who presented to the ED with non-respiratory complaints, between January 1993 and April 1994. Respiratory viruses were isolated in over 82% of the wheezing children less than 2 years of age. RSV was the most common virus detected in children less than 2 years of age (68%) and was not detected in any control subjects. However, in the children less than 2 years of age, similar proportions of nasal aspirates from those with wheezing and controls were positive for RV (41%). In the children older than 2 years, viruses were detected in 83% of wheezing children. RV was detected by PCR in 71% of the wheezing older children compared to 36% of the non-wheezing controls. RSV was detected in 6% of the wheezing children who were 2 years or older. In addition, the authors found that 48% of the wheezing children who were 2 years or older had a positive test for RV and a measured marker of atopy compared to only 5% of the respective control group. [30] In a similar one-year study (2000) (2001) , 133 children (2 months to 18 years) admitted to the hospital for wheezing were compared to 133 age-matched controls admitted without wheezing. [46] In the younger children, virus was detected in 84% of the wheezing children compared to 54% of the respective controls. Consistent with other studies, RSV was the predominant virus in the younger children during the winter. However, RV was detected more frequently in young children hospitalized for wheezing during April through November. Among children older than 3 years, a respiratory virus was significantly more likely to be detected in children admitted for wheezing, than children without wheezing. RV detection was significantly associated with wheezing. In addition, wheezing was strongly associated with atopy, as measured by total IgE and skin testing, in the children older than 3 years. These studies highlight the different pathogens associated with wheezing illnesses by age and the association of RV and atopy with wheezing in children beyond infancy.

The association between bronchiolitis during infancy and the development of asthma has been an area of interest for decades. [4, [48] [49] [50] [51] [52] [53] [54] [55] [56] [56] [57] [58] [59] [60] [61] [62] [63] [64] [65] [66] [67] [68] [69] [70] [71] [72] [73] [74] [75] Most, but not all, previous studies have primarily included case infants who were hospitalized with bronchiolitis during infancy. Therefore studies examining wheezing only after hospitalization for bronchiolitis during infancy may not reflect the outcomes of the large majority of infants with bronchiolitis who have only outpatient visits, emergency department visits, or no healthcare visit at all. [76] Although several early studies focused solely on RSV bronchiolitis or were conducted before routine testing for RV was available, more recent studies have used PCR to investigate the association of non-RSV bronchiolitis and subsequent wheezing. [63, 67, 70, 71, 75, 77, 78] Therefore the diverse group of research investigations in this area includes case infants in whom the specific viral agents of bronchiolitis were not determined, case infants with only RSV bronchiolitis, or case infants with either RSV or non-RSV bronchiolitis. Overall, there is convincing evidence from several cohorts that RSV and RV bronchiolitis during infancy are risk factors or markers for subsequent wheezing within the first decade of life. [48, 56, [66] [67] [68] [70] [71] [72] 75] Hospitalization for bronchiolitis during infancy and the association with recurrent wheezing and asthma during childhood.

RSV bronchiolitis-As RSV is known to be a major cause of bronchiolitis during infancy, several early cohorts included case infants who were hospitalized with RSV bronchiolitis during infancy. [66, 71, 72, 79] Sigurs and colleagues studied the relationship between RSV hospitalization during infancy and asthma in a small cohort of Swedish children. [71, 72] This prospective study included 47 children hospitalized with RSV bronchiolitis during infancy and 93 matched controls. The authors defined the study outcomes as: ""asthma"" (3 or more episodes of bronchial obstruction verified by a physician), ""recurrent wheezing"" (3 or more episodes of bronchial obstruction not physician verified) and ""any wheezing"" (asthma, recurrent wheezing, or one or two episodes of wheezing). At age 7.5 years, approximately one-third of children with a history of severe RSV bronchiolitis were diagnosed with asthma and these children were significantly more likely to have a diagnosis of asthma than their non-hospitalized controls. [71] Despite the relatively small size of this cohort, at age 13 years the increased risk of asthma remained among children with a history of severe RSV bronchiolitis during infancy. [72] RSV bronchiolitis and non-RSV bronchiolitis-Historical data also demonstrate the increased risk of wheezing or asthma after non-RSV bronchiolitis and emerging data suggests that children with a history of LRTI with viruses other than RSV may have an even greater risk of subsequent wheezing. As early as the 1960s, in a study of hospitalized children less than 5 years of age, Simon and colleagues speculated that children with non-RSV bronchiolitis had a predisposition to develop asthma. [80] Murray and colleagues conducted an investigation of 73 children with either RSV or non-RSV bronchiolitis hospitalization during infancy and a retrospectively recruited non-hospitalized control group. [69] The authors found that the children hospitalized for bronchiolitis during infancy were more likely than controls to have wheezing (42.5% vs. 15.0%) at 5.5 years. [69] In addition, wheezing by parent report (34% vs. 13%) and use of bronchodilators (33% vs. 3%) at 9 to 10 years after the initial bronchiolitis episode were more common in children with a history of a bronchiolitis hospitalization. [48] Fjaerli and colleagues found that a group of 57 children hospitalized with bronchiolitis during infancy, whether RSV+ or RSV−, were more likely to be under a doctor's care for asthma at age 7 compared to a retrospectively recruited, non-hospitalized control group of 64 children. [68] Piippo-Savolainen and colleagues also found that children hospitalized for bronchiolitis in the first two years of life were more likely to have asthma in young adulthood. [81] In a subset of participants, Piippo-Savolainen and colleagues found that adults with a history of non-RSV bronchiolitis during the first two years of life were at greater risk of developing asthma than a comparison group with a history of RSV bronchiolitis. [64] In a cohort of 81 children, Kotaniemi-Syrjänen and colleagues investigated the relationship of non-RSV bronchiolitis during the first 2 years of life and the subsequent risk of asthma around age 7 years. [67] They found that an RV positive hospitalization for wheezing during the first 2 years of life was associated with a four-fold increased risk of asthma around age 7 years compared to non-RV hospitalizations. Finally, Garcia-Garcia and colleagues found an increased risk of early childhood asthma in children previously hospitalized with hMPV (23 children) or RSV (32 children) bronchiolitis compared to a control group hospitalized with gastroenteritis (38 children). [63] Overall, this data suggests that viral LRTI with viruses other than RSV are associated with as high or even higher risk of childhood asthma then RSV-associated LRTI.

Birth cohorts-There are a limited number of longitudinal investigations of viral infections during infancy and subsequent wheezing that have followed infants from birth, with the goal of prospectively identifying and investigating the spectrum of acute respiratory illnesses during infancy and early childhood on the risk of developing asthma. [70, 75, 82] These studies have allowed for the investigation of the association of viral LRTI that did not require hospitalization with subsequent wheezing. In the cohort of children enrolled at birth in the Tucson Children's Respiratory Study, Stein and colleagues found that children with a history of RSV LRTI in the first 3 years of life were 3.2 times more likely to have parental report of infrequent wheeze (1-3 episodes of wheezing in past year) and 4.3 times more likely to have frequent wheeze (>3 episodes of wheezing in the past year) at 6 years, compared to infants with no LRTIs in the first three years of life. [4, 70] However, the association of RSV LRTI during infancy and infrequent and frequent wheeze decreased with age and neither were significant at age 13 years. At age 13 years, 517 of the 888 children (58%) followed for the first 3 years of life were included. The authors suggested that although RSV LRTI during early childhood was a risk factor for recurrent wheezing, it was not a risk factor for atopic asthma.

Lemanske and colleagues found that an RV wheezing episode during infancy was the strongest predictor of persistent wheezing in preschool years among children enrolled in the Childhood Origins of Asthma Study (COAST). [75] The COAST cohort is different from the Tucson cohort in that it includes only children with an increased risk of developing asthma. [2] All of the children in the cohort have at least one parent with respiratory allergies and/or physician diagnosed asthma. The authors found that children with at least one moderate to severe RVassociated wheezing illness during infancy had a 6.6 increased odds of subsequent wheezing in the 3 rd year of life and those with RSV had a 3.0 increased odds of wheezing in the 3 rd year of life. [75] In the combined moderate-severe illness group without wheezing, there was an increased risk for wheezing in the third year of life (OR 3.9, 95% CI 1.1 -15). Data from this study is the first to show that, particularly in genetically susceptible hosts, even moderate to severe viral infections during infancy that are not associated with wheezing or hospitalization are associated with an increased risk of subsequent wheezing. [75] In another birth cohort of infants at high risk for asthma development, Kusel and colleagues found that children with a history of ""wheezy"" LRTI infections with RV or RSV during infancy were at increased risk of having wheezing at age 5 years. [82] 

A number of epidemiologic approaches have been employed to study the relationship between viral infections and asthma exacerbations ( Table 2) . [83] [84] [85] [86] [87] [88] [89] [90] [91] These approaches include comparing the prevalence of respiratory viruses detected in asthma patients with and without acute exacerbations, and comparing virus detection in patients with asthma to that in patients without asthma in community, emergency department, and/or hospital settings. In general, many studies prior to the use of sensitive molecular techniques, detected lower rates of viral infection during acute asthma exacerbations. [84, 88, 89, [92] [93] [94] More recently, the use of PCR has resulted in increased detection of respiratory viruses in patients with asthma exacerbations. [95] 

Viruses are important triggers of asthma exacerbations in children and have been detected in up to 80-85% of exacerbations in children in studies using PCR for viral detection (Table 2) . [30, 46, 84, 89, [95] [96] [97] Johnston and colleagues investigated the association of viral infections and asthma exacerbations in a 13 month longitudinal study of 108, [9] [10] [11] year old English children with reported wheeze or persistent cough. Families recorded twice daily peak flows and daily respiratory symptoms. Lower respiratory symptoms were defined and recorded as cough (day or night), wheeze (day or night), difficulty breathing/shortness of breath, or not fit to go to school because of chest problems. [95] Viruses were detected in approximately 80% of reported episodes of LRTIs with associated decreases in peak flow measurements. Picornaviruses, which include RV and enteroviruses, accounted for 2/3 of the positive samples. As a comparison, the authors tested respiratory aspirates for picornavirus from the group of 65 children who provided a respiratory sample when they were asymptomatic. The authors found that 12% of these samples were positive. In another investigation, Johnston and colleagues found strong correlations between the rates of upper respiratory tract infections, divided in half monthly segments, and rates of pediatric and adult hospital admissions for asthma as determined by ICD-9 codes. [98] These studies demonstrate the high prevalence of respiratory viruses in children with asthma and the correlation of peaks in respiratory infections with asthma hospitalizations.

The New Vaccine Surveillance Network (NVSN) is a population-based surveillance investigation of hospitalized pediatric patients ages birth to five years from two US counties. [13] Based on the 592 children enrolled October 2000 through September 2001, children with a history of wheezing or asthma had significantly higher estimated rates of RV-associated hospitalizations (25.3/1000 children) than those without a history of wheezing or asthma (3.1/1000 children), P<0.001).

with and without an acute exacerbation. [99, 100] Thumerelle and colleagues conducted a regional study of 82 French children (October 1, 1998-June 30, 1999), aged 2-16 years. In children with asthma, the authors found higher rates of virus detection among those hospitalized with an exacerbation compared to those without an exacerbation in the prior three weeks. [100] Khetsuriani and colleagues studied children aged 2 to 17 years with persistent asthma. Sixty-five children with acute asthma exacerbations and 77 children with well controlled asthma were enrolled. One or more viruses were detected in 63% of the patients with asthma exacerbations and in 23.4% of the patients with well-controlled asthma. RV was detected among 60% of case patients and 18% of controls. Symptomatic respiratory infections which were positive for at least one virus were associated with asthma exacerbations, while asymptomatic infections were not. [99] The September epidemic of asthma-Observational studies have also been used to investigate the association of respiratory viruses with asthma morbidity. An increase in asthma hospitalizations during early autumn has been noted in several countries and respiratory viruses, in particular RV, have been speculated as causative agents. [24, 91, [101] [102] [103] Johnston and colleagues investigated the etiology of the ""September epidemic of asthma exacerbations"" in a case group of 57 Canadian children with asthma who presented to the ED during the last 3 weeks of September compared to a group of 157 controls with asthma recruited from the community. [97] Although the control group did not have an ED visit, a majority reported asthma symptoms, including continuous or repeated breathing trouble, waking at night, and activity limitations. Viruses were detected in a significantly larger proportion of the children presenting to the ED than children who did not present to the ED (62% vs. 41%). Cases were also less likely to have been prescribed an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) than controls. In a separate study, Johnston and colleagues used a mathematical model to investigate the relationship between peak asthma hospitalizations in Canada and the return to school. The authors found that over the 13 study years, the average timing of the peak of asthma hospitalizations in school age children occurred 17.7 days following the return to school, with later peaks for pre-school children and adults. The authors concluded that school age children were the likely source of the etiologic agent resulting in the yearly peak in asthma hospitalizations, with a plausible hypothesis being transmission of infectious agents such RV. [104] Asthma exacerbations in adults Respiratory virus detection in adults with asthma-Viruses are important triggers of asthma exacerbations in adults and studies using PCR have detected viruses in approximately 40-50% of exacerbations (Table 2) . [90, 92, [105] [106] [107] A study by Teichtahl and colleagues included adults admitted for asthma exacerbations and matched controls admitted for elective surgery, August 1993 to July 1994. Seventy-nine patients with asthma and 54 controls were included. Overall, 37% of the adults admitted with asthma had a virus detected compared to 9% of the control group. [105] Atmar and colleagues conducted a longitudinal study of 29 adults with asthma recruited from pulmonary clinics and a cross-sectional study of a convenience sample of 148 adults who presented to the ED with an asthma exacerbation. Viruses were detected using virus specific PCR. The authors found that in the longitudinal study, 44% of asthma exacerbation were associated with a respiratory tract viral infection. In the crosssectional ED study, 55% were associated with a viral infection. RV, coronavirus, influenza, and parainfluenza were the most common viruses detected. [106] Prevalence of virus detection in adults with asthma during exacerbations and quiescence-Several studies have performed viral detection both during asthma exacerbations and subsequent follow-up. Using PCR, Tan and colleagues investigated the prevalence of viral respiratory infections in 17 adults with near fatal asthma requiring ventilatory support, 29 adults hospitalized with an asthma exacerbation, and 14 hospitalized with COPD. [108] Samples for viral detection were taken during the acute asthma exacerbation and follow-up samples were obtained 4-6 weeks after hospital discharge. During the acute exacerbation, overall 52% of the samples were positive, including 59% and 41% of the near fatal asthma and acute exacerbations respectively. In the near fatal asthma group, 47% of the viruses detected were picornavirus and 24% were adenovirus. Viral detection was positive in 7% of the 29 specimens collected 4-6 weeks after hospital admission. [108] Other studies have used molecular diagnostic techniques to investigate the role of more recently discovered viruses in the pathogenesis of asthma exacerbations. Williams and colleagues determined the prevalence of hMPV in a cohort of 101 adults at initial enrollment during an asthma hospitalization (1999) (2000) (2001) (2002) (2003) and at follow-up 3 months later. [109] HMPV was detected in 6.9% of subjects at admission compared to 1.3% in follow-up. Furthermore, none of the subjects who were positive for hMPV at admission were positive at follow-up. [109] Another study involving this cohort of patients described the prevalence of RV in patients during an acute asthma exacerbation and 3-month follow-up. [110] Over the four year study period, 21% of the cohort was RV positive by PCR during the asthma exacerbation. Seventy-six of the 101 participants completed the 3 month follow-up. At follow-up only 1.3% (one patient) were positive and none of the subjects who were RV positive during the preceding asthma exacerbation were positive at follow-up. Subjects who were RV positive were more likely to smoke cigarettes and be a nonuser of ICS compared to RV negative subjects, similar to the findings of lower use of ICS among children seen in the hospital during the September asthma epidemic associated with RV among children. [97, 110] RV clinical lower respiratory tract infections in adults with and without asthma -Corne and colleagues conducted a longitudinal investigation of RV infection by following 76 subjects with asthma and their cohabitating partners without asthma over a 3 month period (September through December 1993). [111] Subjects maintained diaries of severity of upper and lower respiratory tract symptoms and nasal aspirates were obtained from subjects every 2 weeks. Overall, there were no differences in RV-positivity between the subjects with and without asthma. However, the authors found that participants with asthma had more frequent clinical lower respiratory tract infections associated with RV than controls, 43% vs. 17% respectively. In addition, the group of patients with asthma had significantly higher severity scores (median 1 vs. 0) and longer duration of illness (median 2.5 days vs. 0 days). [111] Summary Epidemiologic investigations have provided valuable insight into the role of respiratory viruses in wheezing illnesses in children and adults. Viruses are the most important cause of lower respiratory tract infections in infancy and early childhood, and LRTIs with respiratory viral pathogens have been identified as significant risk factors for the development of early childhood asthma. RSV is an important pathogen in wheezing illnesses during infancy and appears to become less commonly associated with wheezing illnesses in older children. The newly appreciated role of non-RSV LRTI and the strong association of RV illness with a marked increased risk of future wheezing among children born to a parent with asthma suggest a differential ""asthmagenicity"" of respiratory viruses in asthma pathogenesis. Although it is unclear whether respiratory viruses induce asthma development, children with severe infections during infancy are at increased risk of subsequent wheezing, and large longitudinal studies will hopefully help answer this critical question. Knowing whether respiratory viruses cause asthma presents the hope for a new strategy for asthma prevention. In addition, viruses are important triggers of asthma exacerbations in children and adults, being implicated in the vast majority of significant disease exacerbations, and respiratory viral illness prevention would likely decrease the significant morbidity related to this common chronic disease.

"Emerging Infections and Pregnancy: West Nile Virus, Monkeypox, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, and Bioterrorism",D.J. Jamieson). Clin Perinatol 32 (2005) 765 -776 emerging infections and pregnancy 767,"In 1991, the National Academy of Science's Institute of Medicine convened a 19-member multidisciplinary panel to study the emergence of infectious disease threats. This expert panel issued a landmark report, entitled Emerging Infections-Microbial Threats to Health in the United States [1] , which described a host of factors that contribute to the introduction and spread of novel infectious diseases. In 2003, a follow-up report was issued, entitled Microbial Threats To Health: Emergence, Detection, and Response [2] . These two reports emphasize the urgent threat posed by the introduction and spread of novel infectious disease agents in the United States. Furthermore, they describe the critical role that globalization plays in the rapid and efficient spread of these infectious diseases. As global borders blur, and people, animals, food, and other products are rapidly transported, the infectious diseases that they harbor may also be 0095-5108/05/$ -see front matter D 2005 Elsevier Inc.

perinatology.theclinics.com efficiently transported to new locations. In addition to the unintentional spread of disease, we also now face the possibility of intentional disease spread by bioterrorist attacks.

As new infectious diseases, such as West Nile virus, monkeypox, and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) are recognized in the United States, there are critical questions about how these infectious diseases will affect pregnant women and their infants. In addition, the implications of bioterrorist attacks for exposed pregnant women need to be considered. In this article, the authors address the following questions for a number of infectious disease threats: (1) Does pregnancy affect the clinical course of these novel infectious diseases? (2) What are the implications for prophylaxis and treatment of exposed or infected pregnant women? (3) Are these novel infectious diseases transmitted during pregnancy, labor and delivery, or breastfeeding?

West Nile virus is a mosquito-borne flavivirus that is transmitted to humans primarily through the bite of infected mosquitoes [3] . Infection in humans is varied: it can be asymptomatic; it can result in a mild illness with fever, rash, and headache; or it can be severe, with meningoencephalitis and other neurologic sequelae, because the virus has a predilection for the human nervous system [4] . Information about West Nile virus in pregnancy is fairly limited, with only six cases of West Nile virus in pregnancy having been reported to date [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] , although the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has been tracking more than 70 pregnant women infected with West Nile virus since 2003 [6] .

There has been only one documented case of probable intrauterine infection with West Nile virus [5, 7] . A 20-year-old woman at 27 weeks gestation presented with fever, severe headache, blurred vision, abdominal and back pain, and vomiting. She was treated with intravenous antibiotics. On the fourth day of hospitalization, the patient was afebrile, but had pain and symmetric weakness in her legs. After more than 2 weeks of hospitalization, the patient left against medical advice and was readmitted 2 days later after having fallen. Electromyelography (EMG) indicated widespread involvement of the lower motor neurons. Serologic testing revealed West Nile virus-specific (WNV-specific) IgM antibodies in the serum and in cerebrospinal fluid, consistent with the diagnosis of meningoencephalitis. At 38 weeks of gestation, the patient had a spontaneous vaginal delivery of a viable infant. At delivery, WNV-specific IgM was detected in maternal serum, cord blood, infant serum, and infant cerebrospinal fluid. The infant also had WNV-specific IgM antibody in the serum. The placenta was polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-positive for West Nile virus at one of two reference laboratories. In addition, the infant had evidence of bilateral chorioretinitis and cerebral tissue destruction. This is the only reported case of documented intrauterine transmission of West Nile virus. The infant ocular and neurologic abnormalities that were noted at birth likely resulted from the infection with West Nile virus.

In another reported case of West Nile virus infection in pregnancy complicated by meningoencephalitis, there was no evidence of fetal infection, although the work-up of the infant for infection was incomplete [8] . A 28-year-old having a history of chronic hypertension and sickle cell trait presented at 16 weeks gestation with headache, neck pain, fever, nausea, and vomiting. She reported recently being bitten by mosquitoes, and WNV-specific IgM was detected in her cerebrospinal fluid, consistent with the diagnosis of West Nile virus meningoencephalitis. She was treated with antibiotics and antivirals, and required mechanical ventilation. At 32 weeks, she was induced for superimposed preeclampsia and fetal growth restriction. The infant appeared normal and did well, although a serologic evaluation for possible West Nile virus infection in the infant was not undertaken. In this case, it is likely that the maternal hypertensive disease contributed substantively to the fetal growth restriction. What is unclear is whether infection with West Nile virus could have also contributed to the fetal growth restriction.

In four other cases of West Nile virus infection in pregnancy that have been reported in the literature [9, 10] , there has been no evidence of fetal infection or fetal effects from maternal infection. In each of these cases, infant serologic testing for WNV-specific IGM was negative. In addition to the cases during pregnancy, there has also been one reported case of probable West Nile virus infection to an infant through breastfeeding [11] .

Based on the limited information reported to date, it is not clear whether pregnant women are more susceptible to infection to West Nile virus, or if they have a more severe clinical course. With the CDC now actively collecting information on cases in pregnancy, we hope that there will be additional information addressing these issues in the near future. The fetal effects of maternal infection are also unclear, with one probable case of congenital anomalies associated with intrauterine infection and one possible case of fetal growth restriction, although the growth restriction could also easily be attributed to the maternal hypertensive disease. West Nile virus is a flavivirus with antigenic similarities to Japanese encephalitis and St. Louis encephalitis [3] . Other flaviviruses have been associated with spontaneous abortion and neonatal illness, but they have not been known to cause birth defects [6] . In terms of preventing illness, pregnant women should be advised to use protective clothing, avoid outdoor exposure during times of the day when mosquitoes are most active (ie, dawn and dusk), and use insect repellants containing N,N-diethl-m-tolumide (DEET) [6] .

Monkeypox, which belongs to the orthopoxvirus group of viruses [12] , was so-called because it was discovered in laboratory monkeys in 1958 [13] .

Monkeypox was first identified as the cause of a smallpox-like illness in humans in Africa in 1970 [13] , and subsequent outbreaks were reported, including one large series of 88 cases reported from the Democratic Republic of the Congo [14] . Information about monkeypox infection among pregnant women is extremely limited, because most prior descriptions of monkeypox outbreaks in Africa do not include a description of the natural history of outbreaks among pregnant woman. One probable case of perinatal infection has been reported from Zaire. At approximately 24 weeks gestation, a pregnant woman developed a febrile illness with a rash, and monkeypox virus was subsequently isolated from a vesicular lesion. Six weeks later she delivered a 1500 g infant who had a generalized skin rash resembling monkeypox [13] .

In June 2003, the first evidence of community-acquired monkeypox infection was reported in the United States [12] . By July 8, 2003, a total of 71 monkeypox cases had been reported from six states [15] . This outbreak resulted from contact with infected pet prairie dogs, who acquired monkeypox after being housed or transported with infected African rodents. Because some of these infected pets were in households with pregnant mothers, there was concern about how to advise pregnant women [16] .

Because smallpox (vaccinia) vaccine had been reported to reduce the risk of monkeypox among previously vaccinated persons in Africa, the CDC recommended that persons exposed to a sick prairie dog or an infected person be vaccinated, regardless of their pregnancy status [16] .

Severe acute respiratory syndrome SARS is an acute viral infection with a novel coronavirus [17, 18] , which in 2003 caused outbreaks of more than 50 cases in 6 countries, but affected 25 countries [19] . The largest case series of pregnant women comes from Hong Kong, where 12 pregnant women who had SARS were hospitalized in 2003 [20] [21] [22] [23] . Three of the 12 pregnant patients who had SARS died, for a case-fatality rate of 25%. Among the 7 women who presented in their first trimester of pregnancy, 4 had spontaneous abortions between 2 and 5 weeks after onset of illness, and 2 electively terminated their pregnancies after recovery from SARS. Among the 5 women who presented in the late second or third trimesters, 4 had preterm deliveries, with 3 patients delivered by emergency cesarean section due to inadequate maternal oxygenation and 1 due to fetal distress. Two patients had evidence of intrauterine growth restriction and oligohydramnios. Six patients were admitted to the intensive care unit [22] . Among the five newborn infants, there was no evidence of clinical or serologic evidence of perinatal transmission, as assessed by SARS-associated coronavirus reverse-transcriptase PCR and viral culture on cord blood, placenta tissue, and amniotic fluid [21] . A matched study in Hong Kong [20] comparing the clinical course and outcomes of 10 pregnant SARS patients with 40 nonpregnant controls found that pregnant and non-pregnant patients had similar clinical symptoms and presentation, but that pregnant patients had evidence of more severe illness. Pregnant patients were more likely to require endotracheal intubation and admission to the intensive care unit, and they were more likely to develop renal failure and disseminated intravascular coagulopathy compared with nonpregnant patients. There were three deaths among the pregnant patients compared, with no deaths in the nonpregnant group.

Two of the eight people who had laboratory-confirmed SARS in the United States in 2003 were pregnant women [24] [25] [26] . Both had traveled to Hong Kong and stayed in the same hotel as the physician who is thought to be the source of infection for index case-patients in a variety of countries. A 36-year-old woman traveled to Hong Kong at 19 weeks gestation. Upon her return to the United States she was hospitalized for pneumonia, and subsequently required mechanical ventilation. Serum specimens were tested at the CDC and found to be positive for SARS-coronavirus antibody. She recovered and did well until 38 weeks gestation, when she underwent cesarean delivery for a complete placenta previa. The infant was normal-appearing and had no evidence of infection; however, clinical specimens from the infant were not tested for SARS coronavirus [24, 25] . The second patient in the United States was a 38-year-old who traveled to Hong Kong at 7 weeks gestation. She and her husband also stayed at the Hong Kong hotel implicated in the spread of SARS to a number of countries. Both the pregnant woman and her husband were diagnosed with SARS upon their return to the United States. The pregnant woman was hospitalized for 9 days and recovered fully from her illness. At 36 weeks gestation, she had preterm premature rupture of membranes and delivered a healthy infant without evidence of infection [26] .

Although not confirmed by the two cases in the United States, the cases reported from Hong Kong suggest that pregnant women who have SARS may have a more severe clinical course compared with nonpregnant women. In addition, SARS during pregnancy may be associated with increased rates of spontaneous abortion, preterm delivery, and intrauterine growth restriction. There has been no evidence, however, of perinatal transmission of SARS. In terms of treatment, although ribavirin has been used empirically to treat SARS, it has not been studied systematically to determine whether it is effective treatment [27] . There are concerns about using ribavirin early in pregnancy; embryocidal and teratogenic effects of ribavirin have been noted in animal studies and ribavirin is designated as pregnancy category X, indicating that it should not be used in pregnancy [28] . Although there are few data regarding use early in pregnancy, in the few women given ribavirin later in pregnancy for measles or influenza, no fetal adverse effects have been noted [29, 30] . Eleven of the 12 pregnant SARS patients in Hong Kong received ribavirin, including 6 of the 7 patients diagnosed in the first trimester [23] . It is possible that the high rates of spontaneous abortion observed in Hong Kong could be due to treatment with ribavirin rather than the SARS infection.

In this new age of heightened concern about terrorist attacks, the possibility of intentional attacks in the United States using biologic weapons has been of increased concern recently, particularly after the anthrax attacks of 2001 [31] . The Working Group on Civilian Biodefense, which is an expert panel composed of representatives from academic, government, military, public health, and emergency management agencies and institutions, has identified a limited number of biologic agents that are of particular concern. These include anthrax, smallpox, botulism, tularemia, plague, and the viral hemorrhagic fevers [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] . Physicians and public health officials have been developing strategies for how to respond to potential bioterrorist attacks, including identifying that an attack has occurred, prophylaxing those exposed, diagnosing and treating cases, and implementing containment measures to minimize the number of people exposed. It is critical that these comprehensive response plans include specific guidance for pregnant women, so that pregnant women who are exposed or who are cases can be treated appropriately. For some of these bioterrorist agents, such as smallpox, we have some information about infection in pregnancy; however, for many of these potential bioterrorist agents there is limited information about these infections in pregnancy.

Anthrax infections can be cutaneous, inhalational, or gastrointestinal, and are caused by Bacillus anthracis, an aerobic, gram-positive, spore-forming bacillus species [36, 38] . Although anthrax has been around since the time of ancient Rome [39] , information about anthrax in pregnancy is limited. There were two recent cases of anthrax infection in pregnancy reported from Turkey in 2003 [40] . In one case, a 33-year old woman at 32 weeks gestation presented with a submandibular eschar and extensive edema of the face, neck, and upper thorax. Her report of flaying a dead cow 7 days earlier was consistent with exposure, because herbivores are often infected after ingesting anthrax spores from the soil. She was treated with penicillin and prednisolone, recovered 10 days later, and delivered prematurely at 34 weeks gestation. The second case was a 29-year-old woman at 33 weeks of gestation who had a lesion on her elbow, was treated with penicillin, and delivered at 34 weeks gestation. In both cases, B anthracis was isolated from their lesions, they recovered quickly without sequelae, and their neonates did not have any evidence of infection.

There have been several other cases of anthrax infection in pregnancy from Iran and India [41, 42] . In two cases, pregnant women presented with gastrointestinal anthrax after ingesting contaminated meat. In both cases the women died from peritonitis. Of over 140 maternal death autopsies performed at a hospital in Iran, four women had anthrax [41] . There are no reported cases of perinatal transmission of anthrax in the literature, and no cases of inhalational anthrax in pregnancy.

During the anthrax attacks of 2001, which resulted in 22 cases and five deaths [38] , guidelines were rapidly developed and disseminated to address prophylaxis for exposed persons as well as recommendations for treatment. Both the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) and the CDC recommend that pregnant women who have a high-risk environmental exposure should receive prophylaxis [43, 44] ; however, decisions about whether an exposure is risky enough to merit prophylaxis for a pregnant woman should be made by public health officials, not by the woman's obstetrician-gynecologist or other care provider [44] . The first-line regimen for prophylaxis of pregnant women should be a 60-day course of ciprofloxacin. If the specific strain of B anthracis is found to be penicillin-sensitive, then a switch to amoxicillin may be considered. Due to effects on fetal bone and dental enamel, doxycycline, the other first-line agent for anthrax prophylaxis among nonpregnant adults, should be used with caution in asymptomatic pregnant women, and only when contraindications proscribe use of other drugs. If doxycycline is used in pregnant women, periodic liver function testing should be performed because of the small increased risk of maternal hepatic necrosis. Although anthrax vaccine supplies are currently limited, anthrax vaccination has been proposed as an adjunct to microbial prophylaxis for optimal postexposure prophylaxis [38] ; however, there are no animal or human safely studies of the anthrax vaccine during pregnancy, and the vaccine is not recommended for use in pregnancy [45] . For initial therapy of inhalational anthrax among nonpregnant adults, intravenous ciprofloxacin or doxycycline, along with one or two additional agents, is recommended [38] . For pregnant women, the recommendations for treatment are similar to those of nonpregnant adults, although ciprofloxacin would be generally preferable to doxycycline.

Due to its high fatality rate and its ease of transmission, as well as the general lack of immunity currently in the US population, smallpox is one of the most feared potential agents of bioterror. Smallpox is caused by variola virus, a DNA virus of the genus Orthopoxvirus, the same genus as monkeypox, cowpox, and vaccinia. Variola differs from the other orthopox viruses in that it is readily transmitted from person-to-person [35] .

Smallpox is generally more severe in pregnant women than in nonpregnant women or in men [46] . In several reports from India, pregnant women had a higher case-fatality rate and a sevenfold increased risk of a severe hemorrhagic type of smallpox compared with nonpregnant adults [47] . Rates of spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, and preterm delivery are very high among women who have smallpox [46] . In addition, congenital cases of smallpox have been reported [46] . Therefore, the potential impact that an intentional attack with smallpox in the United States would have specifically on pregnant women is particularly concerning.

Vaccinia vaccine, the highly effective vaccine against smallpox, was recommended for all US children until 1972. Currently, only those laboratory workers and health care workers at high risk of exposure are being offered vaccinia vaccination [48] ; however, vaccination during pregnancy is generally contraindicated because of documented cases of fetal vaccinia following maternal vaccination. Although pregnancy is a contraindication to routine nonemergency vaccination, in the case of an intentional attack, pregnancy should not be a contraindication to postexposure vaccination [48] . Vaccinia immune globulin (VIG) is recommended for persons who have severe, life-threatening complications from vaccinia vaccination. VIG is not contraindicated in pregnancy if severe adverse vaccine reactions occur [48] .

Several other agents, such as botulism, tularemia, plague, and hemorrhagic fever viruses, have been highlighted by the Working Group on Civilian Biodefense as potential biologic weapons. Botulism is an extremely potent biological toxin that comes from Clostridium botulinum. Once absorbed, botulism toxin binds irreversibly to peripheral cholinergic synapses and blocks acetylcholine release, causing paralysis. Recovery may take weeks to months to complete, and results from reinnervation of paralyzed muscle fibers [32] . There have been several cases of botulism in pregnancy reported in the literature. In the most dramatic case [49] , a 37-year-old woman at 23 weeks gestation who had consumed home-produced green beans was hospitalized for progressive weakness and eventual paralysis, requiring assisted ventilation for 2 months. Botulism antitoxin was administered. Although she became increasingly paralyzed, fetal growth was normal and fetal movement was apparent. She recovered fully and delivered a healthy infant at term. In another case, an Alaskan native was hospitalized at 16 weeks gestation with botulism after ingesting contaminated whitefish. After receiving antibotulism toxin, she was discharged home on the tenth hospital day. She delivered a healthy infant at term [50] . There has been no evidence to date of transplacental transport of botulism toxin to the fetus, nor have there been any reports of adverse fetal effects of maternal treatment with botulism antitoxin [49] [50] [51] . Based on limited information, pregnant women should receive the same treatment for botulism as nonpregnant adults, which consists of supportive care and passive immunization with equine antitoxin [32] .

Tularemia is a plaguelike disease of rodents caused by Francisella tularensis. For prophylaxis of tularemia after an intentional attack, ciprofloxacin, one of the two preferred regimens for nonpregnant adults, is recommended for pregnant women,. For treatment of tularemia, gentamicin, also one of the two preferred choices for nonpregnant adults, is recommended [34] .

Yersinia pestis, the causative agent of plague, is an enzootic infection of rodents that most commonly causes bubonic plague. In an intentional attack using Y pestis, the recommendation for pregnant women is to use gentamicin for prophylaxis [37] .

The viral hemorrhagic fevers, which are caused by several families of viruses, are a clinical illness associated with fever and a bleeding diathesis. Several of these such as Ebola, Marburg, Lassa, and yellow fever have been identified by the Working Group on Civilian Biodefense as potential biologic weapons [33] . There is some evidence that the mortality of some viral hemorrhagic fevers appears to be higher in pregnancy. Although there are no antiviral drugs approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for treatment of viral hemorrhagic fevers, ribavirin may reduce mortality of several of them, including Lassa fever. As previously mentioned, ribavirin is designated as pregnancy category X and is contraindicated in pregnancy; however, given the severity of the hemorrhagic fevers, the Working Group on Civilian Biodefense feels that the benefits appear likely to outweigh the risks and recommends ribavirin use for severely ill pregnant women [33] .

As we face emerging and re-emerging health threats, we will need to understand how these novel diseases will affect pregnant women. In some cases, such as SARS, the hemorrhagic fevers, and smallpox, it appears that pregnant women may have more severe clinical courses compared with nonpregnant adults. In some cases, it appears that the rapid diagnosis of the disease may be delayed due to pregnancy. For example, in one of the reported anthrax cases, there was probably a delay in diagnosis of anthrax peritonitis because the pregnancy complicated the presenting clinical picture [41] . In terms of prophylaxis and treatment of emerging diseases, in many cases, such as anthrax, tularemia, and plague, first-line therapies and postexposure prophylaxis is similar in pregnant and nonpregnant adults. Although vaccinations such as those for smallpox and anthrax are not generally recommended for pregnant women, in some cases they may be used for postexposure prophylaxis. For example, for pregnant women exposed to monkeypox or smallpox, use of the vaccinia vaccine is recommended. In some cases, such as with ribavirin, which is generally contraindicated in pregnancy due to its teratogenic and embyrocidal effects, decisions about use in pregnancy need to be carefully weighed. In the case of SARS, where treatment is generally supportive and the effectiveness of ribavirin has not been convincingly demonstrated, use of ribavirin may not be indicated. By contrast, ribavirin has been shown to be effective treatment for some of the viral hemorrhagic fevers, such as Lassa fever, and despite the risks, treatment of pregnant women may be warranted given the severity of illness. In terms of perinatal transmission, there are cases of intrauterine transmission of West Nile virus, monkeypox, and smallpox virus reported in the literature.

There are a growing number of new or newly recognized pathogens in the United States that threaten our health. As new disease threats emerge, it will be critical to evaluate and understand how these diseases affect pregnant women, so that reasonable response plans for diagnosis and treatment of pregnant women can be rapidly developed.

Viral Co-Infections in Pediatric Patients Hospitalized with Lower Tract Acute Respiratory Infections,"Molecular techniques can often reveal a broader range of pathogens in respiratory infections. We aim to investigate the prevalence and age pattern of viral co-infection in children hospitalized with lower tract acute respiratory infection (LT-ARI), using molecular techniques.","Lower tract acute respiratory infections (LT-ARI) are estimated to cause 75% of all acute illnesses and are the leading cause of hospitalization for infants and young children worldwide [1, 2] . Most infections in children and adults are caused by viruses [1, 3, 4] , including respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza virus (IV), human parainfluenza virus (hPIV), adenovirus (AdV) and rhinovirus (hRV). In the past decade, several new respiratory viruses, including human metapneumovirus (hMPV) [5] , new subtypes of human coronaviruses (hCoV) [1] and bocavirus (hBoV) [6] , have been associated with LT-ARI, though their clinical importance requires clarification. The frequency of LT-ARI cases varies with age, among other factors.

The wider availability of molecular diagnosis techniques has allowed the identification of pathogens otherwise missed using conventional methods, and their use frequently leads to detection of more than one microorganism [7] . The importance of viral co-infections in the pathogenesis of LT-ARI is unclear; furthermore, the possible impact of age on viral co-infection prevalence is, to the best of our knowledge, unknown.

In the present study we aimed to estimate the prevalence of viral co-infection in children hospitalized with LT-ARI and to assess the impact of age in the rates of viral co-infection in these children.

We conducted an observational, prospective study in Spain through a national hospital-based research network for pediatric respiratory research: GENDRES (Genetics, vitamin D and respiratory infections research network-www.gendres.org), which includes 13 Spanish tertiary hospitals. Eligible study participants were previously healthy children under 14 years of age admitted to a participating hospital with an LT-ARI diagnosis. LT-ARI was defined as any acute lower respiratory tract infection of sufficient severity to warrant admission to hospital. All types of LT-ARI were included, from bronchiolitis to pneumonia, with or without wheezing, fever, rhinorrhea or respiratory distress. A nasopharyngeal sample (aspirate/wash or swab) was obtained during admission in patients recruited between January 2011 and January 2013. A comparison cohort of 97 UK children admitted with LT-ARI, aged over 1 month, and sick enough to warrant blood tests, was recruited between 2009 and 2012 as part of the Immunopathology of Respiratory Infection Study (IRIS) at St Mary's Hospital, London. These cohorts allowed for comparison of North and South European data from two regions with different climate and healthcare systems, as well as permitting validation of the Spanish findings on coinfection rate,and overall virus frequency. In both cohorts, recruited patients were admitted to PICU or ward. The Spanish cohort study was approved by the Ethical Committee of Clinical 

Nasopharyngeal samples were obtained using a sterile feeding tube and injector for nasopharyngeal aspirate/wash or a sterile nylon swab without culture medium. Samples were kept at 4°C for up to 24 hours before storage at -80°C, pending transport on dry ice to the UK for virus detection by multiplex nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for 19 viruses: RSV; IV (A, B); HPIV types (1-4); AdV (A-F); hRV; HMPV; HCoV (NL63, 229E, OC43) and hBoV (gene targets and primer sources in Table 1 ). At the time of processing, viral material was eluted into a volume of 200 μl. Nucleic acid extracts were prepared using a QiagenMDx BioRobot. First round amplification was performed using 20 μl nucleic acid extract. Second round PCR was performed using 1 μl amplicon from first round PCR as template material. Reactions were run using a Lightcycler 480 with melt curve analysis for the detection of PCR products. Genotyping was performed by Sanger sequencing of second round PCR products when appropriate (AdV). Sequences were analysed using the BLAST algorithm.

General data are shown as percentages or means with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Fisher's exact test was used to study the association between the viruses and PICU admission. 

The GENDRES cohort had a median age of 6.4 (first quartile: 2.2, third quartile:17.0) months and a male-to-female sex ratio of 1.7. One patient was excluded due to incomplete clinical data. The cohort included nasopharyngeal samples from 204 patients: 23 (11.3%) nasopharyngeal swabs and 181 (88.7%) nasopharyngeal aspirates/wash. No differences in findings were observed in relation to the method used for sample collection (data not shown). Molecular diagnostics identified at least one pathogen in 187 samples. Of these PCR positive samples, 73 had previously yielded negative results using conventional methodology-immunufluorescence assays and/or rapid techniques. Five samples (2.5%) were negative for both PCR and the initial diagnostic work-up. In 12 cases (5.9%) where the referring hospital had established a diagnosis, PCR was negative (RSV, n = 8; IV H1N1, n = 2; Mycoplasma, n = 1; and Influenza C, n = 1). By PCR multiplex assay, a single pathogen was detected in 95 (46.6%) children and two or more pathogens were detected in 92 (45.1%) patients, giving an overall detection rate of 91.7%. The most commonly detected virus was RSV (n = 108), followed by hRV (n = 68), hBoV (n = 48), AdV (n = 39), HMPV (n = 27), IV (n = 12), hPIV and hCoV (both n = 5) ( Table 2 ). In co-infected samples, the most frequent combination of pathogens was RSV + hRV (n = 23) followed by RSV + hBoV (n = 10) and RSV + AdV (n = 7) (see Table 3 ). The virus most frequently found in dual infection was RSV (n = 42), followed by hRV (n = 35) ( Table 2) . RSV was observed with the same frequency as a single infection (n = 53) and as a co-infection agent (n = 55) (see Fig 1) . However, hRV, IV, hBoV, AdV and hMPV were more frequently found in co-infections (Fig 1) .

The UK cohort included samples from 97 patients, with a median age of 20.0 (first quartile: 7.0, third quartile: 48.7) months and a male-to-female ratio of 0.94. We identified at least one virus in 85 (87.6%) samples; in 12 samples no virus was identified. A single virus was present in 56 (57.7%) patients, and two or more viruses in 29 (29.9%) children. The most commonly detected virus was RSV (n = 35), followed by hRV (n = 24), IV (n = 23), hBoV (n = 19), AdV (n = 9), HMPV (n = 4) and hPIV (n = 6) ( Table 2 ). In the co-infected samples, the most frequent combinations were RSV + hBoV and IV + hBoV (both n = 5). The viruses most frequently found in dual infections were RSV and hBoV (both n = 12), followed by hRV (n = 9) and IV (n = 8) (Table 3) . hRV and IV were observed with similar frequencies in single infection and co-infection (hRV n = 11 vs 13; IV n = 13 vs 10), while hBoV and AdV were more frequently found as co-infections, and RSV was more commonly present as a single infection.

We compared co-infection frequencies according to age groups. In both cohorts, co-infection was found in all age groups. In the GENDRES cohort, there is a significant association between age and co-infection: in children aged 12-24 months (72.7% of infected patients; see Fig 1) and those aged 24-48 months (75.0% of infected patients; P-value = 0.001). In the UK cohort, there was also a significant association age and co-infection in patients aged 12-24 months (73.3% of the infected patients; P-value = 0.005).

In the GENDRES cohort, RSV infection affected younger children more frequently (mean age: 8.1 months; SD: 14.9) and hPIV was principally found in older patients (mean age: 40.4 months; SD: 53.5) ( Table 2 ). In the UK cohort, RSV infection also affected younger children 

There was no significant difference in the number of infections between the PICU and non-PICU cohorts. Although modest differences were found for hBoV (PICU: 15.8%-non PICU: 22.6%) and hMPV (PICU: 2.6%-non PICU: 14.0%) in the GENDRES cohort, these were not statistically significant. These differences were only observed in the UK cohort for hBoV (PICU: 16.3%-non PICU: 22.2%) ( Table 4 ). 

Multiple viruses are detected in at least one third of children hospitalized with LT-ARI. This rate reaches two thirds for patients in their second year of age.

With the introduction of molecular techniques, the detection of multiple co-infecting viruses has become common [21] , though the prevalence of each virus varies between studies. Our results show that viral co-infection is frequent, particularly in children above one year of age: children aged 12-24 months had the highest number of detected viruses, which may reflect slower clearance (and perhaps increased pathogenicity) following primary infection by a virus, and an immature immune system [3, 22] . We observed that co-infection rates were lower in older children in both cohorts, despite this group being prone to greater LT-ARI exposure through increased participation in shared childcare groups. This finding is inconsistent with two previous reports. In particular, Chorazy et al. [23] reported a non-significant increase in co-infection in children aged 6-12 months, and co-infection decreased after one year with increasing age. Peng et al. [24] reported that co-infection was more frequent in children between 3-6 years of age.

At least one respiratory pathogen was detected in 91.7% of the enrolled patients in the Spanish cohort and 87.2% in the UK cohort. This finding is in the upper end of the reported range in children (between 47% and 95%) [3, 25, 26] . Possible explanations for the wide differences in detection rates found in the literature include: (i) heterogeneity in studied populations (including genetic variability and predisposition), (ii) differences in respiratory symptoms at presentation (upper or lower respiratory symptoms), (iii) differences in the time of sampling, (iv) number of respiratory pathogens tested, and (v) the kind of diagnostic tests used [3, 22, 25] . Many patients had multiple respiratory viruses: 45.1% in the GENDRES cohort, and 29.9% in the UK cohort, which is again in the upper end of the reported range (17-41%) [3, 27, 28] .

In 12 cases there was discordance between a negative PCR and a positive diagnostic pretest. This could be due to the different time of sampling, and/or it might be due to false positives, which are known to occur more frequently in rapid tests. We also found five negative samples (2.5%) for both PCR and pretest tested pathogens. These differences might be explained by the time and mode of collection of the samples. In some patients, the initial conventional viral test was performed on hospital admission samples, whilst PCR was performed using samples obtained after the patients were transferred to PICU and recruited for the study.

Some viruses were mainly present as co-infecting agents (hRV, IV, hBoV, AdV and hMPV) and rarely found as single pathogens. As previously reported [3, 29, 30] , RSV was the most frequent pathogen in both cohorts, especially in younger children. The second virus most frequently detected by PCR was hRV. The clinical significance of a positive hRV PCR assay has been questioned, given that hRV has been detected in asymptomatic children even two weeks after the clinical symptoms had disappeared [31, 32] . However, hRV has been identified as single pathogen in some ARIs in children [21] . In our study, hRV was found in one third of samples and as single pathogen in approximately 10% of the cases.

In the GENDRES cohort, infection by both RSV and hRV was the most common viral coinfection detected, but in the UK cohort the most common viral co-infections were RSV + hBoV and IV + hBoV. These differences most likely reflect the fact that UK patients were recruited during the 2009 pandemic influenza season, but they may also reflect local differences in epidemiology and recruitment (including a higher proportion of PICU cases in the UK cohort).

Bocavirus is a recently discovered virus that may cause ARIs, particularly in children, with the highest frequency found in hospitalized infants. Our results indicate that hBoV is commonly detected in respiratory samples of young children with LT-ARI, in agreement with previous reports [33, 34] . In our study, hBoV was the third most frequently identified virus in the GENDRES cohort, after RSV and hRV, and the fourth in the UK cohort. Our detection rates in both the GENDRES and UK cohorts (23.5% and 19.6%, respectively) are higher than those in other published series, which have reported variable prevalence ranges of 1.5-19%. Methodological factors may explain these differences: our cohorts included only hospitalized children, whereas other studies included inpatients and outpatients [33, 35] . hBoV was rarely found as a single infecting agent: in most cases (87.5%) it was found together with other respiratory viruses, as previously observed [34, 36, 37] . RSV, hRV, AdV and hMPV viruses were the most frequently observed co-pathogens, as observed by other authors [38] [39] [40] .

In young children, hMPV is an important cause of bronchiolitis, accounting for 5-15% of all cases [4, 41, 42] . In our study we found 27 (13.2%) hMPV-positive samples in the GENDRES cohort. Of these, 66.7% of hMPV were detected as a co-infection with another respiratory virus, and 33.3% were found as a mono-infection. In the UK cohort four (4.1%) samples were hMPV-positive, including two with co-infection. Co-infection with hMPV has been proposed to increase disease severity in some studies [5, 43, 44] , but not in others [45] . Dual infection with RSV is reportedly common, reflecting the overlapping seasonal distributions. One study reported that 70% of children with severe RSV bronchiolitis were co-infected with hMPV, suggesting that the disease caused by RSV may be augmented by a concurrent hMPV infection [44] . However, population-based and case control studies of hospitalized children have found that hMPV and RSV co-infections are uncommon [42, 43] . In our study, the low proportion of mono-infected patients suggests that hMPV rarely produces clinically significant infection by itself, but co-infection of hMPV with RSV was also uncommon (only two cases).

Bezerra et al. [46] have observed that AdV is frequently detected as part of a co-infection, in contrast with the findings of Huang et al. [47] . AdV was reported to be responsible for 5-10% of ARI in children [11] . Our detection rate ranged between 9.3% (UK cohort) and 19.1% (GENDRES cohort) with a median age of 21.8 months.

Our study detected a broad range of common respiratory pathogens but it was not exhaustive, and indeed it may have missed as yet undescribed respiratory pathogens. The study considered only children admitted with LT-ARI, and did not include milder or asymptomatic infections. Several studies have shown that viruses can be found in children with no ARIs [22, 48] , and further research is needed to understand the respiratory viral carriage and infection. Although quantification of the virus load by PCR is possible, respiratory samples are heterogeneous, and different extractions of the same patient can lead to diverse results depending on chance variation in the amount of virus present in the aliquots extracted. Whilst the robustness of our findings is supported by the broad similarity between the two independent cohorts analyzed in the present study, its applicability to other populations is likely to be influenced by local epidemiological and host genetic factors.

In conclusion, the presence of more than one virus in children admitted to hospital with LT-AR ranged from one third to two thirds of these patients, depending on the age, and being particularly frequent in the second year of age. The co-infection pattern most frequently found was the combination of RSV and hRV. The clinical significance of co-infection remains difficult to establish from observational data. Further studies including also subjects with mild illness as well as healthy control groups are needed in order to better understand its clinical relevance.

Clinical characteristics and outcome of respiratory syncytial virus infection among adults hospitalized with influenza-like illness in France,"Conclusion: RSV is an infrequent cause of ILI during periods of influenza virus circulation but can cause severe complications in hospitalized adults. Risk factors for RSV detection in adults hospitalized with ILI include cancer and immunosuppressive treatment. Specific immunization and antiviral therapy might benefit patients at risk. P. Loubet, Clin Microbiol Infect 2017;23:253 ","Respiratory syncytial virus Pneumonia Adults Influenza-like illness Influenza Elderly a b s t r a c t Objectives: The aim of this study was to analyse characteristics and outcome of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection in adults hospitalized with influenza-like illness (ILI). Methods: Patients hospitalized with ILI were included in this prospective, multicentre study carried out in six French hospitals during three consecutive influenza seasons (2012e2015). RSV and other respiratory viruses were detected by multiplex PCR in nasopharyngeal swabs. Risk factors for RSV infection were identified by backward stepwise logistic regression analysis. Results: A total of 1452 patients hospitalized with ILI were included, of whom 59% (861/1452) were >65 years and 83% (1211/1452) had underlying chronic illnesses. RSV was detected in 4% (59/1452), and influenza virus in 39% (566/1452). Risk factors for RSV infection were cancer (adjusted OR 2.1, 95% CI 1.1 e4.1, p 0.04), and immunosuppressive treatment (adjusted OR 2.0, 95% CI 1.1e3.8, p 0.03). Patients with RSV had a median length of stay of 9 days (6e25), and 57% of them (30/53) had complications, including pneumonia (23/53, 44%) and respiratory failure (15/53, 28%) . Fifteen per cent (8/53) were admitted to an intensive care unit, and the in-hospital mortality rate was 8% (4/53). Pneumonia was more likely to occur in patients with RSV than in patients with RSV-negative ILI (44% (23/53) versus 26% (362/1393), p 0.006) or with influenza virus infection (44% versus 28% (157/560), p 0.02).

Over the past decade, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) has been increasingly recognized as an important pathogen in adults [1] , and especially the elderly [2e4], immunocompromised patients [5, 6] and individuals with underlying chronic respiratory diseases [7, 8] .

In the elderly population, RSV is one of the three most common causes of respiratory disease, along with influenza virus and rhinovirus [3, 7] .

Respiratory virus detection has improved with the development of highly sensitive and specific molecular methods, which are providing interesting new epidemiological information. However, for reasons of cost and the lack of RSV-specific antiviral drugs, adult inpatients with influenza-like illness (ILI) are frequently not tested for RSV but rather only tested for influenza virus. Influenza surveillance systems based on ILI and acute respiratory illness definitions are unsuitable for capturing cases of RSV in children and adults [9e11] . More studies are needed to determine the burden of RSV infection, and to characterize at-risk populations that could be targeted by vaccination and antiviral treatment. The aims of this study were to describe (a) the prevalence, (b) the clinical features, and (c) the outcome of RSV infection in adults hospitalized with ILI.

We analysed cases of laboratory-confirmed RSV infection during three consecutive influenza seasons (2012/13, 2013/14 and 2014/ 15), in a post hoc analysis of patients hospitalized with ILI in the FLUVAC study. FLUVAC is a French prospective observational study of influenza vaccine efficacy conducted in six university hospitals (Cochin Hospital, Paris; Bichat Hospital, Paris; Pontchaillou Hospital, Rennes; Limoges Hospital; University Hospital, Montpellier; Edouard Herriot Hospital, Lyon). The FLUVAC study design is further described in Rondy et al. and Loubet et al. [12, 13] . Each season, enrolments take place during periods of influenza circulation (from November to March). Data on adults hospitalized for at least 24 h for ILI, with symptom onset <7 days before sampling, were collected. ILI was defined as a combination of the following: (a) at least one of the following systemic symptoms: fever (38 C), headache, myalgia or malaise, and (b) at least one of the following respiratory symptoms: cough, sore throat or dyspnoea [14] . Each participant was interviewed, and nasopharyngeal samples were obtained at enrolment.

We collected demographic characteristics, chronic underlying diseases and their treatments, the characteristics of the current ILI episode: clinical presentation, hospitalization ward, the length of hospital stay and outcome (occurrence of complication, intensive care unit admission and death). Data were retrieved from the medical charts, interviews with the patients and families, and laboratory databases. All variables collected are detailed in the Supplementary material (Appendix S1).

Respiratory viruses were detected in nasopharyngeal swabs from all the patients by means of multiplex RT-PCR. Any bronchoalveolar lavage fluid samples or tracheal aspirates ordered by the physician in charge were also tested.

Samples were first tested in the virology laboratory of each participating hospital by means of real-time influenza A and B PCR after manual nucleic acid extraction. All samples were then sent to the French National Influenza Reference Centre (CNR-Lyon) for influenza confirmation and screening for other respiratory viruses. RNA and DNA were extracted with the automated Easymag system from BioM erieux (Marcy l'Etoile, France), and influenza viruses were detected with an in-house real-time RT-PCR protocol [15] . The samples were also screened for a panel of other respiratory viruses (adenoviruses, bocaviruses, coronaviruses, human metapneumovirus, parainfluenza viruses 1e4, picornavirus and RSV) by real-time PCR using the Respiratory Multiwell System rgene ® on an ABI 7300 analyser.

We first described the characteristics of all the patients hospitalized with ILI. Then, univariate analysis was used to compare RSVpositive patients with (a) RSV-negative patients (including patients infected by other respiratory viruses and patients free of viral infection) and (b) influenza virus-positive patients. Quantitative variables were expressed as mean and standard deviation (SD) or median and interquartile range (IQR), and qualitative variables as number and percentage. We used the Wilcoxon rank sum test or Fisher's exact test for univariable comparisons. Missing data for each variable were excluded from the denominator.

Factors associated with RSV infection were identified by using RSV-negative individuals as the comparison group. Individuals with influenza virus and RSV co-infection were excluded from the analysis. We used a backward stepwise logistic regression model, with RSV test results (positive/negative) as the dependent variable. All covariates with a p value <0.2 in univariate analysis were tested in the multivariate model, namely age (considered as a binary variable (<65 and 65 years)), dyspnoea, fever, myalgia, chronic lung disease, cancer (solid and haematological malignancies), diabetes, chronic renal failure, and immunosuppressive treatment. Factors associated with pneumonia onset were analysed among all ILI patients. Individuals with influenza virus and RSV co-infection were excluded from the analysis. We used a backward stepwise logistic regression model in which pneumonia (positive/negative) was the dependent variable. Covariates with a p value <0.2 in univariate analysis were tested in the multivariate model, namely age (considered as a continuous variable), chronic heart disease, chronic respiratory disease, cancer (solid and haematological malignancies), diabetes, chronic renal failure, immunosuppressive treatment, RSV infection, influenza virus infection, and influenza vaccination. The final model was adjusted for chronic respiratory disease and age because of their known role in the onset of pneumonia. Results from both regression models were expressed as odds ratios (OR) and adjusted ORs (aOR) with their 95% CI. A p value of 0.05 was considered statistically significant. All analyses used STATA software (V12, © Copyright 1996e2014 StataCorp LPt, College Station, TX, USA).

The FLUVAC study (clinicaltrials.gov NCT02027233) respected Good Epidemiological and Clinical Practices in Clinical Research, and the Declaration of Helsinki, and was approved by regional ethics committees. All the study participants gave their informed consent for respiratory virus testing.

Overall, 1452 patients hospitalized with ILI were included during the three periods of influenza circulation (Fig. 1 Fig. 2 ).

Respiratory syncytial virus was the third most frequent virus, after influenza virus (39% (566/1452) of patients with ILI, 73% (566/777) of patients with at least one virus) and picornavirus (5% (68/1452) of patients with ILI, 9% (68/777) of patients with at least one virus). The other detected viruses were coronavirus (3.5% (51/1452) and 7% (51/777) respectively), human metapneumovirus (3% (41/1452) and 5% (41/777)), adenovirus (1% (18/ 1452) and 2% (18/777)) and bocavirus (0.5% (8/1452) and 1% (8/ 777)). Six patients (6/1452, 0.4%) were diagnosed with both influenza virus and RSV infection and so were removed from further analyses.

The median age of the 53 patients with RSV infection alone was 74 years (IQR, 61e84) ( Table 2) . Chronic underlying diseases were present in 45 cases (45/53, 85%), and consisted mainly of chronic respiratory diseases (29/53, 55%), chronic heart disease (24/53, 45%) and cancer (18/53, 34%; 12 solid tumours, 6 haematological malignancies). Fifteen patients (15/53, 28%) were on immunosuppressive therapy. Twenty-six patients (26/53, 49%) had been hospitalized in the previous year, an average of 1.4 times (SD 2.3).

The median time from symptom onset to admission was 2 days (IQR, 1e3). Cough (43/53, 81%), fever (44/53, 83%) and dyspnoea (45/53, 85%) were the main symptoms in patients with RSV infection.

The median length of hospital stay was 9 days (IQR 6e25). A total of 55 medical complications occurred in 30 patients (30/52, 58%) during their hospital stay, including pneumonia (23 episodes, 42% (23/55) of complications), respiratory failure (15/55, 27%), heart failure (10/55, 18%), and acute respiratory distress syndrome (7/55, 13%). Intensive care unit admission was necessary for eight patients (8/53, 15%). Four patients (4/53, 8%) died during the hospital stay; all of them were men >65 years old with chronic respiratory diseases. Furthermore, three patients had chronic heart disease. The mean time from admission to death was 13 days (SD 2.9).

Patients with RSV were older than patients with influenza virus (74 years (IQR 1e84) versus 68 years (IQR 52e81), p 0.05) ( Table 2) .

Patients with RSV were more likely to have cancer or immunosuppressive treatment than patients without RSV (respectively 34% (18/53) versus 16% (219/1393), p 0.002; 28% (15/53) versus 15% (205/1393), p 0.003) and influenza virus-positive patients (34% (18/ 53) versus 13% (74/560), p 0.004; 28% (15/53) versus 14% (78/560), p 0.01).

Multivariate analysis of all patients with ILI showed that cancer (OR 2.1; 95% CI 1.1e4.1, p 0.04) and immunosuppressive treatment (OR 2.0; 95% CI 1.1e3.8, p 0.03) were significantly associated with RSV detection ( Table 3 ).

The patients with RSV and influenza virus infection did not differ in terms of the length of stay, ICU admission or mortality.

After adjustment for chronic respiratory disease and age, we found that RSV infection (OR 2.1; 95% CI 1.2e3.8, p 0.008), chronic renal failure (OR 1.8; 95% CI 1.3e2.5, p 0.001) and active smoking (OR 1.3; 95% CI 1.0e1.7, p 0.02) were significantly associated with the onset of pneumonia (Table 4 ).

In this study conducted during three consecutive influenza seasons among 1452 adults hospitalized for ILI in France, RSV was the third most common respiratory virus, being detected in 4% of patients, compared with 39% for influenza virus. This rate is lower than that found in the USA by Sundaram [7] . In the latter study, the rate was even higher (8/64, 12.5%) among hospitalized patients. In another study, Falsey et al. reported a 10% (142/1388) prevalence of RSV among adults aged 65 years or with underlying cardiopulmonary diseases who were admitted with acute respiratory symptoms during four consecutive winters in Rochester, NY [1] . Several reasons may explain the broad range of reported RSV detection rates. For example, our study was restricted to periods of influenza virus circulation, which may not have included the peak of RSV circulation, although enrolments in the two studies by Falsey et al. started in mid-November. Another factor is age: we included all adults >18 years, whereas Sundaram et al. and Falsey et al. included only older subjects, in whom RSV infection may be more frequent. Furthermore, the laboratory methods used in the Rochester study included viral culture and serological tests, and RT-PCR was the only positive test in only two-thirds of cases. Finally, the clinical definition used to trigger swab collection also differed among the studies.

The median age of the RSV-infected patients in our study was 74 years but, contrary to other studies, we found no association between RSV infection and older age [3, 16, 17] . Most of the patients with RSV infection had chronic underlying conditions (45/53, 85%), consisting mainly of chronic respiratory disease (29/53, 55%) or chronic heart disease (24/53, 45%). This is consistent with the report by Walsh et al. that underlying pulmonary disease was a significant risk factor for severe RSV illness requiring hospitalization [18] .

We found that the two underlying conditions independently associated with RSV infection were cancer and immunosuppressive treatment. This association was statistically significant whether RSV-positive patients were compared with all RSV-negative patients or only with influenza virus-positive patients. Although immunocompromised patients (especially patients with haematological malignancies) are known to be more susceptible to RSV infection [19] , solid cancers and immunosuppressive therapy are not classical risk factors.

Respiratory syncytial virus was associated with significant morbidity: the median length of hospital stay was 9 days; 15% (8/ 53) of RSV-infected patients were admitted to the intensive care unit, and 8% (4/53) died. These findings are consistent with the literature [1, 20] . Similar percentages were noted in the influenza group of our study. Patients with RSV were significantly more likely than patients with influenza or without RSV to develop pneumonia (44% versus 28% and 26%, respectively). Falsey et al. and Lee et al. also found a high rate of pneumonia among 159 RSV-infected patients >65 years admitted for ILI in the USA (70/159, 44%) and among 607 RSV-infected adults admitted to three hospitals in Hong Kong (261/603, 43%) [20, 21] . Jain et al. [22] found at least one respiratory virus in 23% of 2259 American adults with communityacquired pneumonia requiring admission to one of five participating hospitals between 2010 and 2012. RSV was found in 3% (67/ 2259) of all patients.

The strengths of this study include the large number of adults hospitalized with ILI, the prospective multicentre design, standardized patient screening in the participating centres, centralized confirmation of respiratory viruses in an influenza reference centre and the lengthy study period spanning three consecutive influenza seasons. Several limitations must, however, be acknowledged. First, as all the participating centres were teaching hospitals, the proportion of patients with underlying diseases may have been higher than in the general ILI population, owing to a referral bias. Second, although the sample was large, the study was probably underpowered to identify a possible impact of RSV on morbidity and mortality in multivariate analysis. Third, the ILI definition used here captures only a subset of RSV infections [10] . Our study does not reflect the real burden of severe RSV infection, which may include other clinical manifestations. Fourth, we report post hoc results of the FLUVAC study, which was not designed to answer this research question. Indeed, as the FLUVAC study was designed to assess influenza vaccine efficacy, patients were enrolled during periods of influenza virus circulation, which differ slightly from periods of RSV circulation. This means that our data reflect the prevalence of RSV among patients hospitalized for ILI during periods of influenza virus circulation and not during peak RSV circulation, which usually occurs earlier, owing to epidemiological interference [23] . However, French surveillance data (RENAL system) show that the peak of the RSV epidemic overlapped with the beginning of influenza virus circulation during the three seasons of interest, and that the two viruses co-circulated for at least 2e3 weeks (Fig. 3) .

In conclusion, this prospective observational study conducted in France during three influenza seasons reveals that 4% of adults hospitalized for ILI had RSV infection, of whom 58% developed cardiopulmonary complications and 8% died. It also shows that elderly individuals and patients with cancer and/or immunosuppressive treatment are more likely to have RSV isolated when hospitalized for ILI. Potential benefits of enhanced RSV testing, antiviral treatment, and vaccine development in these groups should be considered. The outcome analysed was RSV infection.

Severe lower respiratory tract infection in infants and toddlers from a non-affluent population: viral etiology and co-detection as risk factors,"Background: Lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) is a major cause of pediatric morbidity and mortality, especially among non-affluent communities. In this study we determine the impact of respiratory viruses and how viral co-detections/infections can affect clinical LRTI severity in children in a hospital setting.","Lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) represent an important public health burden in the first years of life accounting for approximately one fifth of all deaths in children below five years of age, especially in developing countries [1] . The specific role of newly identified viruses on LRTIs, like Human Metapneumovirus (hMPV), has been studied in recent years [2] . However, its impact among non-affluent populations has been scarcely evaluated. In such locales, infants with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)-associated LRTIs present a three times greater risk of a fatal event, when compared to their peers in developed countries [3] .

Although RSV is well recognized as the main agent associated with severe LRTIs, recent data indicate that other viruses may play a significant role in these clinical outcomes. Human rhinovirus (HRV) seems to be of particular interest, as the most prevalent virus in respiratory illnesses even in the first years of life [4, 5] , being associated with severe acute bronchiolitis, especially among children of atopic parents [6] . Moreover, a recent study showed that, in a population of preterm infants, HRV was the most prevalent agent associated with severe bronchiolitis [7] . Also of interest is the fact that wheezerelated HRV infection in the first year of life is associated with an increased risk for developing asthma later in life [8] , and that this effect was greater than the observed in relation to RSV [9] .

The impact on severity of early life respiratory infections may be also affected by viral co-detections diagnosed through sensitive PCR analyses. Some studies have shown a positive association between viral codetection and worse clinical outcomes [10, 11] , while others have failed to show results in the same direction [12] [13] [14] .

The aims of our study were to determine the current impact of newly identified viruses on the severity of LRTI in infants seen in the emergency room and pediatric wards from a tertiary hospital in a developing country, and how specific viruses alone or in codetections increased the degree of clinical severity of disease.

Infants and toddlers younger than three years of age, with a diagnosis of LRTI, admitted to the emergency room (ER) or pediatric wards of a tertiary hospital in Porto Alegre, southern Brazil, were recruited for this study, during the months of greatest prevalence for acute pediatric respiratory viral illnesses (i.e., from April to November) in 2007 [4, 15] . The great majority of patients seen in this particular setting come from low-income families, with health coverage provided by the Brazilian free-access public health system. LRTI was defined by the presence of signs and symptoms of an acute respiratory infection (cough, nasal discharge, oropharyngeal hyperemia, with or without fever), and lower respiratory signs (tachypnea, retractions, prolonged expiratory time, or crackles/wheezing on auscultation). Chest radiographs were taken only at medical assistant discretion, to avoid unnecessary X-ray exposure, and thus were not used for diagnostic purposes. Children who were admitted in the ER with signs and symptoms of a LRTI for at least 6 hours were considered eligible, once symptoms had started within the previous 5 days. Patients with other co-morbidities such as neuromuscular diseases, previous cardiopulmonary disorders, immunodeficiencies, or important congenital anomalies were excluded. We also excluded patients with a hospitalization due to LRTI in the previous 30 days. Bacterial pneumonia was excluded by clinical presentation and chest X-rays findings.

Within the first 24 hours of hospitalization, medical information was collected from parents or guardians through a standardized questionnaire. Data regarding clinical conditions at admission, vital signs, and signs of respiratory distress were obtained from the medical charts. Information on use of medications, clinical course of the disease until discharge, use of supplemental oxygen, and length of hospital stay were prospectively collected. These two latter variables were used as the main clinical outcomes, serving as surrogates for clinical severity. Supplemental oxygen was withdrawn when pulse oximetry was equal or greater than 94% in room air for at least 6 hours, as this is the standard clinical procedure in the hospital. Sample size was estimated based on few previous similar studies, since data analyzing the association between viral co-detection and our main outcomes was scarce at the time this project was planned [16] [17] [18] .

Nasopharyngeal aspiration with a standardized technique using vacuum and a sterile collector were performed in all children within the first 48 hours of admission. Samples were immediately split into aliquots, including one in TRIzol W , and stored at −80°C, until shipment to the Laboratory of Viral Pathogenesis, at the University of São Paulo School of Medicine, Ribeirão Preto.

To isolate RNA from nasal aspirates, 250 μL were extracted according to the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen, Carlsbard, USA). DNA was extracted from a sample of 200 μL of nasal aspirate using the Wizard Genomic DNA W purification kit, following manufacturer's instructions (Promega, Madison, USA). The detection of viruses was done by Real Time PCR, using the Taqman System W (Applied Biosystems, New Jersey, USA), with specific primers and probes in a thermal cycler (7300 Real Time PCR system W -Applied Biosystems). Real Time PCR reactions for cellular gene (β-actin) were also performed for internal quality control.

For viruses with a RNA genome (i.e., HRV, Influenza Virus-A [FLUAV], human parainfluenza virus [HPIV], RSV, hMPV and human coronavirus [HCoV]), the transcription into cDNA was done with reverse transcriptase (high capacity cDNA reverse transcription kit W , Applied Biosystems), using 1 μg from the extracted RNA, according to the manufacturers' protocol. The qPCR assays were performed using 3 μL of the DNA extraction or cDNA (approximately 150 ng), 0.33 pmoles for primers, 0.17 pmoles for probes and 7.5 μL of master mix of TaqMan W (Applied Biosystems). Amplifications were performed with 45 cycles of denaturation at 95°C for 15 seconds and annealing-extension at 60°C for one minute, except for hMPV, when annealing was done at 55°C for 30 seconds, and extension at 60°C for one minute.

Demographics were summarized as mean or median and range according to their distribution. Characteristics among groups were compared, accordingly, using twosample t-test, Mann-Whitney, Chi-square or Fisher's exact test.

Generalized linear models (Tweedie model with Identity link function) were used to analyze the relationships between main outcomes (length of stay in the hospital and time in use of supplemental oxygen) and the predictor variables (virus detection [yes/no], sex, age, prematurity (i.e. <37 weeks of gestation), maternal smoking during pregnancy, family asthma). All variables with a significance of p < 0.15 were considered in the univariate models and those with significance of p < 0.05 in the multivariate analysis. All analyses were performed using SPSS v.18 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL).

This study was approved by the local Institutional Ethics Committees (06/03467 -Pontif ícia Universidade Católica do Rio Grande do Sul and 4856/2004 -Universidade de São Paulo). Parents or legal guardians read and signed an informed consent approved for this study.

Two hundred and sixty patients were enrolled in the study. Characteristics of the patients recruited are presented in Table 1 . In the whole sample there were more boys than girls, almost half of children were younger than six months, 24% of all children were born premature, 29% had been exposed to tobacco during gestation, and more than a half had a family history of asthma (parents or siblings). Overall, median hospital length was 6 days and median supplemental oxygen requirement was 5 days.

The presence of viruses was detected by PCR in 222 (85%) of all LRTI episodes. Co-detection was present in 146/260 (56%). The frequencies of viral detection and co-detection are shown in Table 2 . The most common single infection was related to RSV (54%), followed by hMPV (32%), and HRV (21%).

During the surveyed time RSV has shown an incidence peak in the beginning of the cold season (i.e. from april to November) in the southern hemisphere, followed in late winter by peaks of hMPV, HRV, and HBov ( Figure 1 ). Other viruses such as HPIV and Human Adenovirus (HAdv) showed low but constant rates throughout the season.

In the univariate analyses, length of hospital stay and need of supplemental oxygen were significantly associated with age (≤6 months), maternal smoking during pregnancy and with family history of asthma (parents and/or siblings) ( Table 3 ). Infants younger than 6 months of age stayed in hospital 3.8 days longer than older infants (p < 0.001), and those with a family history of asthma stayed 2.4 days longer than those without a family history of asthma (p < 001). Also, infants 6 months of age or younger needed supplemental oxygen for an extra 3.8 days, when compared to older infants/children. A similar finding was observed for children with a family history of asthma, who required 2.4 extra days of oxygen compared to those without the family history of asthma (Table 3) . Other risk factors, such as breastfeeding, indoor smoking, current parental smoking, siblings, and overcrowding were not significantly associated with neither of the main outcomes.

Infants with positive PCR for HRV alone as well as those co-detected with RSV and HRV also had significantly longer hospital stays (3.2 days, p = 0.001; and 5.5 days, p = 0.002, respectively) than those with other detected viruses. Extended time in use of supplemental oxygen was also associated with HRV (2.8 days, p = 0.002) and RSV (3.7 days, p = 0.013), but also with Influenza virus A or B (2.2 days, p = 0.042), when compared to those with other viruses in single or in co-detection.

Infants with HRV-LRTIs stayed an extra 2.2 days in hospital (p = 0.011), for a total of 7.7 (95% CI: 6.1-9.3) days when compared to those with other infections, after adjusting for potential confounding variables (Table 4 ). Table 5 shows that infants with combined HRV and RSV positive PCR in the same samples stayed 4.5 extra days (p = 0.004) than those without HRV and RSV in these adjusted models (that included sex, age ≤ 6 versus >6 months, prematurity, family history of asthma and maternal smoking during pregnancy), (95% CI: 7.0-13.0) days. Time in use of supplemental oxygen followed the same association trends. Infants with proven RSV infections needed 4.75 (95% CI: 3.97-5.53) extra days of oxygen, while those with HRV used supplemental oxygen for 1.4 extra days, and those with RSV and HRV co-detection for 2.2 days, when compared to infants presenting positive PCRs for other viruses alone or in combinations. Figure 2 illustrates the association between HRV and RSV + HRV co-detection with increased length of hospital stay and oxygen use, and this effect is especially significant for infants younger than 6 months of age. Influenza viruses were not associated with longer use of supplemental oxygen when controlling for the demographic variables.

Our results suggest that infants with severe LRTI and positive PCR for HRV, alone or in co-detection with RSV, stayed hospitalized longer periods and utilized more supplemental oxygen, when compared to children infected by other viruses, including those with RSValone. Our data also reinforce previous findings that identified RSV as the major agent associated with severe LRTIs among children in a hospital setting, in populations of low socio-economic status, where other environmental and social variables potentially play a role [16, 17] . Infants younger than six months and those with a family history of asthma/recurrent wheeze are also at greater risk for disease severity. RSV was the most frequently detected virus, accounting for a high burden of LRTIs in our population. Although it is not possible to establish an unequivocal correlation between LRTIs and upper airway viral detection, the finding of RSV in over 50% of hospitalized children in our study strongly suggests that its impact is still indeed very high in this region, regardless of the presence of newly identified viruses. These results are in accordance with recently published studies in Brazil, which also identified RSV as the main agent responsible for severe LRTI, especially in a hospital setting. Nascimento and coworkers have shown an overall viral detection rate of 93% from nasopharyngeal samples in a small group of children below 2 years of age, and reported RSV as the most prevalent virus (63.6%) [19] . Another study aiming to investigate the role of HBov and hMPV in LRTIs in southern Brazil also showed similar results (at least one positive virus in 90% of the samples and RSV positive in 49.3%) [20] . The high detection rate of RSV in children with LRTI in a hospital setting such as ours is consistent with most studies worldwide and the burden due to viral respiratory disease seems as high in these locales as they are in more developed countries. A recent analysis of children admitted into the hospital due to acute bronchiolitis in Texas, USA, has shown a steady increase in admissions over a 5-year period and this has been credited mostly to RSV [21] . This increasing role for severe viral LRTIs, observed also in other studies, is probably explained by a series of complex environmental and social changes that seem to affect how viruses spread in communities.

Some studies have reported different clinical outcomes for specific viruses causing LRTIs, especially in the presence of co-detections, such as with RSV and HBov [22, 23] , while others did not reproduce such findings [17, 24, 25] and these associations remain unclear. A lack of association between an overall finding of any viral codetection and LRTI severity was reported in studies performed in non-affluent countries [2, 12, 26] , as well as in developed countries [13, 14] . In our study, patients detected with HRV alone and RSV + HRV presented increased length of hospitalization and increased time of supplemental oxygen use. Papadopoulos et al. has shown a five-fold increase in clinical severity in infants with acute bronchiolitis due to HRV, compared to those infected only with RSV. Compared to those with positive RSV samples without HRV co-detection, infants with HRV were older, had lower birth weights and were hospitalized earlier [16] . Some explanations for apparently contradictory findings in a myriad of studies could be attributed to the lack of uniform criteria for subject inclusion and standardized statistical analysis [14] . Other plausible explanations are the natural variation in HRV prevalence in different seasons and possible variations in the prevalence of type C HRV. This agent is associated with more severe disease and was already described as a major cause of LRTI in infants from non-affluent countries [27, 28] . Unfortunately, in our study, we were not able to determine the prevalence of HRV subtypes, and this stands as an interesting subject for further research. The association of HRV (alone or with RSV) with LRTI severity and atopy has not been widely studied. The relationship between persistent wheezing at 3 years and at 6 years versus relevant HRV infection in early life is well established [9, 29] , but there are few studies looking at these relationships in the first year of life. A recent study suggests that the relationship between HRV in early life LRTI and subsequent recurrent wheeze/asthma is dependent on allergic sensitization, which seems to precede the viral insult in a causal model [30] . This association we have found between HRV with increased Figure 2 Comparison of RSV, HRV and RSV plus HRV in regards to: (A) length of hospital stay and (B) days of supplemental oxygen use. Black circles: group of infants ≤ 6 months of age; white circles: group of infants > 6 months of age. The groups of HRV and RSV + HRV were significantly different (p < 0.05), when compared by age. Values expressed as mean ± SD of days. severity (using the surrogates of length of hospital stay and days in supplemental oxygen) is a major finding. Hence, the association between HRV infection, increased severity and atopy remains to be better clarified.

It has already been shown that HRV is able to reduce cell proliferation and decreases the self-repair capacity of bronchial epithelial cells [31] . Therefore, our data may suggest that in certain subsets of patients the burden of HRV in acute LRTI should be considered distinct from that of other viruses. Another plausible explanation for our findings could be the possibility of HRV persistence in the airways leading to an ""over detection"" of the virus, simultaneously with those infected only by RSV [32] . In our study this hypothesis seems improbable since we detected a clear worsening in the clinical markers in patients with RSV that were also detected with HRV.

Another interesting finding of our study was the high prevalence of newly described viruses. hMPV was detected in almost one third of all episodes, but did not seem to affect the main outcomes studied here, in the way RSV and HRV have done. While the recognition of the impact of human hMPV is increasing, its prevalence is still probably underestimated in clinical practice, since laboratory testing has become widely available only in recent years [18, 24, 33] . HBov was also detected in a large number of nasal samples and it was very frequently associated (co-detected) with other agents. In our study, only 2/27 patients with HBov had this virus detected as single agent. The overall HBov detection rate was higher in our data compared to previous studies [34, 35] , and this may be explained again by natural seasonal variations. It is also interesting to notice the seasonal pattern of both hMPV and HBov, which present their peak prevalence rates in late winter, right after the RSV peak, which occurs earlier in winter.

The main limitation of our study is the lack of surveillance in consecutive years, which could have biased results in case of an outbreak of one specific virus in a given year. Our eight months of viral surveillance could potentially have failed to detect any atypical outbreak, which did not seem likely to have occurred. Also, reliable tests capable of ruling out bacterial co-detection were not available at the time of the study. This could have underestimated the burden of bacteria in our sample and the co-detection of viruses and bacteria remains an interesting issue for further studies.

In our study, RSV was the most prevalent viral agent in hospitalized patients with LRTI and the co-detection of HRV in patients with RSV infection increased hospital stay and days in use of supplemental oxygen. Interestingly, even in developing countries, the role of recently discovered viruses needs to be further studied in order to identify novel risk factors of susceptibility/severity, and new treatment targets for these agents. We also highlight the role of HRV as an important risk factor for severe LRTI, particularly when simultaneously associated with RSV, which strongly suggests that co-detection may also mean co-infection, since the combination of the two agents seem to affect clinical outcomes. Longitudinal studies with control groups are necessary to confirm these results in populations at greater risk for severe respiratory disease.

IL-33 and ST2 as predictors of disease severity in children with viral acute lower respiratory infection,"Background: Mechanisms influencing severity of acute lower respiratory infection (ALRI) in children are not established. We aimed to assess the role of inflammatory markers and respiratory viruses in ALRI severity. Methods: Concentrations of interleukin(IL)-33, soluble suppression of tumorigenicity (sST)2, IL-1ß, tumor necrosis factor α, IL-4, IL-6 and IL-8 and types of respiratory viruses were evaluated in children at the first and fifth days after hospital admission. Disease severity was defined as need for mechanical ventilation. Results: Seventy-nine children < 5 years-old were included; 33(41.8%) received mechanical ventilation. No associations between virus type, viral load or co-detections and severity of disease were observed. Detection of IL-33 and sST2 in nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPA) on admission were associated with higher risk for mechanical ventilation (RR = 2.89 and RR = 4.57, respectively). IL-6 and IL-8 concentrations were higher on Day 5 in mechanically ventilated children. IL-6 NPA concentrations decreased from Day 1 to Day 5 in children who did not receive mechanical ventilation. Increase in sST2 NPA concentrations from Day 1 to Day 5 was associated with longer hospital length of stay (p < 0.01). Conclusions: An exacerbated local activation of the IL-33/ST2 axis and persistently high sST2 concentrations over time were associated with severity of viral ALRI in children.","Acute lower respiratory infection (ALRI) is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in children under 5 years old worldwide [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] . Respiratory viruses represent key pathogens involved in ALRI and can cause pneumonia and acute viral bronchiolitis in infants and young children [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] . While young age, prematurity and co-morbidities have been identified as predictors of poor outcomes [6] [7] [8] [9] , the role of virus types and host inflammatory responses in disease severity is not well defined, as published results are inconsistent [10, 11] . Lately, a model of immune inflammatory response in which an imbalance between T helper (Th)1, Th2 and regulatory T cells could be responsible for severe cases of ALRI in infants and young children has been suggested [10, 12, 13] . In addition, Interleukin (IL)-33, a member of the interleukin-1 family expressed in epithelium surfaces, along with its receptor, suppression of tumorigenicity (ST)2, may play an important role in the immune response associated with asthma, autoimmune disorders and infections [14, 15] . There is experimental and clinical evidence showing the involvement of the IL-33/ST2 axis in the inflammatory responses to viruses, including respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) [16, 17] , influenza [18] , rhinovirus [19] and metapneumovirus [20, 21] .

In light of recent findings and considering the lack of efficient treatment options for viral respiratory diseases, understanding the complex interrelations between respiratory viruses and host immune responses becomes mandatory. The identification of predictors of disease severity may help to identify potential therapeutic targets. Thus we aimed to evaluate the association between the IL-33/ST2 axis, along with other inflammatory markers (IL-1β, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF)-α), and the severity of ALRI in young children. Patients were also assessed for viral etiology and its association with illness severity.

This was a prospective cohort study conducted in a tertiary-care university hospital in Brazil. The study was approved by the Institutional Research Ethics Board (#17470/2014) and written informed consent was obtained from the patients' parents. All consecutive children younger than five years attending the pediatric emergency room with ALRI who were admitted to hospital from January 1st, 2015 to December 31st, 2016 were eligible for the study. ALRI was defined by the presence of cough, tachypnea, respiratory distress with prolonged expiratory time, and wheezing or crackles on auscultation. Subjects were excluded if they had used systemic steroids for over 24 h within 4 weeks of presentation or had multiple comorbidities (more than two). Demographic, clinical and outcome data were collected from patients' health records. Disease severity was defined as need for mechanical ventilation.

Nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPA) were obtained within 24 h of admission (Day 1) and on the fifth day (Day 5) of hospital stay. In case of hospital discharge before Day 5, the sample was collected just prior to it. NPA technique consisted of washing the nasal cavity with 3 mL of saline followed by sample collection into a mucus extractor. During the first year of the study, blood samples were also concomitantly drawn. The samples were processed, aliquoted and stored at −70°C until analysis.

NPA were tested using real-time PCR for the presence of RSV A and B, rhinovirus, human metapneumovirus A and B, influenza virus A and B, and adenovirus, including quantification of viral load. Total RNA and DNA were extracted from 250 μL nasopharyngeal washes using TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies), following the manufacturer's protocols. Reverse transcription was done with High Capacity Reverse cDNA transcription kit (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) using 1 ng of extracted RNA and random hexamers, following manufacturer's instructions. Newly synthesized cDNA was subjected to TaqMan real-time PCR (qPCR) with specific primers and probes (Supplementary material 1) in a StepOnePlus Real-Time PCR System thermocycler (Applied Biosystems). The RNAse P gene was used as internal control for all samples. All real-time PCR assays were tested in duplicate. Reverse transcription, assembly of real-time PCR mixes, and cycling parameters were per a previously published protocol [22] .

IL-33, IL-1β, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and the soluble receptor (sST2) were measured using a commercial enzymelinked immunosorbent assay (ELISA; R&D systems) according to the manufacturers' instructions. Detection limits for the assays were 0.186 pcg/ml (IL-33), 2.44 pcg/ml (sST2), 3.8 pcg/ml (IL-1β), 15.5 pcg/ml (TNF-α), 0.2 pcg/ml (IL-4), 3 pcg/ml (IL-6) and 31.1 pcg/ ml (IL-8).

Analysis was made using SAS 9.4 software (SAS institute, Cary, NC). Data were expressed as median (range) or number (%). Patients were grouped according to need for mechanical ventilation. Continuous variables between groups were compared by Mann-Whitney U test and categorical variables, by Fisher's exact test or chi-square test. Variables with repeated measures over time were analyzed after logarithmic transformation. Wilcoxon matched pairs test was used to compare concentrations of inflammatory markers at Day 1 and Day 5 in both groups. Relative risks were estimated through log-binomial regression models to compare incidences of mechanical ventilation according to the detection of IL-33 and sST2 in NPA on admission. Kaplan-Meyer estimates were calculated for hospital length of stay analysis. A Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve was constructed to assess the ability of viral loads to predict need for mechanical ventilation. For the latter, only the highest value of viral load for each individual was included. A 5% significance level was considered in all analysis.

From January 1st 2015 to December 31st 2016, 261 children younger than five years were admitted to Hospital das Clínicas of Ribeirão Preto Medical School, University of São Paulo with ALRI. Seventy-nine children were included in the study. One hundred eighty two patients were excluded for the following reasons: corticosteroid use for more than 24 h in the previous 4 weeks before hospital admission (n = 156); recruitment failure (n = 11); lack of consent from parents or guardians (n = 8); multiple comorbidities (n = 7). Thirty-three patients (41.8%) received mechanical ventilation. Fig. 1 shows the flow diagram of the study.

Demographic, clinical and outcome data are shown in Table 1 . Demographic data were not significantly different between groups. However, use of systemic antibiotics and the presence of atelectasis in chest radiograph were more frequent in patients who received mechanical ventilation. Moreover, duration of supplemental oxygen and hospital length of stay were longer in the mechanical ventilation group.

At least one virus was identified in the NPA of 72 (92.2%) study subjects. The most frequently detected virus was RSV (n = 60; 75.9%), followed by rhinovirus (n = 35; 31.6%), human metapneumovirus (n = 13; 16.5%), influenza (n = 5; 6.3%) and adenovirus (n = 4; 5.1%). Two or more viruses were detected in 41.7% of samples (Supplementary material 2). Neither the analysis of viral subtypes, nor the presence of co-detections reached statistical significance as risk factors for the need for mechanical ventilation support ( Table 2) .

Comparison of concentrations of inflammatory markers in NPA samples on the first and fifth days showed that there was no difference between groups in inflammatory markers concentrations on Day 1 (Supplementary material 3). However, IL-6 concentrations were 10.6 times higher and IL-8 concentrations were 1.4 times higher on the fifth day following hospital admission in the mechanical ventilation group (Table 3) .

There was a significant increase in IL-4 and IL-8 NPA concentrations from Day 1 to Day 5 in both groups. Conversely, a significant reduction in sST2 NPA concentrations was observed in the mechanical ventilation group and there was a significant decrease in IL-6 NPA concentrations in children who did not receive mechanical ventilation from Day 1 to Day 5 (p < 0.05) (Fig. 2 ). Blood samples were collected from 37 patients (Supplementary material 4). There was a significant increase in serum IL-33 concentrations in patients who did not receive mechanical ventilation from Day 1 (median 0.186 pcg/ml; range 0.186-840.4 pcg/ml) to Day 5 (median 28 pcg/ml; range 0.186-4253.8 pcg/ml) (p = 0.04).

On admission, patients who received mechanical ventilation had detectable NPA concentrations more frequently of both IL-33 (50% vs. 13.3%) and sST2 (87.5% vs. 40.9%) compared with patients who did not receive respiratory support, respectively (p < 0.001). Furthermore, detectable concentrations of both IL-33 and sST2 in NPA samples on admission were associated with higher risk for mechanical ventilation (RR = 2.89, 95%CI 1.83-4.57 and RR = 4.57, 95%CI 1.78-11.70, respectively). The detection of IL-33 in NPA had a sensitivity of 50% (95%CI 0.32-0.68) and specificity of 93% (95%CI 0.79-0.98) in predicting need for mechanical ventilation, with a positive likelihood ratio (LR) of 7.00 (95%CI 2.22-31.97) and a negative LR of 0.54 (95%CI 0.38-0.77). Detectable concentrations of sST2 showed sensitivity of 88% (95%CI 0.77-0.96) and specificity of 59% (95%CI 0.43-0.73) in predicting need for mechanical ventilation, with a positive LR of 2.14 (95%CI 1.46-3.12) and a negative LR of 0.21 (95%CI 0.08-0.55).

An increase in sST2 concentrations in NPA from Day 1 to Day 5 was associated with a longer hospital length of stay (p < 0.01) (Fig. 3) .

ROC curve analysis showed a poor discriminative performance of viral loads to predict need for mechanical ventilation (Supplementary material 5).

To our knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate the IL-33/ST2 axis in pediatric patients with ALRI at two times during hospitalization along with other inflammatory cytokines and respiratory viruses, and their association with illness severity. Our results show an early and more prominent local activation of the IL-33/ST2 axis in children with more severe ALRI who needed ventilator support. Detectable concentrations of IL-33 and sST2 in NPA samples on the first day following hospital admission were associated with a higher risk for mechanical ventilation. Moreover, an increment in sST2 NPA concentrations from admission to hospital Day 5 was associated with a longer hospital length of stay.

In a recent review by Vázquez et al. [23] , the authors highlight the importance of early identification of high-risk patients in the management of RSV disease in infants and young children, as treatment options are scarce. In this paper, IL-33 is mentioned as a potential biomarker of disease severity. However, few publications have addressed the IL-33/ Data are expressed as median (range) or n (%). P values for comparison between mechanical ventilation and no mechanical ventilation groups. ST2 axis in viral respiratory diseases in children, with conflicting results. Similar to our findings, García-García et al. [13] reported higher detectable IL-33 NPA levels in infants infected by RSV and rhinovirus on hospital admission when comparing to healthy controls, although no associations between higher IL-33 detections and ICU admissions or longer hospital lengths of stay were found. Saravia et al. [16] described higher IL-33 NPA concentrations in 19 infants with RSV acute viral bronchiolitis on hospital admission when compared to IL-33 NPA concentrations 28 days later, after hospital discharge. In contrast, Christiaansen et al. [24] found that higher NPA concentrations of IL-33 on hospital admission were associated with milder disease in 23 RSV infected infants. It is worth mentioning that none of the studies evaluated the same inflammatory markers in a different moment of hospitalization other than on admission. Concentrations of these molecules on Day 5 of hospital stay enabled us to characterize the host response in the acute phase of the disease. The soluble form of ST2, which is one of the mechanisms of IL-33 down regulation, has been identified as a reliable biomarker of poor prognosis in cardiovascular diseases, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and other inflammatory conditions [25, 26] . Furthermore, while IL-33 plays an important role in tissue repair and restores tissue homeostasis in infectious and chronic inflammatory diseases, persistently high sST2 levels is often implicated in the emergence of tissue fibrosis. Indeed, sustained high serum concentrations of sST2 on the first three days of mechanical ventilation in adults with ARDS were associated with longer hospital length of stay, extubation failure and mortality [25] . Similarly, we have found that detection of sST2 in NPA samples on admission shows a high sensitivity and good accuracy in predicting need for mechanical ventilation in children with viral ALRI. Also, an increment of sST2 concentration over time was associated with a prolonged hospital stay in our patients. A multicenter cohort study [27] performed by Faber et al. reported high concentrations of sST2 on admission in the NPA of infants intubated for RSV bronchiolitis. Soluble ST2 concentrations were 20 times higher in the intubated group, when compared to those with milder disease. Although it is well known that the IL-33/ST2 axis takes part in eosinophilic modulation in asthma, the role of ST2 in neutrophilic inflammation of the airway, which is considered to be the main cause of ALRI severity in the pediatric population [28] , is still poorly understood [29] . Schaunaman et al et al. [29] demonstrated an overexpression of ST2 in cultured normal human primary airway epithelial cells leading to neutrophilic chemoattractant IL-8 production, which was independently associated with M. pneumoniae or rhinovirus infection. Indeed, we observed an increase in IL-8 concentrations in NPA samples in both groups. IL-8 is mostly responsible for the local neutrophil afflux, which has been associated with mucus accumulation that has an important role in viral containment in upper respiratory tract, but can also lead to airway and alveolar obstruction. In fact, high concentrations of IL-8 have been often correlated to worse outcomes, such as hypoxemia and mechanical ventilation [10] .

Interestingly, in our study, a significant increase in serum IL-33 concentrations from Day 1 to Day 5 of hospitalization was observed in children who did not receive mechanical ventilation, while in the mechanical ventilation group, serum IL-33 concentrations remained mostly undetected. In addition, in the group of non-ventilated patients, we also observed a decrease in IL-6 NPA concentrations from Day 1 to Day 5 following hospital admission. It has been reported that IL-33 modulates IL-6 responses [14] . Pyle et al. [30] have suggested that an early and robust production of IL-6 is necessary to the resolution of the disease by regulating Th1 responses between Day 4 and Day 7 after viral respiratory tract infection.

Despite these observations, increased concentrations of IL-6 and IL- 8 found in the mechanical ventilation group in our study could be due to the inflammatory response caused by mechanical ventilation itself, as previously suggested [31] . Even though IL1-ß and TNFα have been frequently associated with disease severity [28, [32] [33] [34] , our results do not corroborate these findings. We also detected an increment of IL-4 NPA concentrations in both studied groups from Day 1 to Day 5 of hospital stay. IL-4 is a typical Th2 response cytokine, frequently implicated in the emergence of recurring wheezing episodes and asthma exacerbations, especially related to rhinovirus infection [12, 19] . In our study, we did not observe any association between viral etiology, viral load or co-infections and disease severity. Viral-related risk factors for severe disease are not well established, as the pathogenesis of ALRI is the result of a complex interaction of environmental factors, viral virulence and host responses [35] [36] [37] [38] . Whereas studies in genomics have mapped transcriptome features in the host leading to inflammatory responses that are unique according to viral etiology and age of the patient [38] , Cavallaro et al. [28] reported that the severity of the inflammatory response was independent of viral etiology. They also did not find an association between disease severity and co-infections, which was corroborated by a recently published meta-analysis [39] . A retrospective observational study on mechanically ventilated children with bronchiolitis admitted to the PICU showed no differences on duration of respiratory support or PICU length of stay between bronchiolitis caused by only one virus and more than one virus [40] . Hospital length of stay, however, was longer in the co-detection group. On the other hand, a recent publication reported an association between ALRI in children by coronavirus alone or in co-detection with rhinovirus C and severity of the disease, defined as need for admission to the pediatric intensive care unit in our hospital [41] . On regards to viral load, many studies have assessed the role of RSV viral load in predicting worse outcomes, with conflicting results [42] . It has been recently suggested that higher RSV viral loads at presentation elicits a more robust inflammatory response, resulting in faster viral clearance, which could be associated with milder disease [43] .

The strength of this study is that we were able to analyze, concomitantly, the ALRI inflammatory modulation using a panel of seven inflammatory markers that reflects Th1, Th2 and Regulatory T cells (Tregs) responses, both in NPA and blood samples, as well as its relation to disease severity, in two distinct moments of the viral ALRI disease in children. This study, therefore, adds information to the literature, concerning the pediatric host response to respiratory infections by a multitude of viral etiologies, not exclusively by RSV and/or rhinovirus, as extensively reported before. Furthermore, no other publications known by the authors studied both IL-33 and sST2 in this context. The limitations of our study include a high rate of corticosteroid use, leading to a smaller sample size and the lack of a control group of healthy patients.

In conclusion, ALRI severity, defined by the need of mechanical ventilation, was associated with an early and more robust local activation of the IL-33/ST2 axis. During the course of the disease, an increment in sST2 local levels was correlated to a longer hospital length of stay, whereas a systemic increase in IL-33 and a local decrease of IL-6 were associated with milder disease. Finally, respiratory virus types, viral load or co-detections were not associated with disease severity in this cohort of young children with ALRI.

Incidence and implications of unrecognized viral respiratory tract infections in premature infants during their birth hospitalization: a prospective surveillance study in two neonatal intensive care units NIH Public Access,"Objective-We sought to determine the frequency and effects of nosocomial respiratory viral infections (RVIs) in premature neonates, including those who may be asymptomatic. Study Design-We performed a year-long surveillance for RVIs in infants <33 weeks gestational age admitted to two Syracuse neonatal intensive care units (NICUs). Infants were enrolled within 3 days of NICU admission and were sampled for RVIs until discharge using a multiplex PCR assay capable of detecting 17 different respiratory viruses or subtypes.","common respiratory viruses among hospitalized infants have been described, including influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), coronavirus, parainfluenzavirus (PIV), adenovirus, enterovirus and rhinovirus [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] . In most of these published studies, virus detection was ascertained only in symptomatic infants. In others, surveillance for respiratory virus pathogens was initiated only after an outbreak was established. Of note, respiratory viral infections (RVIs) were detected in minimally symptomatic and even asymptomatic infants when widespread screening was instituted during outbreaks [3] . Moreover, premature infants often have atypical symptoms of infection, such as feeding difficulty, periodic breathing or apnea [8] [9] [10] . Reports of NICU outbreaks generally have focused on a single infectious agent, and studies extending to multiple viruses are hampered by the technical limitations associated with routine assays such as antigen detection and virus culture. Recent developments in multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing permit rapid, sensitive testing of multiple viruses from a single specimen, including viruses for which culture is unavailable and/or unreliable or for which rapid antigen assays do not exist. In this study we report on the results of a year-long surveillance study in two NICUs in Syracuse, New York, in which infants' nasopharyngeal specimens were tested in longitudinal fashion from birth to discharge for 17 different viruses.

A prospective, observational study of premature infants in two NICUs in Syracuse, NY, during one calendar year (2009) was performed. Infants were deemed eligible if they were born at less than 33 weeks 0 days gestational age and were available for enrollment within 3 days of arrival in the NICU, which included transfer from another facility or following hospital birth. Neonates with medical and surgical diagnoses were included. Gestational age was determined by menstrual dates and confirmed by ultrasound. Infants were excluded if they had a known or suspected immune deficiency, or were born to an HIV-positive mother. After obtaining informed consent, nasopharyngeal flocked swabs (Copan Diagnostics, Inc., Corona, CA) were collected from each infant by study personnel trained in the proper procedure for obtaining a nasopharyngeal specimen (including intubated infants to ensure sample consistency) within 3 days of birth and on a regular twice weekly (Monday/ Thursday) schedule thereafter until discharge. Sampling was deferred on a particular day if it was deemed to place the infant at risk. Specimens were placed in 1.5 mL universal transport media (Copan) and frozen at −70° C prior to testing with the xTAG® Respiratory Viral Panel (RVP, Luminex Molecular Diagnostics, Inc., Toronto, ON, Canada). RVP is a multiplex PCR assay that detects influenza A H1, H3, and nonspecific; influenza B; respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) A and B; parainfluenza (PIV) 1, 2, 3 and 4; coronavirus 229E, NL63, HKU-1 and OC43; rhinovirus/enterovirus; adenovirus; and human metapneumovirus (hMPV). Clinical and demographic data were collected from the medical records. At each sampling timepoint, the use of mechanical ventilation and percent of inspired oxygen was recorded, along with the results of any microbiologic testing performed for appropriate clinical purposes. Clinical events (episodes of oxygen desaturation, bradycardia or apnea) were recorded daily according to the existing criteria being used routinely by the nursing staff in both NICUs. To qualify as an event, the aforementioned change had to persist for longer than 20 seconds. Oxygen saturation below 88% and a heart rate below 100 beats per minute were the cutoff points used for desaturation and bradycardia events, respectively. Clinical deteriorations were defined as a sustained (lasting three days) increase in daily oxygen desaturation events from the prior baseline rate, an increase in oxygen requirement (as judged by the current inhaled oxygen concentration required for stable oxygen saturations, excluding transient desaturations associated with feeding), or an increased level of respiratory support (moving from nasal cannula to continuous positive airways pressure, to intubation or mechanical ventilation). A diagnosis of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) was made if an infant required supplemental oxygen at 36 weeks post-conceptional age.

The two NICUs in the study were a level 3 unit with a daily average census of approximately 12 infants, and a level 4 regional center with a daily average census of approximately 55 infants. Throughout the study period, each NICU operated under its usual infection control procedures: all staff employed an extended hand and arm scrub on arrival to the unit, and standard precautions were in place at all times. All direct patient contact by medical staff required gloves. Contact precautions also were in place (gown and glove) for patients known to be colonized or infected with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). MRSA screening by PCR was performed on all patients at the regional center on a weekly basis. All children (age 17 yrs and younger) were excluded from the units and adult visitors were excluded if ill. Parents who had respiratory symptoms were discouraged from visiting but allowed to visit if they wore gowns, gloves, and a surgical mask. In the regional center NICU, twin and triplet births were separated into different nursing areas. No healthcare personnel were aware of the results of the respiratory virus detection tests during the study.

Statistical comparisons between groups were performed using Fisher exact test or student t test as appropriate. Time to infection was calculated as the interval between birth date and infection date for the first infection and the interval between previous and current infection dates for repeated infections. The marginal effects of several variables, including NICU units, gender, gestational age and birth weight on time to infection were presented by Kaplan-Meier infection-free probability curves and tested by log-rank test. A Cox proportional hazards regression model was further fitted to examine the effect of each covariate, adjusting the effect of other covariates. A random-effect term was included to adjust the dependence among the multiple observations from the same infant. The proportional hazards assumption and possible outliers were visually examined through Schoenfeld and Deviance residual plots. A path model, focusing on the direct and indirect effects of infection on the hospital stay, was proposed and confirmed by using SAS9.2 proc CALIS under which the algorithm was optimized via a Quasi-Newton method. Statistical significance was defined at a level of 0.05. 

Approximately half of the parents approached for the study consented to enrollment. The most common reason given for refusal was a concern for an additional procedure on a very small baby, which may have skewed our population towards enrolling neonates of later gestational age. Fifty infants were enrolled into the study; 27 (54%) were male. The average gestational age was 28 weeks (range 24 to 32). Eighteen infants (36%) had gestational ages <28 weeks. The average duration of birth hospitalization was 54.6 days. Twenty-five infants (50%) were intubated at some time during hospitalization, for a mean of 12.5 days. Twentyeight infants (56%) required supplemental oxygen at some time during hospitalization, and 17 (34%) met criteria for diagnosis of BPD. Eleven infants were enrolled from the level 3 NICU, and 39 were from the level 4 regional NICU. One infant died.

A total of 708 specimens were obtained and tested from the 50 patients over the 52 week period, for an average of 13.6 specimens per week. No weeks were missed but the level of enrollment varied throughout the year -at any one time the number of active patients from the level 3 NICU varied between zero and four, and at the level 4 NICU between two and eight. 66 specimens tested positive for at least one respiratory virus, giving twenty-six (52%) neonates who tested positive for a respiratory virus on at least one occasion. The mean time to detection of the first positive sample was 24 days (range 0 to 92). For each infected patient an average of 2.5 swabs were positive during their hospital stay (range 1 to 13). Viruses detected in the 26 positive patients were PIV3 (13 patients), hMPV (9 patients), RSV-B (8 patients), RSV-A (7 patients), PIV-2 (7 patients), Entero/Rhinovirus (7 patients) and Influenza B (4 patients). Eighteen samples (28% of the positive swabs) included more than one virus and some infants were positive for different viruses at different times. There was evidence of seasonality of infection with particular viruses, with clusters of detection being observed (Figure 1 ). Fourteen patients had sequential positive specimens for the same virus, with specimens positive over a range of 3-13 days, however because we obtained specimens only twice weekly an accurate determination of duration cannot be made. The viruses that had episodes of sequential detection were hMPV, RSV B, PIV 3 and EV/RV.

Kaplan-Meier curves were created reflecting location, sex, gestational age and birth weight in order to identify potential predictors of infection. The infection rate from RVIs was similar between the two NICUs (5 of 11 from NICU 1, and 21 of 39 from NICU 2, p = 0.74). The Kaplan-Meier curves comparing each location for sex, birth weights or gestational age were not statistically significantly different ( Supplemental oxygen requirements also were higher in the infected cohort. We identified only a single timepoint when one uninfected infant required an inhaled concentration of oxygen above 50%, an event that occurred at 36 separate timepoints in the infected group.

A Cox proportional hazards model showed modestly significant effects of gestational age after adjusting for the effect of NICU units and sex (Table 2 -online only) . At each NICU, an infant with lower gestational age was more likely to be infected. The effect of birth weight in the Cox model was reversed compared with the marginal effect seen in Kaplan-Meier analysis, but one child with massive hydrocephalus had a very high birth weight for gestational age which skewed the model. When this outlier was removed the datapoints tended to cluster with no clear trend (data not shown).

We proposed a path model to determine whether virus infection directly extended length of hospital stay or whether this effect was mediated by the need for intubation and oxygen use. The model was confirmed in SAS using Covariance Analysis of Linear Structural Equations. The effect of RVI on length of stay appeared to be mediated partially through effects on the respiratory system, as there were significant standardized indirect effects of infection on length of stay (p = 0.001). When two outliers were excluded (one who died on day of life 1, another who was discharged to an outlying hospital and lost to follow-up) infection was significantly correlated to length of stay through both direct (p < 0.003) and indirect (p < 0.0005) effects (Figure 4 -online only). Table 1 shows clinical events in infected and uninfected infants. On average, the infected infants had nearly double the number of desaturation events compared with the uninfected cohort (7.1 episodes / day versus 3.9 episodes / day, p < 0.0001). Episodes of bradycardia were the same between the two groups, while there were significantly fewer apnea events among infected infants. This latter finding was likely due to confounding of infected infants were more likely being mechanically ventilated, which precluded apnea.

Most infants were evaluated for bacterial infection at the time of birth, and again later at the discretion of the clinical team. A total of 118 blood cultures were obtained from the 50 study patients. There were significantly more cultures obtained from the virus-infected infants than from the virus-uninfected infants (70 versus 38, p = 0.008). 

We documented a remarkable rate of otherwise unsuspected and unrecognized respiratory viral infections among premature neonates during their birth hospitalizations. The detection of viral nucleic acid from the respiratory tract of asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic infants (none of the infants in the study displayed symptoms typical of RVI or were evaluated for RVI by the NICU clinicians) raises the question of whether these events represent true infection. In the absence of data documenting seroconversion, our observation documenting 14 instances of prolonged serial detection suggest ongoing virus replication rather than transient carriage. Moreover, of the viruses included in the detection panel, only adenovirus is known to persist in the nasopharynx, although respiratory viruses have been detected in asymptomatic older children. Detection of viral nucleic acids in nasopharyngeal secretions in our study correlated significantly and directly with several specific negative outcomes, inferring a possible causal relationship. Additionally, our findings suggest the need for enhanced virus surveillance and optimized infection control.

Although outbreaks of RVIs in NICUs have been described, this study confirms the importance of systematic surveillance in detecting infections that otherwise would be unrecognized. Premature neonates with RVIs can display atypical symptoms or can have no overt, recognizable symptoms. However, the detection of RVIs within a NICU can have profound clinical implications. Infants with detectable RVIs, even those without overt symptoms, had greater supplemental oxygen requirements, high likelihood of mechanical ventilation, required longer durations of oxygenation, and were hospitalized longer. Persistent detection of virus was associated with clinical deteriorations. In addition, there was a higher rate of BPD in the virus-infected population, an observation clearly worthy of further study. The expression and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the lung have been implicated in the etiology of BPD [12] , in association with chorioamnionitis [13] and prolonged mechanical ventilation [14, 15] . Nosocomial RVIs may exacerbate the inflammation that already occurs secondary to positive pressure ventilation, prematurity and/ or supplemental oxygen therapy and may contribute to the development of chronic lung disease of prematurity. The effect of RVI on length of stay appeared to be mediated through effects on the respiratory system. Path analysis and linear regression analysis of our data showed significant direct and indirect effects of infection on length of stay.

Prolonged hospitalization is itself a risk-factor for nosocomial infection, supported by the finding in our study that the average length of time until first detecting an RVI was 24 days. Pre-existing lung disease may predispose infants to infection, as endotracheal intubation and feeding tubes (both markers of clinically compromised infants) have been previously identified as risk factors for acquisition of RVI [16] .

A limitation of our study is that it only covered one calendar year and a relatively small number of neonates. The potential for cross-contamination of specimens was limited by collection of samples in separate sealed containers using universal precautions. Laboratory contamination was limited by using dedicated trained personnel and strict sample identification identical to that employed for our hospital's clinical specimens. Sample containers remained sealed from collection until laboratory RNA extraction. To ensure a consistent sample set throughout the year, the collection schedule was adhered to as much as reasonably practical with exceptions made only for times when an infant could not safely be tested, and repeat attempts were made as soon as possible. There were no weeks when specimen collection did not occur. A limitation of our study is the difficulty in proving that detection of an RVI is due to ongoing viral replication. Seroconversion data might support this supposition, but this testing was not performed. In addition, the association between detection of an RVI and prolonged hospitalization, increased requirements for oxygenation and respiratory support, and a higher rate of BPD, does not in itself prove causation.

We documented transmission of respiratory pathogens to premature neonates during their birth hospitalization despite presumed vigilance related to infection control practices in these high-risk settings. These practices included the use of barriers (gowns and gloves), hand washing before and after each patient contact, the use of masks for anyone with respiratory symptoms, and the exclusion of all children. During this study, we did not explore the sources of infection, however most of the infants had contact only with the healthcare personnel and their parents. We noted that several twin infants had identical viruses detected at the same time, despite being in separate nursing areas. Our findings highlight the limitations of current infection control practices and raise questions as to whether more aggressive measures need to be implemented. Specifically, one needs to ask whether the presence or sequelae of these infections justify more intensive monitoring of infections and assessment of strategies of prevention and control guidelines.

During a year-long surveillance for respiratory viral infections in two neonatal intensive care units, we found that more than half of the preterm infants had at least one unrecognized, asymptomatic respiratory virus infection; among this group, hospitalization was prolonged and BPD more prevalent. Probability of remaining free of viral infection over time was not significantly different based on A) location, B) birthweight above or below 1000gm, C) gestational age above or below 28 weeks D) Sex. p-values calculated by Log-rank test. Infants with a diagnosis of BPD at 36 weeks (labeled as ""Yes"") had a greater probability of acquiring viral infection compared with infants without BPD (labeled as ""No'). p-values calculated by Log-rank test.

Clinical manifestations and outcomes of respiratory syncytial virus infection in adult hospitalized patients,"Objectives: To study the clinical outcomes of hospitalized patients aged ≥ 15 years and diagnosed with RSV infection. Study design: Both retrospective and prospective cohort studies were conducted at a university hospital between May 2014 and December 2015. Results: RSV was detected in 86 of 1562(5.5%) adult hospitalized patients suspected of respiratory viral infection. Sixty-nine patients were included in the study. RSV was detected by RT-PCR (82.6%), IFA (10.1%), and both RT-PCR and IFA (7.3%). Most patients (87.0%) were aged ≥ 50 years. Cardiovascular diseases, pulmonary diseases, immunocompromised hosts, and diabetes were the major comorbidities. The common manifestations were cough (92.8%), dyspnea (91.3%), sputum production (87.0%), tachypnea (75.4%), wheezing (73.9%), and fever (71.0%). Fifty-five patients (79.7%) were diagnosed with pneumonia. Hypoxemia (SpO2 ≤ 92%) was found in 53.6% patients. Twenty-five of 69(36.2%) patients developed respiratory failure and required ventilatory support. Cardiovascular complications were found in 24.6% of patients. Congestive heart failure, acute myocardial infarction (MI), new atrial fibrillation, and supraventricular tachycardia were found in 9(13.0%), 7(10.1%), 4(5.8%), and 3(4.3%) of 69 patients, respectively. Overall mortality was 15.9%. Pneumonia (81.8%) and acute MI (18.2%) were the major causes of death. Conclusions: Most adult hospitalized patients with RSV infection were of advanced age and had comorbidities. Cardiopulmonary complications were the major causes of death. Management and prevention of RSV infection in these vulnerable groups are necessary.","Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is an important cause of acute respiratory infection (ARI) in infants and young children [1] [2] [3] . Nevertheless, it has been recognized as a cause of adult ARI, especially in the elderly, those with comorbidities, and immunocompromised hosts, which leads to hospitalization and increases morbidity and mortality [1, [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] . The prevalence of RSV infection in adults varies from 3% to 13% depending on age groups, underlying diseases, diagnostic techniques, study periods, and geographic regions. [3] [4] [5] [7] [8] [9] , In addition, disease severity ranges from mild to severe acute respiratory illness [4] . A total of 4%-16% of adult patients with RSV infection required hospitalization [3, 4, 10] , with high complications including cardiopulmonary complications and mortality [4, 5, 8, 11] . There were a few data of adult hospitalized patients with RSV infection, with high complications, in Thailand; [3, 12, 13] however, additional clinical data are required for planning patient management and also disease prevention in this region.

The objective of the study was to determine the clinical manifestations and outcomes of RSV infection in adult hospitalized patients. 

Immunocompromised patients were defined as patients who received chemotherapy, corticosteroids > 20 mg/day prednisolone equivalent, hematologic malignancy, or HIV infection. Pneumonia was diagnosed if patients had fever, cough, and dyspnea with new pulmonary infiltrates on chest radiography. Acute bronchitis was defined as an acute respiratory infection manifested predominantly by cough without pneumonia, common cold, or exacerbation of asthma or COPD [14] . Chest radiography was independently interpreted by two chest radiologists who did not know the clinical course of patients. If the results were discordant, the consensus was made after the discussion. Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) was defined as pneumonia that developed 48 h or more after admission without endotracheal intubation. Ventilator-acquired pneumonia (VAP) was defined as pneumonia that developed more than 48 h after endotracheal intubation [15, 16] . COPD exacerbation was defined as a sustained worsening of the COPD patients' condition beyond normal day-to-day variations, acute onset and necessitates a change in regular medication [17] . Asthma exacerbation was defined by changes in symptoms and rescue use, which were outside the patients' usual range of day-to-day variation [18] . Worsening or new congestive heart failure were diagnosed by cardiologists based on clinical signs, laboratory investigation such as chest radiography and echocardiography.

The PASW statistics 18.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) was used for the analysis. Categorical data were described as percentages. Normally distributed continuous data were presented as mean and standard deviation (SD), whereas non-normally distributed data were presented as median and interquartile range (IQR). Categorical and continuous variables were compared between groups using Chi-square test or Fisher's Exact test and unpaired t-test or Mann-Whitney test as appropriate. Multiple logistic regression analysis was performed to identify the risk factors of complications and were presented as odds ratio and 95% confidence interval. A p-value of < 0.05 was considered a statistically significant difference.

Respiratory specimen of 1562 adult hospitalized patients suspected of respiratory viral infection were sent to detect RSV during May 2014 and December 2015. RSV was detected in 86 (5.5%) of patients in 5 months a year between July and November during two consecutive rainy seasons (Fig. 1 ). Sixty-nine RSV positive patients provided written informed consent and were included in the study. RSV was detected by RT-PCR (82.6%), IFA (10.1%) and both RT-PCR and IFA (7.3%). Clinical outcomes in terms of acute respiratory illnesses (ARI) and mortality are demonstrated in Fig. 2 . Community-acquired and nosocomial-acquired RSV infections were found in 57 (82.6%) and 12 (17.4%) patients, respectively. Twenty-one of 57 (36.8%) community-acquired RSV infected patients had a history of contact with persons having acute respiratory tract infection in their families. The nosocomial-acquired infections were detected during outbreak, 5 patients at hematologic ward, and 7 patients at general medical ward. Pneumonia was the most common ARI in both groups. Mortality rates of the community-acquired and nosocomial-acquired RSV infections were 15.8% (9 of 57) and 16.7% (2 of 12), respectively. The clinical manifestations of community-acquired and nosocomial-acquired RSV infections were similar, and the data were combined for analysis.

The median age of patients was 72 years (IQR 58-81 years) (Table1). Sixty of 69 (87.0%) patients aged ≥ 50 years with the highest prevalence (36.2%) of age 65-79 years. Among patients aged < 50 years, 7 of 9 (77.8%) were immunocompromised hosts (3 hematologic malignancy, 2 hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients, and 2 connective tissue diseases on immunosuppressive drugs). Females were the predominant. All patients had at least one comorbidity. The most common comorbidities were pre-existing cardiovascular diseases (33.3%), pulmonary diseases (29.0%), immunocompromised hosts (29.0%), diabetes (29.0%), and chronic kidney diseases (26.1%).

The median duration of symptoms at presentation was 3days (IQR 2-3.5days). The common presenting symptoms ( Table 2) were cough (92.8%), dyspnea (91.3%), sputum production (87.0%), and history of fever (81.2%). Rhinorrhea was present in 46.4%of patients. The common initial physical findings were tachypnea (75.4%), wheezing (73.9%),and fever (43.5%). Wheezing was found in 69.6% (39 of 56) of patients after excluding asthma or COPD. Fever (BT ≥ 37.8°C) was foundin approximately 71.0% patients in the first 2 days of admission with mean temperature 38.7 ± 0.6°C. After excluding hematologic malignancy and bacterial co-infection, the median white blood counts were 7995 cells/mm 3 (IQR 5,632-10,842 cells/mm 3 ). Median neutrophil and lymphocyte counts were 72.6% (IQR 60.0-84.2 %) and 16 .6% (IQR 9.0-24.5%), respectively.

Chest X-rays were performed for all patients. Pneumonia and acute bronchitis were diagnosed in 79.7% (55/69) and 17.4% (12/69) patients, respectively (Fig. 2) . Chest radiography findings of pneumonia were diffuse interstitial infiltrations alone 60.0% (33/55), mixed diffused interstitial and alveolar infiltrations 30.9% (17/55), and alveolar infiltrations alone 9.1% (5/55). Exacerbations were occurred in 9 of 10 asthma and all 3 COPD patients. Hypoxemia (peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO 2 ) ≤ 92%) was found in 26 patients (37.7%) at the initial presentation and increased to 37 patients (53.6%) during the hospitalization. Twenty-five of 69 (36.2%) patients developed acute respiratory failure and required ventilatory support (22 patients needed invasive mechanical ventilation and 3 patients required non-invasive ventilation). 2 . Summary of clinical outcomes in terms of ARI and mortality of community-acquired and nosocomial-acquired RSV infections in adult hospitalized patients. RSV, respiratory syncytial virus; ARI, acute respiratory illness; COPD, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; HAP, hospital-acquired pneumonia; VAP, ventilator-associated pneumonia. 

Seventeen of 69 patients (24.6%) developed cardiovascular complications and 9 of 17 (52.9%) patients had pre-existing cardiovascular diseases (CVD). Congestive heart failure (CHF), acute myocardial infarction (MI), new atrial fibrillation (AF), and supraventricular tachycardia (SVT, heart rate 130, 160 and 220 beats/min) were found in 9 (13.0%), 7 (10.1%), 4 (5.8%), and3 (4.3%) of 69 patients, respectively. Four of 9 CHF patients had worsening CHF. Among 5 new onset CHF patients, 4 patients had pre-existing coronary artery disease and valvular heart disease, and the other one had no previous diagnosis of CVD but had left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) 33.5% during RSV infection. All acute MI were diagnosed as non-ST-elevation MI (NSTEMI). Five of 7 (71.4%) acute MI had concomitant CHF. Three of 7 (42.8%) acute MI patients were first diagnosed, and all had the risk factors of coronary artery disease (DM, hypertension and dyslipidemia). The pre-existing coronary arterial disease (CAD) was the risk factor of overall cardiovascular complications in hospitalized adult patients with RSV infection with odds ratio 6.18, (95% CI 1.18-32.5), p = 0.03, adjusted for age, sex, HT, DLP, DM, pre-existing CHF, arrhythmia, and VHD.

Sixty-five (94.2%) and 51 (73.9%) patients received initial empirical antibiotics and antiviral drugs (oseltamivir), respectively. After confirmed RSV infection, 32 (46.4%) patients received oral ribavirin in cases of respiratory failure that needed mechanical ventilator, hematologic malignancy, immunosuppressive therapy, or HIV infection. Mortality rates in patients treated with oral ribavirin compared to those without oral ribavirin were 18.8% (6/32) vs 13.5% (5/37), p-value 0.553. Sputum specimens were collected in 54 (78.3%) patients, but only 18 of 54 (33.3%) specimens were acceptable for bacterial culture. Bacterial co-infection with RSV identified by sputum culture were found in 6(8.7%) patients, Haemophilus influenzae (1), Klebsiella pneumoniae (1), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (2), Acinetobacter baumannii (1), and Pasteurella multocida (1). Hemoculture for bacteria was performed on 65 patients (94.2%). Three patients had concomitant bacteremia, Escherichia coli (2), and Aeromonas hydrophila (1). One patient with E. coli bacteremia had urinary tract infection, whereas the source of infection including sputum culture was not identified in other two patients.

The overall mortality rate was 15.9% (11 of 69 patients). Two patients of nosocomial RSV infection had hematologic malignancy with agranulocytosis. They received oral ribavirin, empirical antibiotics, and antifungal drugs; however, RSV persisted and had no evidence of other organisms (bacteria or fungus). Nine patients of community-acquired RSV infection were of advanced age (64-95 years) and had comorbidities. Pneumonia (9 of 11, 81.8%) and acute MI (2 of 11, 18.2%) were the most and the second common causes of death.

Most (87.0%) adult hospitalized patients with RSV infection of age ≥ 50 years had comorbidities. RSV is an important pathogen not only in patients of age ≥ 65 years but also in the age range 50-64 years, which was similar to previous studies [9, 19, 20] . Nevertheless, we found the highest prevalence in age range 65-79 years (36.2%). The major comorbidities were pre-existing cardiopulmonary diseases, hematologic malignancy, immunocompromised hosts and DM. These findings were similar to the results of previous studies [4, 6, 11, 19, 21] . RSV infection is a seasonal disease [3, 22, 23] . We found RSV infection in the hospitalized patients during rainy seasons, which was similar to the results of a previous study in another region of Thailand [3] . The common manifestations were cough, dyspnea, sputum production, fever, wheezing, and tachypnea, similar to the previous studies. [6, 9, 11, 21, 24] Nevertheless, nasal congestion and rhinorrhea were not the predominant symptoms in our study. These findings suggested predominant involvement of lower respiratory tract, which might be associated with disease severity.

The prevalence of pneumonia and acute respiratory failure, which required ventilatory support, was higher than those in previous studies, 79.7% vs 29%-67.5% and 36.2% vs 3.4%-17.0%, respectively [6, 7, 11, [25] [26] [27] . Chest radiologic findings of RSV pneumonia in our study included predominant interstitial infiltrations (60.0% diffuse interstitial infiltrations alone and 30.9% mixed diffused interstitial and alveolar infiltrations). In contrast, those of most previous studies were consolidation or ground-glass opacity in unilateral and basilar in location [6, 11, 24, 28] . However, our radiologic findings were similar to those of a previous study conducted in rural Thailand by another research group [12] .

Cardiovascular complications were found in 24.6% of patients including both worsening and new onset CHF, acute MI, new AF and SVT, and 52.9% of them had pre-existing cardiovascular diseases. The prevalence of cardiovascular complications in adult RSV infection had been reported in 14.3%-22.0% of patients [6, 11] . A risk of overall cardiovascular complications in our study was pre-existing coronary arterial disease (CAD) with adjusted odds ratio 6.18, (95% CI 1.18-32.5), p = 0.03. In addition, we found that acute MI was the second cause of death. These supported the importance of cardiovascular complications in adult hospitalized patients with RSV infection. Patients with cardiovascular disease have higher rates of health care utilization for RSV-related illness and worse outcomes [29] .

Most patients received initial empirical antibiotics (94.2%) and oseltamivir (73.9%), which had no effect on RSV. We might reduce the unnecessary uses of antibiotics and anti-influenza drugs, if we knew pathogen earlier. Oral ribavirin was used in patients with severe respiratory failure who needed mechanical ventilator and immunocompromised hosts in our observational study; however, the benefit of treatment is not clear.

The mortality rate was high (15.9%) compared to other studies (5.8%-11.9%) [4, 6, 21] . This might be because of severe RSV infection, where pneumonia was found in 79.7% of patients. In the adult hospitalized patients with RSV infection, mortality was higher in the elderly with comorbidities and young patients with hematologic malignancy. Cardiopulmonary complications such as pneumonia and acute MI were the most and the second causes of death, respectively.

High complications and mortality of RSV infection in our study supported the importance of RSV infection in adult hospitalized patients. RSV causing severe complications and high mortality in the elderly similar to or higher than influenza had been reported [7, 11, 30] . Adult severe pneumonia can occur in other viruses including human metapneumovirus (HMPV), human rhinovirus, parainfluenza virus, adenovirus, and coronavirus [5, 10, 31] . More studies of respiratory viral infections in adult patients are needed to identify the incidence and the impact of these viruses in Thailand. The mechanisms of these severe diseases in the elderly are not clear. However, the experimental studies in aged mice infected with RSV and/or HMPV demonstrated that CD4 + T lymphocytes, the cytokine response, or a defect in humoral response may be associated with the severity in this population [32, 33] .

The first limitation of the study is the combination of retrospective and prospective studies, even though most of the patient data were recorded by pulmonologists on duty. The retrospective study might affect the presenting symptoms of patients; however, it should not affect the clinical outcomes including cardiopulmonary complications and mortality. The second limitation is that only the respiratory specimens of patients suspected of respiratory viral infection were sent for the detection of RSV. It may lead to bias in the prevalence and clinical presentations. The prospective study of all adult hospitalized patients with acute respiratory illness should be conducted to determine the prevalence, clinical manifestations, and outcomes of the virus.

Most of the adult hospitalized patients with RSV infections aged ≥ 50 years old and had pre-existing cardiopulmonary diseases, hematologic malignancy, immunocompromised hosts, and DM. Pneumonia and acute MI were the major causes of death. Management and preventive strategies of RSV infection in these vulnerable groups in both community-acquired and hospital-acquired infections are necessary.

Bocavirus Infection in Otherwise Healthy Children with Respiratory Disease,"To evaluate the role of human bocavirus (hBoV) as a causative agent of respiratory disease, the importance of the viral load in respiratory disease type and severity and the pathogenicity of the different hBoV species, we studied all hBoV-positive nasopharyngeal samples collected from children who attended an emergency room for a respiratory tract infection during three winters (). Human bocavirus was detected using the respiratory virus panel fast assay and real-time PCR. Of the 1,823 nasopharyngeal samples, 104 (5.7%) were positive for hBoV; a similar prevalence was observed in all three periods studied. Among hBoV-infected children, 53.8% were between 1-2 years old, and hBoV was detected alone in 57/104 (54.8%) cases. All of the detected hBoV strains belonged to genotype 1. The median hBoV load was significantly higher in samples containing strains with both the N546H and T590S mutations compared to other samples (p<0.05). Children with a single hBoV-1 infection more frequently had upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) than those who were co-infected (37.0% vs 17.8%, respectively, p = 0.04). The duration of hospitalization was longer among children with high viral loads than that observed among children with low viral loads (8.0 ±2.2 days vs 5.0 ±1.5 days, respectively, p = 0.03), and the use of aerosol therapy was more frequent among children with high viral loads than among those with low viral loads (77.1% vs 55.7%, respectively, p = 0.04). This study shows that hBoV is a relatively uncommon but stable infectious agent in children and that hBoV1 seems to be the only strain detected in Italy in respiratory samples. From a clinical point of view, hBoV1 seems to have in the majority of healthy children relatively low clinical relevance. Moreover, the viral load influences only the duration of hospitalization and the use of aerosol therapy without any association with the site of the respiratory disease.","Human bocavirus (hBoV) is a recently identified viral agent that belongs to the family Parvoviridae and contains a single linear positive-sense or negative-sense single-stranded deoxyribonucleic acid genome [1] . This virus has been detected mainly in younger children, in nasopharyngeal secretions, in sera and blood samples of patients with upper (URTI) and lower (LRTI) respiratory tract infections and in faecal specimens of subjects with gastroenteritis [2] . Currently, hBoVs are classified into species 1 through 4; hBoV1 is predominantly found in the respiratory tract, and hBoV2, hBoV3, and hBoV4 are found mainly in stool [3] .

Despite there are studies suggesting that hBoV is able to infect the lower airways causing severe infections in both children and adults, the role of hBoV as a causative agent of respiratory disease is frequently questioned due to its common detection with other potential pathogens [4] and the evidence that in some studies co-infections can have a significantly greater clinical and socioeconomic impact on infected children and their households than hBoV infection alone [5] . Moreover, the importance of the viral load in determining the type and severity of respiratory disease as well as the pathogenicity of the different hBoV species [6] are not precisely defined. The main aim of this study was to contribute to resolving these problems. The circulation of hBoV during several winter seasons in Italy was investigated, and a phylogenetic analysis of detected strains was performed. In addition, correlations between different hBoV strains and the severity of disease in cases with infections due to hBoV alone or due to co-infections were studied. Finally, the role of the viral load was analysed.

To evaluate the circulation of the different hBoV types and the possible relationships between viral load, virus genetic characteristics, and the severity of infection, nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from otherwise healthy children attending the emergency room of the Fondazione IRCCS Ca' Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, University of Milan, Italy, due to a respiratory tract infection arising between November 1 and March 31 during 3 winters (2009-2010, 2011-2012, and 2013-2014) . The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Fondazione IRCCS Ca' Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, Milan, Italy. Written informed consent of a parent or legal guardian was required, and children 8 years of age were asked to give their written assent. Patients' demographic characteristics and medical histories were retrieved from hospital charts and were systematically recorded before and after the first visit to the emergency room using standardized written questionnaires [7] . The study patients were classified into disease groups (i.e., acute otitis media, rhinosinusitis, pharyngitis, croup, infectious wheezing, acute bronchitis, pneumonia) on the basis of signs and/or symptoms using well-established criteria and were finally subdivided into two subgroups: upper (URTIs) and lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) [8] . Nasopharyngeal secretions were collected from all of the children immediately after admission to the emergency room using a paranasal flocked swab (1 swab per child), which was stored in a tube containing 1 mL of universal transport medium (Kit Cat. No. 360c, Copan Italia, Brescia, Italy).

Viral nucleic acids were extracted from each swab by means of a Nuclisens EasyMAG automated extraction system (Biomeriéux, Craponne, France), and the extract was tested for respiratory viruses using the respiratory virus panel xTAG RVP FAST v2 (Luminex Molecular Diagnostics, Inc., Toronto, Canada), which simultaneously detects influenza A virus (subtypes H1 or H3); influenza B virus; respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) types A and B; human parainfluenza virus types 1-4 (hPiV1-4); adenovirus (AdV); human metapneumovirus (hMPV); coronaviruses (hCoV) 229E, NL63, OC43 and HKU1, enterovirus/rhinovirus (EV/hRV); and hBoV, in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions [9, 10] . Samples that were positive for hBoV were stored at -80°C.

HBoV real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) Viral nucleic acid extracts previously testing positive for hBoV were re-tested for confirmation by two different singleplex real-time PCRs using TaqMan Universal Master Mix II (Applied Biosystems, California, USA). Amplification and detection of viral DNA were performed with a 7900HT real-time PCR System machine (Applied Biosystems, California, USA). Conserved regions for RT-PCR primers and probes were identified in the hBoV NS-1 and NP-1 genes from the nucleotide sequence alignments available from GenBank (for NS1, DQ206700-08, DQ000495-96, and DQ200648, and for NP-1, DQ000495-96, AB243566-72, DQ296618-35, DQ353695-99, DQ299885, DQ267760-75, DQ284856, DQ295844, and AM109958-66; http:// www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/). Each 25 μL singleplex reaction mixture consisted of 0.5 μL of forward primer 5'-TGCAGACAACGCYTAGTTGTTT-3' and reverse primer 5'-CTGTCCCG CCCAAGATACA-3' for the 88 base pair NS-1 target or forward primer 5'-AGCATCGCTCCTACAAAAGAAAAG-3' and reverse primer 5'-TCTTCATCACTTGGTCTGA GGTCT-3' for the NP-1 target, 0.125 μL of probe 5'-CCAGGATTGGGTGGAACCTGCAAA-3' or 5'-AGGCTCGGGCTCATATCATCAGGAACA-3', and 2.5 μL of sample viral DNA. PCRs were conducted at 50°C for 2 min and then at 95°C for 10 min, followed by 45 cycles at 95°C for 15 sec and at 60°C for 1 min. TaqMan probes were labelled at the 5' ends with the reporter molecule 6-carboxyfluorescein and at the 3' ends with Black Hole Quencher 1 (Biosearch Technologies, Inc., Novato, CA). Each run included one synthetic template control and one no-template control for each target. Specimen extracts were also tested by real-time PCR for the human RNase-P gene to monitor specimen quality and the presence of PCR inhibitors. A positive test for both the NS1 and NP-1 targets or for a single target confirmed from a second extraction from a new sample aliquot was considered definitive evidence of hBoV infection.

The viral load was obtained using real-time PCR with the NS1 primers and probe previously described and a DNA plasmid used as the standard calibrator. The amplified target fragment of the plasmid was verified by sequencing. Plasmid DNA concentrations were detected with an ND-1000 spectrophotometer (NanoDrop products, Wilmington, DE, USA). Each run included plasmid and negative controls. Standard precautions were taken throughout the PCR process to avoid cross-contamination. Negative controls and serial dilutions of the positive controls were included in every PCR assay. Finally, quantitative results were reported as DNA copies/ mL of respiratory samples. The viral load was defined as low for values 10 6 log (copies/mL) and as high for values >10 6 log (copies/mL).

For genotyping, the viral VP-1/2 gene was amplified using a conventional PCR assay. Briefly, 4 sets of forward and reverse primers (5'-CACAGACAGAAGCAGACGAGAT-3' and 5'-GGTG AGAAGTGACAGCTGTATTG-3'; 5'-TTCAGAATGGTCACCTCTACA-3' and 5'-CTGTGC TTCCGTTTTGTCTTA-3'; 5'-AACTTTGACTGTGAATGGGTTA-3' and 5'-AAATAGTGCC TGGAGGATGAT-3'; 5'-CTATCACCAGAGAAAATCCAATC-3' and 5'-GAGACGGTAACA CCACTA-3') were used in PCR amplification and the Quantitect Probe Master Mix (QIA-GEN, Venlo, Netherlands) was used as the basis for the reaction mix. Viral products were analysed by electrophoresis on a 1.5% agarose gel and purified with the QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (QIAGEN, Venlo, Netherlands). Sequencing reactions were set up with purified DNA, one of the specific primers used in the PCR and BigDye Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems, California, USA) according to the protocol recommended by the manufacturer. Sequencing and sequence analysis were performed on a 3130 Genetic Analyser (Applied Biosystems, California, USA).

All alignments were performed using ClustalX 2.1 and BioEdit (version 7.1.3.0) software (Ibis Biosciences, Carlsbad, CA). Phylogenetic trees of the VP-1/2 protein gene were generated using the neighbour-joining method and p-distance model of the Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analyses (MEGA) software, version 5.05 [11] . Bootstrap probabilities for 1,000 iterations were calculated to evaluate confidence estimates. The graphs were made using GraphPad Prism version 5.01 for Windows (GraphPAD Software, San Diego, CA). All genotyped sequences of the hBoV VP-1/2 gene were submitted to GenBank (accession numbers KR014412-KR014516).

Tests for positive selection were conducted on the Datamonkey server [12] using the singlelikelihood ancestor (SLAC), and the fixed-effects likelihood (FEL) [13] , the internal branch fixed-effects likelihood (IFEL) [14] , the mixed effects model of evolution (MEME) [15] , and fast unconstrained Bayesian approximation methods (FUBAR). The dN/dS ratios were calculated using the SLAC and FEL codon-based maximum likelihood approaches. The SLAC approach counts the number of non-synonymous changes per non-synonymous site (dN) and tests whether it is significantly different from the number of synonymous changes per synonymous site (dS). The FEL approach estimates the ratios of non-synonymous to synonymous changes for each site in an alignment. The IFEL method is similar to the FEL, but tests site-bysite selection along only the internal branches of the phylogeny. In order to avoid an excessive false-positive rate, sites with SLAC, FEL, IFEL and MEME p-values of <0.1 and a FUBAR posterior probability of >0.90 were accepted as candidates for selection.

Descriptive statistics of the responses were generated. Continuous variables were presented as mean values and standard deviations (SDs) and categorical variables as numbers and percentages. For categorical data, comparisons between groups were performed using a contingency table analysis with the Χ 2 or Fisher's exact test when appropriate. For ordered categorical data, a Cochran-Armitage test for trend was used to compare the groups. Continuous data were analysed using a two-sided Student's t-test after ensuring the data were normally distributed (based on the Shapiro-Wilk statistic) or using a two-sided Wilcoxon's rank-sum test if the data were non-normal. All analyses were two tailed, and p-values of 0.05 or less were considered to be statistically significant. All analyses were conducted using SAS version 9.2 (Cary, NC, USA).

During the three study periods, 1,823 nasopharyngeal samples were collected in the emergency room. Of these, 104 (5.7%) tested positive for hBoV (Table 1) . Among hBoV infected children, 53.8% were between 1-2 years old, whereas 28.8% and 17.3% were aged <1 and 3 years, respectively. The prevalence of hBoV detection was quite similar in the three studied periods; HBoV was the only virus detected in 57/ 104 (54.8%) cases and was detected in association with one (89.5%) or more (10.5%) viruses in 47 (45.2%) cases. EV/hRV and RSV were the most common co-infecting viral agents and were found, respectively, in 20 and 18 samples. Subjects with co-infection were younger than those without (p = 0.03). Considering 10 6 DNA copies/mL as a cut-off, the viral load was classified as low in 66 (63.5%) cases and as high in 38 (36.5%) cases.

The phylogenetic tree constructed using the VP1/VP2 sequences showed that all of the Italian hBoV strains detected during the three study periods belonged to hBoV genotype 1 (Fig 1) . No unusual clustering was observed among the identified strains; hBoVs circulating in 2009 were closely related to strains circulating in 2014. The sequence identity matrix of the VP1/VP2 gene showed minimum to maximum identity ranges of 97.8-100% between the Italian strains and 98.4-99.7% with respect to hBoV st1 reference strains (DQ000495). In comparison to the reference strain, 8/105 (7.6%) strains had only one amino acid difference, 32/105 (30.4%) strains had two amino acid differences, and the remaining strains (65/105; 61.9%) had at least three amino acid changes.

A total of 61/672 (9.1%) amino acid positions were observed to have at least one change in the VP1/VP2 sequence alignments (Fig 2) . Of these, 7/61 (11.5%) changes occurred within the VP1 unique (VP1U) region corresponding to the first 129 amino acids at the N-terminus of the VP1 gene. Specifically, the following changes were observed: R17K, G28D, E29K, L40S, H43Q, D72N, and G126E (Fig 2) .

The VP1U region includes the conserved phospholipase A 2 (PLA 2 ) motif (nt 21-63). The VP1U sequences of all hBoV isolates identified in this study revealed conserved YXGXG (nt [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] and HDXXY (nt 41-45) motifs in the catalytic site of secreted PLA 2 . In addition, the amino acid residues at positions 21, 41, 42 and 63 have been hypothesized to form the catalytic network for enzymatic activity. In our hBoV strains, all the sequences had amino acids associated with efficient enzymatic activity (P21, H41, D42, and D63).

Of note, two hBoV strains (MI-267-Jan2014 and MI-272-Jan2014) had a peculiar amino acid sequence in the 19-amino acid segment starting at amino acid 411 (KVPTRRVQPYIRQTNWKHR), which has not been previously reported in hBoV strains included in the GenBank database (in red, Fig 1) . Overall, these two strains had 13 and 14 amino acid changes compared to the hBoV st1 strain, and almost all these changes were included in the region described below. The origin of this highly divergent region, which occurred in spite of the conservation displayed in the rest of the hBoV DNA genome, remains to be defined.

A global analysis of selective pressure made using the SLAC model indicated an estimated overall dN/dS ratio of 0.18. Overall, the site-specific analyses identified three sites (411, 536, and 546) as under positive selection by at least two methods used (SLAC, FEL, FUBAR, and MEME). The IFEL model was used to determine the selection pressure acting on the VP1/VP2 codons along the internal branches of the tree. Two positively selected codons (411 and 546) were identified. The selected sites, highlighted with arrows in Fig 2, were presumably located in Of these strains, 6/13 (46.1%) were also characterized by the N534K, Q535P, and Q535D mutations. Several negatively selected sites were identified by different methods (Table 2 ).

Regarding the viral load, a wide range of hBoV DNA levels from 3.5x10 2 to 7.5x10 9 copies/mL were found in the clinical samples. In Fig 2 (right side) , the viral load of each Italian hBoV strain is reported near the aligned mutations. In the group of strains (n = 70; 66.6%) harbouring at least 2 mutations in addition to A149T, the values of the hBoV load greater than 1x10 8 DNA copies/ml are reported in grey. A total of 16 strains had a very high viral load, and 13/16 (81.3%) harboured the T590S mutation. This percentage is nearly significantly different than the overall frequency (42/70; 53.8%) of T590S in the group of strains described below (p = 0.08). Seven of the 13 strains with the T590S mutation had an additional mutation in one of the sites under positive selection (reported in Fig 2 with an asterisk) . In detail, 4/13 (30.8%) had the N546H change, 2/13 (15.4%) had the A411D change, and 1/13 (7.7%) had the A411T change.

Based on the observed data, we hypothesize that the double mutation of N546H with T590S may positively affect viral replication and specific immune response. As shown in Table 3 , the median hBoV load was significantly higher in samples of strains with the N546H and T590S changes than that in samples of wild type T590 strains, strains with only the T590S mutation, and strains with only the N546H mutation (p-values of 0.0078, 0.016 and 0.018, respectively). Finally, the two divergent strains (MI-267-Jan2014 and MI272-Jan2014) with unusual amino acid changes were observed with viral loads lower than 10 6 DNA copies/mL. This could suggest that these mutations do not confer a replicative advantage in these virus strains.

In Table 4 , data regarding demographic, clinical and laboratory characteristics of children infected by hBoV-1 alone or co-infected with hBoV-1 and one or more other respiratory viruses are reported. Because a preliminary evaluation did not find any differences among subjects co-infected with EV/HRV, RSV or other viruses, all co-infections were considered together. As shown, children infected with only hBoV-1 had URTIs more frequently than those with a co-infection (37.0% vs 17.8%, respectively, p = 0.04). Moreover, a similar illness within the family in the 7 days since patient enrolment was significantly more common among co-infected children than among those with a single infection (48.9% vs 26.5%, respectively, p = 0.02). No other significant differences between the groups were observed. Table 5 shows the demographic, clinical, and laboratory characteristics of the enrolled subjects according to the hBoV load. Subjects with low and high viral loads were quite similar. The only significant differences were found in the duration of hospitalization, which was longer among children with a high viral load than among those with a low viral load (8.0 ±2.2 days vs 5.0 ±1.5 days, respectively, p = 0.03), and in the use of aerosol therapy, which was more frequent among children with a high viral load than among those with a low viral load (77.1% vs 55.7%, respectively, p = 0.04). Moreover, mutations leading to a high or low viral load were not associated with atypical clinical characteristics.

This study shows that in Italy during the winter periods 2009-2010, 2011-2012, and 2013-2014, the incidence of hBoV infection among children with respiratory disease was relatively low, limited to approximately 5% of cases, and did not significantly vary from year to year.

The phylogenetic analysis showed that all of the strains detected in this study belonged to hBoV genotype 1 and were closely related to the prototype strain identified by Allander et al. [1] . This was expected because this genotype is the most common among hBoVs associated with respiratory infections [1] .

Most of the patients in whom hBoV1 was identified were younger than 3 years of age, further highlighting that younger children are the individuals most frequently infected by this viral agent [1] . Serological studies have shown evidence that the number of subjects positive for anti-hBoV1 antibodies continuously increases with increasing age group from the ages of 6 months to 6 years, and by the age of 2 years approximately 80% of children have been infected with hBoV1 [16, 17] . More than 50% of the children infected by hBoV1 in this study were coinfected with at least one other respiratory virus. Moreover, co-infected patients had LRTI more frequently than those infected by hBoV alone. These findings are not surprising because simultaneous detection of hBoV1 and other viruses in children with respiratory disease and greater severity in co-infected cases have been already reported in studies in which it was also demonstrated that hBoV1 can frequently be identified in the respiratory secretions of asymptomatic subjects [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] . Recently, it has been reported that hBoV1 can be shed for several days or months after a previous infection [24] , which could explain the simultaneous identification of hBoV1 and other respiratory viruses, the frequency of asymptomatic infections and the generally greater severity of infections in co-infected individuals compared to those with hBoV1 alone. In most of the co-infected cases, detection of hBoV in the respiratory secretions with the new sensitive molecular methods able to identify very low viral loads might be a consequence of a previous clinically resolved disease, and a virus other than hBoV was therefore the real cause of the disease. However, reports of severe clinical manifestations in patients infected with only hBoV have been published [25] , highlighting that the assessment of the real importance of hBoV infection in a single patient remains very difficult. Studies on children with severe pneumonia, acute wheezing, asthma and/or bronchiolitis suggested that hBoV1 is able to infect the lower airways down to the bronchioles [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] . Moreover, hBoV1 has been found as the only infectious agent in adult lung transplant recipients with severe LRTI, whereas it was not detected in respiratory secretions of asymptomatic transplanted subjects [33] . This would indicate that hBoV1 is not always a bystander or the cause of mild respiratory problems but rather a real, although relatively rare, causative agent of severe disease in both children and adults, particularly when they are immunocompromised. On the other hand, hBoV can cause serious neurological infections [34] and contribute to chronic disease in adult patients mainly because it can persist after childhood infection and reactivate [35] . Evaluation of the viral load has been considered a possible method to define when this virus is the real cause of a respiratory disease and when it is only a secondary infection. Unfortunately, this approach has had no success because although some studies have shown evidence for a strict correlation between high viral load and severe LRTI in children with a single hBoV infection [36] [37] [38] , others, including the present study, did not show a clear relationship between these two variables [39] . However, the evolution of virulence appears to involve a variety of mechanisms in different viral systems, including mutations in regulatory regions and viral adaptation for utilization of alternative or expanded repertoires of cellular receptors. An alternative hypothesis to evaluate the importance of hBoV1 concerns the correlation between viral load levels and the presence of specific mutations. However, mutations associated with increased or reduced replication are rarely reported for hBoV. Recently, Hao et al. have reported that few nucleotide changes were correlated with a lower viral load [40] . In the present study, a double mutant (N546H and T590S) was observed in samples with a significantly higher viral load. However, further phenotypic validation studies are required to draw major conclusions regarding the impact of these mutations on viral replication. Furthermore, as reported by Qu et al. [41] , it seems that nucleotide changes in the VP1U region could affect the replication efficiency of hBoV. Likewise, in our strains all the amino acids of the catalytic site were conserved, and no mutations that affect sPLA 2 activity were identified.

In agreement with others [42] , the phylogenetic analysis of this study confirmed the very low degree of variability in the hBoV genomic region encoding proteins that are exposed to the virus surface and are therefore under immunologic pressure. Only 9% (62 codons) of amino acids were found to have at least one change in the VP1/VP2 gene, a finding not substantially different from that reported by Hao et al. in a different geographic area [40] . In our study, several amino acid changes were observed in strains circulating in almost all the respiratory seasons. This finding provides evidence that the selection of those variants best adapted to each particular environment might select for variants with an evolutionary advantage. Seven of these mutations were located in a genomic region (i.e., VP1U) previously reported to be involved in the mechanisms of virus replication. For instance, the VP1U amino acid variations R17K and L40S have been previously reported [43] , whereas the remaining variations have not yet been described. Interestingly, two hBoV strains identified in respiratory samples collected in January 2014 had unusual amino acid sequences in a somewhat conserved genomic region. The reason for this genetic diversity is still undefined. However, as described for hBoV, other parvoviruses [44] , and enteroviruses, a series of α-helices and β-barrels in the VP2 protein were intercalated by an external loop, in which the majority of the genetic variability accumulated. Nevertheless, these two divergent strains were found in samples with low viral loads, and we might hypothesize a loss of replication advantage for these strains.

In the present study, the dN/dS ratios for all pairwise comparisons were <1, which is in line with previous results showing that positive selection was extremely limited in parvoviruses [45] . In fact, selective pressure analyses have identified 3 codons under positive selection. In a previous paper, a different codon (L40) was identified as being under positive selection [46] . Nevertheless, the great majority of codons were under negative or neutral selection, which has also been confirmed by others [47] . This finding suggests that only a few amino acids of the VP1/VP2 proteins present on the surface of the virion are potentially subjected to a strong selective pressure by the host immune response.

In conclusion, this study confirms that hBoV is less common than other respiratory viruses but that the frequency of its detection in children with respiratory disease is in time stable. It was detected with a prevalence of about 5% in several consecutive seasons and no unusual clustering was observed among identified strains, with strains circulating in 2009 being closely related to those circulating in 2014. Moreover, only a minority of virus sites were found to be under positive selective pressure, and all the strains detected in respiratory tract infections of this Italian study belonged to genotype 1. From a clinical point of view, this study highlights that in otherwise healthy children, hBoV1 seems to have relatively low clinical relevance, because patients infected with hBoV alone mainly suffered from an URTI. The viral load was not associated with clinical characteristics of the infection, and viral mutations, despite affecting viral replication, did not affect the conditions or severity of the clinical presentation. Further studies are needed to clarify the clinical relevance of hBoV in children, particularly in those at risk for severe chronic underlying disease, and to evaluate the role of viral modification in conditioning the degree of viral virulence and the specific immune response.

Clinical Infectious Diseases Burden and Risk Factors for Coronavirus Infections in Infants in Rural Nepal,"Knowledge of risk factors for symptomatic human coronavirus (HCoV) infections in children in community settings is limited. We estimated the disease burden and impact of birth-related, maternal, household, and seasonal factors on HCoV infections among children from birth to 6 months old in rural Nepal.","Acute respiratory infections (ARIs) contribute significantly to pediatric mortality and morbidity worldwide [1] , resulting in 3.1 million deaths annually [2] . Pneumonia, a severe manifestation of ARI, is the single largest cause of death in children worldwide, accounting for 16% of all deaths among children <5 years of age [3] . Viruses are the leading cause of ARIs, accounting for up to 80% of all cases [4, 5] . Increased use of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) over the past decade has led to a greater detection of previously underrecognized viruses such as human coronaviruses (HCoVs). HCoVs have been detected worldwide from persons of all ages [6] . HCoVs are commonly associated with upper respiratory tract infections, cause up to one-third of all common colds [7, 8] , and can also cause severe lower respiratory tract infections, including pneumonia, in susceptible individuals [9] [10] [11] . There are 4 genera: alpha, beta, gamma, and delta coronaviruses. In the genus Alphacoronavirus, there are several species including HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63. In the genus Betacoronavirus, species include HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-OC43, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus, and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus. HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 were first identified in the mid-1960s, with HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 reported in 2004 and 2005, respectively. The 4 non-SARS/MERS species circulate widely in humans, whereas SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are thought to spread in animal reservoirs, occasionally spilling over to human populations [6] . The SARS outbreak of 2002-2003 was caused by SARS-CoV, a novel coronavirus. This worldwide outbreak brought attention to this family of viruses; the discovery of HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 followed shortly thereafter. The subsequent outbreak of MERS-CoV beginning in 2012 led to a renewed interest in HCoVs and their potential severity. Despite the growing interest and molecular characterization of these viruses, important gaps in knowledge about HCoVs remain. Limited data exist about the epidemiology of HCoVs in young infants and in persons of all ages in community settings, as well as the relative clinical importance of the 4 human HCoV species.

Here we examined disease burden and risk factors for HCoVassociated ARIs among children from birth to 6 months of age using a prospective, active home-based surveillance assessing the impact of maternal influenza vaccine on respiratory illnesses in rural Nepal [12] . METHODS We conducted a secondary analysis of data from 2 community-based, placebo-controlled, randomized trials of maternal influenza immunization, conducted in rural Sarlahi district, Nepal, from April 2011 to May 2014 [12] . Overall, 3693 pregnant women were enrolled in their second or third trimester and followed with weekly home-based visits from the time of vaccination to 6 months postpartum. Maternal and infant morbidity was assessed for the 7 days prior to each weekly household visit, and a midnasal sample was collected if an infant had any of the following criteria defining an ARI episode: fever, cough, difficult or rapid breathing, wheeze, or a draining ear [13] . Swabs were collected and placed in temperature-stable Primestore transport medium (Longhorn Diagnostics, Austin, Texas), and stored for up to a week at room temperature [12] . The tubes were then transported to the local laboratory, aliquoted into cryovials, and later shipped at room temperature to the University of Washington Molecular Diagnostics Laboratory in Seattle, where the samples were stored at -80°C. For HCoV detection, nucleic acids were extracted and tested using real-time reverse-transcription PCR (RT-PCR) with previously described methods [13, 14] . An HCoV ARI was defined as the presence of respiratory symptoms for a minimum duration of 1 day plus a midnasal swab positive for HCoV by RT-PCR. A single ARI episode was defined as an illness episode followed by 7 symptom-free days. The incidence of ARI episodes was calculated by dividing the number of cases by days at risk from birth to the end of study or loss to follow-up, and are reported per 1000 person-years (PY) of observation. Days with symptoms and the subsequent 7 symptom-free days (an ARI episode) were excluded from days at risk. A single swab from each episode was considered for the analysis. Therefore, the number of swabs was equal to the number of episodes.

Gestational age was estimated by calculating the difference between the date of birth and the last menstrual period (LMP). Date of LMP was obtained by visiting women of childbearing age every 5 weeks and asking for the date of LMP [12, 15] . Infant weights were measured as soon as possible after birth by trained study team members using a scale accurate to 10 g (Tanita BD-585). The weight was considered to be a birth weight if taken within 72 hours of birth. Low birthweight (LBW) was defined as <2500 g. Preterm birth was defined as birth before 37 completed weeks of gestation. Small for gestational age (SGA) was defined as birth weight <10th percentile for gestational age using the Intergrowth reference population [16] . A 4-category composite score was created using the preterm and SGA variables. For instance, children who were born at term and were appropriate for gestational age (AGA) were categorized as AGA term, and those who were born preterm and were SGA were categorized as SGA preterm. Breastfeeding initiation time was divided into within the first day (day 0) and beyond the first day of life. A neonate was defined as a child <28 days of age. Maternal smoking was defined as whether the mother smoked cigarettes or bidis (local hand-rolled cigarette) in the 30 days prior to enrolling in the trial. Households were defined as persons sharing a cookstove and household density was defined as the number of persons per household and number of children aged <5 years per room. A composite socioeconomic score estimating wealth of a household was created using multiple socioeconomic variables and those indicating household wealth measured by ownership of land, animals, and household items. A binary score was created for each item and summed to produce a score. Wealth quartiles were then created based on this score [17] . A composite indoor pollution score estimating pollution from indoor cookstoves was also created. Seasons were categorized as summer-monsoon (June-August), autumn (September-November), winter (December-February), and spring (March-May). Poisson regression was used to examine the association between birth-related, maternal, household, and external characteristics and HCoV respiratory illness in infants, using PY at risk of infection as the exposure. Mixed-effects modeling was used to account for correlated data of repeated episodes per child. Bivariate regression was performed first for each of the risk factors. Factors from the bivariate analysis were then included in the multivariate regression. Two different regressions were run, 1 where HCoV cases were compared to anyone without HCoV (non-HCoV ARI and those without ARI who may or may not have tested positive for HCoV if they had been tested) (model 1) and a second regression where HCoV cases were compared to all non-HCoV cases of ARI (ARI cases who tested negative for HCoV) (model 2). Logistic regression was used to examine any association between HCoV and other respiratory viruses as coinfections. All analyses were done with Stata 13.0 software (Stata Corp LP, College Station, Texas).

A total of 3693 pregnant women were enrolled in the study from April 2011 to April 2013. Altogether, 3505 of the 3646 live-born infants were followed up for 1157.9 PY. A total of 4223 ARI episodes were detected in these infants, of which HCoV was detected in 296 swabs from 282 (8%) infants. These 296 HCoVpositive swabs included 103 swabs positive for HCoV-OC43, 78 positive for HCoV-HKU1, 70 for HCoV-NL63, and 19 for HCoV-229E. Species could not be determined for 26 HCoVpositive swabs. Fourteen repeat HCoV infections were also observed. Among these, 2 infants had 3 HCoV infections each in the course of the study. Median follow-up time overall was 175 days (interquartile range, 167-179 days) for an infant, and 53% of infants were followed through 180 days. Characteristics of the infants by HCoV and ARI status are shown in Tables 1 and  2 . Overall HCoV incidence among infants was 255.6 (95% confidence interval [CI], 227.3-286.5) per 1000 PY. The incidence per 1000 PY of the HCoV species was as follows: HCoV-NL63: 59.6 (95% CI, 46.4-75.4), HCoV-OC43: 87.2 (95% CI, 71.1-106.0), HCoV-HKU1: 65.6 (95% CI, 51.7-82.2), and HCoV-229E: 16.4 (95% CI, 9.9-25.6). Seasonal variation of HCoV infections was observed, with the overall incidence peaking in 2 winters and 1 autumn. The highest incidence was observed in the autumn of 2011 at around 750 per 1000 PY (Supplementary Figure 1) . Seasonality also varied among the HCoV species. HCoV-NL63 circulated every year of the study period and peaked around the autumn months. In contrast, HCoV-OC43 circulated in 2012 and 2013, and peaked around spring and late winter, respectively. Additionally, HCoV-HKU1 showed peak activity during winter of 2012, whereas HCoV-229E mainly occurred in early and late 2012 ( Figure 1 ). Cough, fever, and wheeze were the most common clinical symptoms ( Figure 2 ). Crowding in a household (number of children <5 years of age per room) was also associated with an increased risk of HCoV infection (IRR, 1.13; 95% CI, 1.01-1.28). In addition, poorer households were seen to be at increased risk compared to wealthier households. An increased risk was observed among infants who were SGA and preterm compared to those who were AGA and at term, but this was not statistically significant. Being born in the monsoon season or infected between June and August lowered the risk of HCoV compared to other times of the year. No association was seen between HCoV incidence and LBW, maternal age, literacy, smoking status, caste, and the indoor pollution score. In a multivariate model comparing HCoV-positive cases with HCoV-negative individuals (model 1), the risk factors that were significant included infant age, the number of children <5 years of age per room, and birth outside the summer-monsoon season (Table 3 ). In the model comparing HCoV positive cases with other ARI cases that were HCoV negative, the factors that were significant were infant age and monsoon season birth. As season of birth and season of infection were highly correlated, season of birth was selected for inclusion in the multivariate models. Coinfections with at least 1 other respiratory virus in the swab was seen in 137 of 296 HCoV infections (46% 

Approximately 8% of infants experienced HCoV-associated ARIs within the first 6 months of life in a prospective home-based surveillance study in rural, southern Nepal. HCoV incidence was significantly higher among older infants than neonates, and was positively associated with the number of children aged <5 years per room and births during non-monsoon seasons. Overall HCoV incidence peaked during 2 winters and 1 autumn in the course of the study. All 4 species were present with overlap in timing of circulation. OC43 had the highest incidence, followed by HKU1, NL63, and 229E. The lower incidence among neonates could be explained by either social factors or the presence of high levels of maternal antibodies at birth against all types of HCoVs that decline within a few months [17] . In our study, the increased risk was seen from 2 months of age and did not increase over time thereafter, suggesting that if maternal antibodies played a role, they waned relatively quickly. An increase in HCoV infections with age was also seen in previous studies [18, 19] . Gagneur et al [20] found no association between HCoV infections with gestational age and birthweight among 64 neonates, of whom 7 had HCoV infections and 57 were uninfected. However, this was a hospital study examining nosocomial respiratory viral infections among neonates admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit. In our study, HCoV incidence was positively associated with household crowding of young children. This has been observed by others [21, 22] . We did not observe any statistically significant associations between HCoV incidence and the other factors analyzed (infant sex, gestational age, birth weight, maternal age, literacy, smoking, parity, ethnicity, household wealth, presence of an indoor biomass stove). Our HCoV incidence was 255.6 per 1000 PY among study children. Previous studies of HCoV incidence in children have focused on different age groups, used a narrower definition of ARI, or had different follow-up schedules to our study. For example, HCoV incidence ranged from 77.1 per 1000 PY in Costa Rica to 17.6 per 1000 PY in Singapore among children aged 6 months to <10 years enrolled in an influenza vaccine efficacy trial [23] . The lower incidence reported in the trial could be explained by the inclusion of only febrile cases, conducting follow-up only every 1-2 weeks, and a wider age range. A study in Pakistan reported an HCoV incidence of 7.3 per 1000 PY in children aged 0-24 months with severe pneumonia under a fortnightly surveillance [24] . For comparison, when we repeated our analyses using only febrile cases, HCoV incidence was 82.3 per 1000 PY. HCoVs were found in 7% of all ARI episodes in our study, compared to 5%-18% in previous studies [24] [25] [26] [27] . We believe that weekly surveillance for morbidity assessment in our study minimized recall bias, allowing for better capture of ARI episodes. HCoV infections were seen throughout the study period with >1 peak per year.

Large year-to-year periodicity in HCoVs was also observed over 3 years of surveillance. HCoV incidence peaked in 2 winters and 1 autumn, and reached a nadir in 2 summer-monsoon seasons. Similar seasonal trends were reported in Western Europe and the United States [14, 19, 28] . Among the HCoV species, HCoV-NL63 was detected in every year of the study and peaked around the autumn months, comparable to the seasonality reported in Hong Kong [29] . Frequency of HCoV-NL63 was highest in 2011 and 2013, which suggests that this species peaks every other year, similar to the pattern reported in Western Europe [30] . HCoV-OC43 circulated around spring-winter of 1 study year, similar to the seasonality seen in Western Europe/ United States [14, 19] ; however, this species also showed peak activity in the spring. HCoV-HKU1 was predominant in winter whereas HCoV-229E showed no particular seasonality. We did not see notable differences in symptoms or duration of illness by species, similar to Ogimi et al in a hospital-based population [31] . Of the 296 HCoV infections, 137 (46%) were coinfections with at least 1 other respiratory virus detected in the swab. This compares to coinfection rates ranging from 11% to 73.5% in previous studies [14, 19, 23, 32, 33] . Rhinoviruses were the most frequently codetected viruses, followed by bocavirus and RSV. A study of children aged <14 years with lower ARI in China [32] found HRV to be the most commonly detected virus in HCoV coinfections. A study of children aged 0-19 years with ARI found RSV to be the most commonly detected virus in HCoV coinfections, but HRV was not tested in that study [14] . We also found an increased rate of coinfections among nonneonates compared to neonates (91.2% vs 8.8%). We found a negative association between HCoV and HRV, RSV, and influenza viruses that were statistically significant after adjusting for other viruses and season of infection. This suggests that an infection by any 1 of these viruses could make it less likely for an individual to be infected by an HCoV. A similar relationship between HRV and HCoV has been reported previously in healthy children aged 6-24 months [34] and in individuals with ARI, nearly half of whom were infants aged <1 year [35] . The negative association between the viruses could perhaps be explained by the induction of interferons and other cytokines following infection by 1 virus, which could then prevent infection by the subsequent virus [36, 37] . Despite active surveillance, our study has several limitations. Swabs from asymptomatic infants were not collected, which could underestimate HCoV carriage but overestimate incidence. Very few studies have conducted active surveillance for asymptomatic infections in young infants, although these studies have documented 4% and 28% of nasal specimens positive for coronavirus in the absence of symptoms [27, 38] . Background rates of asymptomatic HCoV infection would also enable calculation of attributable fraction. This would provide further evidence of the association of HCoV infections and ARIs in infants; a higher attributable fraction would imply a stronger association. In addition, subjective maternal report of infant fever was used as a symptom for ARI instead of measured temperature. However, a previous validation study in this area showed good sensitivity and specificity of maternal report of fever [39] . The study was conducted in a poor, rural district with specific demographics, thus potentially limiting generalizability. However, this region is similar to many rural areas of north India, Bangladesh, and Pakistan and is representative of a large population residing within South Asia. Active home-based surveillance of infants in a rural South Asian setting showed that HCoV was associated with a substantial proportion of illnesses among infants. Knowledge of HCoV infections is limited in community settings and there is also a lack of data on infection risk factors. This study fills a gap in our knowledge of the epidemiology of coronaviruses, specifically in a rural, population-based setting in South Asia.

Unrecognized Viral Respiratory Tract Infections in Premature Infants during their Birth Hospitalization: A Prospective Surveillance Study in Two Neonatal Intensive Care Units,"Objective To determine the frequency and effects of nosocomial respiratory viral infections (RVIs) in premature neonates, including those who may be asymptomatic.","R ecent work has challenged the widely-held assumption that newborns in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) are protected from infections present in the community. Outbreaks of common respiratory viruses among hospitalized infants have been described, including influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), coronavirus, parainfluenzavirus (PIV), adenovirus, enterovirus, and rhinovirus. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] In most of these published studies, virus detection was ascertained only in symptomatic infants. In others, surveillance for respiratory virus pathogens was initiated only after an outbreak was established. Of note, respiratory viral infections (RVIs) were detected in minimally symptomatic and even asymptomatic infants when widespread screening was instituted during outbreaks. 3 Moreover, premature infants often have atypical symptoms of infection, such as feeding difficulty, periodic breathing, or apnea. [8] [9] [10] Reports of NICU outbreaks generally have focused on a single infectious agent, and studies extending to multiple viruses are hampered by the technical limitations associated with routine assays such as antigen detection and virus culture. Recent developments in multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing permit rapid, sensitive testing for multiple viruses from a single specimen, including viruses for which culture is unavailable and/or unreliable or for which rapid antigen assays do not exist. In this study, we report the results of a year-long surveillance study in 2 NICUs in Syracuse, New York, in which infants' nasopharyngeal specimens were tested for 17 different viruses in longitudinal fashion from birth to discharge.

We performed a prospective, observational study of premature infants in 2 NICUs in Syracuse, NY, during 1 calendar year (2009). Infants were eligible if they were born at less than 33 weeks, 0 days gestational age (GA), and were available for enrollment within 3 days of arrival in the NICU, which included transfer from another facility or following hospital birth. Neonates with medical and surgical diagnoses were included. GA was determined by menstrual dates and confirmed by ultrasound. Infants were excluded if they had a known or suspected immune deficiency, or were born to a human immunodeficiency virus-positive mother. After obtaining informed consent, nasopharyngeal specimens were collected using flocked swabs (Copan Diagnostics, Inc, Corona, California) from each infant by study personnel trained in the proper procedure for obtaining a nasopharyngeal specimen (including intubated infants to ensure sample consistency) within 3 days of birth and on a regular twice weekly (Monday/Thursday) schedule thereafter until discharge. Sampling was deferred on a particular day if the procedure was deemed to place the infant at risk. Specimens were placed in 1.5 mL universal transport media (Copan) and frozen at À70 C prior to testing with the xTAG respiratory viral panel (RVP; Luminex Molecular Diagnostics, Inc, Toronto, Ontario, Canada). RVP is a multiplex PCR assay that detects influenza A H1, H3, and nonspecific; influenza B; RSV A and B; PIV 1, 2, 3, and 4; coronavirus 229E, NL63, HKU-1, and OC43; rhinovirus/enterovirus; adenovirus; and human metapneumovirus (hMPV). Clinical and demographic data were collected from the medical records. At each sampling timepoint, the use of mechanical ventilation and percent of inspired oxygen was recorded, along with the results of any microbiologic testing performed for appropriate clinical purposes. Clinical events (episodes of oxygen desaturation, bradycardia, or apnea) were recorded daily according to the existing criteria being used routinely by the nursing staff in both NICUs. To qualify as an event, the aforementioned change had to persist for longer than 20 seconds. Oxygen saturation below 88% and a heart rate below 100 beats per minute were the cutoff points used for desaturation and bradycardia events, respectively. Clinical deteriorations were defined as a sustained (lasting 3 days) increase in daily oxygen desaturation events from the prior baseline rate, an increase in oxygen requirement (as judged by the current inhaled oxygen concentration required for stable oxygen saturations, excluding transient desaturations associated with feeding), or an increased level of respiratory support (moving from nasal cannula to continuous positive airways pressure, or to intubation or mechanical ventilation). A diagnosis of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) was made if an infant required supplemental oxygen at 36 weeks post-conceptional age.

The 2 NICUs in the study were a level 3 unit with a daily average census of approximately 12 infants, and a level 4 regional center with a daily average census of approximately 55 infants. Throughout the study period, each NICU operated under its usual infection control procedures: all staff employed an extended hand and arm scrub on arrival to the unit, and standard precautions were in place at all times. All direct patient contact by medical staff required gloves. Contact precautions also were in place (gown and glove) for patients known to be colonized or infected with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). MRSA screening by PCR was performed on all patients at the regional center on a weekly basis. All children (age 17 years and younger) were excluded from the units and adult visitors were excluded if ill. Parents who had respiratory symptoms were discouraged from visiting but allowed to visit if they wore gowns, gloves, and a surgical mask. In the regional center NICU, twin and triplet births were separated into different nursing areas. No healthcare personnel were aware of the results of the respiratory virus detection tests during the study.

Statistical comparisons between groups were performed using Fisher exact test or Student t test as appropriate. Time to infection was calculated as the interval between birth date and infection date for the first infection and the interval between previous and current infection dates for repeated infections. The marginal effects of several variables, including NICU units, sex, GA, and birth weight on time to infection were presented by Kaplan-Meier infection-free probability curves and tested by Log-rank test. A Cox proportional hazards regression model was further fitted to examine the effect of each covariate, adjusting the effect of other covariates. A random-effect term was included to adjust the dependence among the multiple observations from the same infant. The proportional hazards assumption and possible outliers were visually examined through Schoenfeld and deviance residual plots. A path model, focusing on the direct and indirect effects of infection on the hospital stay, was proposed and confirmed by using SAS v. 9.2 PROC CALIS (SAS Institute, Cary, North Carolina) under which the algorithm was optimized via a Quasi-Newton method. Statistical significance was defined at a level of P = .05.

The research was approved by the Institutional Review Boards of St. Joseph's Hospital Health Center and Crouse Irving Memorial Hospital, both of Syracuse, NY (Institutional Review Board for the Protection of Human Subjects #2008.147 and #2008.4657, respectively).

Approximately one-half of the parents approached for the study consented to enrollment. The most common reason given for refusal was a concern for an additional procedure on a very small baby, which may have skewed our population towards enrolling neonates of later GA. Fifty infants were enrolled into the study; 27 (54%) were male. The average GA was 28 weeks (range 24 to 32). Eighteen infants (36%) had GA <28 weeks. The average duration of birth hospitalization was 54.6 days. Twenty-five infants (50%) were intubated at some time during hospitalization, for a mean of 12.5 days. Twenty-eight infants (56%) required supplemental oxygen at some time during hospitalization, and 17 (34%) met criteria for diagnosis of BPD. Eleven infants were enrolled from the level 3 NICU, and 39 were from the level 4 regional NICU. One infant died.

A total of 708 specimens were obtained and tested from the 50 patients over the 52-week period, for an average of 13.6 specimens per week. No weeks were missed but the level of Vol. 161, No. 5 November 2012 enrollment varied throughout the year-at any 1 time, the number of active patients from the level 3 NICU varied between 0 and 4, and at the level 4 NICU between 2 and 8. Sixty-six of 708 specimens tested positive for at least 1 respiratory virus; 26 neonates (52%) were positive for a respiratory virus on at least 1 occasion. The mean time to detection of the first positive sample was 24 days (range 0-92). For each infected patient, an average of 2.5 swabs were positive during their hospital stay (range 1-13). Viruses detected in the 26 positive patients were PIV3 (13 patients), hMPV (9 patients), RSV-B (8 patients), RSV-A (7 patients), PIV-2 (7 patients), entero/rhinovirus (7 patients), and influenza B (4 patients).

Eighteen samples (28% of the positive swabs) included more than 1 virus, and some infants were positive for different viruses at different times. There was evidence of seasonality of detection of particular viruses, with clusters observed (Figure 1) . Fourteen patients had sequentially positive specimens for the same virus, with specimens positive over a range of 3-13 days; however, because we obtained specimens only twice weekly, an accurate determination of duration cannot be made. Sequential detection of hMPV, RSV B, PIV 3, and enterovirus/rotavirus occurred.

Kaplan-Meier curves were created reflecting location, sex, GA, and birth weight in order to identify potential predictors of infection. The rate for RVIs was similar between the 2 NI-CUs (5 of 11 from NICU 1, and 21 of 39 from NICU 2, P = .74). The Kaplan-Meier curves comparing each location for sex, birth weights, or GA were not significantly different statistically ( Figure 2 ; available at www.jpeds.com), and the data from each NICU, therefore, were aggregated for comparison of infected and uninfected infants.

Clinical comparisons between infected and uninfected infants are shown in Table I . Infected infants compared with uninfected infants had a longer average length of stay (70 days vs 35 days, P = .002), need for intubation (17 of 26 infected infants vs 7 of 24 uninfected infants, P = .01), average duration of intubation (19 days vs 5 days, P = .03), and duration of supplemental oxygen requirement (51 days vs 13 days, P = .002). Nineteen of the 26 infected infants required supplemental oxygen at some point during their hospitalization, compared with 9 of the 24 uninfected infants (P = .006). Seventeen infants required oxygen at an adjusted GA of 36 weeks (the criteria for diagnosis of BPD); 12 of the 17 were among the virus-infected infants and the remaining 5 were uninfected. The probability of acquiring infection was significantly higher for infants diagnosed with BPD (P < .05; Figure 3 ; available at www. jpeds.com).

Supplemental oxygen requirements also were higher in the infected cohort. We identified only a single timepoint when 1 uninfected infant required an inhaled concentration of oxygen above 50%, an event that occurred at 36 separate timepoints in the infected group.

A Cox proportional hazards model showed modestly significant effects of GA after adjusting for the effect of NICU units and sex (Table II ; available at www.jpeds.com). At each NICU, an infant with lower GA was more likely to be infected. The effect of birth weight in the Cox model was reversed compared with the marginal effect seen in Kaplan-Meier analysis, but 1 child with massive hydrocephalus had a very high birth weight for GA, which skewed the model. When this outlier was removed, the data points tended to cluster with no clear trend (data not shown).

We proposed a path model to determine whether virus infection directly extended length of hospital stay or whether this effect was mediated by the need for intubation and oxygen use. The model was confirmed in SAS using covariance analysis of linear structural equations. The effect of RVI on length of stay appeared to be mediated partially through effects on the respiratory system, as there were significant standardized indirect effects of infection on length of stay (P = .001). When THE JOURNAL OF PEDIATRICS www.jpeds.com Vol. 161, No. 5 2 outliers were excluded (1 infant who died on day of life 1, another who was discharged to an outlying hospital and lost to follow-up), infection was significantly correlated to length of stay through both direct (P < .003) and indirect (P < .0005) effects ( Figure 4 ; available at www.jpeds.com). Table I shows clinical events in infected and uninfected infants. On average, infected infants had nearly double the number of desaturation events compared with the uninfected cohort (7.1 episodes/d vs 3.9 episodes/d, P < .0001). Episodes of bradycardia were the same between the 2 groups, and there were significantly fewer apnea events among infected infants. This latter finding may have been due to the confounding factor that infected infants were more likely being mechanically ventilated, which precluded apnea.

Most infants were evaluated for bacterial infection at the time of birth, and again later at the discretion of the clinical team. A total of 118 blood cultures were obtained from the 50 study patients. Significantly more cultures were obtained from the virus-infected infants than from virus-uninfected infants (70 vs 38, P = .008). Eleven cultures were positive for bacteria from 6 of the virus-infected infants compared with 6 positive bacterial cultures from 4 of the virusuninfected infants (23.1% of virus-infected infants had a positive culture, compared with 16.7% of virus-uninfected infants (P = .73 by Fisher exact test). Of the 11 positive bacterial cultures in infants infected with a viral pathogen, some were repeatedly positive for the same organism. In addition, 1 virus-infected infant had 2 separate blood cultures positive for coagulase-negative Staphylococcus and Klebsiella, and another had 3 separate cultures positive for Klebsiella sp, MRSA, and Candida sp. The 6 positive blood cultures from infants who never had a virus detected occurred in 4 infants, with 2 sets being repeatedly positive for Staphylococcus epidermidis. All clinical deteriorations and clinical events noted in study patients were reviewed, and changes in respiratory support were associated with coincident oxygen desaturation events. Compared with virus-infected infants, uninfected infants displayed few clinical deteriorations beyond the first few days of life; 38 clinical deteriorations occurred in 26 infected infants vs 8 clinical deteriorations in 24 uninfected infants. During 27 (71%) clinical deteriorations, RVI was detected simultaneously. All 14 episodes of sequential detections of RVIs were associated with clinical deteriorations. Additionally, 7 of the 11 positive blood cultures in the virus-infected group were associated with deteriorations. Specific details for each neonate with RVI detections are shown in Table III (available at www.jpeds.com).

We documented unsuspected and clinically unrecognized RVIs among premature neonates during their birth hospitalizations. The detection of viral nucleic acid from the respiratory tract of asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic infants (none of the infants were evaluated for RVI by the NICU clinicians) raises the question of whether these events represent true infection. In the absence of data documenting seroconversion, our observation documenting 14 instances of prolonged serial detection suggest ongoing virus replication rather than transient carriage. Moreover, of the viruses included in the detection panel, only adenovirus is known to persist in the nasopharynx, although respiratory viruses have been detected in asymptomatic older children. Detection of viral nucleic acids in nasopharyngeal secretions in our study correlated significantly and directly with several specific negative outcomes, raising the possibility of a causal relationship. Additionally, our findings suggest the need for enhanced virus surveillance and optimized infection control.

Although outbreaks of RVIs in NICUs have been described, this study confirms the importance of systematic surveillance in detecting infections that otherwise would be unrecognized. Premature neonates with RVIs can display atypical symptoms or can have no overt, recognizable symptoms. However, the detection of RVIs within a NICU can have profound clinical implications. Infants with detectable RVIs, even those without overt symptoms, required more supplemental oxygen, had a high likelihood of mechanical ventilation, required longer durations of oxygenation, and were hospitalized longer. Persistent detection of virus was associated with clinical deteriorations. In addition, there was a higher rate of BPD in the virus-infected population, an observation worthy of further study. The expression and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the lung have been implicated in the etiology of BPD, 11 in association with chorioamnionitis, 12 and prolonged mechanical ventilation. 13, 14 Nosocomial RVIs may exacerbate inflammation attributable to positive pressure ventilation, prematurity, and/or supplemental oxygen therapy, and may contribute to the development of chronic lung disease of prematurity. The effect of RVI on length of stay appeared to be mediated through effects on the respiratory system. Path analysis and linear regression analysis of our data showed significant direct and indirect effects of infection on length of stay.

Prolonged hospitalization is a risk-factor for nosocomial infection, supported by the finding in our study that the average length of time until first detecting an RVI was 24 days. Pre-existing lung disease may predispose infants to infection, as endotracheal intubation and feeding tubes (both markers of clinically compromised infants) have been previously identified as risk factors for acquisition of RVI. 15 Additionally, multiple interventions by nursery and respiratory therapy personnel may increase opportunities for acquisition. A limitation of our study is that it only covered 1 calendar year and a relatively small number of neonates. The potential for cross-contamination of specimens was limited by collection of samples in separate sealed containers using universal precautions. Laboratory contamination was limited by using dedicated, trained personnel and strict sample identification identical to that employed for our hospital's clinical laboratory. Sample containers remained sealed from collection until laboratory RNA extraction. To ensure a consistent sample set throughout the year, the collection schedule was adhered to as much as reasonably practical with exceptions made only for times when an infant could not be tested safely, and repeated attempts were made as soon as possible. There were no weeks when specimen collection did not occur. A limitation of our study is the difficulty in proving that detection of an RVI is due to ongoing viral replication. Seroconversion data might support this supposition, but this testing was not performed. In addition, the association between detection of an RVI and prolonged hospitalization, increased requirements for oxygenation and respiratory support, and a higher rate of BPD does not prove causation.

We documented transmission of respiratory pathogens to premature neonates during their birth hospitalization despite presumed vigilance related to infection control practices in these high-risk settings. These practices included the use of barriers (gowns and gloves), hand washing before and after each patient contact, the use of masks for anyone with respiratory symptoms, and the exclusion of all children. During this study, we did not explore the sources of infection; however, most of the infants had contact only with their parents and the healthcare personnel. We noted that several twin infants had identical viruses detected at the same time, despite being in separate nursing areas. Our findings highlight the limitations of current infection control practices and raise questions as to whether the presence or sequelae of these infections justify more intensive monitoring of infections and assessment of strategies of prevention and control. n

Epidemiology of viral respiratory infections in children undergoing heart surgery,"Background: Acute viral respiratory infections (VRI) are the most common diseases in humans and are associated with high morbidity and mortality in infants and the elderly. Children with congenital heart disease (CHD) are more susceptible to get severe forms of VRI due to their altered lung mechanics, leading to several complications, such as increased hospital stay, longer mechanical ventilation, and higher mortality. This study aimed to identify the frequency of VRI in children with CHD undergoing cardiac surgery, and to compare the major outcomes according to the presence or absence of a VRI. Methods: This was a longitudinal, observational cohort study. Nasopharyngeal secretion samples were collected pre-and postoperatively for patients undergoing cardiac surgery, from May 2013 to May 2014. Respiratory viruses were detected using CLART Pneumovir®. Results: Forty-eight patients were enrolled. We found a VRI preoperatively in 16 children with CHD before surgery (33.3%), and the frequency of new infections was 8.3% (4 patients). However, in this study, in univariate analyses, the two groups did not differ in any of the studied outcomes. In the multivariate regression models, adjusting for age and STAT category, the presence of a VRI did not show a significant effect on the major outcomes. Conclusions: In conclusion, VRI was frequent in children undergoing open-heart surgery, but the presence of a VRI did not impact on major outcomes in this cohort.","Viral respiratory infections (VRI) are one of the leading causes of hospitalization during the first year of life [1] . The most prevalent viruses are respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), rhinovirus, bocavirus and others [2, 3] . Some strategies are used in selected children, including those with congenital heart disease (CHD), to prevent VRI-related hospitalizations, like palivizumab [4, 5] .

Children with CHD have altered lung mechanics, decreased lung compliance and increased pulmonary vascular resistance. Therefore, they are more susceptible to complications of VRI, especially when they undergo open-heart surgery [5, 6] .

Clinical detection of a VRI in children after open-heart surgery is a challenging task, and potentially lead to unnecessary use of antibiotics. Depending on the magnitude of the problem, more aggressive intervention towards VRI prevention may be needed.

The frequency of VRI and the most prevalent agents in children with CHD undergoing heart surgery at our hospital are not known. Our hypothesis is that VRI are highly prevalent in our patients and that they are associated with poorer outcomes. We aimed to determine the frequency of VRI in children submitted to heart surgery for CHD, and to estimate their impact on major outcomes: duration of mechanical ventilation, length of hospital and ICU stay, and mortality.

This was a longitudinal, observational, cohort study. All patients scheduled for heart surgery for CHD at our institution, a tertiary-care university hospital, between May 2013 and May 2014, were eligible. Patients were routinely assessed for respiratory symptoms the day before surgery. Since only patients without respiratory symptoms are operated, only these were included. The study was approved by the https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ppedcard.2018.09.003 Received 18 July 2018; Received in revised form 19 September 2018; Accepted 20 September 2018 local institutional review board (#270.409) and signed informed consent was required for enrollment.

The study consisted of collection of respiratory secretion samples, extraction of nucleic acids, PCR amplification, and microarray detection and reading. Collection of respiratory secretion samples was performed as follows: the day before surgery, three days after surgery, and seven days after surgery. All patients were tested at the three moments. Virus detection tests were done only after the study was finished; therefore, results were not timely available to affect medical decisions. We used an automated method (CLART Pneumovir®, Genomica, Madrid, Spain). This method can qualitatively detect up to 18 different respiratory viruses: RSV A and B, parainfluenza 1, 2, 3, 4A and 4B, coronavirus 229E, metapneumovirus A and B, adenovirus, enterovirus B, rhinovirus, influenza A (including H1N1), B, and C, and bocavirus, with specificity of > 99% for all viruses. Demographic and surgical data, and outcomes were collected from medical charts. Surgical complexity was categorized using STAT (STS-EACTS Congenital Heart Surgery Mortality Category) [7] .

Patients with a first-sample (preoperative) positive result were considered home-infected if they were admitted for < 48 h, and hospital-infected if they were admitted for 48 h or more prior to sample collection. A hospital-acquired VRI was defined by a positive result any time after an initial (within 48 h from admission) negative result for viruses.

Pulmonary complications such as congestion and atelectasis were diagnosed by agreement between respiratory therapists and at least three medical staff looking at chest radiographs in light of clinical data.

We used IBM SPSS 20.0 (Chicago, IL). Results were expressed as mean (standard deviation), median (range), or counts (proportions), according to data type and distribution. The frequency of VRI was calculated by dividing the number of cases of VRI by the number of patients. For comparison between groups (with and without VRI), we used Fisher's exact test, Student's t-test, or Mann-Whitney's U test, as appropriate. Multivariate logistic or linear regression models were used, for binary or continuous outcomes, respectively, to identify the influence of a VRI on the major outcomes. Independent variables were: presence of VRI, age, and STAT category. Effect sizes were estimated by parameter estimates and significance of these associations were assessed by 95% confidence intervals. A significance level of 0.05 was adopted.

Sixty-one patients were operated in the time frame, but only 48 patients were included in the study. Among the non-included patients, four underwent emergency surgery, and nine did not consent. Twentythree patients (47.9%) were male, and 14 (29.1%) died. Tables 1, 2 and 3 present demographic and surgical data, and outcomes, respectively, according to the presence of VRI.

Although patients with VRI were more likely to have lower STAT categories, neither STAT nor age at surgery were significantly different between patients with and without VRI.

All patients were admitted in the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) after surgery, mechanically ventilated. Forty patients (83%) were extubated at least once, and 15 of them (37.5%) have had at least one extubation failure. Tracheostomy was needed in 3 patients.

Regarding postoperative pulmonary complications, we found pulmonary congestion in 42 patients (87.5%), pleural effusions in 21 patients (43.7%), and atelectasis in 20 patients (41.6%). Twenty-four patients (50%) have had two or more of these pulmonary complications. VRI was present preoperatively in 16 patients (33.3% of total), while 4 patients acquired a VRI during hospital stay (8.3% of total) in this cohort, with a total frequency of 41.6%. The number and type of viruses we found are shown in Fig. 1 . Among children with a VRI, association of two viruses were found in four patients: two had enterovirus B plus influenza A H1N1, one had adenovirus plus rhinovirus and one had enterovirus B plus rhinovirus. VRI were more frequent during winter (55%) than in fall (20%) and in spring and summer (10%). Immunoprophylaxis against RSV was given to seven patients before surgery. Of these, four have had a VRI, but not caused by RSV.

In univariate analyses, the two groups did not differ in any of the studied outcomes: duration of mechanical ventilation (p = 0.09), arteriovenous oxygen difference (p = 0.71), vasoactive-inotropic score (p = 0.85), extubation failure (p = 0.47), PICU and hospital length-ofstay (p = 0.10 and 0.16, respectively). Surprisingly, mortality was lower in patients with VRI (20 vs. 35%, p = 0.33), although not statistically significant due to the small number of patients.

To better understand these apparently similar outcomes in patients with and without VRI, multivariate regression models were used to adjust for age and STAT categories (1-3 versus 4-5). In multivariate logistic regression models, the odds-ratio (OR) for death was strongly influenced by age at surgery, but not by STAT ≥4 or the presence of a VRI. The OR for extubation failure was not influenced by any of the predictors. In multivariate general linear models, arterial-venous oxygen difference [D (A-V) O 2 ] and the vasoactive-inotropic score (VIS) were not influenced by any of the predictors. Length of mechanical ventilation was only influenced by STAT ≥4, and not by age at surgery or the presence of a VRI. Length of ventilatory support (invasive and non-invasive) and hospital stay were influenced by age at surgery and STAT ≥4, but not by the presence of a VRI. Finally, PICU length-of-stay was influenced only by age at surgery, but not by STAT ≥4 or the presence of a VRI. Overall, the presence of a VRI did not affect the major outcomes. These results are depicted in Tables 4 and 5 .

In this cohort, 27 patients (56%) were given antibiotics because of suspected postoperative bacterial infection. Of these, five patients were positive for VRI but had negative cultures for bacteria.

We found a high frequency of children with a VRI undergoing openheart surgery in our hospital (41.6%), with a frequency of hospitalacquired VRI of 8.3%. The most prevalent respiratory viruses found in our study were: rhinovirus, bocavirus, enterovirus B, influenza A (H1N1), influenza C, adenovirus, RSV A, and coronavirus. In our study, since these results were available only long after the surgery, none was cancelled or postponed because of it. Bicer et al. studied incidence and etiology of viral infections among hospitalized children with VRI symptoms. They found a prevalence of 66.5%, and the most prevalent viruses were RSV, adenovirus, parainfluenza, and rhinovirus [8] . In our study, the frequency was lower, probably because we studied asymptomatic children, and the types of viruses were also different.

In our study, we used a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based, commercially-available, automated method that can detect 18 different viruses at once. Kanashito et al. compared three different methods of detecting VRI in humans: direct immunofluorescence, single-, and multiplex-PCR. In 39 nasopharyngeal samples from children with congenital heart disease, they found a VRI prevalence of 64.1%. Multiplex PCR performed better than the other methods [9] . Krause et al. highlighted the usefulness of multiplex PCR tests to distinguish VRI from bacterial infections in children [10] . VRI can lead to unnecessary use of antibiotics. In our study, this may have occurred in five patients.

In our study, the presence of VRI was not associated with major outcomes after open-heart surgery in children. These findings did not confirm those reported by other investigators. Delgado-Corcoran et al. investigated the prevalence of rhinovirus in children submitted to heart surgery, and showed that patients with VRI had longer duration of Table 2 Anatomic diagnosis of patients.

Bold means a significant effect at p < 0.05. mechanical ventilation, more extubation failures, frequent use of bronchodilators, and longer hospital stay [11] . In another study, children submitted to open-heart surgery that had VRI experienced longer hospital and PICU length-of-stay, compared with matched controls [12] . Altman et al. studied the impact of RSV infection in children with CHD, and they found that these patients had more significant morbidity and higher mortality, with higher healthcare-associated costs [6] . We speculate that our results were negative because of: (a) limited power, given the small sample size, and (b) detection of viruses in asymptomatic children, since the ones with symptoms of VRI were rescheduled. In the study by Delgado-Corcoran et al. [11] , children were considered infected when they had symptoms of VRI, while in the study by Spaeder et al. [12] , infection was defined as the presence of viruses in nasopharyngeal or endotracheal specimens. Although there is evidence that a symptomatic VRI will negatively impact outcomes [12] , it is not clear whether asymptomatic presence of a virus in the respiratory system will affect the outcomes. Therefore, the usefulness and the cost-effectiveness of screening all children scheduled for congenital heart surgery regarding the presence of respiratory viruses need clarification. In Brazil, RSV is the most common cause of VRI requiring hospitalization in children [13] . In a systematic review of 20 published studies, Homaira et al. showed that patients who most benefit from passive immunization against RSV were preterm infants (< 33 weeks), children with chronic lung disease and children with congenital heart disease [14] . However, the most frequent virus in our patients was rhinovirus, and RSV was detected in a single patient. This finding cannot be attributed to the use of passive immunization against RSV, since only a few of our patients were given it.

Some authors recommend screening for rhinovirus among patients scheduled for congenital heart surgery, especially infants and toddlers with respiratory symptoms, and that surgery should be postponed if positive; they, however, acknowledge that cost-effectiveness is unknown [11] . Simsic et al. adopted preoperative testing for respiratory virus by PCR before cardiac surgery for all patients with single-ventricle and, if the test is positive, surgery is rescheduled for 6 weeks, pending a negative follow-up viral PCR [15] . There are some rapid tests for VRI in the market, like the Abbott TESTPACK RSV (Abbott Diagnostics, Santa Clara, CA), the QuickVue RSV Test (Quidel Corp., San Diego, CA) or the RAMP® RSV TEST (Response Biomedical Corp., Vancouver, Canada), which are rapid enzyme immunoassay for the direct detection of RSV antigen in nasopharyngeal swab specimens [16] . The clinical value of these rapid tests in children with CHD is unknown. In children admitted to an emergency department, bedside testing for RSV, if immediately available, could have changed medical management in 64% of cases, reduced the number of tests ordered, antibiotics prescribed, and saved an average of USD 669 per patient [17] . Another issue that may be considered is the lack of preventive strategies for most of the viruses that cause VRI in these patients, besides RSV. New vaccines for these viruses could bring benefit to many patients in similar situations.

In our hospital, screening for VRI is not routine. Patients scheduled for congenital heart surgery undergo only clinical evaluation, and surgery is postponed for a few weeks if the patient has symptoms of a VRI. Our findings are important because they bring awareness to the high frequency of asymptomatic VRI in patients with CHD scheduled for open heart surgery, although, here, not associated with poorer outcomes. Although the screening test is non-invasive and technically simple, on the other hand, it is expensive. Besides, identification of a respiratory virus does not necessarily mean an active infection, since respiratory viruses can be detected weeks after a VRI. Nevertheless, despite the limitations of this study, our results suggest that screening asymptomatic children for VRI before open-heart surgery is not costeffective, since there was no difference in outcomes.

Limitations of this study include: (a) heterogeneity of patients regarding anatomic diagnoses, (b) the wide range of ages at surgery, and (c) higher mortality than that of centers from developed countries. Therefore, our results may not apply for resource-rich centers in developed countries, they do, at least in part, for limited-resource centers from developing countries.

In conclusion, VRI was frequent in children undergoing open-heart surgery, but the presence of a VRI did not impact on major outcomes in this cohort.

Viral Etiologies of Hospitalized Acute Lower Respiratory Infection Patients in China,"Background: Acute lower respiratory infections (ALRIs) are an important cause of acute illnesses and mortality worldwide and in China. However, a large-scale study on the prevalence of viral infections across multiple provinces and seasons has not been previously reported from China. Here, we aimed to identify the viral etiologies associated with ALRIs from 22 Chinese provinces.","Acute lower respiratory infections (ALRIs) continue to be an important cause of acute illnesses and mortality worldwide (especially in infants and young children) [1] [2] [3] [4] . The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2010 (GBD 2010) estimates that there were 2.8 million deaths due to lower respiratory infections globally in 2010 (5.3% of the total deaths) [4] . The incidence of ALRIs in children aged less than 5 years is estimated to be 0.22 episodes per child-year, with 11.5% cases progressing to severe episodes in low-and mid-income countries in 2010, and most cases occur in India, China, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Indonesia and Nigeria [5, 6] . The main etiological agents responsible for ALRIs include bacteria (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae type b, Staphylococcus aureus, etc.), viruses, and fungi. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human influenza viruses, human parainfluenza viruses type 1, 2, and 3 (PIV-1, PIV-2 and PIV-3), human rhinoviruses (HRV), adenoviruses (ADV), human metapneumovirus (hMPV), human coronavirus (hCoV), and human bocavirus (hBoV) have been identified among patients with ALRI [7] [8] [9] [10] . In China, ALRIs were the most frequent cause of child mortality in 2008, despite an astonishing 66% reduction in pneumonia-specific mortality rates between 2002-2007 (from about 9?4 to 3?2 per 1000 live births) [11] . Moreover, most pneumonia deaths occur in poor rural communities.

The majority of the studies contributing data on the epidemiology of the etiologic agents of ALRIs are from industrialized countries. Although several studies have reported the prevalence of viral infections in outpatients and inpatients in local areas of China [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] , a large-scale study across multiple provinces and seasons has not been previously reported. We aimed to identify the viral etiologies associated with ALRIs from patients across 22 provinces of China between 2009-2013.

The China's Ministry of Health decided that since data from patients with ALRI was part of continuing public health surveillance and implemented national surveillance guidelines; parents/guardians of participants in this study were only required to provide brief verbal consent during their enrollment, which was recorded in each questionnaire by their physicians. This project and the above procedure for obtaining consent were approved by the ethical review committee of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC, Beijing, China).

In 2009, we initiated active surveillance for hospitalized ALRI patients in 108 sentinel hospitals in 24 provinces of China. The sentinel sites were chosen after carefully considering capacities of surveillance and laboratory testing, and geographical representativeness. A national surveillance protocol including guidelines for patient enrollment, specimen collection and laboratory testing, case reporting form and protocols for data transmission and related standard operating procedures (SOP) in Chinese language were developed by Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC, Beijing) and the regional reference laboratories. This protocol was then used by all the participating hospitals and laboratories [18] .

Patients admitted to the wards or intensive care unit (ICU) of departments of internal medicine, pediatrics or infectious diseases in each of these sentinel hospital were screened by nurses and physicians for ALRI. A patient was considered to be having ALRI if they had: (1) at least one of listed manifestation of acute infection: measured fever ($38uC), abnormal white blood cell (WBC) differential, leukocytosis (a WBC count more than 10,000/mL) or leukopenia (a WBC count less than 4,000/mL), and chill; (2) at least one of listed signs/symptoms of respiratory tract infection: cough, sputum, shortness of breath, lung auscultation abnormality (rale or wheeze), tachypnea, and chest pain. Among ALRI patients, those with a chest radiograph demonstrating punctate, patchy or uniform density opacity were defined as having radiographic evidence of pneumonia [17] .

Each week or month, the first 2-5 ALRI patients were enrolled for specimen collection in each sentinel hospital, based on their pre-defined target sample size. Cases were screened weekly in 49 hospitals and monthly in the other 59 hospitals. After hospital admission, physicians obtained verbal consent from eligible ALRI cases-or their parent/guardians, following which appropriate respiratory specimens (nasopharyngeal swab or aspirate, sputum, bronchoalveolar lavage or lung puncture aspirate), blood or serum were collected. Respiratory specimens were placed immediately in viral transport media (VTM) and stored at 4-8uC at the local hospital. Collected blood samples were placed at 220uC in vacuum blood tube on ice. Specimens were transferred to the 46 qualified laboratories (including 14 central, regional reference laboratories, and 32 local laboratories at prefecture or provincial level) for diagnostic testing. Most of the tests were completed within 24 hours after collection. At the laboratories, specimens in VTM were stored at 270uC if testing was not performed within 24 hours after collection.

Each specimen was tested for the seven identified viral etiologies, i.e. RSV, human influenza virus, ADV, human parainfluenza virus (PIV), hMPV, hCoV and hBoV. The viral nucleic acid was directly extracted from respiratory specimens by using commercial kits (e.g. QIAmpMiniElute Virus Spin kit, QIAamp Viral RNA Mini kit or RNeasy Mini kit, by Qiagen, Valencia, CA) recommended by China CDC. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or real-time PCR were performed to detect ADV and hBoV, and reverse transcriptase-PCR (RT-PCR) or real-time RT-PCR were performed to detect the other five viral agents as described previously [13, 17] . Ig M or Ig A of the targeted viruses were detected in a single blood or serum specimen, and Ig G were detected in paired acute and convalescent sera, by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using recommended commercial indirect immunofluorescence kits (xTAG Respiratory Viral Panel) according to the manufacturer's protocol ( Figure 1 ). These assays were performed in biosafety level 2 facility laboratories. All the laboratories used the same protocol (see primers and sequence information in Table S1 and Table S2 in File S1) [18] , which undergoes quality control assessment by the China CDC. If any one of the targeted viruses was detected in the specimens, the patient was considered to be positive for that viral etiology. If two or more specimens from one patient were tested and one of them tested positive, we considered the patient to be positive for the virus ( Figure 1 ). The cases where only a single pathogen identified was labelled as mono-infection, and the cases where two or more viruses were detected was regarded as co-detection.

Detailed demographic and clinical data of cases and laboratory results of specimens were collected by staff of sentinel hospitals and laboratories through a standardized case reporting form, and entered on a weekly basis into an online data management system established by China CDC.

We used descriptive statistics to summarize the spectrum of viral etiologies by age group in hospitalized ALRIs patients, and to analyze their temporal trends using monthly data during the study period. Statistical analysis was performed with SPSS (v18.0, SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA). Two tailed Mann-Whitney tests were used for the comparison of median age between patients positive and patients negative for viruses. Fisher's Least Significant Difference (L-S-D) tests were used for multiple comparisons of median age between patients positive for different viruses, and Chi-square tests were used to analyze the frequency data. P,0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.

During January 2009-September 2013, 29,248 hospitalized ALRIs patients contributing 31,348 specimens were enrolled from the 108 sentinel hospitals. Due to sparse patients (,40) in 27 sentinel hospitals, we just included 28,369 patients from 81 sentinel hospitals in 22 provinces who were tested for the aforementioned seven viral etiologies for final analysis ( Figure 1 and Figure 2 ). Among the 28,369 ALRI patients, 60% were children aged ,5 years and 12% were elderly aged $65 years, with a median age of 3 years [interquartile range (IQR), 0.7-24 years]. A temperature $38uC was documented in 43% of ALRI cases at the time of physical examination. Cough was the most common symptom (79%). Of 14,720 ALRI patients (52% of total) that had a chest X-ray performed, 10,115 (69%) were reported to have radiographic evidence of pneumonia ( Table 1) .

Of 28,369 hospitalized ALRI patients tested for the seven viral etiologies, 10,387 (36.6%) were positive for at least one etiology. The median age of these patients was considerably lower than patients who were negative for any of the viruses (1 years vs 4 years) (P = 0.000, Mann-Whitney Test). Of the patients in who viruses were identified, those with confirmed influenza and hCoV had a higher median age (4 and 3 years) than patients positive for other viruses (0.7-2 years) (P = 0.000, L-S-D Test). Compared with patients testing positive for other viral etiologies, patients with laboratory confirmed influenza and hCoV more frequently complained of chest pain and fatigue. A similar pattern was observed in adults aged 50-64 years and the elderly ( Table 1) .

Of the 10,387 hospitalized ALRI patients confirmed with at least one viral etiology, the most frequent detected virus was RSV (in 2,795 patients, 9.9%), followed by influenza in 1,869 patients (6.6%), PIV in 1,366 patients (4.8%), ADV in 957 patients (3.4%), hBoV in 551 patients (1.9%), hMPV in 424 patients (1.5%) and hCoV in 393 patients (1.4%) ( Table 1) . Co-detections were found in 7.2% of patients. All the seven viral agents were detected in each age group ( Figure 3 ). However, RSV was the most common etiology in very young children aged ,2 years (17.0% of ALRI patients, Figure 4 , Panel A). Influenza viruses were the mainly associated with ALRIs in adults (10.5% in 15-49 years) and elderly (7.4% in 50-64 years and 6.5% in $65 years) throughout the study period. During the A(H1N1)pdm09 pandemic, about 30% of the adult (15-49 years) ALRI admissions were associated with influenza. (Figure 4 The proportion of respiratory viruses in ALRI patients has demonstrated substantial annual variation (P = 0.000, Chi-square test). This is more marked in case of influenza viruses, which had a much higher proportion in 2009 than that in the rest of the years ( 

Among the 2032 ALRI patients with co-detection, two viruses were identified in 1709 cases (84.1% of cases with co-detection), three viruses were detected in 277 cases (13.6%), and four or more viruses were detected in 46 cases (Table 2) . RSV was the most frequent etiology in cases with co-detection. RSV and another respiratory virus were detected in 1296 (53.8%) cases 354 cases 

Over the 57-month period, there were clear seasonal peaks for RSV, influenza, PIV, hBoV and hMPV infections. RSV activity was observed throughout the year during the 5 year period with an annual a peak in January-February each year ( Figure 5 There were no clear temporal trends for patients infected with ADV and hCoV ( Figure 5 , Panels D and G), even when analysis was stratified by age group (Figure S1 and Figure S2 ).

This study is the first to describe the viral etiologies in hospitalized ALRI patients using data from sentinel surveillance sites covering the majority of Chinese provinces over 5 consecutive years; and based on a standardized surveillance protocol and laboratory assays. A total of 28,369 hospitalized ALRI patients were enrolled from 2009-2013, and 36.6% were positive for at least one virus, which is consistent with published data reported from China and other countries [13, 18, 19] .

Our findings that RSV was the leading pathogen identified in young children under two years hospitalized for lower respiratory tract infections demonstrates that RSV could also be associated with substantial morbidity and mortality in China, as reported in studies from other industrialized and developing countries [20] [21] [22] . This finding indicates that prevention strategies for RSV such immunization when a suitable vaccine is available in the future could have large public health impact in China. We also demonstrated that influenza viruses could lead to substantial burden on health care system especially in a large country like China with a rapidly aging population especially since influenza positivity rate was higher in adults and elderly. This is consistent with the reported estimates of influenza disease burden based on studies conducted in China and across the world [23] [24] [25] [26] . However, influenza vaccination (which confers individual and herd immunity) has an extremely low coverage rate in China [27] . Widespread use of influenza vaccine should have a considerable impact on the influenza disease burden in China. PIV was the second most common pathogen identified in children aged less than 2 years. We also observed that ADV was an important virus associated with ALRI in children. These evidences will be important for China's public health authorities to guide the priority for control of infectious diseases. From a public health perspective, information on seasonality of pathogens is crucial to inform the timing of interventions, particularly for a climatically and economically diverse country as China [28] . China has an intensive national influenza surveillance network and influenza seasonality in different epidemiological regions was identified to be used as a basis to optimize the timing of future vaccination programs [29] . Our study demonstrates that although respiratory viruses circulate throughout the year, viruses like RSV, PIV, hBoV and hMPV have a clear seasonal trend. RSV activity peaked in January-February each year, and this is consistent with published reports from other studies in temperate regions where RSV occurred most frequently in the winter months [6] .

Our study had a few limitations. Firstly, only viral pathogens were detected in our study; bacterial pathogens were not included, which prevented us from getting comprehensive data on the pathogens that are associated with ALRIs and mixed viralbacterial infections. Secondly, virus (sub)typing was not performed systematically and (sub)typing data were not collected., These data are very important and could provide a more comprehensive picture by age group and seasonality in various regions [28] . Thirdly, further understanding of seasonality of these viral agents in various climate regions and co-relation with meteorological data (temperature, rainfall, humidity etc.) will be important to better understand and describe the epidemiology of these etiologies and related diseases, and for appropriately timing the use of interventions, such as influenza vaccines and future RSV vaccines [30] . Fourthly, this study did not include HRV during the first four years, which is also one of most common pathogens associated with ALRI. 5) The importance of viruses as major causes of ALRIs is becoming increasingly apparent because the sensitivity of detection techniques has greatly improved and new molecular tests are increasingly replacing conventional methods. However, lack of controls limits our ability to infer a causal association and therefore our results must be interpreted with caution [31, 32] .

In conclusion, this study provided important background information concerning the respiratory viral etiologies in China, based on a large sample size across a vast territory for multiple seasons. Our findings could serve as robust evidence for public health authorities for drawing up further plans to prevent and control of respiratory virus associated ALRIs. The spectrum of viral etiologies could be helpful to estimate disease burden associated with these pathogens and to guide the priority for future research studies and allocate resources to fight infectious diseases. RSV is common in very young children and prevention measures, such as vaccination, could have a large public health impact. Influenza was most common in adults and influenza vaccination should be more widespread in China. The seasonality information could be used as a basis to optimize the timing for the potential use of appropriate pharmaceutical and nonpharmaceutical interventions against these diseases. These preliminary results indicate that more robust surveillance data and evaluations are needed to estimate the disease burden and to understand whether geographic areas, climate and other environmental factors and patterns of human behavior influence the timing and severity of epidemics associated with these viral agents.

Rapid Diagnosis of Respiratory Virus Infections Patients With Acute Respiratory Disease in,"Viral respirator 5"" in(ectians represent a significant segment of the total respiratory disease speclrum; however, until reeentl 5"" the laboralory diagnosis oJ viral respiratory infections was relalirely im;f#icient. Development of new and hnproved immunologic assay systems has paved the way for accurate and reliable rapid diagnostic tests that detect viral antigens in clinical specialens. We conducted a careful and elaborate study in which radioimmunoassay for antigen detection was compared with u battery of tissue culture systems for viral isolation and iden-ti#Tcati(m. Using a lTne plastic catheter, a specimen of mucus was aspirated from the nasopharynx o.f patients with clinical signs and symptoms of acute viral upper respiratory tract infections. Each spechnen was divided into two portions; one was used to inoculate a variety o.f tissue culture cell lines and the other was used for radioimmunoassay tests for influenza A and B. adenavirus, parainfluenza 1, 2, and 3, and respiratory syncytial virus. Radioimmunoassav results campared very favorably with the tissue culture data with on/v one exception-adenovirus. Essentially this degree of accuracy and reproducibility was obtained with an enzrnle-liaked imnmnosorbent assay test. which has replaced radioimmunoassa.r. Tissue cultures are still used for backup, but with a rapid antigen detection system in place, coupled with a modern computer program ta facilitate the laboratory data to the clinician, considerable strides hare been nlade, and will continue to be made, in the diagnosis and therapy of viral respirat()r 5"" tract infections.","Diagnosis of viral infections of the respiratory tract is relatively inefficient. This is due to several factors, one of which is the isolation of the virus in tissue culture systems because some of the agents--rhinovirus or coronavirus--cannot be cultivated in a practical manner. Others, such as respiratory syncytial virus, have a low rate of efficiency of cultivation. Another factor is the quality of the specimen; the presence of viral immunoglobulin A-antibodies in the mucus secretions, or virus inactivation due to improper storage or prolonged transport time of the specimen to the laboratory. A third factor relates to the prospects of a virus being present in the specimen. For example, in the case of influenza the chance for the isolation of the agent decreases rapidly 3 days after onset of clinical symptoms. Finally, the time required for virus isolation, including tissue culture cultivation, hemadsorption, and typing of the virus isolate, generally requires 3-10 days, a time lapse that cannot be tolerated if useful cooperation with the clinician is to be maintained.

Enhancement of efficiency and performance of rapid diagnosis are the current tools in clinical virology. The first successful efforts in this direction were made by Gardner and McQuillin (1968) in London, Grandien (1985) in Stockholm, Halonen et al. (1983) in Turku, and others (Orstavik et al., 1980; Berg et al., 1980; Chao et al., 1979; Daisy et al., 1979: Fulton and Middleton, 1974) . These scientists improved the application of immunofluorescence techniques for the rapid diagnosis of respiratory tract diseases. As viewed by the European Group for Rapid Viral Diagnosis, this was reasonable progress in rapid diagnosis of viral diseases. Although immunofluorescent staining of cells removed from the nasopharynx is a rapid method, it is also subjective and requires a highly skilled microscopist. The preparation of the smears (usually at the bedside) is another critical problem. Furthermore, this method has not been automated, and is restricted to a relatively small number of samples per day.

Therefore, the advantages of the radioimmunoassay (RIA) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (Yolken, 1982) are clearly evident. The major advantages are objectivity, high sensitivity, and detection of specific viral antigens independent of the presence of viable virus (Purcell et al., 1974) . This last advantage eliminates the problems of storage and transport of the samples, as well as the diagnostic problems later in the course of illness. Recent studies have shown that the sensitivity and the specificity of ELISA and RIA were comparable to those obtained by the immunofluorescence tec]anique or by conventional isolation techniques (Minnich and Ray, 1980 : Sarkkinen et al., 1981a : Sarkkinen et al., 1981b .

The validity of rapid diagnosis of respiratory tract viral diseases was tested by antigen detection in a pilot project during an outbreak in Berlin, during the winter of 1980. The RIAs and the ELISAs were performed according to the methods of Sarkkinen et al. (1981a Sarkkinen et al. ( , 1981b Sarkkinen et al. ( , 1981c and Halonen et al. (1983) . The purpose of the study was to test the efficiency of a four-layer RIA or enzyme immunoassay, respectively, in comparison with conventional isolation techniques in the routine work of the laboratory with unselected clinical specimens. The time of the pilot project was characterized by an outbreak of influenza A subtype H,N1 followed by a second wave of subtype H3N3 within 2-3 wk.

During this seasonal outbreak of acute respiratory diseases, specimens from 146 patients were investigated for influenza A, B, para 1, 2, 3, respiratory syncytial and adenovirus (Ehrlicher et al., 1984) . The specimens were obtained from both hospitalized patients and from patients seeing physicians in the clinic or office. The patients were mainly children of both sexes, ranging in age from 4 wk to 14 yr, who had clinical symptoms of acute respiratory disease, and were examined within the first 3 days after onset of clinical symptoms. The samples were obtained by aspiration from the nasopharynx with a fine plastic catheter through the nostrils of patients. By this method, usually 0.2-2.0 ml of mucus was easily obtained. Furthermore, we learned that this method is more readily tolerated by the patient than are throat swabs because the vomiting stimulus is avoided. For further handling the aspirated specimens were divided in two parts; one was diluted 1:10 with Eagle's medium containing antibiotics and inoculated on tissue cultures of primary African green monkey kidney cells, on human diploid fibroblasts, or on FL cells. The tissue cells were observed for cytopathic effect or hemadsorption. If positive they were propagated further in deembryonated eggs and examined with the electron microscope. The second part of the specimen was diluted 1:5 with phosphate buffered saline containing 20% FCS, 2% Tween 20, and 10 -~ merthiolate. After sonication to dissolve the mucus, the material was stored at -70°C until tested with the RIA or the ELISA procedure. The RIA was performed on polystyrene beads coated with antivirus guinea pig immunoglobulin G (IgG) purified by immunosorbent chromatography. After over-night adsorption of the sample preparation, rabbit antivirus immunoglobulin was added and allowed to react for 1 hr; this was followed by the addition of labeled sheep antirabbit IgG. Binding ratios of 2.1 or greater compared with control preparations were considered positive.

The sensitivity of this procedure as a method for antigen detection was determined with purified antigens. The sensitivity ranged from 5 ~g/ml of virus protein for adenovirus, influenza A, and parainfluenza 1 and 3, to 20 ~g/ml for influenza B and parainfluenza 2. For respiratory syncytial virus the sensitivity was 200 ~g/ml. The specificity was high, and no crossreactivity was observed, either in control antigen or in clinical specimens with other types of isolated viruses.

As demonstrated in Figure 1 , 119 specimens cultured for influenza A virus were negative and 27 were tissue culture-positive. In the RIA four of the tissue culturenegatives were positive and six of the culture-positives were negative in the RIA. These results were independent of the influenza subtype (H1N, or H3N3) . The investigation shows that RIA has a good sensitivity and an enhancement of efficiency can be obtained by the RIA. But does viable virus escape detection by the RIA if only small numbers are present in the specimens. For influenza B virus, the RIA has a significantly higher efficiency than conventional isolation techniques. However, with adenovirus ( Figure 2 ) all of the 133 tissue culture-negative attempts were also negative with the RIA, but from the 13 tissue culture-positive specimens, three were negative in the RIA A significant improvement in diagnosis could be obtained for respiratory syncytia[ virus (Figure 3) . From 144 culture-negative probes, five were significantly FIGURE 1. Influenza A antigen detection by radioimmunoassay in 27 tissue culture-positive specimens and 119 tissue culture-negative specimens (Ehrlicher et al., 1984) . FIGURE Z. Adenovirus antigen detection by radioimmunoassay in 13 tissue culture-positive specimens and 133 tissue culture-negative specimens (Ehrlicher et al., 1984) .

FIGURE 3. Respiratory syncytial virus antigen detection by radioimmunoassay in two tissue culture-positive specimens and 144 tissue culture-negative specimens (Ehrlicher et al., 1984] . The examples demonstrated in this 5 yr project were in close agreement with the clinical pictures, and most of the results could be confirmed by demonstrating a significant increase of the antibody titers. Only a few cases of parainfluenza virus infection were found in this observation period, but in an outbreak later in the year the method produced very good results with high sensitivity.

Evidently, for influenza A and especially for influenza B, a higher efficiency of virus diagnosis can be obtained using RIA. A significant advance also may be obtained with respiratory syncytial virus; but with adenovirus the RIA produced no measurable advantage. After evaluation of those seven tests under naturally occurring epidemiologic conditions, we elected to continue this approach, but we replaced the RIA method with an ELISA using a peroxidase detection system in microtiter plates. The results were essentially the same and we now use the ELISA system in our clinical diagnostic routine, covering nearly all hospitals, and a large number of outpatient clinics, in West Berlin.

The antigen detection approach has proved to be a suitable method to improve the efficiency of diagnosis of respiratory viruses. But in our opinion it is still necessary to perform a tissue culture simultaneously. Sensitivity can be enhanced by using purified antibodies of higher potency or of better specific activity of labeling. Generally, monoclonal antibodies are of no advantage in this system. The concentration of the samples is an important factor.

Because testing for seven different virus antigens requires at least 0.5 ml of mucus it would be desirable to reduce the test volumes and to develop combined tests for several antigens in one single assay. The time required for virus diagnosis could be reduced from several days to 12 hr.

Finally, when considering the time reduction in diagnostic work, one should keep in mind that, especially when using rapid methods, the organization of the flow of clinical material from the patient to the laboratory and the evaluation, interpretation, and printing and transfer of the results to the clinician requires an amount of time greater than for the laboratory tests. Therefore, we developed a fully-computerized diagnostic system and obtained a significant additional time reduction in virus diagnosis (Habermehl, 1983 (Habermehl, , 1985 .

Rapid diagnosis of virus diseases is the goal of the immediate future. Currently available antiviral drugs are specifically directed against one group or kind of virus and, because therapy should be started as early as possible, it is necessary now to establish a variety of diagnostic methods to be prepared to fulfill the clinical requirements of the future.
