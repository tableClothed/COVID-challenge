Pathogen diversity drives the evolution of generalist MHC-II alleles in human populations," It consists of 95 diseases caused by 168 extracellular pathogens, including diverse bacterial species, fungi, protozoa, and helminthes","Manczinger, Máté; Boross, Gábor; Kemény, Lajos; Müller, Viktor; Lenz, Tobias L.; Papp, Balázs; Pál, Csaba",2019-01-31,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6372212/
The Evolution and Genetics of Virus Host Shifts," Avian influenza viruses bind SAa-2,3 receptors in the respiratory The pathogen is less successful in host clades more distantly related to its natural host
 Both processes result in closely related host species harbouring similar pathogens, and in some host clades harbouring more pathogen species","Longdon, Ben; Brockhurst, Michael A.; Russell, Colin A.; Welch, John J.; Jiggins, Francis M.",2014-11-06,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4223060/
Natural selection and infectious disease in human populations," The range of diseases affected by ancient pathogen-driven selection extends beyond infectious diseases and immune-mediated disorders
 tuberculosis strain, an accurate phenotype would include sequence data from the pathogen","Karlsson, Elinor K.; Kwiatkowski, Dominic P.; Sabeti, Pardis C.",2014-04-29,http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc4912034?pdf=render
Unifying Viral Genetics and Human Transportation Data to Predict the Global Transmission Dynamics of Human Influenza H3N2,"Notable recent examples include novel influenza strains, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus and Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, which all exploit today's complex and voluminous transport networks to rapidly disseminate in a globalized world","Lemey, Philippe; Rambaut, Andrew; Bedford, Trevor; Faria, Nuno; Bielejec, Filip; Baele, Guy; Russell, Colin A.; Smith, Derek J.; Pybus, Oliver G.; Brockmann, Dirk; Suchard, Marc A.",2014-02-20,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3930559/
Does genetic diversity limit disease spread in natural host populations?," In these models, hosts varied in susceptibility to a single pathogen strain, but no host genotype was completely resistant to infection","King, K C; Lively, C M",2012-06-20,https://www.nature.com/articles/hdy201233.pdf
A Systems Biology Approach to Infectious Disease Research: Innovating the Pathogen-Host Research Paradigm, These studies are being extended to identify and model those hostvirus interactions that predispose an infected lung to secondary bacterial invasion by Staphylococcus aureus,"Aderem, Alan; Adkins, Joshua N.; Ansong, Charles; Galagan, James; Kaiser, Shari; Korth, Marcus J.; Law, G.

Evolution of feline immunodeficiency virus in Felidae: Implications for human health and wildlife ecology,"Molecular genetic tools are informative in evaluating emerging pathogens and provide essential information such as pathogen identification, association of particular or novel strains with disease outbreaks, mutational changes leading to increased or decreased pathogenesis, and geographic and/or evolutionary origins of the pathogen","Pecon-Slattery, Jill; Troyer, Jennifer L.; Johnson, Warren E.; O’Brien, Stephen J.",2008-05-01,http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc2774529?pdf=render
