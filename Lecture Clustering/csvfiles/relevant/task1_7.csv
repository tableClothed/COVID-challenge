Tissue tropism and transmission ecology predict virulence of human RNA viruses," The virulence risk factors we identify suggest that broadly targeting direct contact or respiratory transmission interfaces within ecological systems and/or tailoring detection assays towards certain virus families (e
For each of the 214 recognised human-infective RNA virus species, following standardised data compilation efforts and critical assessment protocols [5] , data on virulence and potential risk factors were collected via a systematic search and review of clinical and epidemiological literature","Brierley, Liam; Pedersen, Amy B.; Woolhouse, Mark E. J.",2019-11-26,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6879112/
Nosocomial Transmission of Emerging Viruses via Aerosol-Generating Medical Procedures," If we are to design proactive infection control guidelines and understand the underlying biology of viral transmission, we must conduct collaborative clinical and scientific research on nosocomial virus transmission and AGMPs","Judson, Seth D.; Munster, Vincent J.",2019-10-12,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6832307/
Characterizing the Transmission Dynamics and Control of Ebola Virus Disease," These additional interventions include the use of household protection kits, designed to reduce transmission in the community; improvements in infection control protocols in health care settings that reduce transmission among health care workers; and the impact of rapid diagnostic kits in Ebola treatment centers, which reduce the time to isolation for infectious individuals seeking hospitalization","Chowell, Gerardo; Nishiura, Hiroshi",2015-01-21,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4301953/
Spatial and temporal analyses to investigate infectious disease transmission within healthcare settings," Use of interdisciplinary tools may increase the ability to identify transmission prospectively and implement preventive measures
 electronic medical databases), advancement in molecular and statistical techniques, development of analytical platforms that enable greater access to non-experts and increased interdisciplinary collaboration, the potential for using pre-existing data to prevent future avoidable infections and improve patient safety can become a reality
Descriptive studies that included molecular data covered a range of applications including outbreak investigations, 94e102 cluster identification 103 and improving control interventions
 Findings were synthesized to evaluate the actual use of spatiotemporal analysis on infectious diseases in healthcare settings","Davis, G.S.; Sevdalis, N.; Drumright, L.N.",2014-04-30,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhin.2014.01.010
