Communicable Disease Surveillance Ethics in the Age of Big Data and New Technology, Data from animal and environmental health sources can help to identify emerging infectious disease risks,"Gilbert, Gwendolyn L.; Degeling, Chris; Johnson, Jane",2019-06-10,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7091643/
xMAP Technology: Applications in Detection of Pathogens, The surveillance of zoonotic viruses in wildlife populations is necessary in order to monitor the risk of emerging infectious disease outbreaks,"Reslova, Nikol; Michna, Veronika; Kasny, Martin; Mikel, Pavel; Kralik, Petr",2017-01-25,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5263158/
Targeting Transmission Pathways for Emerging Zoonotic Disease Surveillance and Control," By targeting this and other potential routes of food contamination, surveillance efforts and control measures may better minimize the risk of zoonotic disease emergence
 Proactive approaches include pathogen discovery in wildlife to identify potential zoonoses , Lipkin 2013 , however the number of microbes in wildlife remaining to be discovered is likely large and the causes and dynamics of transmission from wildlife to human are poorly understood ( Jones et al
 However, it is likely that many more novel transmission pathways remain undescribed for pathogens that pose a potential human health risk","Loh, Elizabeth H.; Zambrana-Torrelio, Carlos; Olival, Kevin J.; Bogich, Tiffany L.; Johnson, Christine K.; Mazet, Jonna A. K.; Karesh, William; Daszak, Peter",2015-07-01,http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc4507309?pdf=render
