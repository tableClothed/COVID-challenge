"Comparative Analysis of Transcriptional Profiles of Adult Schistosoma japonicum from Different Laboratory Animals and the Natural Host, Water Buffalo","Comparative genomics analysis of well characterized signaling pathways between schistosome and mammalian host indicates that schistosome genome encodes various growth factors, receptors and other critical components to regulate numerous cellular processes during tissue development and organogenesis","Liu, Shuai; Zhou, Xiaosu; Piao, Xianyu; Wu, Chuang; Hou, Nan; Chen, Qijun",2015-08-18,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4540470/

Evolution of feline immunodeficiency virus in Felidae: Implications for human health and wildlife ecology," Patterns of divergence describe substantial genetic differences among strains across the entire FIV genome and define monophyletic viral lineages unique to specific host species (Barr et al
Phylogenetic analyses of concatenated sequences from coding regions excluding env (6435 bp) recapitulate that FIV strains are specific to their host species
Although sharing conserved genome organization, large genetic differences exist among species-specific FIV strains","Pecon-Slattery, Jill; Troyer, Jennifer L.; Johnson, Warren E.; O’Brien, Stephen J.",2008-05-01,http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc2774529?pdf=render
