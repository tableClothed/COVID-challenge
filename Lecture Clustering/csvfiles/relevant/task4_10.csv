Antibody-dependent NK cell degranulation as a marker for assessing antibody-dependent cytotoxicity against pandemic 2009 influenza A(H1N1) infection in human plasma and influenza-vaccinated transchromosomic bovine intravenous immunoglobulin therapy," Vaccine induction or therapeutic production of antibodies that target influenza internal proteins via ADCC response may prove to be a new development for influenza vaccine/treatment design
 Routine evaluation of vaccine-induced antibody responses and determination of protective titers will potentially benefit from utilizing additional influenza assays such as NI, MN, and ADCC assays","Morrison, Brian J.; Roman, Jessica A.; Luke, Thomas C.; Nagabhushana, Nishith; Raviprakash, Kanakatte; Williams, Maya; Sun, Peifang",2017-10-31,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2017.06.007
Molecular mechanisms for enhanced DNA vaccine immunogenicity," Hence combinations of multiple cytokines in a DNA vaccine formulation or sequential vaccination with cytokines may enhance vaccine efficacy
Targeting DNA vaccine to specific cells or subcellular compartments can greatly increase antigen processing and presentation and promote the desired immune responses, while minimizing systemic toxicity","Li, Lei; Petrovsky, Nikolai",2015-12-28,http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc4955855?pdf=render
Protective Efficacy of Passive Immunization with Monoclonal Antibodies in Animal Models of H5N1 Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza Virus Infection,"To help develop a clinical antibody therapy, we also generated a human-mouse chimeric monoclonal antibody (MAb ch61) that showed strong neutralizing activity against H5N1 HPAI viruses isolated from humans and evaluated its protective potential in animal models","Itoh, Yasushi; Yoshida, Reiko; Shichinohe, Shintaro; Higuchi, Megumi; Ishigaki, Hirohito; Nakayama, Misako; Pham, Van Loi; Ishida, Hideaki; Kitano, Mitsutaka; Arikata, Masahiko; Kitagawa, Naoko; Mitsuishi, Yachiyo; Ogasawara, Kazumasa; Tsuchiya, Hideaki; Hiono, Takahiro; Okamatsu, Masatoshi; Sakoda, Yoshihiro; Kida, Hiroshi; Ito, Mutsumi; Quynh Mai, Le; Kawaoka, Yoshihiro; Miyamoto, Hiroko; Ishijima, Mari; Igarashi, Manabu; Suzuki, Yasuhiko; Takada, Ayato",2014-06-12,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4055766/
Vascular disrupting agent DMXAA enhances the antitumor effects generated by therapeutic HPV DNA vaccines," Thus, CRT has been shown to be highly potent in enhancing the antigen-specific immune responses and antitumor effects generated by DNA vaccination in several preclinical models","Peng, Shiwen; Monie, Archana; Pang, Xiaowu; Hung, Chien-Fu; Wu, T-C",2011-03-08,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3062584/
Preparation of recombinant vaccines," ISCOM-based vaccines are able to induce strong antibody and cellular immune response
 Studies in mice showed that CpG ODN can boost both humoral and cell-mediated immune responses against a broad range of proteins or vaccines","Soler, Eric; Houdebine, Louis-Marie",2007-12-31,https://doi.org/10.1016/s1387-2656(07)13004-0
