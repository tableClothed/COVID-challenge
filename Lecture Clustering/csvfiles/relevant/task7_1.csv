Communicable Disease Surveillance Ethics in the Age of Big Data and New Technology,"Moreover, to realise the additional benefits of using pathogen WGS data for communicable disease surveillance will require access to and analysis of aggregate WGS data in national or international laboratory networks, linked to clinical and epidemiological databases","Gilbert, Gwendolyn L.; Degeling, Chris; Johnson, Jane",2019-06-10,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7091643/
Establishment of CDC Global Rapid Response Team to Ensure Global Health Security, Laboratorians strengthened Zika virus testing capacity and improved existing diagnostic tools,"Stehling-Ariza, Tasha; Lefevre, Adrienne; Calles, Dinorah; Djawe, Kpandja; Garfield, Richard; Gerber, Michael; Ghiselli, Margherita; Giese, Coralie; Greiner, Ashley L.; Hoffman, Adela; Miller, Leigh Ann; Moorhouse, Lisa; Navarro-Colorado, Carlos; Walsh, James; Bugli, Dante; Shahpar, Cyrus",2017-12-27,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5711298/
Evaluating Hospital-Based Surveillance for Outbreak Detection in Bangladesh: Analysis of Healthcare Utilization Data," Of greater relevance is that surveillance system capacity to detect outbreaks and detection probabilities increased substantially with the number of cases
â€¢ The capacity to detect cases and outbreaks decreased with distance from surveillance hospitals","Nikolay, Birgit; Salje, Henrik; Sturm-Ramirez, Katharine; Azziz-Baumgartner, Eduardo; Homaira, Nusrat; Ahmed, Makhdum; Iuliano, A. Danielle; Paul, Repon C.; Rahman, Mahmudur; Hossain, M. Jahangir; Luby, Stephen P.; Cauchemez, Simon; Gurley, Emily S.",2017-01-17,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5240927/
Leveraging the Laboratory Response Network Model for the Global Health Security Agenda, Use of existing CDC LRN PHEP-funded systems enabled rapid and effective communication between clinical laboratories and public health laboratories,"Mangal, Chris N.; Maryogo-Robinson, Lucy",2014-09-01,http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc4171117?pdf=render
Epidemic Surveillance Using an Electronic Medical Record: An Empiric Approach to Performance Improvement,"Most automated surveillance systems utilize diagnostic codes to find diseased individuals
 Our results further argue that diagnostic codes sets used for case-detection should routinely optimized during surveillance system development or expansion","Zheng, Hongzhang; Gaff, Holly; Smith, Gary; DeLisle, Sylvain",2014-07-09,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4090236/
Internet-based surveillance systems for monitoring emerging infectious diseases," 68 These studies show potential applications of internet-based surveillance systems in bolstering traditional surveillance system capacity and guiding public health action
 A global response requires concerted international approaches to strengthen the capacity of emerging infectious diseases surveillance systems worldwide","Milinovich, Gabriel J; Williams, Gail M; Clements, Archie C A; Hu, Wenbiao",2014-02-28,https://doi.org/10.1016/s1473-3099(13)70244-5
