"Comparative Analysis of Transcriptional Profiles of Adult Schistosoma japonicum from Different Laboratory Animals and the Natural Host, Water Buffalo","Comparative genomics analysis of well characterized signaling pathways between schistosome and mammalian host indicates that schistosome genome encodes various growth factors, receptors and other critical components to regulate numerous cellular processes during tissue development and organogenesis","Liu, Shuai; Zhou, Xiaosu; Piao, Xianyu; Wu, Chuang; Hou, Nan; Chen, Qijun",2015-08-18,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4540470/
Natural selection and infectious disease in human populations," Incorporating ancient history into disease susceptibility studies will identify functional variants and elucidate cellular mechanisms, and facilitate the development of new therapies for a surprisingly wide range of human illnesses","Karlsson, Elinor K.; Kwiatkowski, Dominic P.; Sabeti, Pardis C.",2014-04-29,http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc4912034?pdf=render
A Systems Biology Approach to Infectious Disease Research: Innovating the Pathogen-Host Research Paradigm," Proteomic technologies and accompanying informatics pipelines are evolving rapidly, with throughput and sensitivity approaching that of microarrays
 Computational integration of the transcriptomic, proteomic, and lipidomic data into an appropriate network model will illuminate the detailed signatures of extreme virulence and identify the molecular mechanisms underlying these responses
 A comprehensive model of the influenza virus-host interaction, aided significantly by recent advances in sequencing technologies and advances in viral genetic manipulation, will serve to calibrate the global public health response to a newly emergent strain as well as uncover novel targets for therapeutic intervention
 Understanding the regulatory and metabolic programs required for infection will enable the development of effective therapeutic treatments in the future","Aderem, Alan; Adkins, Joshua N.; Ansong, Charles; Galagan, James; Kaiser, Shari; Korth, Marcus J.; Law, G.

Evolution of feline immunodeficiency virus in Felidae: Implications for human health and wildlife ecology,"Molecular genetic tools are informative in evaluating emerging pathogens and provide essential information such as pathogen identification, association of particular or novel strains with disease outbreaks, mutational changes leading to increased or decreased pathogenesis, and geographic and/or evolutionary origins of the pathogen
 Emerging pathogens utilize diverse strategies for genome adaptation and re-organization to successfully infect new host species that are only discernable through full genome scans","Pecon-Slattery, Jill; Troyer, Jennifer L.; Johnson, Warren E.; O’Brien, Stephen J.",2008-05-01,http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc2774529?pdf=render
