Development of Novel DNA-Encoded PCSK9 Monoclonal Antibodies as Lipid-Lowering Therapeutics," 81 In a phase I clinical trial evaluating the safety and immunogenicity of DNA vaccine GLS-5700, healthy adults demonstrated development of both binding and neutralizing antibodies, associated with protection in animal models","Khoshnejad, Makan; Patel, Ami; Wojtak, Krzysztof; Kudchodkar, Sagar B.; Humeau, Laurent; Lyssenko, Nicholas N.; Rader, Daniel J.; Muthumani, Kar; Weiner, David B.",2019-01-02,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ymthe.2018.10.016
Molecular mechanisms for enhanced DNA vaccine immunogenicity,"As in traditional vaccine research, small rodent laboratory animals are principally used for DNA vaccine research
 While vaccine success in small animal models does not guarantee translation to humans, such studies remain an important part of the vaccine development pipeline","Li, Lei; Petrovsky, Nikolai",2015-12-28,http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc4955855?pdf=render
Preclinical safety and tolerability of a repeatedly administered human leishmaniasis DNA vaccine," 12 However, immunogenicity of DNA vaccines was often modest in humans, necessitating better delivery methods and improved vaccine antigen expression","Riede, O; Seifert, K; Oswald, D; Endmann, A; Hock, C; Winkler, A; Salguero, F J; Schroff, M; Croft, S L; Juhls, C",2015-04-30,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4530203/
Protective Efficacy of Passive Immunization with Monoclonal Antibodies in Animal Models of H5N1 Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza Virus Infection," In particular, we used a cynomolgus macaque model, which simulates the H5N1 HPAI virus infection of humans more faithfully and thus has been used as an animal model for vaccine and pathogenesis studies on influenza virus infection [50] ","Itoh, Yasushi; Yoshida, Reiko; Shichinohe, Shintaro; Higuchi, Megumi; Ishigaki, Hirohito; Nakayama, Misako; Pham, Van Loi; Ishida, Hideaki; Kitano, Mitsutaka; Arikata, Masahiko; Kitagawa, Naoko; Mitsuishi, Yachiyo; Ogasawara, Kazumasa; Tsuchiya, Hideaki; Hiono, Takahiro; Okamatsu, Masatoshi; Sakoda, Yoshihiro; Kida, Hiroshi; Ito, Mutsumi; Quynh Mai, Le; Kawaoka, Yoshihiro; Miyamoto, Hiroko; Ishijima, Mari; Igarashi, Manabu; Suzuki, Yasuhiko; Takada, Ayato",2014-06-12,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4055766/
New Class of Monoclonal Antibodies against Severe Influenza: Prophylactic and Therapeutic Efficacy in Ferrets, The data of these two experiments demonstrate the prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy of this new class of human monoclonal antibodies in a highly stringent and clinically relevant ferret model of human influenza,"Friesen, Robert H.
