Nosocomial Transmission of Emerging Viruses via Aerosol-Generating Medical Procedures, Understanding the characteristics of the aerosol transmission of different influenza A viruses and subtypes could help us determine the risk of influenza A viruses for nosocomial transmission due to AGMPs,"Judson, Seth D.; Munster, Vincent J.",2019-10-12,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6832307/
Environmental Conditions Affect Exhalation of H3N2 Seasonal and Variant Influenza Viruses and Respiratory Droplet Transmission in Ferrets," Climatic conditions in tropical regions of the world represent a different set of parameters affecting transmission, and furthermore, routes of transmission not involving airborne virus (e","Gustin, Kortney M.; Belser, Jessica A.; Veguilla, Vic; Zeng, Hui; Katz, Jacqueline M.; Tumpey, Terrence M.; Maines, Taronna R.",2015-05-13,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4430532/

Quantifying the transmission potential of pandemic influenza,"One line of addressing heterogeneous patterns of transmission using the observed data is separating household transmission from community transmission
 In future studies, influenza models may better to highlight the increasing importance of considering household transmission to estimate the transmission potential using the temporal distribution of infection events","Chowell, Gerardo; Nishiura, Hiroshi",2008-03-31,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.plrev.2007.12.001
