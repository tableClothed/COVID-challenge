"Establishing benchmarks and metrics for disruptive technologies, inappropriate and obsolete tests in the clinical laboratory"," We evaluated whole genome sequencing, next generation sequencing and proteomics as examples of high impact disruptive technologies that generate large quantities of data that need software to reduce to clinically useful results","Kiechle, Frederick L.; Arcenas, Rodney C.; Rogers, Linda C.",2014-01-01,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cca.2013.05.024
Applications of Next-Generation Sequencing Technologies to Diagnostic Virology," NGS technologies are currently used for whole genome sequencing, investigation of genome diversity, metagenomics, epigenetics, discovery of non-coding RNAs and protein-binding sites, and gene-expression profiling by RNA sequencing (reviewed in refs
 Typical applications of NGS methods in microbiology and virology, besides high-throughput whole genome sequencing, are discovery of new microorganisms and viruses by using metagenomic approaches, investigation of microbial communities in the environment and in human body niches in healthy and disease conditions, analysis of viral genome variability within the host (i","Barzon, Luisa; Lavezzo, Enrico; Militello, Valentina; Toppo, Stefano; Pal√π, Giorgio",2011-11-14,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3233444/
