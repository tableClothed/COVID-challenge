"Establishing benchmarks and metrics for disruptive technologies, inappropriate and obsolete tests in the clinical laboratory"," The current recommendation for diagnostic testing involves a two-tiered algorithmic approach involving antibody testing [68] 
 Obsolete tests in the microbiology laboratory include bacterial antigen detection tests, Group B Streptococcus antigen (GBS) testing and HIV-1 Western blot","Kiechle, Frederick L.; Arcenas, Rodney C.; Rogers, Linda C.",2014-01-01,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cca.2013.05.024
Applications of Next-Generation Sequencing Technologies to Diagnostic Virology, High throughput deep sequencing methods have been proposed as tools for monitoring genetic consistency of live viral vaccines,"Barzon, Luisa; Lavezzo, Enrico; Militello, Valentina; Toppo, Stefano; Pal√π, Giorgio",2011-11-14,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3233444/
Future Veterinary Diagnostics," The integration of DNA and protein-based microarray methods may extend the range of rapid clinical diagnostic testing
Protein microarray technology has enormous potential for application within the veterinary diagnostic testing arena
 Most laboratories offering nucleic amplification tests (NAT)-based diagnostics use methods developed inhouse or those adapted from research publications
 This comprehensive and unbiased analysis of viral prevalence in a given biological sample also increases the feasibility of introducing molecular testing for viruses that are easily detected using classical diagnostic testing methods
 20 Innovative strategies using biomarkers represent alternative strategies for reliable cancer testing and for detecting clinical markers predictive of cardiovascular and other diseases
Nucleic amplification technologies will continue to be a benchmark for pathogen detection in veterinary diagnostics
For the veterinary clinical laboratory, commercially standardized assays are not readily available","Dahlhausen, Bob",2010-04-30,https://doi.org/10.1053/j.jepm.2010.05.006
