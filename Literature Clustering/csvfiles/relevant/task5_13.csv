Nosocomial Transmission of Emerging Viruses via Aerosol-Generating Medical Procedures,"In contrast to causing a patient to produce aerosols, AGMPs can also mechanically create and disperse respiratory aerosols through procedures such as ventilation, suctioning of the airway, or nebulizer treatment","Judson, Seth D.; Munster, Vincent J.",2019-10-12,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6832307/
Resistance to synthetic blood penetration of National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health-approved N95 filtering facepiece respirators and surgical N95 respirators," Penetration for large numbers of samples at higher velocity can be expected because an increase in the test velocity is likely to increase the permeability of the masks for fluids, including synthetic blood","Rengasamy, Samy; Sbarra, Deborah; Nwoko, Julian; Shaffer, Ronald",2015-11-01,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajic.2015.06.014
Commentary Considerations for Recommending Extended Use and Limited Reuse of Filtering Facepiece Respirators in Health Care Settings,"NIOSH researchers found that FFR use caused no or minimal increases in heart rate, respiratory rate, and transcutaneous carbon dioxide as well as no differences in oxygen saturation on test subjects during 1 hr of low-moderate treadmill exercise when compared with wearing no respirator (control)","Fisher, Edward M.; Shaffer, Ronald E.",2014-03-14,http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc4610368?pdf=render
Reusable elastomeric air-purifying respirators: Physiologic impact on health care workers," To determine differences for physiological variables, repeated-measures ANOVAs for oxygen saturation, partial pressure of transcutaneous carbon dioxide, breathing rate, tidal volume, minute volume, and heart rate were performed
 Paired t tests were performed to examine respirator dead space oxygen and carbon dioxide responses to EAPR at the 2 exercise intensities","Roberge, Raymond J.; Coca, Aitor; Williams, W. Jon; Powell, Jeffrey B.; Palmiero, Andrew J.",2010-06-30,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajic.2009.11.006
"Applications of ultraviolet germicidal irradiation disinfection in health care facilities: Effective adjunct, but not stand-alone technology", Air filtration aims to reduce airborne concentrations to well below infectious doses,"Memarzadeh, Farhad; Olmsted, Russell N.; Bartley, Judene M.",2010-06-30,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajic.2010.04.208
Evaluation of the survivability of MS2 viral aerosols deposited on filtering face piece respirator samples incorporating antimicrobial technologies,Other reactive oxygen molecules such as ozone are also excellent antimicrobial agents,"Rengasamy, Samy; Fisher, Edward; Shaffer, Ronald E.",2010-02-28,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajic.2009.08.006
Evaluation of the rationale for concurrent use of N95 filtering facepiece respirators with loose-fitting powered air-purifying respirators during aerosol-generating medical procedures," Hospital engineering controls (eg, negative pressure rooms, room ventilation systems with high efficiency particulate filters, ultraviolet radiation, etc 8 ) and the use of medications to suppress coughing and salivation during airway procedures 4,10,35,38,39 further limit the airborne spread of respiratory pathogens and would additionally decrease the PAPR wearer's potential inhalational exposure","Roberge, Raymond J.",2008-03-31,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajic.2007.04.284
