Chikungunya Virus Fidelity Variants Exhibit Differential Attenuation and Population Diversity in Cell Culture and Adult Mice,"Fidelity mutant CHIKV impair serum neutralization of less diverse WT CHIKV in vitro
 Infectious CHIKV titers and CHIKV RNA levels in primary target tissues, muscle and ankle, and secondary tissues, brain and liver, were measured to determine whether clinical disease severity was associated with differential viral loads","Riemersma, Kasen K.; Steiner, Cody; Singapuri, Anil; Coffey, Lark L.",2019-01-17,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6340026/
Stability of Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus on Fomite Materials at Different Temperatures," In fact, eluates from fecal samples induced remarkable cell toxicity, making the infectious virus assays difficult to interpret","Kim, Yonghyan; Krishna, Venkatramana D.; Torremorell, Montserrat; Goyal, Sagar M.; Cheeran, Maxim C.-J.",2018-02-13,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5876564/
Host genetics determine susceptibility to avian influenza infection and transmission dynamics," However, viral shedding did not extend to higher respiratory tissues as no shedding was detected in oropharyngeal swabs (Fig","Ruiz-Hernandez, Raul; Mwangi, William; Peroval, Marylene; Sadeyen, Jean-Remy; Ascough, Stephanie; Balkissoon, Devanand; Staines, Karen; Boyd, Amy; McCauley, John; Smith, Adrian; Butter, Colin",2016-06-09,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4899695/
Environmental Conditions Affect Exhalation of H3N2 Seasonal and Variant Influenza Viruses and Respiratory Droplet Transmission in Ferrets," Successful transmission was noted when virus was detected in nasal wash samples within 11 dpc and hemagglutination inhibition antibody titers against homologous virus were detected in convalescent serum collected after 18 dpc
 Droplet transmission occurs when larger droplets (>5 Î¼m), typically expelled during coughing or sneezing, encounter the upper respiratory tract or ocular mucosa of a susceptible individual","Gustin, Kortney M.; Belser, Jessica A.; Veguilla, Vic; Zeng, Hui; Katz, Jacqueline M.; Tumpey, Terrence M.; Maines, Taronna R.",2015-05-13,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4430532/
Vaccination of influenza a virus decreases transmission rates in pigs," Lesions included moderate numbers of lymphocytes within the hyperplastic epithelium, intraluminal cellular debris and occasional bacterial colonies
 The lung lesions of the NV pigs had moderate to severe bronchoalveolar pneumonia with attenuation, hyperplasia, moderate numbers of lymphocytes admixed with macrophages in the epithelium, within the intraluminal necrotic cellular debris, and extending into the alveolar spaces","Romagosa, Anna; Allerson, Matt; Gramer, Marie; Joo, Han Soo; Deen, John; Detmer, Susan; Torremorell, Montserrat",2011-12-20,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3258204/
Sequential Adaptive Mutations Enhance Efficient Vector Switching by Chikungunya Virus and Its Epidemic Emergence, BM indicates combined titers of competitors in blood meal used for mosquito infection,"Tsetsarkin, Konstantin A.; Weaver, Scott C.",2011-12-08,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3234230/
