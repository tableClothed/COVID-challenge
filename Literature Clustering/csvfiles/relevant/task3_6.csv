Microbial genomes from non-human primate gut metagenomes expand the primate-associated bacterial tree of life with over 1000 novel species,"Despite the low overall degree of microbial sharing between human and non-human hosts at the species level, some bacterial families were common among primate hosts (Fig","Manara, Serena; Asnicar, Francesco; Beghini, Francesco; Bazzani, Davide; Cumbo, Fabio; Zolfo, Moreno; Nigro, Eleonora; Karcher, Nicolai; Manghi, Paolo; Metzger, Marisa Isabell; Pasolli, Edoardo; Segata, Nicola",2019-12-28,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6935492/
Evolutionary origins of epidemic potential among human RNA viruses, L2 and L3/4 viruses in non-human hosts may cross the species barrier and enter human populations,Lu Lu; Liam Brierley; Gail Robertson; Feifei Zhang; Samantha Lycett; Donald Smith; Margo Chase-Topping; Peter Simmonds; Mark Woolhouse,2019-09-18,https://doi.org/10.1101/771394
Evolution and Genetic Diversity of Porcine Circovirus 3 in China,"The Circovirus genus claimed veterinarians' attention shortly after its discovery, most members infect avian species but swine also serve as natural hosts [1, 2] ","Chen, Ye; Xu, Quanming; Chen, Hong; Luo, Xian; Wu, Qi; Tan, Chen; Pan, Qidong; Chen, Ji-Long",2019-08-27,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6783837/
Animal Virus Ecology and Evolution Are Shaped by the Virus Host-Body Infiltration and Colonization Pattern," Further, the SARS corona virus infected civet cats raised as food animals before appearing in humans as host [26] ","Slingenbergh, Jan",2019-05-25,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6631033/
Origins and Evolution of the Global RNA Virome," Finally, it seems plausible that, given the high prevalence of ϪRNA viruses in metazoa and their virtual absence in protists (with the exception of the recently discovered ""leishbuviruses"" that likely invaded their parasitic protist hosts via HVT from an animal host [49, 50] ), the viruses that comprise RdRp branch 5 evolved in animals via mixing and matching genes from reovirus-like and flavivirus-like ancestors","Wolf, Yuri I.; Kazlauskas, Darius; Iranzo, Jaime; Lucía-Sanz, Adriana; Kuhn, Jens H.; Krupovic, Mart; Dolja, Valerian V.; Koonin, Eugene V.",2018-11-27,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6282212/

"The diversity, evolution and origins of vertebrate RNA viruses"," As mammals and birds often experience relatively similar infectious disease to humans, and live in close proximity to us, they are commonly thought to be the natural reservoir hosts of the RNA viruses that subsequently emerge and cause diseases in humans through a process of cross-species transmission [1, 2] ","Zhang, Yong-Zhen; Wu, Wei-Chen; Shi, Mang; Holmes, Edward C",2018-08-31,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.coviro.2018.07.017
The Evolution and Genetics of Virus Host Shifts,"Emerging infectious diseases affecting humans, wildlife, and agriculture are often the result of a pathogen jumping from its original host into a novel host species
One little-explored consequence of host shifts is how they affect the distribution of pathogens across host species [85] ","Longdon, Ben; Brockhurst, Michael A.; Russell, Colin A.; Welch, John J.; Jiggins, Francis M.",2014-11-06,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4223060/
