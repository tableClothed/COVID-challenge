"Establishing benchmarks and metrics for disruptive technologies, inappropriate and obsolete tests in the clinical laboratory"," Obsolete tests in the microbiology laboratory include bacterial antigen detection tests, Group B Streptococcus antigen (GBS) testing and HIV-1 Western blot
Bacterial antigen detection tests should be considered obsolete","Kiechle, Frederick L.; Arcenas, Rodney C.; Rogers, Linda C.",2014-01-01,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cca.2013.05.024
Future Veterinary Diagnostics," Testing kits that use this technology are commercially available for detecting Salmonella spp
Nucleic amplification technologies will continue to be a benchmark for pathogen detection in veterinary diagnostics
For the veterinary clinical laboratory, commercially standardized assays are not readily available
Many amplification methods, including PCR, ligase chain reaction, NASBA, and strand displacement amplification, are used in commercially available diagnostic test kits
 Biosensors using antibodies or DNA/RNA strands can detect infectious disease agents and be used for hormone and drug assays
 Most laboratories offering nucleic amplification tests (NAT)-based diagnostics use methods developed inhouse or those adapted from research publications
 65 Protein microarrays offer unparalleled throughput, minimal reagent consumption, and sensitive simultaneous detection of multiple targets","Dahlhausen, Bob",2010-04-30,https://doi.org/10.1053/j.jepm.2010.05.006
Diagnostic System for Rapid and Sensitive Differential Detection of Pathogens," Methods to directly detect nucleic acids of microbial pathogens in clinical specimens are rapid, sensitive, and may succeed when culturing the organism fails","Briese, Thomas; Palacios, Gustavo; Kokoris, Mark; Jabado, Omar; Liu, Zhiqiang; Renwick, Neil; Kapoor, Vishal; Casas, Inmaculada; Pozo, Francisco; Limberger, Ron; Perez-Brena, Pilar; Ju, Jingyue; Lipkin, W.
