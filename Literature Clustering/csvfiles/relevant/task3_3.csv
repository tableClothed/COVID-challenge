Animal Virus Ecology and Evolution Are Shaped by the Virus Host-Body Infiltration and Colonization Pattern," For example, an opportunistic, epithelial virus of wildlife origin is likely to be found circulating in livestock before becoming first detected in humans as host","Slingenbergh, Jan",2019-05-25,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6631033/
Genetic Diversity and Phylodynamics of Avian Coronaviruses in Egyptian Wild Birds," Phylodynamic and evolutionary analysis indicate that wild bird ACoV strains are closely related to the infectious bronchitis viruses (IBVs) reported from commercial poultry, indicating their possible threat to commercial poultry","A. Rohaim, Mohammed; F. El Naggar, Rania; M. Helal, Ahmed; M. Bayoumi, Mahmoud; A. El-Saied, Mohamed; A. Ahmed, Kawkab; Z. Shabbir, Muhammad; Munir, Muhammad",2019-01-14,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6356246/
Genetic susceptibility to infectious diseases: Current status and future perspectives from genome-wide approaches," The majority of patients recruited in the study were infected with genotype 3 and HCV is genetically heterogeneous, suggesting that other and possibly different interactions exist in patients infected by distinct HCV genotypes","Mozzi, Alessandra; Pontremoli, Chiara; Sironi, Manuela",2018-12-31,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2017.09.028
"Origin, Genetic Diversity, and Evolutionary Dynamics of Novel Porcine Circovirus 3"," This suggests the potential to become endemic in pigs, at least if compared to human influenza viruses","Li, Gairu; He, Wanting; Zhu, Henan; Bi, Yuhai; Wang, Ruyi; Xing, Gang; Zhang, Cheng; Zhou, Jiyong; Yuen, Kwok‐Yung; Gao, George F.; Su, Shuo",2018-07-04,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6145280/
Natural selection and infectious disease in human populations," Consistent with long host-pathogen co-evolution, only 10% of infected individuals develop active disease; in most infected individuals the host immune system contains the pathogen","Karlsson, Elinor K.; Kwiatkowski, Dominic P.; Sabeti, Pardis C.",2014-04-29,http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc4912034?pdf=render
Does genetic diversity limit disease spread in natural host populations?," Thus, host population genetic diversity seems to have an important role in buffering populations against epidemics
Consistent with results from agricultural populations, the existing literature suggests that high genetic diversity could buffer host populations against disease spread","King, K C; Lively, C M",2012-06-20,https://www.nature.com/articles/hdy201233.pdf
Evolution of feline immunodeficiency virus in Felidae: Implications for human health and wildlife ecology,The emergence of infectious disease within new host species or naïve populations can greatly influence species survival and adaptation,"Pecon-Slattery, Jill; Troyer, Jennifer L.; Johnson, Warren E.; O’Brien, Stephen J.",2008-05-01,http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc2774529?pdf=render
