Human Metapneumovirus Infection in Jordanian Children: Epidemiology and Risk Factors for Severe Disease," Thus, the epidemiology of previously established risk factors in this population are different than other cohorts where these factors are often predictors of respiratory virus severity
 Our study highlights that the epidemiology of established risk factors are unique to specific populations
 Prematurity and daycare are underrepresented factors in this population, highlighting that factors contributing to severe disease differ substantially between geographic and developing regions","Schuster, Jennifer E.; Khuri-Bulos, Najwa; Faouri, Samir; Shehabi, Asem; Johnson, Monika; Wang, Li; Fonnesbeck, Christopher; Williams, John V.; Halasa, Natasha",2015-12-01,http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc4875771?pdf=render
