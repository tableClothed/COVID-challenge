Intranasal DNA Vaccine for Protection against Respiratory Infectious Diseases: The Delivery Perspectives,"Liposomes are vesicles comprised of phospholipid bilayers
 Effective mucosal immunity often correlates with the uptake of antigen by mucosal inductive tissues, such as NALT in the upper respiratory tract following intranasal immunization
 Apart from cellular uptake, particle size also affects the kinetics of lymphatic drainage
 In addition, the overlying epithelium of mucosal follicles forms a specialized cell layer","Xu, Yingying; Yuen, Pak-Wai; Lam, Jenny Ka-Wing",2014-07-10,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4190526/
Aerosol Generating Procedures and Risk of Transmission of Acute Respiratory Infections to Healthcare Workers: A Systematic Review," Procedures that might promote the generation of droplets or aerosols (nonexhaustive list) included non-invasive ventilation (CPAP and BiPAP), endotracheal intubation, airway suctioning, high frequency oscillatory ventilation, bag-valve mask ventilation, chest physiotherapy, nebulizer therapies, aerosol humidification, bronchoscopy or other upper airway endoscopy, tracheotomy, and open thoracotomy","Tran, Khai; Cimon, Karen; Severn, Melissa; Pessoa-Silva, Carmem L.; Conly, John",2012-04-26,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3338532/
