Nanoparticle Vaccines Against Infectious Diseases, Nanotechnology based formulations offer numerous advantages for the development of new generation vaccines,"Pati, Rashmirekha; Shevtsov, Maxim; Sonawane, Avinash",2018-10-04,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6180194/
Human monoclonal antibodies as candidate therapeutics against emerging viruses," Among these methods, large na√Øve antibody phage library-based technologies have enabled the rapid development of highaffinity hmAbs against emerging viral diseases that occur in an outbreak setting","Jin, Yujia; Lei, Cheng; Hu, Dan; Dimitrov, Dimiter S.; Ying, Tianlei",2017-11-20,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7088856/
Antibody therapies for the prevention and treatment of viral infections," One key challenge is the relatively small market for antibody treatments of viral diseases, and potentially higher cost associated with production of recombinant antibodies, as compared to small molecule antivirals","Salazar, Georgina; Zhang, Ningyan; Fu, Tong-Ming; An, Zhiqiang",2017-07-10,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5627241/
Molecular mechanisms for enhanced DNA vaccine immunogenicity,"Developments in next-generation sequencing, microarrays, and high throughput proteomics approaches now provide opportunity to identify additional potential molecular adjuvants for DNA vaccines","Li, Lei; Petrovsky, Nikolai",2015-12-28,http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc4955855?pdf=render
Monoclonal antibody-based therapies for microbial diseases, This combined with the relatively high costs of producing and delivering immunoglobulin therapies can make the market analysis of many reagents not economically viable,"Saylor, Carolyn; Dadachova, Ekaterina; Casadevall, Arturo",2009-12-30,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2009.09.105
Preparation of recombinant vaccines," The demand of vaccines including recombinant vaccines remains relatively modest as these biopharmaceuticals require relatively a high investment in research
Several systems are becoming efficient to produce large amount of recombinant proteins including vaccines
The different systems to produce recombinant vaccines Different systems are being implemented to produce recombinant proteins for experimental use or for biotechnological applications
 Apart from their use for basic studies, transgenic plants are increasingly used to improve food production","Soler, Eric; Houdebine, Louis-Marie",2007-12-31,https://doi.org/10.1016/s1387-2656(07)13004-0
