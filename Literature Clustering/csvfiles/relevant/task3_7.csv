Pathogen diversity drives the evolution of generalist MHC-II alleles in human populations," Clearly, future work should elucidate the evolutionary trade-offs between protection from pathogens and genetic susceptibility to autoimmune diseases","Manczinger, Máté; Boross, Gábor; Kemény, Lajos; Müller, Viktor; Lenz, Tobias L.; Papp, Balázs; Pál, Csaba",2019-01-31,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6372212/
Genetic susceptibility to infectious diseases: Current status and future perspectives from genome-wide approaches," Indeed, poor socioeconomic conditions represent a risk factor for several infectious diseases (Baker et al
 These data suggest that both immunological and carcinogenic factors contribute to the risk of cervical cancer development
 This exemplifies how the combined effect of genetic admixture and environmental factors has the potential to affect genetic associations","Mozzi, Alessandra; Pontremoli, Chiara; Sironi, Manuela",2018-12-31,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2017.09.028
Unifying Viral Genetics and Human Transportation Data to Predict the Global Transmission Dynamics of Human Influenza H3N2,"Our analysis reveals that many potential predictors of global influenza virus spread are not associated with viral lineage movement, specifically, geographical proximity, demography and economic measures, antigenic divergence, epidemiological synchronity and seasonality do not yield noticeable support (Fig","Lemey, Philippe; Rambaut, Andrew; Bedford, Trevor; Faria, Nuno; Bielejec, Filip; Baele, Guy; Russell, Colin A.; Smith, Derek J.; Pybus, Oliver G.; Brockmann, Dirk; Suchard, Marc A.",2014-02-20,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3930559/
Feature Selection Methods for Identifying Genetic Determinants of Host Species in RNA Viruses,"The identification of genetic markers predicting cross-species disease emergence faces many of the same challenges as genotypeto-phenotype mapping in other spheres, such as human genomewide association studies of risk factors for chronic diseases [13] ","Aguas, Ricardo; Ferguson, Neil M.",2013-10-10,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3794897/
Does genetic diversity limit disease spread in natural host populations?,"By reducing individual-level and population-level genetic heterozygosity, inbreeding can increase host susceptibility to infectious parasites (Dwyer et al","King, K C; Lively, C M",2012-06-20,https://www.nature.com/articles/hdy201233.pdf
