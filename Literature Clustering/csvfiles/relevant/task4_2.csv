Vaccines and Therapeutics Against Hantaviruses, Rabbits vaccinated with SNV DNA vaccine with muscle electroporation (mEP) produced increased neutralizing antibody titers,"Liu, Rongrong; Ma, Hongwei; Shu, Jiayi; Zhang, Qiang; Han, Mingwei; Liu, Ziyu; Jin, Xia; Zhang, Fanglin; Wu, Xingan",2020-01-30,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7002362/
Antibody-dependent NK cell degranulation as a marker for assessing antibody-dependent cytotoxicity against pandemic 2009 influenza A(H1N1) infection in human plasma and influenza-vaccinated transchromosomic bovine intravenous immunoglobulin therapy," Influenza passive immunotherapy treatments include use of convalescent plasma, hyperimmune immunoglobulins, or monoclonal antibody therapies
 Using our assay and assessing an influenza-vaccinated Tc bovine IVIG therapeutic, NK cell degranulation was specific for virally-infected cells and demonstrated a high titer of NK degranulation antibodies (1:5000)","Morrison, Brian J.; Roman, Jessica A.; Luke, Thomas C.; Nagabhushana, Nishith; Raviprakash, Kanakatte; Williams, Maya; Sun, Peifang",2017-10-31,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2017.06.007
