Public Perception on Healthcare Services: Evidence from Social Media Platforms in China,"Social media has been used as data resource in a growing number of health-related research. The objectives of this study were to identify content volume and sentiment polarity of social media records relevant to healthcare services in China. A list of the key words of healthcare services were used to extract data from WeChat and Qzone, between June 2017 and September 2017. The data were put into a corpus, where content analyses were performed using Tencent natural language processing (NLP). The final corpus contained approximately 29 million records. Records on patient safety were the most frequently mentioned topic (approximately 8.73 million, 30.1% of the corpus), with the contents on humanistic care having received the least social media references (0.43 Million, 1.5%). Sentiment analyses showed 36.1%, 16.4%, and 47.4% of positive, neutral, and negative emotions, respectively. The doctor-patient relationship category had the highest proportion of negative contents (74.9%), followed by service efficiency (59.5%), and nursing service (53.0%). Neutral disposition was found to be the highest (30.4%) in the contents on appointment-booking services. This study added evidence to the magnitude and direction of public perceptions on healthcare services in China's hospital and pointed to the possibility of monitoring healthcare service improvement, using readily available data in social media.","Investigating public perception of healthcare services from different perspectives may generate inconsistent results. For example, patient-initiated violence against health workers [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] , and the tension between doctors and patients for their dissatisfaction with the quality of healthcare [7, 8] , were wildly covered in the Chinese media. While patient experience surveys on the national level showed that patients were generally satisfied with both in-patient and out-patient services [9] . Such differences may result from biases rooted in the survey and media coverage; however, the inconsistency also pointed to the need for additional data sources to monitor public opinions on Chinese healthcare services.

It has been suggested that social media might be such a data source. Rozenblum et al. pointed out that when patient-centered healthcare, the internet, and social media were combined, the current relationship between healthcare providers and consumers might face major changes-thus creating a ""perfect storm"" [10] . Users' posts on the social media platforms would generate a large volume of real-time data regarding public or private issues, among which healthcare related information scatters. Therefore, the utilization of social media data for healthcare research becomes a dramatically growing field and already covered various medical and healthcare research fields [11, 12] . Sinnenberg and colleagues proposed four ways in which social media data were used in healthcare studies:

(1) content analysis, (2) volume surveillance of contents on specific topics, (3) engagement of users with others, and (4) network analysis of users [12] . For the content analysis, most studies focused on measuring public discussion on specific diseases [13] [14] [15] , sentiment analysis for medical interventions (e.g., cancer screening) [16, 17] , identifying safety concerns among health consumers [18] , detecting adverse events of health products [19, 20] . Several researchers studied patient experience, based on the comments posted by patients from online health communities in China [21, 22] , but few studies have been conducted to gather information on healthcare services related topics using social media data. Meanwhile, although sentiment analysis has been wildly applied to process user sentiments associated with health-related text [23] , the lexical resource and tools designed for doing health-related sentiment analysis in Chinese language are few and far between. Fast-advancing in technology and economy, social media users and their activities spiked in China, which made social media a promising source for healthcare service monitoring. In China, the internet penetration rate reached 55.8% at the end of 2017 [24] , with local providers dominating the market, rather than Facebook and Twitter, which are not accessible in China. Chinese social media sites have a unique landscape, and it may not only be used as a communication software but also as an entry point for information. As subsidiaries of Tencent Holdings Limited, Shenzhen, China, WeChat and Qzone are two leading social media and networking services platforms. Each of them reached more than 938 million and 632 million monthly active user accounts in the first quarter of 2017 [25] . According to the 2016 WeChat Data Report, typical users of WeChat were born in the 80s or 90s [26], representing a wide breadth of demographic group in China. Besides providing multimedia communication and supporting social networking, WeChat also has ""Official Accounts"", which serve as channels for publishing articles to the public. Any individual or organization can apply for having their own official account to broadcast their ideas and believes. As for Qzone, it is a platform bundled with QQ, a popular online messaging application in China. Qzone allows users to create their own personal page to write blogs and post updates. And users could be able to express their individual opinions and attitudes freely and instantly on the social media platforms. Subject to the platforms' terms of service and privacy policy agreed upon by users [27, 28] , three kinds of information were collected, stored, and used by the platforms: (1) Personal information;

(2) non-personal information; and (3) shared information. The shared information refers to information that is voluntarily shared on the platforms by users freely and instantly, thus providing a valuable perspective and opportunity to gather public opinions on healthcare services.

As such, we selected WeChat and Qzone as the social media platforms to conduct this exploratory study. The objectives of this study are to conduct volume and sentiment analyses base on the extracted social media contents on hospital healthcare services. The study could demonstrate the social media users' perceptions of hospitals healthcare and may shed light on the further utilization of social media as a data source for healthcare research in China.

This study consisted of three phases. Firstly, we utilized a predefined list of healthcare services categories to devise key words and search strategies accordingly. The data searching strategy would then be used to extract contents from a raw database, which contained publicized posts of WeChat and Qzone. The extracted materials were then put into a corpus. Secondly, we applied natural language processing (NLP) techniques from Tencent NLP platform to the corpus and calculated the volume of content concerning different healthcare services topics. Thirdly, we conducted sentiment analysis to explore the sentiment polarity of Chinese social media users on different healthcare service topics. The detailed process of data collection and analysis is presented in Figure 1 

The raw databases used for this study come from WeChat and Qzone of the version only operated in mainland China. The user volumes and data inclusion criteria of the platforms were showed in Table 1 . Publicly available posted information such as: posted blogs, reviews and articles that are voluntarily shared by individual users from June 2017 to September 2017 were collected from the two platforms. The data collection followed the privacy policy for users of Tencent and was subject to the confidentiality and security measures that implemented by the platforms. And the data analyses were supported by technicians in the Tencent. 

The nine healthcare service categories, used in this study, were derived from the objectives of the National Healthcare Service Improvement Initiative (2015-2017), which was dedicated to improving patient-centered healthcare and patient experience nationwide by the former National Health and Family Planning Commission of P.R. China (NHFPC) [29] . The initiative operated under the leadership of the Bureau of Medical Administration of NHFPC [30] , which suggested that we used nine predefined categories to reflect the healthcare services in hospital (see Table 2 ). Table 2 . Healthcare services categories and corresponding descriptions in the National Healthcare Service Improvement Initiative 2015-2017 (NHSII).

Objectives of NHSII

Optimize the layout of the facility and build a friendly service environment Appointment-booking service Promote utilization of clinical appointment services and guide patient flow Service efficiency Improve service efficiency and effectiveness by rational allocation of resources Information technology Take advantage of information technology to improve patient experience Inpatient service Promote inpatient service process reengineering and provide integrated healthcare service Nursing service Continuously improve quality of nursing care and enhance nursing workforce Patient safety Ensure patient safety by promoting adoption of standard operating procedures Humanistic care

Strengthen humanistic care and provide medical social worker service Doctor-patient relationship Harmonize the doctor-patient relationship and reduce medical disputes

In this study, we constructed a healthcare services corpus, in the Chinese language from the social media data source, to enable further analyses. First, we constructed lexica of keywords and terms in accordance with the predefined service topics. For example, the lexicon for ""Information technology"", used in this study indicate new information dissemination channels, based on information technology provided by hospital to improve patient experience of service information acquisition. And this lexicon contains six information technology service-related terms, namely, ""Weibo"", ""WeChat"", ""website"", as well as ""Self-service machine"". Second, we developed a set of searching strategy to extract the relevant data from the two sources based on the corresponding lexicon of topics. The entire list of search terms for each category and its corresponding searching strategy were provided in Supplementary  Table S1 . Finally, we applied the search strategies to the database of publicly posted materials to screen for posts related to the healthcare service categories to construct the corpus. The search and screening process were performed by Qcloud.

Based on the healthcare services corpus, we classified the content to different healthcare services topics that predefined and measured the content volume of the topic. Specifically, we used the open application programming interface (OpenAPI) services provided by Tencent NLP to analyze the retrieved contents. It is an open platform for Chinese natural language processing (based on parallel computing and distributed crawling system) [31] . Such services enable us to split reviews and blogs into sentences, and each sentence was filtered to classify whether it contained target service topic keywords and terms. If the sentences, containing certain keywords and terms, belonged to the corresponding topic of healthcare services categories as listed in Table S1 , then they would be divided into a certain category. By counting the appearances of each service topic keywords in terms of the number of sentences in the corpus, we can aggregate the counts at the topic level and calculate the proportion of different topics from the social media corpus. For the sentiment analysis tool in Chinese, we also select Tencent NLP, as its algorithm was trained by hundreds of billions of entries of internet corpus data in Chinese and with successful application in other Tencent products (https://nlp.qq.com). OpenAPI with function of Chinese batch texts automatic summarization and sentiment analysis of Tencent NLP enable us to categorize the sentences on certain topic in the social media corpus into a sentiment polarity classification (i.e., neutral, positive, and negative). Finally, each sentence was tagged and classified into different sentiment polarity.

The social media corpus contained approximately 29 million records from WeChat and Qzone, spanning the 9 pre-defined categories, related to hospital healthcare services. Table 3 presents the content volume of each healthcare services topic by social media channel. Among the social media content on healthcare services topics, patient safety was the most commonly encountered topic, both in WeChat and Qzone. The majority of the content related to patient safety issue, its approximately 8.73 million records and covered 30.1% of the entire corpus. The proportion of contents related to other topics varied in the corpus: Information technology (22.2%), service efficiency (17.9%), service environment (10.3%), inpatient service (9.6%), appointment-booking service (3.4%), nursing service (2.5%), doctor-patient relationship (2.5%), and humanistic care (1.5%). 

The results of the sentiment analysis of contents from the corpus found that, in all nine healthcare services topics, 36.1% of the contents in the corpus have been recognized to reveal a positive disposition, 16 .4% neutral and 47.4% negative. We found that topic comprising most positive contents was service environment (59.6%), followed by patient safety (53.2%). With regard to the topics that contained more negative contents than positive, the most one was doctor-patient relationship (74.9%), followed by service efficiency (59.5%), and nursing service (53.0%). Notably, over one third of contents in the appointment-booking service (30.4%) revealed a neutral disposition.

Additionally, in contrast to the content volume distribution for the nine topics, the sentiment disposition of contents in corresponding healthcare services topics shows differences. For instance, Table 3 shows that the nursing service and doctor-patient relationship share an equal proportion (2.5%) of contents in the corpus, however, we observed the disposition of contents from social media users to the two topics varied in Figure 2 . 

To our knowledge, this is the first study that has attempted to explore the public perceptions of healthcare services, using publicly posted materials, of two Chinese social media platforms. Our results showed that patient safety was the most significant topic for users of Chinese social media platforms, followed by information technology and service efficiency. Service environment was found to have the highest proportion of positive comments.

The research assessed the application of content volume calculation and sentiment analyses on Chinese social media data. The study is a crucial step to discovering the methodology on harnessing the social media data in China and an early attempt to track the perceptions of healthcare services in the public by analyzing a unique data source.

This study found a large number of information technology and service efficiency, which might reflect the series of efforts made by both the government and the hospital in integrating information technology in healthcare services in China. Several researchers have identified that health information technology services were used to enhance patient experience [32] [33] [34] , and as a potential solution to shorten the lengthy waiting time in China's public hospital [22, [35] [36] [37] .

Humanistic care was the least mentioned topic in the corpus complied by this study. It may suggest that Chinese social media users are not very familiar with the idea of humanistic care. Those who posted about it basically expressed a positive attitude. An alternative explanation might be this type of care has yet to reach the public only experienced by a few people. Further empirical studies or controlled studies may be conducted to provide further insights.

Our research also explored the sentiment disposition of social media content on healthcare services: 47.4% provided negative feedback. Although this was only the initial results, it could be quite alarming to healthcare administrations and policymakers. Despite the fact that patient surveys generally had favorable results in China [9] , there was still a significant amount of negative comments

Although this was only the initial results, it could be quite alarming to healthcare administrations and policymakers. Despite the fact that patient surveys generally had favorable results in China [9] , there was still a significant amount of negative comments on the social media platforms. Further and more detailed methodology is necessary to further understand the negative comments.

In the 9 topics investigated in this study, we found huge variations in the negative feedback as well as content volumes across topics. For instance, the contents related to doctor-patient relationship only take percentage of 2.5% in the corpus, however 74.9% of the content revealed negative feedback. The varied sentiment polarity distribution of the topics may have important policy implications for healthcare reform in China. For example, 30.4% of the social media references to appointment-booking service reflected neutral feedback, which may suggest that the unsureness of the public on this novel service.

Patients have yet to be familiar with the services-even though it certainly aims to improve the convenience for patients as well as hospital efficiency. Such feedback could be essential for hospitals to improve their service quality by enhancing patient education. Further research might focus on what exactly were discussed in those negative posts so that targeted measures can be employed by the hospitals and responsible administrators to improve the services.

In line with previous evidence [11, 12] , our results show that social media could be a useful tool for health research in China, as well as English, and could be used to capture the public's perspective of healthcare [23, 38] . However, it appeared that the most concerned issue of healthcare in social media is different from what has been found in patient surveys. Findings from a recent qualitative study found that patients cared about the environment and facilities in hospital the most [39] , whereas in our study patient safety issues had the greatest volume. Another research examined the online doctor reviews in China revealed that most posts expressed positive attitudes towards the physicians [21] . Although the evidence on these issues are still not conclusive, it might suggest the perception difference between general public and patients.

Our research extends application of the natural language processing techniques to analysis of healthcare services related contents in China's social medial platforms and offers a new perspective of healthcare services in China's hospital. The results would be of benefit to healthcare providers and regulators benchmarking their performance on patient-centered healthcare delivery. This is important because the social media has been considered as a portal of health information acquisition for Chinese netizens [40] , the perspective of social media would be supplementary in understanding how consumer views the healthcare services in hospital besides the results from traditional paper-based surveys.

This study has the following limitations. First, because the raw material was user-generated data, selection bias may have affected the data. For example, it was observed that most social media users were born in the 80 s or 90 s [26], however we were unable to characterize the users social-demographic information in detail, since the user privacy policy of Tencent currently prohibit such practice. Moreover, considering the exploratory nature of the study, our study focused only on WeChat and Qzone as data sources, whereas other social media platforms in China may have the potential to conduct such analyses as well.

Second, since we derived the healthcare services categories and lexica based on the government document on NHSII and expert consultation, thus the corpus in this study may have failed to include certain amount of healthcare services related data. As a result, we may have underestimated the content volume of healthcare services from the two social media platforms. Furthermore, although all the material in the databases are in Chinese, and therefore most likely be generated by users from China, we are currently not able to determine whether the posts, containing the key terms on healthcare, were describing the Chinese healthcare system or discussing foreign healthcare systems in Chinese language. Further research may strive to develop searching strategies that enable such distinction and increase the specificity of the results.

Third, although the consumer health vocabulary (CHV) is the gold standard reference for retrieving the target data, it has been used in previous researches [13, 38] , such open source of vocabulary list and its corresponding lexica are not available in Chinese language. The accuracy and credibility of the sentiment analysis of this study also await further validation; however, it would require an alternative method to conduct sentiment analyses for Chinese language and the possibility to apply such methods on the Tencent data, which were publicly posted material but still under strict terms of utilization. Another limitation concerned that we have no ability to confirm that the data supplied by Tencent completely represent all users' data as there could be undocumented keyword filter on the platforms. These would inflict potential bias and limit the generalizability of our findings.

Weibo is another popular Chinese social media platform considered to be the counterpart of Twitter in China. Future research could consider extend the analysis process to contents from Weibo, to further explore users, and their views, that have not been covered in this study.

Both the quantitative approach, as shown in our research, and the qualitative approach, such as the face-to-face individual interview method, would be useful to better understand consumer care in healthcare services. There is a scarcity of empirical research exploring the latter issue at present. It has been proposed to complement public perspectives on healthcare services [39] .

Furthermore, the popularity of consumers' unsolicited comments on healthcare providers in social media, prompts an important avenue for understanding patient experience, and has been demonstrated by previous researches [38, [41] [42] [43] [44] . Future research for measuring patient experience based on social media data at hospital level would be help to better understand the landscape of healthcare quality in China.

By analyzing shared information from WeChat and Qzone, this study showed that patient safety was the most concerned topic for users of Chinese social media platform, followed by information technology and service efficiency, while the doctor-patient relationship was found to have the highest proportion of negative comments. This study explored the possibility of utilizing social media to monitor public perceptions on healthcare services. The findings provide an overview of public opinion on healthcare services, which could help regulators to set up the benchmark, on a national or regional level, to monitor the progress of healthcare improvements between comparator districts and services domains. It is also a necessary complement to the traditional paper-based consumer survey. The potential differences between social media perception and traditional consumer survey results would help regulators better understand the gap in quality of care services from various perspectives. Further studies could also focus on extending the NLP method to a more content-based resource and to expand our understanding of mass opinion on healthcare services.

Collaborative accountability for sustainable public health: A Korean perspective on the effective use of ICT-based health risk communication,"The sustainability of public health practices requires collaboration between the government and its citizens. On the government's side, social media can provide a conduit for communicating health risk information in an effective and timely fashion, while also engaging citizens in informed decision-making. On the citizen's side, information communication technology (ICT)-based practices cannot function unless citizens recognize and act on their responsibility to actively engage with government social media platforms. Despite an increasing interest in understanding the adoption of ICT practices and e-government services for health risk communication, there remains a crucial need for a comprehensive framework to explain which factors determine citizen use of digital government resources. The purpose of this study is to investigate how to increase government accountability for motivating citizens to engage in ICT-based health risk communication, thereby attaining sustainable public health practices through collaborative governance.","The sustainability of public health practices requires collaboration between the government and its citizens. On the government's side, social media can provide a conduit for communicating health risk information in an effective and timely fashion, while also engaging citizens in informed decision-making. On the citizen's side, information communication technology (ICT)-based practices cannot function unless citizens recognize and act on their responsibility to actively engage with government social media platforms. Despite an increasing interest in understanding the adoption of ICT practices and e-government services for health risk communication, there remains a crucial need for a comprehensive framework to explain which factors determine citizen use of digital government resources. The purpose of this study is to investigate how to increase government accountability for motivating citizens to engage in ICT-based health risk communication, thereby attaining sustainable public health practices through collaborative governance.

By integrating trust and health risk information into the e-government adoption model (GAM), this research examines factors that influence citizens' likelihood of using government social media resources. Survey data from 700 Korean citizens were analyzed using structural equation modeling. The results indicated that individuals with higher social media competency are more likely to (a) seek risk information through social media and (b) perceive the government's social media sites as easy to use. Consistent with the GAM, intentions to use the government's social media sites for information and interactions appear to increase as citizens perceive more value in using them regarding information quality, ease of use, functional benefit, and security. Furthermore, perceived trust in the government's social media resources appears to function as a mediator of this process. Initial trust in the government is an important determinant of perceptions of its digital resources. Citizens who trust the government tend to evaluate new initiatives positively and are more likely to accept and make use of them.

The results of this study can inform policy design and implementation by elucidating the mechanisms that determine citizens' adoption and usage of digital government services. Theoretically, this work expands the GAM to include health risk communication and adds empirical evidence to the small yet growing body of knowledge of e-government initiatives. These findings also highlight the importance of public trust in the government, as this encourages citizens to seek health risk information and assistance from the government. Overall, the data and model generated in this investigation represent an important step toward the successful and sustainable modernization of public services.

Information-communication technology (ICT) can help governments and their citizens collaborate toward achieving sustainable public health practices. While public health is simply a collection of individual citizens' health, it can be influenced by, mental and physical, individual and collective, and social and environmental factors. For example, maintaining physical health begins with an individual's mental awareness of hygienic concerns; however, individual awareness alone is insufficient. This is because even an individual citizen's health https://doi.org/10.1016/j.giq.2018.12.008 Received 6 March 2018; Received in revised form 7 December 2018; Accepted 30 December 2018 citizens' decision-making in terms of adopting a new technology-driven government system, such as public health risk communication, on government social media sites.

On the one hand, this research provides a blueprint and directions for what determines citizens' participation in and collaboration with government's public health risk communication on social media sites, which may inform researchers, policymakers, and public officials of critical determinants that affect the cognitive, affective, and conative aspects of citizen's willingness to use government-led ICT services and solutions. On the other hand, this research offers managerial insight into how governments can be more accountable and better help citizens fulfill their responsibility using ICT-based health risk communication. Taken together, these efforts facilitate sustainable public health practices in the social media-based public governance era. Given the rapid proliferation and widespread use of social media by government agencies, this study illustrates which policy instruments and transformation strategies should be implemented both by the governed and those governing to enhance public accountability and the effective governance of health risk communication in this new ICT-driven governance ecosystem.

Toward this end, South Korea represents a well-suited study site because the Korean government has committed to developing citizencentered and public value-based e-government and collaborative governance using innovative ICT policies and services in the 4th industrial revolution (Eom & Kim, 2014; Sohn, 2017) . Moreover, most of the Korean public health agencies and government healthcare organizations already heavily use social media platforms, apps, and networks as cost-effective and convenient means toward spreading information, practices, and solutions concerning personal and community health initiatives since the 2015 Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) outbreak in South Korea. Therefore, this locale and its government serve as the foundation for the present investigation into the design and implementation of effective, sustainable ICT practices using social media in the public health sector.

""Accountability underpins civilization"" (Donahue, 2002, p.1) . As long as a service is called ""public"" and is provided by the government, like social media-based health information provision, it is accompanied by the concept of accountability, which assumes a ""principal-agent"" relationship. Although there are numerous definitions of accountability, we can generally agree, ""Accountability is about explanation and justification to a forum with the possibility of sanctions as a result"" (Hughes, 2012, p.187) . Accountability is the ""relationship between an actor and a forum, in which the actor has an obligation to explain and to justify his or her conduct, the forum can pose questions and pass judgment, and the actor may face consequences"" (Bovens, 2007) . Following this definition, the actor is an individual or organization, and the forum is individual or institution; the obligation is formal or informal, and the questions and judgment lead to either a negative or a positive consequence.

Comparing the two similar concepts of responsibility and accountability, Mosher (1968) described objective responsibility as ""the responsibility of a person or an organization to someone else, outside of self, for something or some kind of performance. It is closely akin to accountability or answerability,"" (p.7) and subjective responsibility as feeling responsible and behaving responsibly in a cultural and social context. Hughes (2012) differentiated between accountability and responsibility using organizational hierarchy. He argued that a staff member is accountable to a superior, whereas every superior is responsible for the actions of his or her subordinates. In sum, despite the various attempts to distinguish between accountability and responsibility, their differences are not always clear, and the two terms are often interchangeable. Still, the common argument on accountability prescribes the existence of at least two parties, in which one party expects the other to act beneficially and to not do something harmful (Hughes, 2012; Mulgan, 2000; O'Loughlin, 1990; Romzek & Dubnick, 1994; Saltzstein, 1992) .

Citizens should (and want to) be protected from health risks. However, who is accountable for public health? Based on the condition of accountability, individual citizens are socially responsible and accountable to one another, because everyone is closely connected to and influenced by each other's health. We are all expected to maintain our health. Otherwise, we place the burden of caring for ourselves onto others. In other words, public health has an aspect of externality. Citizens should protect themselves from health risks, both individually and collectively. However, because of the externality of the health problem, citizens also empower and require the government to protect them from health risks through public health policies.

Using social media as a communication platform is one way that government fulfills its accountability for public health (Graham et al., 2015) . Governments are supposed to satisfy four types of accountability (Romzek & Dubnick, 1987; Romzek & Ingraham, 2000) : (1) hierarchical accountability to obey organizational directives; (2) legal accountability to comply with external mandates; (3) professional accountability to defer to individual judgment and expertise; and (4) political accountability to be responsive to key external stakeholders. Among the four, public sector reform has placed great emphasis on professional and political accountability (Romzek, 2000) . Regarding public health, governments are accountable for providing risk communication to more citizens, for example, in this day and age, by using ICT. Simply put, citizens and governments have their own accountabilities regarding the mitigation of public health problems.

Citizens and governments often collaborate in order to get more or better policy resources and outcomes such as information, legitimacy, and productivity (Donahue & Zeckhauser, 2011) . To facilitate this collaboration, governments can use various forms of communication with its citizens: unilateral informing, bilateral consultation, involvement, collaboration, and empowerment (IAP2, 2007) . Specifically, ""collaborative governance"" is often referred to as a special form of the principal-agent relationship in which the government acts as the principal and private players (e.g., contractors or volunteers) act as the agent (Donahue & Zeckhauser, 2011) . However, the concept of collaborative governance is insufficient to describe the collaboration between governments and citizens, because their roles are often mixed between principal and agent. Collaboration in the ""agency relationship"" (Hughes, 2012) rather implies a mutually accountable relationship between citizens and governments.

In the context of health, how are risks assessed and addressed? Generally speaking, risks are managed by following a prescribed process (Crouhy, Galai, & Mark, 2006 ) that includes the following steps:

(1) identify the problem or risk exposure; (2) measure and assess risk exposure and its effects; (3) find and evaluate instruments and facilities to shift or trade risks; and (4) form and adopt risk mitigation strategies to avoid, transfer, and contain the risks. In health risk management, there is a spectrum of citizen participation (Donahue & Zeckhauser, 2011) . Examples include (1) enabling patient and family decisionmaking, (2) enabling community decision-making, (3) encouraging public work such as volunteer coordination, (4) gathering input and data on health, (5) connecting and sharing networks, and (6) disseminating health information.

In combining the discussion above of accountability and risk management, one can identify several challenges regarding citizen accountability in public health. The first challenge is the citizens' selfprotection. Every citizen is expected to have a sense of responsibility toward him-or herself, as well as toward the community; this responsibility should lead to health risk information-seeking behavior (Lee, Hoti, Hughes, & Emmerton, 2015; Medlock et al., 2015) . The second challenge is about the citizens' voice. Because of the externality of health problems, citizens usually shift the accountability of protecting themselves from health risks to their government. Furthermore, they want to (or should) keep interacting with their government to put their voices into policy (Barg et al., 2017; Li, Abelson, Giacomini, & Contandriopoulos, 2015) . The third challenge involves co-production between citizens and government. Citizens are increasingly becoming co-producers with their governments for public values (Alford, 2009) . When it comes to health risk communication using ICT, the citizens who use ICT media are expected to act (or be well prepared to act) as not only information recipients but also information producers or disseminators (Moorhead et al., 2013; Park, Reber, & Chon, 2016) . The fourth challenge concerns citizens' utilization of health-related services. No matter how good an ICT-based public service is, if citizens choose not to use it due to any number of reasons (e.g., ignorance, digital literacy, accessibility, service quality, trust, security concerns) the implementation of policy through this form of civic engagement would be far from successful.

ICT-based health risk communication systems operated by the government should meet the challenges above. With this in mind, the current study employed variables that help address the challenges, based on the theoretical lens of the e-government adoption model (GAM) that incorporates determinants of adopting ICT-based health risk services. In other words, these variables allowed us to explore the answer to the question: How can government better facilitate citizen accountability for public health? Additionally, this investigation considered the factors behind citizens' acceptance and adoption of ICTbased health risk communication services. The variables, theoretical rationales, and models are specified in the following section.

A tendency to seek risk information may lower barriers to adopting innovation for risk management purposes, as information seeking serves as a coping strategy for risk reduction (Golant, 2017; ter Huurne, Griffin, & Gutteling, 2009 ). Previous scholars have found that more exposure to medical information and health-related training leads to information seeking using various sources (Hall, Bernhardt, & Dodd, 2015; Kelly, Sturm, Kemp, Holland, & Ferketich, 2009; Kim & Kwon, 2010) . Furthermore, those with more sources of information reported higher levels of self-reliance when making health-related decisions (Hall et al., 2015) . Information-seeking behavior is part of the effort to cope with information insufficiency, which positively influences the adoption of new communication technology (Golant, 2017) . In other words, individuals with a higher tendency to seek information are inclined to seek more sources of information and try a communication tool that best fits their need for efficient information acquisition. Thus, we posit the following hypothesis: H1. Individuals with higher tendencies to seek risk information will be more likely to use the government's social media sites for (a) obtaining risk information and (b) engaging in interactions with the government for risk preparation. Shareef et al. (2011) proposed the GAM theoretical approach to explain and predict the adoption behavior of e-government services. Based on GAM, the present study considers the perceived ease of use as a perceptual determinant of adoption. Perceived ease of use was originally referred to as the perceived ability to use by Shareef et al. (2011) , but its conceptualization and operationalization when focused on perceptions of e-government websites is best described in terms of T.D. Lee et al. Government Information Quarterly 36 (2019) 226-236 ease of use. Thus, this study uses the modified concept of perceived ease of use instead of Shareef et al.'s (2011) original description. The easier and more effortless people perceive the use of a new technology to be, the more likely they are to use it (Davis, 1989) . A positive relationship between perceived ease of use and adoption behavior is well documented in the literature (Hung, Tang, Chang, & Ke, 2009; Ozkan & Kanat, 2011; Wirtz, Piehler, & Daiser, 2015) . Perceived information quality and perceived functional benefit are key factors that lead users to adopt ICT-based government services. These two concepts imply that people who believe new technology will provide useful information and help them complete tasks efficiently tend to accept the technology and make use of it (Shareef et al., 2011) . Perceptions of usefulness, regarding information quality and task completion, have been reported to play a considerable role in the adoption of information technologies (Oliveira, Faria, Thomas, & Popovič, 2014; Ozkan & Kanat, 2011; Wirtz et al., 2015) . Another important aspect of ICT-based services that encourages adoption behavior is the security of a system. Perceived security refers to the degree to which users perceive that a technology ensures the security of personal information and uses their information appropriately (Shareef et al., 2011) . Problems related to user privacy are considerable barriers that hinder the success of new information technology (Gilbert, Balestrini, & Littleboy, 2004) . Thus, security provisions should be ensured for citizens considering the use of ICT-based government services (Bertot, Jaeger, & Hansen, 2012) . The perception that a technology is secure and safe to use relates positively to the usage of that technology (Shareef et al., 2011; Venkatesh, Chan, & Thong, 2012) . Based on the theoretical background and empirical evidence discussed above, we hypothesize:

H2. Individuals with favorable perceptions of ease of use, information quality, functional benefit, and security will be more likely to use the government's social media sites for (a) obtaining risk information and (b) engaging in interactions with the government for risk preparation.

Social media competency is a prerequisite condition for seeking risk information from these sources (Cheng & Mitomo, 2017; Lallmahomed, Lallmahomed, & Lallmahomed, 2017; Wirtz et al., 2015) . By adopting the conceptualization of the internet's self-efficacy established by Eastin and LaRose (2000) , this study defines social media competency as the degree to which a person is confident in his or her ability to perform tasks on social media required to meet given communication goals. Previous research suggests that higher levels of social media competency lead to increased perceptions of usefulness and ease of use with a new application (Cheng & Mitomo, 2017; Slade, Dwivedi, Piercy, & Williams, 2015) . Thus, we propose the following two hypotheses:

H3. Individuals with higher levels of social media competency will be more likely to seek risk information using these platforms.

H4. Individuals with higher levels of social media competency will be more likely to perceive the government's social media sites as easy to use.

Trust in the government is an influential factor that encourages citizens to adopt online ICT-based government services because trust in the service provider serves as a contextual cue to assess the benefits and effectiveness of using a new application (Alsajjan & Dennis, 2010) . Lack of trust in the government hinders the adoption of e-government services by its citizens (Fakhoury & Aubert, 2015; Lallmahomed et al., 2017; Park, Choi, Kim, & Rho, 2015) . Increased trust in the government, however, leads citizens to perceive government services positively and thus bolsters faith in these services (Gefen, Karahanna, & Straub, 2003) . Trust in the services that the government offers on social media, in turn, is expected to promote intentions to use them for information acquisition and interactions with the government for better task achievement (Shareef et al., 2011) . This line of reasoning leads to the following hypotheses:

H5. Individuals with higher levels of trust in the government will be more likely to perceive the government's social media sites for risk preparation positively in terms of (a) ease of use, (b) information quality, (c) functional benefit, and (d) security.

H6. Trust in the government's social media sites will mediate the influences of perceptions of those sites (such as ease of use, information quality, functional benefit, and security) on intentions to use them for (a) obtaining risk information and (b) engaging in interactions with the government for risk preparation.

H7. Intention to use the government's social media sites for obtaining risk information will relate positively to one's intention to use the sites for engaging in interactions with the government for risk preparation.

The Korean government has been increasing its use of mobile devices (e.g., smartphones) and social media sites/platforms (e.g., Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Instagram) to enhance government information availability, provide innovative government services, strengthen the informed and dialogical relationships with the public for democratic practices and public value creation. Therefore, a variety of digital government services and smart technologies on public safety and healthcare promotion are fully generalized in Korean society (Korea Institute for Health and Social Affairs, 2012; Rana et al., 2017) . In this study, we employed a professional market research company specialized in panel data research on public health, public hygiene, and healthcare, in order to ensure the representativeness and validity of the study. The research company conducted quota sampling, based on the Korean Population and Housing Census 2017, and extracted 1050 respondents who have received or/and consulted the information on public health from the e-government services through government websites and smartphone application. As a result, this company recruited 1050 citizens based on their availability, not by exploiting screening questions. Among them, 700 participants answered the surveyan approximately 67% response rate.

The mean age of the participants was 42 years (SD = 12.1), and 355 of them were male (50.7%). More than half of the respondents held a bachelor's degree (51.6%) or higher (9.0%); the remaining participants had earned either an associate degree (16.6%,) a high school diploma (22.6%), or had completed a middle-school education (0.3%). Table 1 contains details on the sample population's characteristics.

Participants received an invitation through email to complete a survey at their convenience. The questionnaire began with demographic questions, such as sex and age. Respondents then answered questions that measured the study variables, including social media competency, risk information-seeking behavior, perceptions of the government's social media accounts and intentions to use them. The entire survey required approximately 20 min to complete.

The ability to use social media was measured using five items taken from Wirtz et al.'s (2015) Internet Competence Scale. All of the items in this study were rated on a 7-point Likert scale. The items were ""I feel confident when using social media and applications,"" ""I am comfortable when using social media and applications on my own,"" ""I am able to use social media and applications well on my own,"" ""I am able to use social media and applications even if there is nobody around to help me,"" and ""I feel confident and competent finding information by using search functions on social media"" (M = 3.59, SD = 0.79, α = 0.94) ( Table 2) . 

To measure citizen's trust in their government, we constructed an instrument based on previous research (Griffin et al., 2008; Lallmahomed et al., 2017; Park et al., 2015) . Eleven items were used for this measure, including ""I feel that the government does its best for people"" and ""I feel that the government performs its task with honesty and integrity"" (M = 2.78, SD = 0.77, α = 0.95) ( Table 2) .

Participants' risk information-seeking behavior was measured by six items (Griffin et al., 2008; ter Huurne et al., 2009) , including ""When the topic of health risks such as infectious diseases comes up, I try to learn more about the causes and preventive measures"" and ""When this topic comes up, I'm likely to tune it out"" (M = 4.70, SD = 0.61, α = 0.83) ( Table 3) .

To assess participants' perceptions of the ease of use of the government's social media sites, a seven-item scale was adapted from Shareef et al.'s (2011 ) GAM model. Shareef et al. (2011 developed this scale to measure ""perceived ability to use"" (p. 20), although the scale items focused more on perceived quality of the government's website than on perceptions of one's ability to use it. We modified this scale to measure perceived ease of use. For example, ""It is easy to find needed information on the government's social media sites,"" ""Interactions with the government through social media are clear and understandable,"" and ""The government's social media sites provide all relevant information necessary to fulfill my needs"" (M = 3.06, SD = 5.78, α = 0.85) ( Table 4) .

To assess perceptions of the quality of information provided on government social media sites, three items were adapted from Shareef et al. (2011) : ""Information provided at the government's social media sites is up to date,"" ""The government's social media sites provide accurate information about the services the government provides,"" and ""The government's social media sites provide information sequentially and systematically"" (M = 3.15, SD = 0.63, α = 0.80) ( Table 4) . Trust in the government (Griffin et al., 2008; Lallmahomed et al., 2017; Park et al., 2015) I feel that the government does its best for people. Table 3 Descriptive statistics and factor loadings for risk information seeking. 3.2.6. Perceived functional benefit To measure perceived functional benefit of using the government's social media to see health information, the following four items were used: ""The government's social media sites help accomplish tasks more quickly,"" ""It does not take too much time to seek service from the government's social media sites, as compared to traditional government service,"" ""Using the government's social media sites enhances overall efficiency,"" and ""Using the government's social media sites makes it easier to perform tasks"" (M = 3.37, SD = 0.63, α = 0.85). These items were also adopted from Shareef et al. (2011) (Table 4) .

Two items from Shareef et al.'s (2011) scale of perceived security were modified to assess how safe and secure participants feel when using the government's social media sites. Participants rated their agreement with each of the following items: ""The government's social media services are technologically stable"" and ""The government's social media sites have adequate security features"" (M = 3.06, SD = 0.66, α = 0.77) ( Table 4 ).

Perceptions of trust in the government's social media sites were operationalized as credibility and integrity of its social media services. Eight items were adapted from Shareef et al. (2011) , including ""The government's social media services are overall reliable"" and ""The government's social media sites take prompt action when I encounter health risk problems"" (M = 3.03, SD = 0.58, α = 0.90) ( Table 5) .

Based on Shareef et al.'s (2011) scale for the adoption of e-government services, we created six items to measure intentions to use the government's social media platforms for (a) obtaining information and (b) interacting with the government. These two types of adoption intentions were treated as separate variables in the data analysis, as they reflect different forms of communication. Obtaining information pertains more to one-way communication in which the government provides constant updates and relevant risk information using social media (e.g., progress on outbreak containment, availability of vaccines, and possible preventive measures) without receiving any feedback or inquiries from citizens. Interactions with the government describe the two-way communication that occurs through reciprocal dialogues such as commenting on social media posts, having live Twitter chats, and sending direct messages to ask and answer specific questions. Intentions to adopt information services were measured using three items, including ""To obtain information about health-related risks, I would use the government's social media sites"" (M = 3.19, SD = 0.72, α = 0.93). The other two items were used to assess intentions to adopt interactions, including ""To make a query, I would use the government's social media sites"" (M = 3.17, SD = 0.73, α = 0.92) ( Table 5) .

Cronbach's alpha tests for measurement reliability indicated adequate internal consistency among items for each variable, with an alpha value ranging from 0.77 to 0.95. A series of factor analyses also confirmed the reliability and validity of the measurement items. For each variable, all factor loadings were greater than a loading criterion of 0.40, ranging from 0.594 to 0.931 (Harlow, 2014) . Values for individual items that measured the same variable were averaged to create a scale score for data analysis.

We tested the proposed hypotheses (H1 -H7) using path analysis with structural equation modeling in IBM SPSS Amos 23. This approach is superior to running a series of regression analyses because it tests Table 5 Descriptive statistics and factor loadings for trust in government's social media sites and adoption intentions. The government takes full responsibility for any type of insecurity during interaction on social media.

Adoption intentions for information (Shareef et al., 2011) To search/obtain information about health-related risks, I would like to use the government's social media sites. presumed relationships simultaneously, instead of analyzing several causal paths individually, and controls for measurement errors (Zhao, Lynch Jr, & Chen, 2010) . A maximum likelihood estimation was used to obtain path parameters. We ran the initial path analysis, which allowed all variables to relate to all of the other variables. We then removed the insignificant paths from the model and some error variances were modified to co-vary according to the modification indices. These modifications were made one at a time while observing changes to the model fit indices and path estimates. After this model trimming, the goodness-of-fit indices indicated that the developed model fit the data well, χ 2 (16, N = 700) = 52.069, p < 0.001; CFI = 0.990, SRMR = 0.043, RMSEA = 0.057 (see Fig. 1 for the final path model).

According to Hu and Bentler (1999) , structural equation models are valid when the value of the Comparative Fit Index (CFI) equals or exceeds 0.95, the value of the Standardized Root Mean Square Residual (SRMR) is less than or equal to 0.09, and the value of the Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA) is less than or equal to 0.06. Models have an acceptable fit when they meet at least two of these criteria.

The results indicated that risk information seeking was positively associated with intentions to use the government's social media sites for information acquisition (β = 0.12, p < .01). There was no significant direct influence of risk information seeking on intentions to use the government's social media sites for interactions with the government for risk preparation. However, risk information seeking had a positive influence on use intentions for interactions with the government indirectly through use intentions for information acquisition (indirect effect = 0.06). These results support both H1a and H1b (see Table 6 for all direct and indirect effects in the final path model).

Higher perceptions of the ease of use of the government's social media sites resulted in stronger intentions to use those sites for obtaining risk information (β = 0.10, p < 0.05) and interacting with the government (β = 0.12, p < 0.001). Perceived functional benefit also had a direct influence on use intentions for information acquisition (β = 0.16, p < 0.001) and interactions with the government (β = 0.14, p < 0.001). The other two GAM-based variables -perceived information quality and perceived security -did not have a significant direct influence on the two types of use intentions but they appeared to indirectly affect both use intentions through perceived trust in the government's social media sites. Specifically, the indirect influences from perceived information quality on use intentions for information acquisition and interaction were 0.10 and 0.08, respectively. The indirect influences from perceived security were 0.14 and 0.11, respectively. These data serve to support H2a and H2b.

As expected, the results showed that social media competency was positively associated with risk information-seeking behavior (β = 0.27, p < 0.001). In other words, individuals who have more confidence in their abilities to use social media were more likely to use them to seek risk information. Social media competency also appeared to positively associate with perceptions that the government's social media sites are easy to use (β = 0.20, p < 0.001). Additionally, the results revealed that individuals with higher levels of social media competency found the government's social media sites provided benefits in terms of efficiency in completing tasks and finding information (β = 0.23, p < 0.001). These results support H3 and H4.

In support of H5, higher levels of trust in the government led to higher levels of all GAM-based variables: (a) ease of use (β = 0.58, p < 0.001); (b) information quality (β = 0.57, p < 0.001); (c) functional benefit (β = 0.42, p < 0.001); and (d) security (β = 0.51, p < 0.001). These results indicate that, if individuals perceive the government to be trustworthy, they also perceive its social media sites as being easy to use, providing accurate information about potential risks, improving the efficiency of task completion, and possessing adequate security features. These data support H5a through H5d.

Results revealed that perceived trust mediated the influence of site perception, which translated into the intention to use them for risk information acquisition and interactive communication with the government. Specifically, perceived ease of use (β = 0.22, p < 0.001), T.D. Lee et al. Government Information Quarterly 36 (2019) 226-236 perceived information quality (β = 0.18, p < 0.001), perceived functional benefit (β = 0.12, p < 0.001), and perceived security (β = 0.25, p < 0.001) had a positive impact on perceived trust in the government's social media sites. Perceived trust, in turn, positively influenced use intentions for information acquisition (β = 0.57, p < 0.001) and interaction (β = 0.15, p < 0.001). These results thus support H6a and H6b.

Intention to use government social media sites to obtain risk information positively related with use intentions of engaging in interactions with the government for risk preparation (β = 0.50, p < 0.001). This result indicates that individuals who intend to seek risk information using the government's social media resources (i.e., one-way communication) are more likely to adopt and engage in twoway communication with the government for risk management. Thus, H7 is supported.

The ICT-based communication of the public health risk can be successful and sustainable only when the government and the public, including general citizens, patients, care providers, etc., fulfill their accountabilities to engage with the system. While government accountability involves legal, bureaucratic, political, and professional characteristics, citizen accountability centers on deliberative and participative features in the policy process and governance. In other words, fulfilling accountabilities of both parties are complementary to each other. Citizens' active engagement enables citizens not only to acquire information regarding health, wealth, and well-being that is necessary for situational awareness and informed decision-making, but also enables these citizens to provide the government with ample means for better policy design and a provision of appropriate public services (Donahue & Zeckhauser, 2011) . Civic accountability for engagement with the government represents one of the best ways to create a networked community in which citizens feel supported, included, and confident to work toward sustainable development (Orr, Prugh, Renner, Seyle, & King, 2014) . In this respect, this study has identified guiding principles and determining factors behind both government' and citizens' involvement in sustainable public health governance using ICT systems, specifically government social media sites used for health risk communication services.

This study found that citizens are more likely to access and utilize the health risk information provided by the government, and to interact with government entities, when they feel competent in using ICTs, trust their governments, and perceive the system and services to be easy to use, qualified, beneficial, and secure. These findings indicate that understanding the user-oriented variables (e.g. social media competency and trust) and the system-oriented variables (e.g. perceptions of ICTbased government infrastructure and services) is important to facilitae the adoption of a government's digital services for health communication (Liu et al., 2014) . To this end, the primary role of public managers and policymakers is to keep pace with changes that are associated with sociological, psychological, and behavioral features of their end-users, and take these features into account in their ICT policies and e-government services.

Regarding public health risk communication, the government is required to incorporate these user characteristics, such as their technological competence, into the e-government platform. In a time of public health crisis, user-oriented functions may facilitate warning diffusion, situational awareness, informed dialogue, feedback loops, and remedial actions (Mergel, 2016; Zuiderwijk, Janssen, & Dwivedi, 2015) . This study also suggests that e-government practitioners can benefit from their digital communication platform by ensuring its timeliness, usefulness, easy-to-access features, and trustworthiness (Lin, Spence, Sellnow, & Lachlan, 2016; Savoldelli, Codagnone, & Misuraca, 2014) . Regarding the content, governments can identify the most suitable approaches to increase the usefulness of the messages and thereby mitigate public health risk by analyzing the types of information that citizens want or/and need, the preferred format, and the appropriate level of detail. Furthermore, it is important that such e-government services can prevent inaccurate, incomprehensible information, by monitoring the system and adopting filtering tools. As for social media channels, the public health risk communicators should engage in clear, balanced and beneficial approaches to deal with potential emotional responses of the public because social media is a personalized network with subjective norm-based communication infrastructures (Graham et al., 2015; Mergel, 2016) . Furthermore, our study highlights that the ICT competence level of target citizens is a crucial condition for the use of government social media services, which reveals the need to enhance the citizen's media literacy (Lallmahomed et al., 2017; Lin et al., 2011) . To this end, the government can develop various tools for public deliberation and participation, such as media literacy campaigns and project-based learning programs. Such policy measures and educational interventions can improve the overall level of informed preparedness and agile responsiveness of the citizens in case of health risk Ems, 2016) . In this regard, the government can fulfill sustainable health risk communication and management that is not only low-cost but also effective.

The research findings are consistent with previous literature (Dwivedi et al., 2016; Eom & Kim, 2014; Rana et al., 2017; Zuiderwijk et al., 2015) that emphasize the importance of building and maintaining the credibility and public trust of government. While the ICTbased communication practices of the public health risks are likely to encourage citizens' intention to collaborate with the government's efforts to deal with health risks, they can also reduce the spread of rumors and inaccurate information, namely, ""fake news,"" and instead, generate the positive effects of word-of-mouth communication.

This study provides meaningful implications, but its findings may be limited to the context of South Korea or other settings in which culture, political environment, and government systems are similar. To be specific, South Korea is well known for its high level of smartphone penetration, internet performance, and broadband network (Eom & Kim, 2014; Rana et al., 2017) . South Korea is also known for its hierarchical government communication structure, as well as its previous experiences regarding the health risks and the influence an outbreak can have on citizens' perceptions and actions toward government information and services during public health emergencies. Moreover, with their relatively high level of social media competency, the citizens of South Korea are cultivated to be the major users of government social media channels, (Kim, Yoon, & Jung, 2017) . Thus, it is necessary to be cautious and not to generalize and directly apply the findings of this study to other countries or settings. This limitation indicates the direction future studies should take.

Studies that analyze multiple countries and regional context can extend the validity and generalizability of this study's findings, which can broaden the horizon of scholarly understanding of citizens' information-seeking behavior in ICT-driven health risk communication (Dwivedi et al., 2016; Liu et al., 2014) . Moreover, such future studies will reveal the various practices and approaches of different governments, as well as their citizens' perceptions, which will offer valuable insights for both scholars and public managers in search of innovative methods to promote collaborative accountability in the digital era regarding ICT-based public health policy.

In addition, comparative and/or longitudinal studies that investigate whether the application of these health risk communication systems bring about similar or different outcomes will help to identify particular user segments and media contexts that have different behavioral patterns in e-government adoption . This will help to reveal the requisites and drivers for the adoption of egovernment services.

This study examined the factors that influence citizens' likelihood of using government social media resources in the context of public health communication. By integrating trust and health risk information into the e-government adoption model (GAM), we conducted survey with 700 Korean citizens and analyzed these data using structural equation modeling. The results indicate that individuals with higher social media competency are more likely to seek risk information through social media and are more likely to perceive the government's social media sites as easy to use. Our findings confirm that, with regards to the GAM, citizens' intentions to use these services increases if the services are perceived as more valuable. In addition, the perceived trust in the government's social media resources functions as a mediator of this process.

This study provides meaningful information regarding the current state of the literature and policy-makers. First, this work extends the GAM to the area of health risk communication, and adds empirical evidence to the knowledge of e-government studies. These findings also have useful policy implications. In particular, the data presented here reveal the importance of citizen engagement for sustainable public health communication; taking an initial step to empirically explore public health communication in the context of a digital government.

Crisis communication in context: Cultural and political influences underpinning Chinese public relations practice,"This study analyzes academic journal articles in order to depict the features of Chinese crisis communication in Mainland China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan. The findings revealed the following features of crisis communication in Chinese societies: collectivistic culture, nationalism, rationalism, face-giving/saving, striving for the ""golden mean,"" the preference for passive communicative strategies, and the avoidance of extreme strategies. Nevertheless, the differences in political systems-the ubiquitous intervention by authoritarian government on the Mainland, the mistrust of government in post-handover Hong Kong, and the relatively mature democratic polity in Taiwan all lead to unique crisis communication practices.","Much existing research analyzes the descriptive features of various crisis communication practices (e.g., Bradford and Garrett, 1995; Cancel, Cameron, Sallot, & Mitrook, 1997; Cho, 2005) and their effectiveness (Brown & White, 2010; Kim & Sung, 2014) . Though helpful, such research has been relatively inattentive to the contextual variables that determine specific practices, especially at the social, cultural, and cross-cultural levels. This has led to doubts about the applicability of crisis communicative strategies across cultures. Because Western cultural assumptions have shaped much research in the field of crisis communication, a revision of such assumptions is needed if the findings of public relations research in general (Pompper, 2005) and crisis communication in particular are to be more widely applicable. This paper addresses previous appeals for more culturally and contextually sensitive perspectives in crisis communication research (Avery, Lariscy, Kim, & Hocke, 2010) by investigating patterns of crisis communication as they have taken shape in three Chinese societies (Mainland China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan) . Along with Brazil, Russia, and India, China has one of the world's most rapidly developing markets. Its growing economy is creating new public relations opportunities within and outside its borders, thereby arousing worldwide interest in China's emergent engagement with the global economic sphere. In the first decade of the twenty-first century; however, China's economy faced several major crises. Some were explicitly economic, such as the Asian financial meltdown in 1998 and the WTO accession in 2001. Others affected the economy indirectly but with no less impact: bird flu outbreaks in 2001, SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) crises in 2003, the Wenchuan earthquake in 2008, and more recent food safety crises. Crisis management and crisis communication have therefore played a critical role in both the public and private sectors in contemporary China.

This study develops a holistic description of crisis communication in three Chinese societies by quantitatively and qualitatively analyzing the content of 93 academic journal articles published in 15 top journals in the field of communication research between 1999 and 2014. The following questions are addressed: which strategies were mobilized by an organization in response to the crisis? Can a universal practice of crisis communication be identified while remaining sensitive to distinct local contexts? Which crisis communication strategy works in one context but not in another?

Building upon crisis communication theory and practice, this study makes the following contributions: (1) detailed depictions of Chinese crisis communication in its native forms in Mainland China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan; (2) the illustration of complex interrelations between Chinese cultural traditions and their political contexts; and (3) the enrichment of current theoretical knowledge of global crisis communication through narrowly defined intercultural and cross-regional comparisons.

This section begins by defining the dominant theories of crisis communicative strategies (CCSs) before reviewing the variables that determine the effectiveness of Chinese crisis communication in its various forms.

Crisis communicative strategies (CCSs) are defined as verbal and nonverbal responses that an organization uses to address a crisis. William Benoit (1995) developed image restoration theory, which later became one of the most cited frameworks in crisis communication research. Benoit (1995) argued that an attack with two components (an offensive act and an accusation of responsibility for the action) threatens organizational or individual reputation, which in turn requires a crisis response strategy. The five main strategies in image restoration theory are (1) denial, (2) evasion of responsibility, (3) reducing the offensiveness of an event, (4) corrective action, and (5) mortification.

Situational crisis communication theory (Coombs, 2004) provides a comprehensive framework for effectively responding to crises. Coombs defines the following four categories of crisis response: (1) denial response, which includes three strategies: attack the accuser, denial, and scapegoat; (2) diminishing response, which includes excuse and justification; (3) rebuilding response, which includes compensation and apology; and (4) bolstering response, which includes reminder, ingratiation, and self-victimization. Huang, Lin and Su (2005) undertook a survey of PR managers from Taiwan in order to examine actual crisis-handling experiences. That study integrated categories of CCS (i.e., Bradford and Garrett, 1995; Coombs, 1995) on two over-arching continuums: defense-accommodation and specification-ambiguity. highlighted in particular the importance of strategic ambiguity for the Taiwanese, which they found to result from Chinese culture's emphasis on indirect communication (Gao and Ting-Toomey, 1998).

A number of other influential theoretical approaches have been applied to corporate crisis responses and their determining contextual factors (e.g., Bradford and Garrett, 1995; Cancel, Cameron, Sallot, & Mitrook, 1997; Cho, 2005) . In the existing literature, crisis type and the scale of the crisis event have been examined as variables that should help determine the appropriate response strategy (Cancel et al., 1997) . For example, many previous studies have grouped crises into major clusters or crisis types, such as the nature of the crisis (Lerbinger, 2001) , the locus of control and intention (Coombs, 1995 (Coombs, , 1998 (Coombs, , 2004 , and the severity of the crisis (Pearson and Mitroff, 1993) . Moreover, Pearson and Mitroff (1993) proposed a model consisting of four main crisis-management variables in respect to the nature of a crisis event: crisis types, crisis phases/stages, systems, and stakeholders. Coombs (1998) also emphasized the importance of perceived crisis responsibility and identified three elements shaping the perception of responsibility during a crisis event: the dimension of attribution, the history of organizational performance, and the severity of the crisis. Coombs (2004) further developed situational theory, which attempts to determine which crisis responses were appropriate for three different crisis clusters, i.e., victim crises, accidental crises, and preventable crises. This theory arrays CCSs according to levels of perceived crisis responsibility: the higher the level of perceived responsibility, the greater the reputational threat and the more accommodative CCSs should be.

Little attention, however, has been paid to contextual variables beyond crisis type/nature. Standing as an exception, Cancel et al. (1997) developed contingency theory for public relations and provided a variety of internal and external variables that influence organizational stances. External variables include industrial environment (e.g., level of competition), threats (e.g., government regulation and litigation), and external public characteristics (e.g., degree of source credibility and level of commitment). Internal variables include an organization's characteristics (e.g., open or closed culture and age of organization), public relations department characteristics, and individual characteristics (e.g., training in PR, personal ethics, etc.).

Going beyond variables at individual levels (Coombs, 2004) or organizational levels (Cancel et al., 1997) , our study emphasizes cultural and political influences at the societal level, which allows for a tighter focus on factors that influence CCSs and their effectiveness. In our study, Chinese cultural context is used to revisit current theories of crisis communication. Current theories of crisis communication are predominately applied to democratic societies, especially American society, where corporations, interest groups, and policy makers reach the public and influence their opinions by building mass media agendas (Berger, 2001; Cobb & Elder, 1971 ). However, Mainland, Hong Kong, and Taiwan have maintained different political systems since the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949. It is likely that these same democratic conditions for current crisis communication theories either manifest differently or are absent altogether in the three Chinese societies. A preponderance of current crisis communication theories presumes the social norms and individual psychological motivations of individualistic cultures. Chinese societies, by contrast, inherit a collectivistic rationality from Confucian culture (Child, 2008) . Based on this contrast, our study provides a correction of Western communication theories by examining them within the context of contemporary Chinese culture and politics.

Cultural and political factors are examined closely in this study insofar as they allow for a detailed characterization of the three Chinese societies that are its focus. The following section begins with a broad discussion of the Confucian tradition shared by Mainland China, Taiwan, and Hong Kong. It concludes with a description of the unique political systems of each region.

The culture of an organization's chief agents and primary stakeholders can have a long-lasting impact on its communication patterns. Consequently, Confucius's teachings, which have dominated Asian culture for centuries, provide a crucial cultural context for better understanding crisis communication practices in China.

Confucianism emphasizes hierarchical authority and justifies an unequal distribution of power and wealth. As a belief system, it has therefore been a powerful source of legitimacy for the upper classes of Chinese society. Authority, order, harmony, and the strict rules governing interpersonal relationships, all key concepts in the philosophy of Confucianism, help explain some of the nuances of communicative practice and public relations in the three regions examined (Sha and Huang, 2003) . For traditional, devout Confucian Chinese, both the universe and human societies are hierarchically structured. Five classes of superior roles or stations exist in this worldview. They are, in descending order of authority, heaven, earth, the emperor, parents, and teachers. In fact, each of these serve the role of ""father figure"" to all of the orders or roles beneath it, compounding the flow of force and authority in a single direction and structuring power relationships among people, as well as those between people and their social and natural environments, as inherently one-sided (Shih, 1988) . China is the ""under-Heaven"" and is governed by the emperor, the ""son of Heaven""; the subject masses are his Tzemin, or ""son-citizens"" (Shih, 1988) . The vestiges of this patriarchal political culture persist throughout modern Chinese society.

Mainland China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan maintain different political systems. The Chinese Communist Party has authoritatively assumed the reigns of Mainland government since 1949, whereas the political systems of Hong Kong and Taiwan have significantly transformed in the past decades.

2.3.2.1. China. According to Oksenberg (2001) , the current Chinese political system still reflects its Soviet or Leninist origins. In the 21st century, the most important organization in China remains the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). The CCP monopolizes political opinion (Chou, 2009 ). The central government maintains the power to intervene in the affairs of local governments, NGOs, and even corporations. Under this political system, several events have occurred that have had major impacts on communicative practice. First, the ""Opening Policy"" was enacted in 1978; since then, the Chinese economy has transformed into one of market-based socialism characterized by joint ventures and wholly foreign-owned enterprises that established their own communication and/or public relations departments in Mainland China (Wu, Lin, & Guo, 2001) . Second, a renewed economic reform policy, declared in the the 3rd plenary session of 14th CPC Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) in 1993, led the way to new business ventures in China, radically reorienting the country away from isolationism and towards its present, ongoing transformation into one of the largest economies in the world.

Chinese media have also developed rapidly over the past two decades. According to Chinese government reports, the number of Chinese newspapers increased tenfold between 1950 and 2000. Given these changes; however, it should be noted that the majority of mass media outlets in China still operate as organs of the CCP. The CCP exerts control over all media, not only state-owned media, which it uses for policing journalistic coverage of the regime and its official policies (Zhao, 2000) .

2.3.2.2. Taiwan. Considered by some as a renegade province of China, Taiwan has anointed itself as the legitimate heir of Chinese tradition and Chinese culture. Taiwan self-consciously views itself as taking a different path from that of the Mainland, both politically and economically. The Republic of China (ROC) was inaugurated on October 10, 1911, and the Nationalist government moved to Taipei from the mainland in 1949. In practice, the ROC was ruled by an authoritarian regime until the lifting of martial law on July 24, 1987. Today, the ROC has become a functioning democracy with rival political parties. This transformation of the political system in Taiwan triggered the liberalization of the media as well as the rapid development of professional communication and public relations practices during the 1990s (Wu et al., 2001) .

As a colony of the Great Britain, Hong Kong was under British control between 1842 and 1997. In postcolonial Hong Kong, the political system is based on the principle of separated powers shared by executive, legislative, and judicial branches. The power of Hong Kong's executive office is limited by its legislative and judicial offices, and vice versa. Hong Kong's government is one of classical republicanism, insofar as it is viewed as a representative system elected and watched over by its citizens. A series of reforms in Hong Kong started to reverse government's notorious reputation for corruption. Ordinary citizens mobilized to monitor the corrupt behaviors of civil servants. As a result, politicians in Hong Kong tend to be cautious about their connections with elite business people (Manion, 2004) .

Hong Kong's original population was formed by waves of migration from Guangdong Province in southeast China. The proximity of Hong Kong's residents to their home districts consequently made travel and communication relatively easy. Hence the closer social and economic ties and the greater general cultural continuity with home districts, which developed alongside Hong Kong's status as a port city. This unique set of close relationships, both with the Mainland and with foreign powers, effectively made Hong Kong the shared periphery of two far-flung world centers: Britain and China (Luk, 1991) .

To recap, this study aims to examine Chinese crisis communication through analysis of scholarly research agendas in order to reveal how CCSs interact with both culture and political regimes. Analyzing articles published in reputable journals provides an accurate depiction of the landscape of Chinese crisis communication by systematically scrutinizing the strategies that scholars have chosen to focus on. Moreover, the following assumptions ground our theory of Chinese crisis communication. First, a certain society's research agenda not only reflects its preference for theoretical attention in general (e.g., Neely, Gregory, & Platts, 1995) but also reflects and represents debates over existing theories (e.g., Guest, 1997) . Second, the status of a communication practice in a certain country or region also reflects its political and media systems, its level of economic development, and aspects of its cultural history (Grunig, Grunig, & Vercic, 1997) .

Cheney and Christensen (2001) suggested that the public relations profession struggles with democratic principles in cultures that are dominated by or biased toward corporatism. Likewise, Spicer (2000) questioned, ""does public relations serve moneyed interests to the exclusion of groups without substantial resources?"" (p. 124). Leitch and Neilson (2001) claimed that PR practice is enriched by public-centered views that counter exclusively organization-oriented perspectives. We adopted a similar analytical framework for our cross-study comparison: does the investigation reflect an organizational or a public perspective? Is the organization examined for-profit or nonprofit? Is the issue investigated related to corporatism and moneyed interests, or not? Further research questions guide the present study: RQ1: What temporal trends exist in Chinese crisis communication scholarship? RQ2: What patterns exist in terms of the crises examined by Chinese crisis communication scholarship? Are there any regional differences?

RQ3: What patterns emerge in the articles in terms of research perspectives (i.e., institution, media, and stakeholder) and types of focal institutions (governmental institutions, corporations, public organizations and others)? Are there any regional differences? Do the patterns reflect a balanced or imbalanced research agenda in Chinese crisis communication scholarship? RQ4: What are the typical CCSs examined in Chinese crisis communication scholarship? RQ5: Are there similarities and/or differences in the CCSs among the three Chinese societies? How do differences and similarities present themselves?

RQ6: Based on the findings of current research on Chinese crisis communication, how does the ""interaction"" among cultural traits combine with a dominant political system to shape crisis communication practice across three Chinese societies?

We used quantitative content analysis for research questions one through three to detect the existence of any patterns. Qualitative methodology (thematic analysis of each article) was used for research questions four through six to investigate possible causes of crisis situations when considering internal, external, and contextual variables that might influence an organization's uses of CCS (Cancel, Cameron Sallot, & Mitrook, 1997) . Fig. 1 illustrates the analytical framework of the current study.

This study utilized a meta-review to study the cultural contexts of crisis communication in Mainland China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan. One approach to meta-review analyzes the content of literature reviews on a certain topic from a certain perspective, such as systematic reviews (e.g., Egan, Tannahill, Petticrew, & Thomas, 2008) , narrative literature reviews (e.g., Egan et al., 2008; Weed, 2009) , and introductory reviews (e.g., Weed, 2009) . Another approach combines established research methods to investigate patterns in academic work on certain topics. This kind of meta-review can utilize quantitative content analysis/assessment (e.g., Ehrhardt-Martinez, Donnelly, & Laitner, 2010), qualitative content reviews (e.g., Ehrhardt-Martinez et al., 2010), or other methods. We adopted this second approach to meta-review in an attempt to map the field of Chinese crisis communication. Moreover, this paper engages with appeals for more methodological diversity in its combination of qualitative thematic analysis (Avery, Lariscy, Kim, & Hocke, 2010) with quantitative content analysis. In order to enhance the scope and applicability of our findings (Eisenhardt, 1989) , this study compared a number of different crises that occurred within a Chinese cultural context. Analysis of multiple case studies helps alleviate artificial impacts on each crisis situation and vastly strengthens the findings (Yin, 2009 ). All cases originated in Chinese societies but fall under different crisis types in various industries. This study conducted thematic analysis of the conclusions in each article in terms of the factors found to have influenced CCS.

Hong Kong and Taiwan are examined in view of the fact that their legal, political, and media systems are different both from each other's and from those of Mainland China. In essence, the multiple-case logic used in this study more closely resembles that of a quasi-experiment. Our results were found using a combined logic of literal replication (the observation of outcomes from similar events) and theoretical replication (the occurrence of dissimilar outcomes due to explainable causes of crisis situations).

In the interest of comprehensiveness, this study reviews various types of work (journal articles & book reviews) published in both English-and Chinese-language journals that studied crisis communication in the three regions (Mainland China, Taiwan, and Hong Kong) from two academic perspectives (public relations and communication). The criteria used for journal selection were high general reputation, a strong influence on Chinese communication research, and accreditation by way of inclusion in certain scholarly indices, such as the Social Science Index (SSCI), the Chinese Social Science Index (CSSCI), and the Taiwanese Social Science Index (TSSCI). We first looked at two major journals in the field of public relations: the In order to represent academic journals from Hong Kong, Communication and Society (TSSCI) was reviewed. 1 Titles of articles were queried with the key words ""crisis/crises,"" and abstracts were queried with the key words ""China/Chinese/Taiwan/Taiwanese/Hong Kong/Macau/Macanese"". Only articles focusing on crisis management were included in the final sample. Articles selected for analysis were published in 15 academic journals between 1999 and 2014. These articles focused explicitly on Chinese crisis communication. Initial keyword searches were conducted in January 2012; further keyword searches were conducted in October 2014. This yielded a total of 93 articles for analysis (56 in January 2012 and 37 in October 2014). 2

Three broad categories were used to code each article. The first category codes publication year and the name of the journal and Index (SSCI, CSSCI, and TSSCI) in which it appears. The second codes the study's research subjects, including crisis case, the focal region of the study (Mainland, Hong Kong, Taiwan, or multiple regions), research perspective (institutional, media, or other stakeholders), and the type of institution involved in the crisis (government, corporations, NGO, or other institutions). The third category codes the CCSs adopted. Huang, Lin, and Su (2005) provided the coding scheme for CCSs in this study. A chi-square test analyzed regional differences among the three Chinese societies. A statistical limitation of this study is the relatively small number of articles (N = 93), given that a larger sample size (N > 200) would have significantly improved the accuracy of estimates from a Chi-square test (Bearden, Sharma, & Teel, 1982) . Therefore we use the results of our Chi-square tests only to compare frequency distributions of variables across regions.

Two postgraduate students served as coders for the 56 articles collected at the first stage of our research. Each coder coded half of the sample (28 articles) independently. To test inter-coder reliability, 11 articles were randomly selected, representing 20% of the total. Using Holsti's (1969) method, the inter-coder reliability was 1.0 for general information (journal name, publication year, author, institution, case or no case), 0.96 for research subject (research focus, article perspective, type of institution, and crisis region), and 0.89 for crisis communication practice (type of CCSs). The overall inter-coder agreement was 0.94. Three postgraduate students coded the other 37 articles collected at the second stage (one coder remained from the first stage). Ten percent were randomly selected to test inter-coder reliability. Holsti's coefficients for the coding categories were all sufficient (above 0.90). The number of related articles published in CSSCI-listed journals significantly increased in 2008, peaking (n = 16) in 2013, in contrast to only three articles on this topic published before 2008. Of all articles examined, nearly half were published in CSSCI-listed journals (43%, n = 40), of which 17 articles came from Modern Communication, 15 articles from Journal of International Communication, and eight from Journalism Quarterly (Bimonthly). The result of our Chi-square test shows a significant preference of CSSCI journals for articles focusing on Mainland China ( 2 (4, N = 66) = 14.05, p < 0.01). Among the 93 articles analyzed, 55 (59%) concentrated on Mainland crisis events, 14 (15%) focused on Taiwan, and only five articles (5%) focused on Hong Kong. Twelve of the articles included multiple regions while seven did not single out any specific Chinese society. Although CSSCI-listed journals published more work on Chinese crisis communication than SSCI-listed journals, their attention to the topic lagged far behind the SSCI-listed journals. RQ2 asked if any pattern exists in the crises examined across the three Chinese regions. Our findings show that a casestudy approach dominated scholarship across all three regions. The result of the Chi-square test did not identify a significant regional difference in adopting case study approaches ( 2 (2, N = 74) = 3.12, p > 0.05). More than half (n = 53, 57%) of the 93 articles examined one or more crises. Among the three regions, Mainland crises were the major subject of examination. Fifty five articles (59%) concentrated on Mainland crises, 14 (15%) on Taiwan, and only five (5%) on Hong Kong. A second finding was that crises seemed not to be confined to one region. The scope of influence for crisis events was often trans-regional or even transnational. Among the 93 articles examined, eight articles conducted comparative or cross-regional studies. For example, Hsiang et al. (2011) analyzed a multinational corporation's handling of a crisis event in Greater China, the US, and Singapore. Finally, crises with severe damages or extensive impact prompted considerable academic attention. The 2003 SARS crisis (nine articles, 10%) and the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake (12 articles, 13%) are two examples.

Concerning RQ3, results showed that the focus on different perspectives (i.e., institution, media, and the public/other stakeholders) was asymmetrical. The institutional perspective was the dominant perspective examined in Chinese crisis communication studies over the past 16 years (48 articles, 52%), in contrast to the media perspective (26 articles, 28%), the public perspective (22 articles, 24%), and other perspectives (four articles, 4%). The result of our chi-square test did not show significant regional difference in the perspectives adopted ( 2 (4, N = 60) = 2.93, p > 0.05). 3 Although the institutional perspective was dominant across all three regions, studies on Mainland crisis communication paid more attention to the media perspective and the public perspective than those focused on Hong Kong and Taiwan. Among the articles on Mainland China that reflected an institutional perspective, 20 focused on governmental institutions (42%), in contrast to corporations (11 articles, 23%), public organizations (three articles, 3%), or others (eight articles, 9%).

Chinese crisis communication research particularly emphasized governmental perspectives. After 2003, governmental crisis communication became the main topic of Chinese crisis communication research in Mainland China (Meng and Qian, 2008) . This trend contradicts the recent call for more symmetrical research agendas that concentrate on non-institutional perspectives (Spicer, 2000) . Nevertheless, recent years have seen increasing academic attention paid to the public perspective, especially when those studies focused on crisis communication in Mainland China. Twenty out of the 22 articles in our sample that adopted the public perspective were published after 2010, and eleven of those focused on Mainland China. This could be the result of the digital transformation of Mainland Chinese society. Sina Weibo -the most widely used social media platform in China -was established in 2009, and social media have since proliferated throughout the Chinese population. Social media has empowered the public to proactively deal with crisis situations as a community (Luo & Jiang, 2014; Pang & Zhang, 2014) . More symmetrical research agendas might be expected in future scholarship on Chinese crisis communication, especially scholarship focused on Mainland China.

RQ4 asks which patterns of crisis communication, if any, exist in Chinese societies. Ultimately, 19% of our sample (18 out of 93 articles) used situational crisis communication theories 4 (Bradford and Garrett, 1995; Coombs, 1998) as an analytical framework in their studies. Of these, justification/reducing effectiveness was reported as the most frequently used crisis response (16/18, 94%). The second most frequently used strategy was denial (14/18, 78%), followed by correction (13/18, 72%), concession/mortification (12/18, 67%), and excuse (12/18, 67%). Moreover, attacking the accuser (3/18, 17%) and ""no comment"" (2/18, 11%) were also used. The findings suggest the limited adoption of western crisis communication theories by Chinese crisis communication scholarship. This may imply that Chinese crisis communication scholarship lags behind the general crisis communication research community. On the other hand, it may reflect the preferences of Chinese crisis communication scholarship for localized theoretical frameworks. We used qualitative analysis for the other articles related to crisis response strategies and found that the CCSs used most often were ""golden mean"" strategies, according with the tendency of Confucianism to promote harmony and highly contextual, indirect communication (e.g., Fang and Faure, 2011) .

RQ5 asks whether there are similarities or differences in CCSs among the three Chinese societies examined. Convergent findings across three societies were found to reflect certain Chinese cultural contexts: (1) asymmetric worldview (more specifically, the two chief strategies which reflect this worldview: ""covering up"" (Chen, 2008; Veil & Yang, 2012; Yu & Wen, 2003) and ""no comment/no response""); (2) the use of diversion or strategic ambiguity (Huang, 2006; Huang, Lin, & Su 2005; Lee, 2004 Lee, , 2009 Hsiang et al., 2011) ; and (3) avoidance of ""extreme"" tactics, such as attacking accusers and apologizing to the public.

Covering up is a prominent strategy in Mainland China. This strategy includes other sub-strategies, such as prohibitions on reporting, deception, and the strategy of giving no comment/response. On one hand, government officials tend to cover up crises perceived as threats to their political careers (Huang and Leung, 2005) . Chen (2008) found that during the SARS crisis in Mainland China, local officials in Guangdong province prohibited the media from reporting the real death rate. On the other hand, a ""face-saving"" mindset can also prevail. Local government officials covered up the SARS outbreak merely because they were trying to save face (Chen, 2008, p. 47) . Additionally, in 21st century China, economic development and social stability have become top priorities for Chinese central and local governments (Huang and Leung, 2005) , thereby creating a larger incentive to cover up scandals.

Corporations also cover up scandals. Lyu (2012a) revealed that the Sanlu Corporation manipulated its ties to local governments in order to cover up its melamine-contaminated milk-powder crisis. Moreover, Sanlu sought to reduce negative publicity by purchasing positive advertising in the media (Veil and Yang, 2012) .

Similar cover-ups occurred in Taiwan during political crises. For example, Yu and Wen (2003) found that, in addition to strategies of denial and excuse, government officials used deception, media manipulation, and attacks against accusers to cover up the truth. According to Yu and Wen (2003) , the Taiwanese government handled crises as ""family"" or domestic matters. Taiwanese politicians avoided disclosing facts to the public during crisis situations in order to save face, secure national dignity, and reduce social turbulence.

Similar to the passive ""covering-up"" displayed by Mainland Chinese officials during the SARS crisis and the Wenchuan earthquake, a characteristic of Hong Kong's crisis communication is the prevalent use of ""no comment"". When the public cried out for more information during the SARS crisis, Lee (2007) found that Hong Kong's government resorted to a ""no comment"" strategy in order to block media attention. According to Lee (2007) , the government insisted not only on refusing to apologize but also on avoiding timely corrective measures. This practice could be related to Hong Kong's legal system, which is much more rigid than the legal systems of Mainland China and Taiwan. According to Fitzpatrick and Rubin (1995) , a ""no comment"" strategy is more likely to occur when admission of guilt is perceived as a liability for the organization in a potential lawsuit. Therefore, ""say[ing] nothing"" and ""say[ing] as little as possible"" are dominant strategies for crisis managers in regions where the rule of law is paramount.

Our findings also suggest that the avoidance of direct confrontation favored by Chinese culture (Ting-toomy, 2005) could be related to the frequent deployment of ""diversion"" as a strategy in Chinese crisis communication. Huang (2006) examined the ways in which four Chinese political figures responded to their alleged extramarital affairs. She demonstrated the prevalence and effectiveness of diversion/strategic ambiguity in these cases. As Huang noted, ""redirection [and] appeals to transcendence allow a political figure to put the case in such a way that the act supersedes its narrow, transient, and current scope and reflects low-context, less direct, more permanent, and future concerns"" (p. 26). Likewise, Huang, Lin, & Su (2005) used a survey of public relations and public affairs managers from Fortune 500 companies to empirically demonstrate that ""diversion"" and ""strategic ambiguity"" are crucial dimensions of CCSs in Taiwan. Such ""diversion"" strategies were also seen in the melamine-tainted milk-powder crisis in Mainland China (Lyu, 2012) and Hsiang et al. (2011) study of Bausch & Lomb's withdrawal of contact lens solution across the three Chinese societies.

4.2.4. Avoidance of ""extreme"" tactics such as attacking accusers and publicly apologizing ""Attacking the accuser"" and ""public apologies"" are seldom-used strategies in Chinese crisis communication, especially at the governmental level. For example, public apologies appeared neither in the SARS crisis (Chen, 2008) nor in the Wenchuan earthquake incident (Chen, 2009) nor in Sanlu's milk-contamination crisis; nor did Hong Kong's government express an apology during the SARs outbreak (Lee, 2007) . Huang (2006) observed that an accused politician chose not to directly attack his accuser, even though he could understandably have done so. Avoiding a direct attack on one's accuser saves face for both the accuser and the accused, thereby maintaining the harmony of the relationship, even if only at the surface level.

RQ6 investigates the extent to which Chinese cultural traits combine with the different Chinese political systems to impact CCSs adopted by Chinese crisis managers. This section consolidates lessons learned from studies published in the past fifteen years. The major characteristics of Chinese CCSs in crisis communication practices are defined below.

Traditional Chinese culture contributes to the unique CCSs in Mainland China (Liu, Chang, & Zhao, 2009) , Hong Kong (Lee, 2004) , and Taiwan (Huang, 2006) . In particular, collectivism, face-giving/saving, and the concept of the ""golden mean"" were identified as central cultural characteristics shaping Chinese crisis communication practices. 4.3.1.1. Collectivistic culture, nationalism, and rationalism. ""Collectivism"", especially at the national level, is a cultural and political attribute that contributes to the rhetorical representation of image restoration strategies, though such representation takes shape differently in the three different regions. Mainland Chinese tend to feel an obligation to take up the collective interest when expressing attitudes and making decisions, especially as they concern the agenda of the national government. Thus CCSs that use ""sustainability"" and ""national security"" to frame crises have been deployed frequently in Mainland China. Liu, Chang, and Zhao (2009) even found that Chinese entrepreneurs and public relations practitioners tend to tout China's overall prosperity more frequently than they are observed boasting of their own individual merits. Similarly, Huang (2006) emphasized the effects of collectivistic culture on the concept of relational harmony, examining four Taiwanese politicians alleged to be involved in extramarital affairs. Huang found that collectivist culture entails a form of ""relationalism"" that strongly shapes crisis communication practices (see Huang, 2006) . 4.3.1.2. Face-giving/saving. The tradition of face-saving (and face-giving) is another unique Chinese cultural trait that contributes significantly to Chinese crisis communication practices. Historically, the practice of ""covering-up"" and its related mindset, which desires that ""the ugly things in the family not go public"", have been common in Chinese crisis communication practices (Tang, 2003; Yu & Wen, 2003) . Saving face for oneself and giving face to others, coupled with narrow obedience to the collective agenda, only intensifies the tendency to cover up a crisis situation.

4.3.1.3. The golden mean. Chinese people traditionally have valued something known as Zhong Yong, which can be roughly translated as ""golden mean"". The golden mean is defined as that which is ""half way between two extremes"" (Ma, 1988, p. 203) . People in a Golden Mean-oriented society tend to behave in accordance with majority opinion (Ma, 1998) . Chinese people tend to think dialectically, and they have been found, statistically, to be more tolerant of contradictions than Western people (Peng and Nisbett, 1999) . The philosophy of the Golden Mean leads to a soft attitude towards resolving conflicts. In conflict resolution, Chinese people are inclined to reconcile large conflicts in a way that reduces them to smaller conflicts (Ma, 1998) . Therefore, extreme CCSs, such as attacking one's accusers, are neither highly valued nor frequently used in Chinese culture (Huang, 2006) .

The political regime in Mainland China is significantly different from that in Taiwan and Hong Kong, such that there is a significant difference in the way governmental crises are dealt with across the three regions. Of all potential actors, the regime in Mainland China is the strongest political force shaping the practice of crisis communication, not only at the level of central and local government but at the corporate level as well. This degree of government control in the Mainland is greater than that in Hong Kong, which in turn is greater than that found in Taiwan, whose regime has a comparatively small degree of sway over the crisis communication. (Meng and Qian, 2008) . Three factors jointly contributed to this. Symbolically, the Chinese government has attempted to play the role of the patriarch who rewards, disciplines, and protects his children (Huang and Bedford, 2009 ). This dynamic is particularly evident during crises or disasters, when the Chinese government has a symbolic responsibility to safeguard its ""children"". In addition to this symbolic responsibility, Chinese history and tradition have endowed the government with huge advantages in social status, resource possession, and power (Qian and Shi, 2012) . In Mainland China, the government has the requisite access and power to intervene upon other actors in a crisis event, whether those might be the media, corporations, or NGOs (Lyu, 2012a) . As a result, the government often assumes the principal acting role in conjunction with or instead of other institutions involved in a crisis (e.g., Cai, Lee, & Pang, 2009; Lyu, 2012a; Bowen and Heath, 2007) .

4.3.2.1.2. The suppression of uncertainty or instability by authoritarianism as a factor contributing to the failure of crisis communication. Meng and Qian (2008) , Gong (2009), and Cai, Lee, and Pang (2009) all pointed out that the key factor contributing to the failure of crisis communication in Mainland China is the tendency of the local governments to suppress uncertainty or instability at the expense of all other concerns. Compounding this basic problem, poor coordination exists between central and local governments. Mainland China is a large territory with multiple hierarchies built into its government at national and local levels. The central government exercises a great deal of control over the personnel and resource allocation of local governments. When large-scale crises (such as SARS and the Sichuan earthquake) take place, flexibility, coordination, and cooperation among various levels of government are key to effective CCSs. Tu and Gong (2008) claimed that these conditions for successful crisis communication do not exist within the Mainland Chinese government.

In Mainland China, ""the level of crisis severity"" is a criterion used by the central government to judge the performance of local governments. Thus, local government leaders tend to withhold or falsify crucial information about crises in reports to the central government (Huang and Leung, 2005) . During the SARS epidemic, for example, many mid-level officials suppressed or withheld news coverage and covered up the outbreak's severity by fabricating more manageable casualty figures (Huang and Leung, 2005) . 4.3.2.1.3. Interdependent relationships between local governments and corporations. Finally, relationships between local governments and corporations hinder the possibility of effective CCSs in Mainland China. For example, during the melaminecontaminated milk-powder crisis, the state-owned Sanlu Corporation took a passive role and waited for instructions from the government (Lyu, 2012a, p. 787) .

Four articles examined in the current study also focus on crises involving private corporations in Mainland China, and they all detail unethical and unprofessional practices. One pattern worth noting is that the practice of corporate crisis communication closely mirrors government conduct. Local government officials have been known to cover up for corporate criminals who pay large tax bills (Lyu, 2012a) . In many cases, large corporations expect some sort of ""protection"" or ""guidance"" from local governments; thus their initial strategy is usually to deny accusations or remain silent (Lyu, 2012a, p. 788) . Often, when the crisis becomes too severe to cover up and the central government finally steps in, much damage has already occurred both to an institution's reputation and to the public trust.

4.3.2.2. Hong Kong. Compared to the power wielded by Mainland China's government, the HKSAR has limited power. When crises occur, Hong Kong's government normally receives more critical scrutiny from scholars and the media than the private sector does (Lee, 2009) . The findings of the present study confirm this. Of all articles examined, governmental institutions in Hong Kong received the highest level of attention (60%), compared with corporations (20%) and media (20%). Ku (2001) maintained that, after the handover in 1997, the HKSAR was under the administration of an ""inexperienced and conservative Chief Executive"" (p. 131), which exposed its inherent weakness when dealing with crises. Academic attention was thus attracted to improving this situation.

The asymmetrical mindset that takes control during crisis situations also exists in Hong Kong. The difference being; however, that such asymmetrical strategies incurred heavy criticism from the media, which resulted in serious damage to the image and reputation of the HKSAR government (Lee, 2007 (Lee, , 2009 ) and loss of public support and public trust (Ku, 2001) .

Of the studies that examined crises in Taiwan and adopted the institutional perspective, only one article investigated governmental CCSs. Unlike the scholarship on Mainland China and Hong Kong, studies that focused on Taiwan highlighted the relationship between unprofessional corporate communication practices and weak regulation on the part of the ROC government. For example, Lin (2011) argued that the passive attitude of the government toward corporate malfeasance escalated the cable TV news-ticker crisis in Taiwan. The fiercely competitive market for ratings in Taiwanese media caused some TV stations to manipulate news tickers to attract viewers. The overuse of news tickers without proper regulations finally became a managerial crisis. Lin concludes that too much autonomy granted by governments to corporations can lead to unethical and unprofessional practices. The Taiwanese government did not effectively control the unprofessional practices of media institutions (in the case of the news tickers, especially) out of concern for maintaining press freedoms. Without any reasonable governmental regulations, however, some corporations will abuse their autonomy.

An accurate summary of this study's main findings must maintain a tone of ambivalence in regard to direct causal relationships. On one hand, Chinese tradition emphasizes harmony, order, face-saving, relationalism, and even nationalism, all of which shape particular forms of Chinese communication. For example, the Chinese traditions of face-giving/saving and the Golden Mean perpetuate the avoidance of extreme CCSs (attacking one's accusers or making public apologies) in Mainland, Taiwan, and Hong Kong. On the other hand, a region's political system also has a significant impact on crisis communication patterns in Chinese society. Formal institutions, particularly political regimes, can either discourage or encourage unethical and unprofessional practices in each region. Specifically, control-oriented crisis communication takes place more frequently within contexts distinguished by highly centralized and authoritarian political systems. Moreover, the transparency and symmetry of crisis communication have an inversely proportional relationship to centralization in the political system. Thus, an account of shared cultural heritage and varied political systems among regions within China is critical for establishing the nature of native crisis communication practices (see Table 1 ).

This study also discovered that research on Chinese CCSs emphasized institutional perspectives. Governmental crisis communication is paramount in research on the Mainland and Hong Kong, whereas corporate crises received the bulk of attention in research on Taiwan. Researchers seemed to be attracted to institutional crisis communication due to regional differences in political systems-ubiquitous intervention by the authoritarian government on the Mainland, the mistrust of government in post-handover Hong Kong, and the relatively mature democratic polity in Taiwan. Our study adds to this the following interesting findings about crisis communication in Mainland Chinese governmental agencies: governmental crisis communication is the predominate focus of research by scholars who work on Chinese public relations; and local governments and corporations within Mainland China display interdependent relationships.

Although our research contains important theoretical implications, it is limited by several factors. First, this study focused on crises that took place primarily in Chinese societies. Another limitation is this study's reliance on the conclusions and findings of the previous studies examined in our sample. Although we analyzed articles from reputable journals indexed in professional databases (such as SSCI, TSSCI, and CSSCI), these criteria are no guarantee of validity. They are only a strong safeguard against lack of validity. Despite the limitations of our methodological design, we believe that this study contributes significantly to an accurate depiction of the landscape of Chinese crisis communication. Through a comparison of empirical data collected from articles focused on three Chinese societies, the ultimate goal of this analysis is to go beyond traditional Western models of corporate crisis communication. The results revealed several compelling reasons for extending mainstream crisis communication theories that we found have limited impact on Chinese crisis communication scholarship. The exiting literature focuses too much on crisis-related variables (such as crisis responsibility attribution) as the primary contextual factor in a crisis situation while neglecting the crucial roles played by cultural context.

Moreover, this study suggests promising new directions for a more symmetrical research agenda for Chinese crisis communication.

First, the Internet has become a crucial context for public relations practice because it provides a technique for studying the attitudes and behaviors of the public during crises. While new forms of media have recently played a large role in mediating institutions and the public in Chinese crisis communication (Lyu, 2012b; Tu and Gong, 2008) , these relatively new communication platforms are in need of scholarly attention. Chinese social media and Internet use differ drastically from comparable practices in western countries. The centralized blocking of some mainstream foreign social media and restricted access to the Internet characterize a distinctive Internet context in China. Therefore, online crisis communication in China presents a set of exciting new challenges for Chinese crisis communication research.

Second, as noted earlier, a majority of Chinese crises have been studied from institutional (in particular, from governmental) rather than media or stakeholder perspectives. There has been little discussion of the effect of CCSs on various segments of the public in Chinese crisis communication research. Therefore, in support of the urgent call for more symmetrical research agendas (Dozier & Lauzen, 2000; Spice, 2000) , we suggest that future research would benefit from a more intensive focus on non-institutional perspectives and the stakeholder perspective in particular.

Moreover, the findings suggest that crisis communication research in public relations may be enriched both theoretically and pragmatically through more diverse contextual and methodological applications. Future research could compare this study's findings to a comparable study of organizations in other countries, which might provide valuable insights into cultural differences.

"Implementing a One Health approach to emerging infectious disease: reflections on the socio-political, ethical and legal dimensions","Background: 'One Health' represents a call for health researchers and practitioners at the human, animal and environmental interfaces to work together to mitigate the risks of emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases (EIDs). A One Health approach emphasizing inter-disciplinary co-operation is increasingly seen as necessary for effective EID control and prevention. There are, however, socio-political, ethical and legal challenges, which must be met by such a One Health approach. Discussion: Based on the philosophical review and critical analysis of scholarship around the theory and practice of One Health it is clear that EID events are not simply about pathogens jumping species barriers; they are comprised of complex and contingent sets of relations that involve socioeconomic and socio-political drivers and consequences with the latter extending beyond the impact of the disease. Therefore, the effectiveness of policies based on One Health depends on their implementation and alignment with or modification of public values. Summary: Despite its strong motivating rationale, implementing a One Health approach in an integrated and considered manner can be challenging, especially in the face of a perceived crisis. The effective control and prevention of EIDs therefore requires: (i) social science research to improve understanding of how EID threats and responses play out; (ii) the development of an analytic framework that catalogues case experiences with EIDs, reflects their dynamic nature and promotes inter-sectoral collaboration and knowledge synthesis; (iii) genuine public engagement processes that promote transparency, education and capture people's preferences; (iv) a set of practical principles and values that integrate ethics into decision-making procedures, against which policies and public health responses can be assessed; (v) integration of the analytic framework and the statement of principles and values outlined above; and (vi) a focus on genuine reform rather than rhetoric.","The recent Ebolavirus (EBOV) outbreak in West Africa and continuing human infections with a novel H7N9 influenza A virus in mainland China are salient reminders of how human and nonhuman health are inextricably linked. Nonhuman animals are the source of 70 % of emerging and re-emerging infectious disease (EID) threats to human health [1] , and more than half of all established human pathogens [2] . The threats posed by EIDs are dynamic. EIDs are caused by pathogens that can change their behaviour over timeeither through genetic modification or through changes in the patterns and pathways of transmission [3] . Social, economic and political systems can either promote or inhibit pathogen transfer, and the incidence and pathogenicity of the disease [4] . While a lack of data makes quantitation difficult, EIDs and zoonoses account for a significant proportion of the global disease burden [5] . EIDs and emergence of zoonotic pathogens, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), are direct causes of an estimated 15 million deaths worldwide each year [6] .

A One Health approach is increasingly considered to be the most effective way of managing EID threats [7, 8] because it represents an acknowledgement of certain facts about the nature of disease, which are then deployed to structure the response. One Health is grounded in a recognition that human, animal and environmental health are interdependent [9] , that animal species provide a shared reservoir for pathogen exchange and spread, and that many EIDs are driven by varied and dynamic human-animal interactions [9, 10] . The response One Health offers is to deconstruct the disciplinary silos [11] which have separated biomedical and social sciences devoted to the study of human disease from those devoted to nonhuman disease and ecological concerns [12, 13] . Inter-disciplinary research is called for and required, as is interventionist practice at local, national and international levels involving: policymakers, planners, regulators, physicians, veterinarians, ecologists, public and animal health officials, environmental health officers, microbiologists, and other allied natural and social scientists [10, 14] .

Although principally associated with EID prevention and control, One Health is also relevant to prevention and control of endemic and zoonotic animal diseases, as well as securing food safety [15, 16] . Considering the magnitude and complexity of global issues surrounding infectious disease and food security, the One Health approach has the potential to provide the creative, effective and sustainable solutions required.

Despite its strong motivating rationale, implementing a One Health approach can be challenging. Dealing with EIDs in an integrated and considered manner can be highly problematic, especially in the face of a perceived crisis. In this paper we examine the socio-political, ethical and legal considerations implied by a One Health approach to EIDs. First we describe how a One Health approach could galvanise and enhance current capacity in EID prevention and control. Making reference to case examples, we then identify and characterise sociopolitical, ethical and legal concerns that have the potential to limit the effectiveness of One Health interventions. Finally, we draw on this data to provide guidance as to how these concerns and issues might be addressed, and point to remaining challenges to the likely success of the One Health approach to EID control and prevention.

In order to explore the broader implications of a One Health approach we employed philosophical and qualitative methods to map existing and potential scientific, ethical and political responses to EIDs in Australia and our region. The overarching philosophical approach is that of developing sustained arguments that critically analyse the existing literature and reconceptualise or refine key concepts. This conceptual information is often observed in exemplars and paradigm cases. In particular we focused on materials pertaining to the social, political and ethical consequences of responses to the risks posed to human health and wellbeing by Hendra virus [HeV], Nipah virus [NiV] and Rabies virus [RbV] in Australasia, and compared them with international responses to canonical examples of pandemic and food borne zoonoses severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) [17] and bovine spongiform encephalitis/variant Creutzfeldt Jacob disease (BSE/vCJD), respectively. A synopsis of the characteristics and burdens of these diseases and the pathogens that cause them are outlined in Boxes 1 and 2.

Because our aim was to generate inductive insights and develop a robust set of argumentsrather than a comprehensive catalogue of every case example or publicationthe sample evolved iteratively from searches of textual sources such as publicly available international (e.g. WHO) and government reports; academic databases (e.g. PubMed); online/print news services (Factiva); organizational newsfeeds (Centers for Disease Control); and the websites of major One Health collaborations [18] . Materials in the sample were read and qualitatively reviewed through an iterative process of testing, revising and refining our definitions, principles and theoretical generalisations [19, 20] against the emerging conceptual map and feedback from the research team. Led by the first author, this cycle of searching, mapping and critical analysis continued until a period where new textual materials were not providing substantive new insights and the team was confident that a position of conceptual saturation had been achieved. In what follows we draw on these analyses and reflections to describe the content, context and nature of the challenges that need to be faced for the effective implementation of a One Health approach to EID control and prevention.

Findings EID prevention and control strategies require a One Health approach One Health is a holistic approach that emphasizes, but is not restricted to, the need to understand and regulate the environmental context (human-animalecosystem interface) of disease emergence and expression [21] . EIDs are characterized by their complexity and uncertainty as to their causes, consequences and likely solutions [22] . In broad terms, the occurrence and cross-species transmissibility of many emerging pathogens, like Ebolavirus (EBOV) and H7N9, arise from human activities such as changes in land use, growth in global trade and travel and intensification of animal husbandry practices [23] [24] [25] . The speed with which our understanding of the biology and epidemiology of H7N9 has developed demonstrates how much our ability to respond to new EID threats has improved over the last few decades. Yet despite advances in immunobiology and genomics that have contributed to diagnostics, therapeutics, and vaccine development, the threat of EIDs to human health and community wellbeing persists.

Part of the reason why EID threats remain in spite of scientific advances, are that EID events are not simply about pathogens jumping species barriers. The threats posed by EIDs are comprised of complex and contingent sets of relations that involve socioeconomic and sociopolitical drivers and consequences, with the latter extending beyond the impact of the disease. The social, cultural and economic impacts of zoonoses are significant. The examples contained in Tables 1 and 2 demonstrate the difficult balance between the human health risks and socioeconomic and cultural costs of EID control [26, 27] . Policy decisions should be based on sound evidencebut it is often the case in dealing with EIDs that the evidence required is absent or fluid. EID events are often dynamic situations that are characterised by uncertainty. As events unfold new evidence is created. Consequently decisions made on the basis of present data can be seen as wrong in the future, as more evidence and a better understanding emerges.

Official reviews of canonical EID events such SARS [17] and BSE/vCJD [28] share two key findings: (i) that actions to reduce risk should not be predicated on scientific certainty; and (ii) that policies to deal with the risks and effects of an EID need to be founded on widely held values, so that people understand, in advance, the kinds of choices that will have to be made. This suggests that the One Health approach needs more than inter-sectoral collaboration and robust health legislation, as the unique nature of EIDs critically limits the effectiveness of scientific, top-down and technocratic approaches to governance [29] .

Hendra virus infection is endemic among at least two species of flying fox in Australia and causes rare, but catastrophic, human infection [85] . Loss of habitat has led to increasingly intense incursions of flying foxes into populated rural and peri-urban areas and promoted the 'spill-over' of Hendra virus into horses and then to people [86] . Hundreds of people have been directly exposed to Hendra virus, with seven confirmed human infections and four deaths since 1994. With over one hundred dead horses and persistent risk, the emergence of Hendra has had significant impact on equine and tourist industries in north eastern Australia, diverted major research resources and caused significant distress and controversy in the broader community [31, 87] .

Nipah virus, a close relative of Hendra, is endemic in East Asian flying fox populations. In 1999, after a program of deforestation and agricultural development in Eastern Malaysia it spread to pigs then humans and other animals, causing respiratory disease and severe encephalitis [88] . It subsequently was reported in India and Bangladesh. Humans can be infected directly from bats, by ingestion of contaminated food and from other humans. Among 522 confirmed human cases, the overall mortality was greater than 50 % [89] . Nipah control programs devastated Malaysia's pig industry and caused high unemployment and dislocation of rural populations, at a cost of more than US$1 billion to the national economy [90] . Nipah virus has been identified by WHO as a likely cause of future pandemics.

Rabies virus infects the central nervous systems of people, wildlife and domestic mammals. The disease is transmitted by bites from infected animals and once it becomes symptomatic, it is virtually always fatal. 55,000 people die and 7.5 million receive post exposure prophylaxis annually, costing $124 billion [91] . Rabies is endemic in much of South East Asia but its range is expanding. Focusing on Australia, the continent is free from Rabies, but the current expansion of the disease in Indonesia [92] is a genuine threat to northern regions. Although likely controllable in domestic dog populations [93] , if Rabies were to become endemic amongst wild or feral animals in this setting, current modelling indicates it would be almost impossible to eradicate [94] . Table 2 Significant historical (i.e. effectively eradicated) EIDs

Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a human respiratory infection, caused by a coronavirus isolated from Chinese horseshoe bats [95] . It was first reported in Asia in 2003 and, within a few months, spread to thirty seven countries in the Americas, Europe and Asia. It affected more than 8000 people and caused 774 deaths, before being successfully eliminated by concerted international efforts. The outbreak and fear that another pandemic could occur are estimated to have cost Canadian and east Asian economies US$200 billion [27] .

Bovine spongiform encephalitis/variant Creutzfeldt Jacob disease (BSE/ vCJD) is a rare but fatal human neurodegenerative condition, caused by consumption of bovine products contaminated with the prions that cause BSE. Since vCJD was first identified in 1996, 175 cases have been reported in the UK and forty nine elsewhere. The World Bank estimates that the direct costs of vCJD/BSE to date exceed more than US $11 billion. Infected herds and the control measure imposed to prevent further infections devastated agricultural communities. The impacts of the emergence of a new zoonotic disease amongst the British public were far broader than agriculture, including the cessation of UK plasma production because of potential iatrogenic infection. With an estimated one in 4000 UK residents carrying vCJD, the burdens will continue well into this century [96] .

The success of One Health depends on more than scientific knowledge and technical achievement because some of the issues that arise in addressing EID risks are socalled 'wicked problems' [30] . When a new EID threat emerges there are rarely ready-made solutions and health policymakers and practitioners are often forced to make tragic choices that may contravene widely held values. Considerations must include the need to protect public health and the wider social, economic and environmental impacts of proposed interventions. Economic and political interests can complicate the decisionmakers' motives and decision-maker uncertainty is compounded by policy decisions becoming entangled in political, ethical and legal considerations [31] [32] [33] . As events surrounding the EBOV outbreak in West Africa illustrate, the importance placed on a specific EID threat at any one time also depends on who is setting the agenda [34] . Therefore to be successfully implemented, the One Health approach must address a range of socio-political, ethical and legal challenges that arise as a consequence of the spread of infection within and between species. Most of these challenges are not unique to One Health, but are shared by any approach to addressing EIDs. However these challenges frequently go unrecognized. In the following section we will clarify the nature of these issues so they can be addressed later in the paper.

(1)Socio-political challenges A focus on individualism, perceptions, short term solutions, populism and avoiding controversy are features of political life, which can prove challenging for EID policy and work against developing effective strategies for addressing EIDs.

Policy responses to EID events such as Nipah and Hendra virus infections (outlined in Box 1) tend to focus on necessary and proximal causes (what individuals do to put themselves at direct risk from an infectious pathogen) because the science about other aspects of EIDs is often complex, uncertain and lacking a clear narrative. Compounding this, our moral psychologies have evolved to respond to direct harmsnot indirect distal causal stories. Many people in liberal democracies believe that they are entitled to rights and freedoms that cannot be sacrificed merely for the marginal gains of others. As the discourse surrounding climate change and other wicked problems illustrates, this promotes technological solutions because they do not require substantive changes in human behaviours and underlying values systems. [35] The net result is that the policy focus for EID prevention and control tends to remain on individual behaviours rather than the structural drivers of emergence and transmissiona case example being the focus on vaccine development and the husbandry practices of horse owners in response to the zoonotic risks of Hendra virus [31, 36] ..

The political impetus for action in response to many EIDs is not necessarily scientific evidence but societal perceptions. Indeed, in the face of scientific uncertainty and ethical ambiguity, ideological perspectives and short-term political considerations often supplant efforts to devise effective long-term interventions [28, 37] .

Political imperatives to avoid, or at least minimise, public concern whilst dealing with EIDs can also prove challenging. In the case of BSE, powerful interests dominated early government responses, leading policymakers to make decisions that avoided public controversy, but had major economic consequences. As the crisis unfolded, expertise became politicized leading to conflict between agencies and policy inconsistency between health communication strategies and the measures being taken to minimize the risks to human health [38] . Even when the link between BSE and vCJD became clear, existing feed bans were poorly enforced and risk communication was dominated by fear of public panic [39] ; even as the decision was made to remove all potential sources of human infection from the UK food supply, messages were confused and policy implementation impeded by poor co-ordination between agencies [28] .

A common but problematic response to EID threats has been to invoke the precautionary principle. Roughly speaking, the precautionary principle can be applied in situations where human activities create a scientifically plausible, but uncertain, risk of significant harm. In response the principle advocates that actions ought to be taken to avoid or reduce the harm, and that these actions need to be proportionate to the seriousness of the potential harm. In other word, in the absence of evidence take a conservative approach.

However applying the precautionary principle to EIDs in an attempt to protect the public can result in what, in retrospect, amounts to an excessive response. This occurred with attempts to control Nipah infection, where significant damage was inflicted on industry, livelihoods and the economy. Similarly, experience with highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 in China and SE-Asia showed that overzealous policy responses can destroy livelihoods and threaten food supplies [40, 41] . In Vietnam alone, almost 40 million birds were culled in 2004 in an attempt to eradicate HPAI. Although many birds were owned by large commercial operations, others were kept by 'backyard' farmers and villagers. Mass culling of poultry appears decisive, but places excessive burdens on vulnerable populations, is ineffective in the context of extensive 'backyard' poultry farming and can, in fact, promote the spread of disease [42] . A similar scenario is currently playing out with Rabies control in Bali.

Unfortunately, the precautionary principle and analytic tools and concepts appealed to in this domain, fail to deliver what is required at times of EID outbreaks since they do not advance public engagement or help resolve disagreements in times of uncertainty [43, 44] . Philosophical critiques of the precautionary principle applied to EIDs have also shown its limitations, including that defining criteria by which to judge a threat as plausible and a response proportionate, often will only substitute one uncertainty for two others [45] .

(2)Ethical challenges

The effectiveness of an EID control policy will depend on the context of its implementation and particularly its alignment with stakeholder and public values [17, 46] . In modern liberal democracies at least some consensus over what is in the public interest and an understanding of the values which support it, is therefore required for the successful implementation of EID responses. Yet this is precisely what has been lacking in outbreaks where fracture lines, differences and value conflicts have become apparent. When the stakes are high, evidence and the implications of actions are uncertain, the situation is complex and resources may be limited but where decisions need to be made, differences are exposed. Such differences could be around beliefs about how to deal with ecological and environmental issues, which may conflict with the importance people attach to public goods, protection of individual autonomy and animal welfare [47]. These conditions of crisis and division are conducive to undesirable consequences including public fear, mistrust, misinformation and non-compliance with public health directives. For example in Canada during the SARS crisis, leaders were unprepared for the range of ethical conflicts that arose, including those over: individual freedom versus the common good; healthcare workers' safety versus their duty to care for the sick; and economic costs versus the need for containment [48] . As indicated in Box 2, both the outbreak itself and fear that another outbreak could occur had significant economic consequences.

Any approach which hopes to successfully respond to EID threats, including a One Health approach, needs to address the ethical concerns articulated above. To this end, potentially conflicting values and logic must be negotiated to realise effective, sustainable and just solutions. Prioritisation and resource allocation require political processes based on fundamental ethical questions about what is valuable, what is to be protected and, ultimately, what is dispensable. To be effective, public policy must be consistent with the values of citizens to whom it is applied, otherwise it can become mired in controversy about whose values should prevail [31, 37, 49] . Therefore, one of the first and most important tasks of policy work is to establish how the public interest is best defined.

(3)Legal challenges

The legal environment in which EID policy is made and in which responses to outbreaks occur, presents its own set of challenges. The law surrounding EID responses in most jurisdictions is diffuse, complicated and often subject to re-interpretation on the basis of whose interests are given primacy at the time decisions are made. Moreover, in many countries different approaches by State/Provincial and local authorities, overlaid by Federal/National powers, complicate regulation so much that 'hard law' is often replaced by resort to 'soft law' of executive and administrative powers and international instruments, such as the International Health Regulations (IHR) [50] . This may add complexity and confusion to the EID regulatory structures, rather than facilitating public health responses to a new threat. Such confusion provides a salient reminder that even in 'global law' approaches to EIDs, the sovereign state remains the institution responsible for regulation and control [51] .

Public health law responses to EIDs tend to be oriented towards controlling cross-border pathogen transfer and community outbreaks rather than the underlying deficiencies and structural conditions from which the threats emerge. Other laws, such as environmental law, may be more useful in addressing structural conditions for emergence. Changes in land use and agricultural intensification in developing societies are major drivers of EID. However, the cost of laws that restrict development may be greater global health inequities, with consequential effects for health outcomes. In order to clarify EIDrelated legal tensions between economic development and health security, a more explicit recognition is needed of who are the primary beneficiaries and who bears the costs of a One Health approach to EIDs [52] .

Legal clarity around the frameworks designed to protect populations from EIDs is critical to providing an enabling infrastructure to co-ordinate and support the One Health-based work of policymakers, development planners, human and animal health-workers and biosecurity agencies.

The health of humans, animals, and ecosystems are interconnected. A One Health approach promises a better understanding of how to prevent and control EIDs at the human-animal-ecosystem interface. However the socio-political, ethical and legal challenges of EIDs illustrated above highlight how responses to infectious disease threats are intrinsically value laden. When a new infectious pathogen such as Hendra or Nipah virus first appears, or a known threat such as Rabies or Ebola encroaches on a new setting, there is limited scientific evidence or past experience to guide decisions or determine whether a planned response will be proportionate. Vastly different interpretations of EID events and their likely outcomes might be supported by the available data. Policymakers and practitioners therefore have little guidance as to what they should do when faced with a nascent infectious disease threat, only what they can do. As others [52] [53] [54] have cogently argued, they must therefore ask themselves: whose health is being prioritized; which public and which good are we seeking to protect?

Notwithstanding recognition of a need for complementary work on values-based questions that inevitably surround EID risks and EID control, the adoption of the One Health approach, so far, has not included development of a comprehensive, ethically-informed policy and implementation framework; this has limited its practical utility [9, 55] . Despite rhetorical and some financial support for One Health as the guiding ethos by which to address interconnected human, animal and environmental health issues, its impact will be minimal unless implications of uncertainty on, and potential conflicts between, human values and political processes are recognised and articulated. Any attempt to address these ethical and normative dimensions must take into account the dynamic nature of EID risk management. A policy that seems reasonable today may be inappropriate tomorrow, in light of new evidence. And when situations are uncertain, decision-makers inevitably fall back on their values. Therefore, a solid framework based on shared values is needed to support decision-making surrounding EIDs when ""evidence"" isor may beunreliable, and rapidly changing or fluid.

What is needed to guide a one health approach to EIDs?

To successfully meet the challenges described above, particularly the necessity to align EID policy with public values, a One Health approach needs to engage in the following.

(i) Social science and economic research to help catalogue and describe the drivers, mechanisms and social and political configurations through which EIDs become threats to human, animal and ecological health [56, 57] . The complex connections between individual social needs and the local socioeconomic context of affected or at-risk communities, need to be understood and addressed by policymaking processes. This should ensure that manifest injustice, livelihood-based decisions and other social and cultural factors do not undermine the effectiveness of favoured control measures. Without adequate knowledge of specific local arrangements, there is a danger that insufficiently nuanced or unified approaches to EIDs will actually undermine the heterogeneous relationships and contingent practices that make health possible in circumstances of structural disadvantage [56, 58] .

The social sciences are analytically broader and more policy focussed than the natural sciences. Whereas the natural sciences tend to frame infectious disease threats narrowly as matters of biological integrity and security, such that barrier technologies and hygiene practices dominate the logic of interventions [59] , social science approaches go beyond this. Building social scientific evidence for use in conjunction with natural scientific evidence about EIDs aligns with the growing realization that EID emergence is as much about the social and economic configuration of capital flow as it is about the biological features of host-pathogen interactions. Current approaches to the economic and structural drivers of EID emergence still presume that state and market neoliberalism is part of the natural order, even as evidence is mounting that these systems of development are central to the problem [60, 61] . Moreover, the current emphasis on microbiology and focus on newer molecular techniques to characterise pathogens, is drawing attention away from developing better understandings of the environmental, economic and social drivers of EIDs. While this is understandable given the desire for vaccines and drugs to solve EIDs, if One Health researchers and practitioners broaden their approach to causality to include upstream, social and economic systemic causes, questions and issues that have been traditionally bracketed or thought best avoided will become central to the cross-sectoral collaboration implied by One Health.

Framework (OHAF) needs to be pursued. Such a framework would catalogue case-based experiences and reflect the particular dynamics of specific EIDs, and promote inter-sectoral collaboration and knowledge synthesis, including integration of information about social, cultural and economic impacts, control measures and uncertainty [62, 63] . The framework would serve as a prompt to ensure that minority perspectives are represented and all relevant concerns are considered. An OHAF could provide a rubric for comparisons between outbreaks. This would allow the inherent complexities of economic and societal responses to EIDs to be compared, to inform policy processes. It is vital for discussions about EID prevention and control to have this kind of sound empirical foundation, because uncertainty and media coverage have the potential to drive bad policy.

Development of an OHAF could be facilitated by adopting well established and methodically rigorous processes such as Framework Analysis, produced by the National Centre for Social Research (UK) [19] , or Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis [MCDA] developed within the field of decision science [64] . In the first instance Framework Analysis would allow for systematic incorporation of the perspectives and contributions of different scholarly disciplines and expert stakeholders. Framework Analysis facilitates movement between different datasets, thematic areas, theoretical resources, and levels of abstraction without loss of conceptual clarity [65] . The Framework method is used to organize and manage research and interpretation through the process of summarization, which is codified into a robust and flexible matrix that allows the policymaker/researcher to analyze data both by case and theme. It is commonly used in areas such as health research, policy development and program evaluation. Equally, MCDA methods offer an alternative and potentially complementary approach to OHAF development. Comprised of a suite of analytic strategies, MCDA have been shown to be valuable tools for prioritization and decision-making in animal and human health [64] . MCDA provides a framework to compare policy alternatives with diverse and often intangible impacts, which can be particularly useful in determining and justifying the prioritization and mobilization of limited research and public health resources [66, 67] .

(iii)Genuine processes of public engagement across the developed and developing world are also essential to a successful One Health approach. These processes are not so much about engaging in deliberative democracy for policy decision-making, as about defining the principles and values that should guide decision-making. This means procedural inclusiveness alone is not enough to ensure transparency and reflexivity, to capture people's preferences and to effectively communicate with the public [68] .

The successful implementation of the One Health approach to EIDs will depend on public trust and cooperation. Public support for unpalatable measures is more likely if citizens understand the issues, and policy implementation reflects community values and preferences. To this end, citizens' juries have been employed in the UK, Australia, the US and elsewhere [69] [70] [71] [72] to explore similar issues and identify citizens' preferences. They represent informed public opinion better than other social research methods (e.g. surveys or focus groups) because they give participants factual information, bring them into a structured and constructive dialogue with experts, provide them with time to reflect and deliberate, and allow them to represent their views directly to policymakers. To be successful, One Health needs to be about more than disease prevention and control. The dynamic, unpredictable effects and risks to peoples' lives of EIDs necessitate a public health and biosecurity infrastructure equipped to address the ethical problems that arise. EID management must therefore be based on normative principles as well as local knowledge, operational experience and disease-specific scientific and economic evidence. This means that governments and policy-makers need to explain and justify the values that underlie decision-making and engage the public in discussions about ethical choices, so that when difficult decisions arise in the face of uncertainty, they will be accepted as fair and essential for the public good [47] . This necessitates that the guiding values and likely ethical choices need to be articulated in a formal statement in advance, as in the heat of emerging health threat, decision makers will be under pressure from many sources to 'do something quickly'.

(v)Integration of an OHAF and SPV with the IHR and relevant national health and biosecurity legislation is essential so that policymakers and practitioners can dynamically test their decision-making.

Our response should of course be based on the best scientific evidence, but EIDs are not just scientific issues, they also have significant social, ethical and animal rights dimensions. Experiences of infectious disease threats such as BSE/vCJD and SARS indicate that there have been problems combining evidence and human values at both local and policy levels [28, 73] . The communicability of diseases between species raises social, ethical and legal issues that have not been clearly elucidated or adequately addressed. Our response to nonhuman animal disease is not determined solely by bio-scientific knowledge; the way people and animals live with and amongst each other is also shaped by social norms, economic imperatives and human values. In matters of public health it is no longer sufficient to ask what works and what is the strength of the evidence; we also need to ask ethical questions about how we should seek to live, and what is the right thing to do [74] [75] [76] . Consensus about the best approaches to EID control and prevention are not always possible, however an agreed set of guiding principles and values can be a means to ensure dialogue, if not always agreement.

The development of an OHAF and SPV will also promote clearer communication about public risk. Significant EID threats have major implications for distribution of scarce resources, access to and regulation of health services and maintenance of social order. As described above it is also clear that policy and legal responses to EID threats are often highly politicised and compromised by failure to communicate clearly with the public. Policymakers responsible for responding to disasters such as EIDs typically find that there is a dissonance between transparency that may appear alarmist versus withholding information to avoid panic. Regardless of advice, people will make their own decisions based on their interpretation of available information, from formal and informal channels. So public communication, before and during a public health emergency, is frequently as important as political decisions and regulatory changes [39, 77] . This means that, to be effective, a One Health approachlike any EID policymust deal with scientific uncertainty, whilst addressing the socio-political, ethical and legal dimensions of effective health communication and intervention strategies [3] . By exposing decision-making processes to reveal the scientific and normative uncertainties and ethical complexities, the introduction of an OHAF and a SPV into One Health theory and practice may incorporate iterative deliberation and learning into EID policy processes.

(vi)Finally, One Health must be about genuine reform rather than merely rhetoric. A One Health approach rests on the assumption that the cross-sectoral integration of expertise, research methodologies and public health infrastructure will inevitably improve capacity for disease-risk prediction and effective intervention. However, calls for increased intersectoral co-operation by public health practitioners, clinicians, scientists and policy-makers are not a new phenomenon. For example in the 1990s advocates of ""new public health"" called for health authorities to turn their attention to the social, economic and environmental factors that affect healthrequiring the realignment and policy integration of Health Departments with other government agencies [78, 79] . Unfortunately in this case as others, attempts at promoting inter-sectoral approaches rarely move beyond rhetoriceven when driven by the best intentions and supported by substantial resources [80] [81] [82] .

The problem is that arguments that promote the need for greater co-operation between sectors tend to focus on the likely benefits of collaboration rather than what reform would entailthat is, what needs to be done organisationally and politically to achieve the desired outcomes [83] . Established 'sectors'whether orientated towards human or animal health, agriculture or the environmenthave genealogies, traditions and rationalities of ""what we are here for"" that have been shaped by social, political and administrative processes [11] . As institutions, they are philosophically and structurally resistant to change that diverts resources and re-orients practices away from their own sectoral priorities [83] . In essence, they have their own constituencies to serve. As a consequence, establishment and implementation of mechanisms that enhance information-sharing, collaboration and inter-sectoral co-operation, such as working groups and interdepartmental committees, have rarely delivered the outcomes promised in the past. Responses to BSE/vCJD in the UK [28] , HPAI in South East Asia [11] , and recent case studies of One Health programs in Uganda [84] , suggest that more work is needed to coordinate implementation and overcome sectoral interests. The complexity of the problems posed by EIDs mean that organising effective control and prevention programs will require genuine cross-sectoral integration and, potentially, re-sectoring of some institutional and professional responsibilities [62] . And as the recent Ebolavirus disease outbreak illustrates, there must also be sustained social and political willingness to achieve control.

If One Health is genuinely the way forward, as we believe it is, then we should do more than talk about its potential benefits. Without genuine cross-sectoral reform and a radical broadening of the scope of its inquiry into how specific social, cultural and spatial configurations promote the risks of EID emergence, One Health is in danger of becoming merely a rhetorical strategy to avoid conflict between its core disciplines, whereby practitioners, researchers and policymakers will espouse the methodological and moral case for interdisciplinary collaboration yet remain in their silos [11] . Even if these barriers are overcome the One Health approach will only succeed if it explicitly acknowledges local contingent and contextual dimensions of disease risk and disease expression and the political impacts of scientific uncertainty, while also seeking to accommodate the values and preferences of 'at risk' and affected individuals. Further, we suggest that decision making around EIDs requires an ethical framework that reflects the values of affected and 'at risk' communities, privileges justice, takes account of human flourishing, protects animal health and welfare and is developed in consultation with relevant stakeholders and the public.

EID risk management is a major global public health issue to which One Health represents a promising approach, but its potential benefits have not been fully realised [53, 55] . Despite recognition that the social and cultural dimensions are critical to the success of One Health, social scientists are yet to play a central or substantive role in shaping research programs and interventions [12, 13] . At the same time as the literature on the ethics of pandemic responses and preparedness continues to grow, the One Health approach to EIDs has received little formal ethical consideration. Even the most ethically attuned existing frameworks for biosecurity and infection prevention and control provide only general operational principles that do not guide actions in times of uncertainty. If One Health is to be meaningful − let alone successful − more attention must be paid to how these different types of knowledge are brought together and brought to public attention. Effective responses to EIDs are likely to be delayed or precluded unless all the socio-political, ethical and legal implications are articulated, publicly debated and − as far as possible − resolved in advance. Policy makers and public health experts need a set of principles and values, developed and articulated prior to an outbreak that explicitly acknowledge the preferences of affected communities and can guide integration of new evidence into decision-making processes in a dynamic manner.

Informed public against false rumor in the social media era: Focusing on social media dependency,"This study explores how the public's belief in false rumors about Middle East Respiratory Syndrome that spread across South Korea related to their accuracy-oriented information seeking as well as the moderating effects of people's reasons for using social networking services (SNS). The survey results show that perceived credibility of false rumors did not affect accuracy-oriented information seeking. However, a significant result was shown in the moderating effect, such that SNS informational dependency interacted with false rumor credibility on accuracy-oriented information seeking. Overall, this study specifically identifies and discusses differences in SNS dependency and accuracy-oriented information seeking in the context of rumor communication to examine the construction of an informed public. Theoretical contributions of this study are discussed.","People often tend to seek more information in order to decrease their uncertainties in chaotic situations during which rumors are being widely spread (Wilson, 1997 (Wilson, , 1999 . Defined as finding 'missing' information, information seeking is motivated by people's necessity to search scant information (Case, 2012) . In rumor communication, an informed public is hard to be formed if people do not seek accurate facts. During the spread of false rumors that could generate major social problems (Tanaka et al., 2012) , a lack of accuracy-oriented information seeking can produce detrimental effects on a society because people may remain as a passive bystander, not an active searcher, letting false rumors confuse a society. Furthermore, if they show passive attitudes amid circulation of false rumors, social chaos is exacerbated.

The potential negative consequences of beliefs in false rumors in terms of information seeking are numerous. People should make the effort to actively check the accuracy of false rumors rather than passively responding to the rumors as bystanders and leaving those to be spread. This paper defines accuracy-oriented information seeking as a cognitive aspect of information seeking by finding accurate information (accuracy-aimed). People with accuracy goals tend to collect a wide range of information, thus reaching the most desired conclusions without prejudice (Hart et al., 2009; Taber and Lodge, 2006) . Past research shows that rebutting the forged rumors, one of accuracy-aimed behaviors, could mitigate the negative impact of false rumors (Tanaka et al., 2012) .

Research on the relationship between rumor and information seeking has rarely been conducted. Hence, the present study aims to establish the rumor communication model in the era of social network service (SNS) by exploring how perceived credibility of rumors affects accuracy-oriented information seeking. Indeed, past research which focuses on the effect of general messages credibility and information seeking shows mixed findings. Some studies argue that low credibility of the message motivates people to seek more 2. Literature review

Rumors are defined as unverified messages that circulate throughout the public (Sunstein, 2009 ) and that are easily formed during risky situations such as floods and terrorism, during which people are plunged into chaos that heightens their concerns over dangers (Danzig et al., 1958; Oh et al., 2010) . Particularly, false rumors, which will be discussed in this study, have been noted as the main causes for social problems in high risky situations (Tanaka et al., 2012) . False rumors are defined as baseless rumors spread during the crisis and later confirmed to be not true (Mendoza et al., 2010) . It is not a new phenomenon that false rumors are circulated during disasters (i.e., Prasad, 1935; Sinha, 1952) because people tend to obviate their uncertainties by spreading the false rumors under the risky situations (DiFonzo and Bordia, 2007) . This study will discuss about false rumors related to the spread of MERS virus.

In today's society, rumors are heavily spread through SNS. In the era of Web 2.0, when people are interconnected through twoway online social media, rumors are spreading faster than ever before. SNSs facilitate false information to be spread due to their fastforwarding characteristic (Adachi and Toda, 2015; Zhang and Leung, 2014) , and consequently creates nationwide panic (Tanaka et al., 2012) . However, despite these negative aspects of social media, some studies have argued that SNS can function as useful means of communication in the context of rumor communication. For example, Twitter can allow real-time updates and information transmission during disasters and other emergencies (Mills et al., 2009) . These contradictions show that the role of SNS in rumor communication should be thoroughly examined as the spread of rumors using SNS is increasing.

In the context of rumors, perceived credibility of rumors is regarded as participant's perception of the rumor's veracity or likelihood of being true and is linked with how people perceive and react to rumors (Grewal et al., 1994; Sternthal et al., 1978) . In this vein, it is important to examine rumor credibility in seeking how informed public is formed, which has rarely been examined in extant research. This study opens the gateway for research on the effects of rumor credibility by predicting diverse results. As previous research noted (Tanaka et al., 2012) , if people easily believe false rumors, they are not likely to find corrective information that are critical in blocking the spread of false rumors. That is, people with high beliefs in false rumors can easily accept the message without having awareness. However, another possibility is that high level of false rumor credibility can facilitate information seeking behaviors by stimulating people's curiosity, which could even lead them to find more accurate information. They may also hold cynical attitudes toward rumors and ignore them, not trying to check facts. Although we can predict different possible results of false rumors credibility, those remain as unsolved issues as no prior studies have empirically examined these possibilities. Hence, now is the time for communication scholars to examine the perceived credibility of false rumors and how the credibility functions in forming an informed public against the spread of false rumors through social media.

Information seeking is defined as ""a conscious effort to acquire information in response to a need or gap in one's knowledge"" (Case, 2012, p.5) , which posits that audiences are active searcher. When facing risks, people tend to seek abundant and accurate information to mitigate their uncertainties, as Allport and Lepkin (1945, p.14) stated, ""the more information he has, and the more carefully he thinks, the less chance that he will be led into believing by his inner, and often unrecognized, impulses."" However, merely spending a lot of time to seek information does not fully explain the meaning of information seeking. Especially regarding rumor communication, efforts to find accurate information against false rumors takes high importance (Crescimbene et al., 2012) , which is termed as accuracy-oriented information seeking in this study, because those effortful behaviors can prevent the circulation of false rumors. This study defines the accuracy-oriented information seeking as people's efforts to find accurate information.

There is a clear difference between accuracy-oriented information seeking and a general term of information seeking; the former stems from cognitive gratification needs but the latter encompasses cognitive gratification as well as people's diverse needs in a more generic term (i.e., hedonic needs, social integrative needs, etc.). That being said, accuracy-oriented information seeking is oriented toward finding information that can fill-in person's intellectual and cognitive needs. In contrast, information seeking does not take account of people's specific needs, only measuring how much information people found; but this can include diverse motivations for seeking more information such as to have fun, join societal relationships, or check the accuracy of the messages.

Theoretically, motivated reasoning theory further supports the explanation of accuracy goal-directed information-seeking (Johnson, 1997) . According to the concept of motivated reasoning, an individual is motivated to achieve goals when they process information (Chaiken et al., 1996) . Of the two dimensions of motivation (i.e., accuracy and direction), accuracy goals heighten cross-cutting exposure while lessening selective exposure, thus prompting people to collect diverse pieces of information to reach the most accurate conclusions (Fiske and Taylor, 1991; Hart et al., 2009; Taber and Lodge, 2006) . As noted in politics studies, accuracy motivated individuals try to search for various issues of candidates and evaluate each candidate's characteristics without having any bias (Leeper and Slothuus, 2014) . In contrast, people with directional goals tend to selectively expose themselves to information that corresponds with their opinions. Such directional motivated reasoning affects rumor rebuttals; that is, an individual is likely to ignore the rumor which contradicts his or her beliefs (Kunda, 1990) . Following these discussions, the concept of the accuracy-oriented information seeking, a developed term to be used in this study, corresponds to having accuracy goals when finding additional information in terms of the motivated reasoning theory. Furthermore, although studies have shown that accuracy motivation reduces congeniality bias (selecting one's supporting view rather than opposing view) while increasing uncongeniality bias (selecting one's opposing view rather than supporting view) (Hart et al., 2009) because it facilitates people's tendencies to uncover the truth by holding objectiveness and open-mind (Chaiken et al., 1989; Kunda, 1990) , no research has not directly linked the discussions of motivated reasoning theory with information seeking.

In context of rumor communication, past studies have revealed that verifying information and rebutting false rumors which is a core behavior of accuracy-aimed information seeking (Leeper and Slothuus, 2014) , make people have critical thoughts (e.g., Allport and Postman, 1947; Bordia et al., 2000; Iyer and Debevec, 1991) , which could ultimately curb the negative impact of false rumors (Tanaka et al., 2012) . Therefore, seeking information with accuracy in mind is essential in minimizing the circulation of false rumors. Such accuracy-oriented information seeking is a step toward finding alternative accurate messages to eliminate uncertainties and to judge whether rumors contain truthful information or not. Particularly, Shibutani (1966) argued that under the situation of great uncertainty and danger, people are accuracy motivated because they realize accurate intelligence determines their survivals. Despite these discussions, it is still unknown whether people sought accurate information in a reality-based risky situation, which raises the needs to focus on the actual incident, MERS virus, in this study to find out answers for the unsolved matters.

The underlying assumption of information seeking behavior is that individuals actively seek additional information if they are uncertain about the information they have (Wilson, 2000) . From this perspective, high perceived credibility of false rumors decreases motivations to find additional information because people might feel certain about the false rumor contents. Given that information insufficiency is a premise of low perceived credibility of that information (Flanagin and Metzger, 2000) , if individuals think that rumors lack sufficient information with having low level of credibility of the given rumors, they would seek more accurate information (Case, 2012) .

As discussed before, we differentiate a general term of information seeking from the accuracy goal directed information seeking, and assert that individuals who are engaged in accuracy-oriented information seeking make effortful behaviors to verify the accuracy of rumors. Metzger and Flanagin (2015) argued that different information seeking situations are motivated by different people's needs to search information. For example, people's accuracy goals (i.e., searching for information about important health-related issues) move them to seek out accurate information but other goals (i.e., searching for information about music groups) do not (Metzger and Flanagin, 2015) . Particularly, chaotic and dangerous situations also motivate people to be accuracy-aimed (Shibutani, 1966) , but no research to date has addressed the relationship between perceived credibility of rumors and accuracy-oriented information seeking under risky situations. Hence, we take this matter as the first research question.

RQ1. In a high risk situation, how is the perceived credibility of rumors associated with the accuracy-oriented information seeking?

.

The conceptualization of SNS dependency has evolved from the media system dependency theory (MSD) proposed by Ball-Rokeach and DeFleur (1976) . MSD explains that mass media affects individuals because they rely on media to achieve their everyday goals. The theory presumes the media, audiences, and society form an organic, interdependent structure (DeFleur and Ball-Rokeach, 1989 ) in a tripartite relationship. Similarly, research has demonstrated that SNS dependency affects individuals' achievement of personal goals Kim and Shin, 2013) . SNS dependency generally comprise six subsets that are not mutually exclusive: personal understanding, social understanding, personal action orientation, social action orientation, solitary play, and interaction play, which refer to the goals that individuals aim to attain by using media (Ball-Rokeach, 1985; Kim and Jung, 2014; Kim et al., 2015; Loges and Ball-Rokeach, 1993) . The different subsets of SNS dependency posit that individuals have different purposes for using SNS. Among various subsets of SNS dependency, we adopt SNS social dependency and SNS informational dependency as core values of SNS uses.

First, people mainly use SNSs to build or maintain social relationships (Ancu and Cozma, 2009; Chu and Kim, 2011) , which is termed as SNS social dependency in this study. SNS social dependency is regarded as people's tendencies to depend on SNSs to gain social interactive gratification through interpersonal communication (Ha et al., 2015, p. 432) . In this vein, SNS social action orientation dependency and SNS interaction play dependency commonly explain the core reasons for using SNS as social connectivity. SNS social action orientation dependency indicates that people depend on SNS in their daily lives in order to identify better ways to communicate with others, to consider how to improve relationships with acquaintances, and to figure out the ways to communicate with others in important or difficult situations . In the same vein, SNS interaction play dependency explains that people depend on SNS as something to do with their friends or to participate in enjoyable events through SNS Kim and Jung, 2014) . These two subsets collectively explain SNS users' social interactions which makes individuals to ""feel at ease and comfortable to engage in interpersonal communication exchanges through the technology-enabled space"" (Phang et al., 2009, p.729) .

On the other hand, people could rely on SNS for obtaining information to satisfy their cognitive needs. In this study, we newly term people's dependencies on SNS to acquire knowledge as SNS informational dependency that focuses on cognitive gratification through SNS usage. Indeed, linking between media dependency and information acquisition is a not new topic. Existing research has highlighted the role of media in helping knowledge acquisition (Ha et al., 2015; Humphreys, 2007) . Media users try to understand a society and their communities by relying on news media (whether it is a print, online, or television) (Ball-Rokeach et al., 1984; Loges and Ball-Rokeach, 1993; Patwardhan and Yang, 2003) . For example, they use Facebook or Twitter as an information source of news. Patwardhan and Yang (2003) found a positive relationship between social understanding and online news reading, concluding that people rely on Internet to understand the current society. These lines of research support the need to explore people's dependency on media for information acquisition purposes. These discussions imply that SNS per se do not affect individuals' behaviors. Rather, it is individuals' different motivations for using SNS that affect behaviors (Gil de Zúñiga et al., 2011) .

As individuals' motivations for using SNS vary, SNS social dependency and informational dependency have clear differences. That is, while some individuals use SNS for building their social relationships, some use SNS as important information sources, spending time obtaining information through SNS (Wise et al., 2010) . SNS informational dependent users focus on gaining information while SNS social dependent users depend on SNS to better understand their communities. That is, SNS social dependency includes both SNS cognitive and hedonic gratification while SNS informational dependency merely focuses on cognitive gratification (Ha et al., 2015) . Numerous studies have found that using SNS for social purposes has positive effects on information acquisition (cognitive gratification) as well as enjoyment (hedonic gratification) (Ha et al., 2015; Humphreys, 2007; Lin and Lu, 2011) . Particularly, SNS users who are relationship-oriented decrease boredom and feel enjoyment while engaging on social interactions, thus obtaining hedonic benefits from the media (Okazaki, 2008) , as affective social exchange theory noted that engaging in interpersonal communication has a positive effect on affective outcomes by satisfying hedonic gratification (Choo and Petrick, 2014; Ha et al., 2015) . Unlike SNS social dependency, SNS informational dependency is exclusively related to cognitive gratification, such as searching for information, learning, and knowledge acquisition (Nambisan and Baron, 2007) .

In this light, two types of SNS dependencies should act differently in the relationship between perceived credibility of rumors and accuracy-oriented information seeking. Compared to SNS social dependent users, SNS informational dependent users can be more pertained to the accuracy-oriented information seeking to fully understand their current situations with accurate knowledge. Following this line of logic, we postulate that the effects of perceived credibility of rumors on information-seeking behavior will differ depending on the different levels of SNS dependency under the high risk situation in which MERS occurred. Specifically, we expect that persons who rely on SNS for their information will be more motivated to verify facts than persons who rely on SNS for social purposes. Based on these expectations, the hypotheses and research questions are posed: H1. In a high risk situation, SNS dependency (social and informational) will moderate the relationship between perceived credibility of rumors and the accuracy-oriented information seeking.

RQ2. Does SNS social dependency moderate the relationship between the perceived credibility of rumors and the accuracyoriented information seeking? If so, does the moderating effect of SNS social dependency differ from the moderating effect of SNS informational dependency?

.

To summarize the above hypotheses and research questions, the proposed designed model is presented in Fig. 1 below.

MERS hit South Korea in 2015, and the whole nation has been suffering from MERS since May 20 of that year; of the infected 186, 38 people have died of the epidemic, the largest outbreak outside of the Middle East.

Over two months, the public was afraid of being infected by the syndrome and was in panic. The South Korean government was criticized by the public for not handling the syndrome in a timely manner. In addition, the government did not immediately disclose key information about the status of the syndrome to the public. According to a Washington Post report released on June 8, 2015, the government specifically did not share the list of hospitals where the infected had been treated, which contributed to the people's lack of faith in the government. The nation's former health minister Moon Hyung-pyo made official apologies to the public at a news conference, saying, 'The spread could have ended much earlier if we had reacted more thoroughly in the initial stage. I feel very sorry about that' (Seo and Fifield, 2015) .

Amid growing uncertainties and fear among the public, rumors were circulated across the nation, largely via social media. For instance, one rumor said, 'The MERS patient was confirmed at Yeouido St. Mary's Hospital so you should not visit' and was spread through SNS, but the hospital later refuted the message (Jhoo, 2015) . That applying petroleum jelly would prevent MERS infection was also disseminated among online users; calling himself a Middle East expert, one user posted in an online message that a fatsoluble substance such as petroleum jelly would block the water-soluble MERS from permeating throughout the body. The message was, however, countered by medical experts (Ahn, 2015) . Such false rumors created chaos around the country, confusing the public.

This study collected rumors that were actually spread during the MERS attacks in South Korea and conducted an online survey of South Koreans in their 20 s through a South Korean research company. Previous research on social media shows that more than 90 percent of undergraduates are Facebook users (Lampe et al., 2008) with largely focusing on college students (e.g., Stutzman, 2006) . With the existing research in mind, this study assumed that social media dependency is explicitly shown among young adults and expanded participants to twenties across the nation. This is because MERS was not a small issue for certain universities but a huge issue for the whole nation (Song, 2015) . The company used proportionate-stratified sampling weighted on gender based on the 2015 South Korean in their 20 s population census data (723,000 for men and 725,000 for women for a total of population in 20 s; 155 for men and 157 for women participated in the survey). Participants were randomly selected from the company's survey poll. Survey participants received a small monetary reward (approximately $1) as a form of appreciation for their participation in the research.

Before survey begins, researchers first asked, 'The below are false rumors about MERS that spread through SNS in 2015. Have you ever received at least one of the five rumors presented below?' The survey respondents were confined to those who had received at least one false MERS rumor through SNS among the five rumors which were presented. A total of 312 persons answered the survey questionnaires. After invalid answers were eliminated, the survey data from 297 respondents were analysed. Detailed items for each variable are presented below.

Researchers asked respondents, 'During the spread of MERS, how much credibility did you place in the aforementioned MERS rumor messages?' The perceived credibility of the MERS rumors was measured in the current study with six questions: 'At that time…' (a) I thought the rumors that I received were believable; (b) I thought the rumors that I received contained accurate information; (c) I thought that the rumors that I received were based on truth; (d) I thought that the rumors that I received contained enough information; (e) I thought that the rumors that I received provided objective information; (f) I believed the rumors that I received (Flanagin and Metzger, 2000; Roberts, 2010; Rosenthal, 1971) . These questions were answered on a 5-point Likert-type scale that ranged from 1 (not at all agree) to 5 (very strongly agree). Internal consistency for the perceived credibility of the rumors was measured using Cronbach's α, with reliability coefficients of 0.953. After summing all scores of the items, we divided by the number of items to create the mean value. (M = 2.58, SD = 0.89). 3.2.2. SNS dependency (social, informational) Following Kim et al. (2015) , we measured SNS dependency on a 5-point scale that ranged from 1 (not at all useful) to 5 (very useful). SNS social dependency measurement items were: (a) consider how to act with friends, relatives, or people you work with; (b) get ideas about how to approach others in important or difficult situations; (c) have something to do with your friends; (d) have fun with family or friends; (e) be a part of social events you enjoy without having to be there (Cronbach's α = 0.829. M = 3.21, SD = 0.75). In contrast, SNS informational dependency, which focuses on obtaining information by using SNS to better understand the situation, was composed of three items: (a) I usually get information through SNS; (b) I utilize information gained from SNS; (c) I immediately update information received from SNS. All items were measured on a 5-point scale that ranged from 1 (not at all agree) to 5 (strongly agree) and calculated as a mean value (Cronbach's α = 0.664. M = 3.19, SD = 0.75).

As noted, information seeking is defined as people's overall information-related activities (Wilson, 1999 ) motivated by the desire to find missing information (Case, 2012) . Given that the current study particularly aims to examine the accuracy-oriented information seeking, the items were rated on a 5-point Likert-type scale that ranged from 1 (not at all agree) to 5 (very strongly agree). Referring to previous studies (i.e., Hart et al., 2009) , I created the items to measure how carefully the respondents sought additional information after they heard the MERS rumors in order to find accurate information, asking ""After I received the MERS rumors, I made the effort to…"" (a) find out more facts about the message contents; (b) check whether the messages contained factual information; (c) find rebuttals regarding the message contents; (d) check the accuracy of the information; (e) reach the best conclusion; (f) know additional facts about the message contents. Items were summed and divided by a number of items (Cronbach's α = 0.914. M = 3.16, SD = 1.09).

As the control variables, this study used gender (0 = male, 1 = female), the perceived credibility of the South Korean government, and feelings toward MERS. The perceived credibility of the government was included because trust in the South Korean government was closely linked with the nationwide spread of rumors, such that low trust in the government prompted the spread of rumors. The item was measured using a 5-point Likert-type scale (1 = do not trust the government at all, 5 = strongly trust the government). Lastly, feelings toward MERS were measured using four elements: uncertainty, fear, anxiety, and feeling terrified and also were measured on a 5-point scale (1 = do not feel at all, 5 = strongly feel), based on the consideration that different levels of feelings affect information seeking (Johnson et al., 2002) . Table 1 shows the demographic profiles of the respondents in the current study. Survey responses from a total of 297 participants (male 49.8%, female 50.2%) who were in their twenties were analysed in the study, and the respondents reported perceiving the South Korean government's credibility as relatively low (M = 1.98, SD = 0.87). The mean value of the respondents' feelings toward MERS-uncertainty, fear, anxiety, and feeling terrified-was high above the median (M = 3.42, SD = 0.98) (See Table 2 ).

Partial correlational analyses, controlling for gender, South Korean government credibility, and feelings toward MERS, revealed that all of the analysed variables have low level of correlations. The correlation value between rumor credibility and SNS social dependency (r = 0.047, p = ns), rumor credibility and accuracy-oriented seeking (r = 0.059, p = ns), SNS informational dependency and accuracy-oriented seeking (r = 0.108, p = ns) was not significant. Meanwhile, SNS informational dependency showed a significant relationship with SNS social dependency (r = 0.319, p < .001) and rumor credibility (r = 0.314, p < .001) at low levels. Table 1 Descriptive statistics for the demographic and other control variables (N = 297). 

In order to examine the effect of the independent variables on the dependent variable and the interaction effects of SNS dependency, this study used hierarchal multiple regression from Step 1 through Step 3. We first entered gender, the South Korean government's credibility, and feelings toward MERS in Step 1. The independent variable and moderators were entered in Step 2. Then, the interactions were entered in

Step 3. Before we tested for any interaction effects, the perceived credibility of rumors and the SNS dependency values were all mean-centered in order to reduce the variance inflation factor and consequently displayed no multicollinearity (Field, 2009) .

The effect of rumor credibility and the moderating effects of SNS dependency on the accuracy-oriented information seeking were tested in order to examine RQ1, H1, and RQ2. All of the control variables were found to influence the accuracy-oriented information seeking (gender: β = −0.122, t = −2.074. p < .05; government credibility: β = 0.101, t = 1.774. p < .10; feelings: β = 0.329, t = 5.353. p < .001). The findings indicated that women were more likely than men to seek additional information with the aim of verifying the accuracy of the rumors. Additionally, people with strong beliefs in the government and more negative feelings toward the syndrome sought additional information to verify the accuracy of the rumors. RQ1 concerns whether the credibility of rumors would be associated with people's seeking additional information to verify the accuracy of the rumors. The results showed that rumor credibility did not affect accuracy-oriented information seeking (see Table 3 ).

Then, we added regression results in Table 3 to ModGraph-I program Ver. 3.0 developed by Jose (2013) . As shown in the graph, the three straight lines represent different categories of SNS informational dependency (high, mid, low). Regarding H1 and RQ2, SNS informational dependency interacted with rumor credibility (β = 0.107, t = 1.915. p = .056). The P-value of the R 2 change in Step 3 was found to be marginally significant at the traditional 0.05 level, indicating that the moderators statistically affected the relationship between rumor credibility and the accuracy-oriented information seeking. However, SNS social dependency was not found to be a moderator in the accuracy-oriented information seeking. These findings partially supported H2. Fig. 2 presents how SNS informational dependency moderated the relationship between rumor credibility and the accuracyoriented information seeking. The lines depicted in the graph show that high levels of SNS informational dependency had a stronger effect on the positive relationship between rumor credibility and the accuracy-oriented information seeking than lower levels. The interaction indicates that users who depend on SNS for information were more affected by rumor credibility than participants who did not rely on SNS for information when finding accurate information regarding the MERS. For the respondents who did not use SNS Table 2 Partial correlation result for analysed variables.

J. Lee, Y. Choi Telematics and Informatics 35 (2018 ) 1071 -1081 mainly to seek information, their beliefs in the rumors had little impact on their accuracy-oriented information seeking.

The primary objectives of this study were to better comprehend rumor communication in the SNS era and to explore how rational communication was actually constructed during the 2015 spread of MERS in South Korea. Specifically, this study set a goal to examine how false rumor credibility affects accuracy-oriented information seeking and further, whether SNS social and informational dependency moderate this relationship. Based on the assertion that accuracy-oriented information seeking is essential in a desirable society where deliberative democracy is materialized by an informed public (Weeks, 2000) , this study began with the premise that it is important to learn how people seek additional accurate information after they hear false rumors that are later found to be not true. Hence, this paper placed emphasis on accuracy-oriented information seeking based on previous arguments that accuracy goals help people to reach the most desirable conclusions (Chaiken et al., 1996) and have critical viewpoints toward rumors (Crescimbene et al., 2012) .

Overall, the findings for the proposed hypothesis and research questions were as follows. With regard to RQ1, regarding the relationship between rumor credibility and accuracy-oriented information seeking, rumor credibility did not influence accuracyoriented information seeking. This result implies that when people believe rumors, they may find more information to gratify their interests and curiosity (hedonic gratification) or to build a sense of closeness (integrative gratification), rather than to acquire accurate knowledge (cognitive gratification). Particularly in a risky situation, high levels of perceived rumor credibility may prompt curiosity and interest in the contents of rumors, leading people to seek additional information to satisfy their information needs. As behaviors of spreading rumors stem from the feelings of curiosity and intimacy with others (Fine et al., 2005) , those who have high credibility of rumors also want to feel close intimacy with others and to satisfy curiosities by searching over what others have talked over the rumors. This result represents that people do not always seek for accurate information when they are uncertain.

The culture as well as politics of South Korea can also explain the non-significant result between rumor credibility and accuracyoriented information seeking. After an outbreak of MERS, the then conservative South Korean government was found to control key public information, generating people's concerns, anger, and anxiety (Power, 2015) . Given such confusing situations, rumor credibility itself could have not led people to find accurate information. Rather, many other factors including political orientation (conservative or liberal) may prompt accuracy-oriented information seeking. In general, as liberal people tend to distrust the current South Korean government compared to conservative side, they may try to find more accurate information, regardless of how much rumors credibility they have. Additionally, the collectivistic culture of South Korea can cause them to seek out information in order to more satisfy their hedonic needs instead of cognitive needs. People living in a collectivist culture tend to put more emphasis on intermingling such as relationships with family, friends, colleagues, and etc. (Cho and Cheon, 2005; Kim et al., 1998) . Therefore, they may want to stick with their acquaintances by getting know more about rumors-related stories. In this sense, rumor fact-checking can be done by many other factors, rather than perceived credibility of rumors.

Regarding H1 and RQ2 which questioned the moderating effect of SNS dependency on the relationship between rumor credibility and the accuracy-oriented information seeking, SNS informational dependency showed an interaction effect with rumor credibility on the accuracy-oriented information seeking. Cognitive gratification stems from the U&G theory offers a good starting point for explaining how SNS informational dependency moderates the relationship between perceived credibility of rumors and the accuracyoriented information seeking. It can be inferred from the finding that people who use SNS mainly for obtaining information and have high beliefs in SNS rumors perceive the rumors as imperative information rather than merely social gossips. Once SNS informational dependent users believe rumors, they feel more needs to gratify their desires to learn, which prompt their motivations to find accurate information. Their perceptions of rumor credibility affect their desires to find accurate information because they use SNS for verifying J. Lee, Y. Choi Telematics and Informatics 35 (2018 ) 1071 -1081 the contents of rumors and for acquiring more knowledge and information, focusing on cognitive gratification. For SNS informational dependent users, high levels of credibility of rumors reflects need for cognition, which explains the extent to which people think deeply about received information, thus making an effort to assess the information critically (Metzger and Flanagin, 2015) . Also, the credibility of rumors motivates SNS informational users to think flexibly, termed as flexible thinking (Metzger and Flanagin, 2015) , thus increasing their intentions to search more contradictory information as an effort to evaluate the given rumors critically. Different from using SNS for social purposes that results in increasing affections as affective social exchange theory notes, SNS informational dependency can lead individuals to have critical thoughts under ambiguous situations. Building from these deductions, additional studies would be of interest regarding how information-dependent SNS users have different motivations and how their behaviors relate to information-seeking behaviors. Taken together, this study has significant conceptual implications in a number of aspects. Aiming to expand the understanding of rumor communication, this study focused on the credibility of rumor messages as the independent variable in an effort to determine the effect of credibility on information seeking. Perceived credibility of rumors is imperative for studying the context of rumor communication because it is related to the formation of reasoned communication under risky situations. In this sense, understanding how rumor credibility helps to construct or endanger an informed public is critical. Second, this paper extends the understanding of rumor communication by examining SNS. In contemporary society, the ways in which rumors are disseminated have undergone drastic changes. People are more likely to use SNS than ever before to disseminate false rumors that are spread quickly through SNS (Doerr et al., 2012) , which raises the necessity to examine SNS rumors in today's society.

Third, in examining the participants' SNS dependency, this study differentiated between social and informational dependency. The strength of this study is the consideration of individual differences in the functions that SNS provides for users, and the recognition of different aims that information seeking behavior may be attempting to accomplish. The results indicate that the two types function differently in the interactions with rumor credibility, supplementing previous studies regarding SNS dependency, which has not been elaborated in depth on the different dimensions of SNS dependency (e.g. Kim et al., 2015) . Lastly, examining people's behaviors with the aim of constructing rational communication after they receive rumors is another imperative step that this study performed in extending the understanding of rumor communication. By dividing information-seeking behaviors into the quantity and accuracy-oriented, this study distinguished itself from previous rumor studies that did not deeply consider people's actual efforts to eradicate irrational communication behaviors that includes non-accuracy motivated rumor spreading behavior. Because an informed public is a prerequisite for constructing a deliberative democracy (Weeks, 2000) , determining people's actual efforts to build up rational communication against irrationalities is imperative for communication researchers to contribute to societies' well-being.

In conclusion, this paper offers valuable implications for understanding the public's actual behaviors in seeking information in the context of rumors and for how credibility and SNS dependency affect these behaviors in the era of Web 2.0. It underscores how certain factors affect the formation of an informed public. At the same time, this paper found that SNS can play a role in constructing a public sphere depending on individuals' motivations for using it. Thus, it is difficult to perceive SNSs as merely unofficial channels because of the lack of professional gatekeepers, which was argued in previous studies (Leberecht, 2010; Mendoza et al., 2010) . The role of SNS in rumor communication is differentiated depending on the motivations for using SNS and on psychological factors including the credibility of rumors. In this way, SNS can function in both positive and negative ways in constructing an informed public.

To our knowledge, this study made a first attempt to assess the effects of people's perception about specific incorrect information on their information seeking behaviors. This study contributes to the growing field of research on information seeking through social media platforms. From the findings of the present paper, in the context of rumor communication, the dearth of information that leads to low perceived credibility is not an exclusive factor in seeking more and accurate information, which is essential in a rational society. Considering that SNS dependency affects information seeking behavior, especially in the era of Web 2.0, the important point is individuals' effortful attempts to be exposed to as much accurate information as possible in order to block false rumors from being circulated and to use SNS in an informational way. From these efforts, SNS can function positively as providing a true public sphere in which laypeople can receive and share accurate information and build up rational communication against the spread of false rumors.

Despite seminal findings, this study also contains some limitations. First, participants were limited to 20 s in this study. Although the selection of participants was based on past research showing people in their 20 s are heavy social media users, generalization of this study is limited. Second, although other types of information seeking can be found, the present study only focused on accuracyoriented information seeking. Additional research on exploring different types of information seeking can expand discussions on information seeking. In line with this limitation, this study only examined SNS social and information dependency. Because people use SNS for many different reasons, future studies are required to expand the discussions. Finally, the present study is based on the certain incident and limited to South Koreans. Future research is required to examine other incidents and compare between people in different cultures.

Social determinants of health inequalities: towards a theoretical perspective using systems science,"A systems approach offers a novel conceptualization to natural and social systems. In recent years, this has led to perceiving population health outcomes as an emergent property of a dynamic and open, complex adaptive system. The current paper explores these themes further and applies the principles of systems approach and complexity science (i.e. systems science) to conceptualize social determinants of health inequalities. The conceptualization can be done in two steps: viewing health inequalities from a systems approach and extending it to include complexity science. Systems approach views health inequalities as patterns within the larger rubric of other facets of the human condition, such as educational outcomes and economic development. This anlysis requires more sophisticated models such as systems dynamic models. An extension of the approach is to view systems as complex adaptive systems, i.e. systems that are 'open' and adapt to the environment. They consist of dynamic adapting subsystems that exhibit non-linear interactions, while being 'open' to a similarly dynamic environment of interconnected systems. They exhibit emergent properties that cannot be estimated with precision by using the known interactions among its components (such as economic development, political freedom, health system, culture etc.). Different combinations of the same bundle of factors or determinants give rise to similar patterns or outcomes (i.e. property of convergence), and minor variations in the initial condition could give rise to widely divergent outcomes. Novel approaches using computer simulation models (e.g. agent-based models) would shed light on possible mechanisms as to how factors or determinants interact and lead to emergent patterns of health inequalities of populations.","Health outcomes are increasingly perceived from a systems approach that is more holistic and non-reductionist [1] . The author in a recent paper extended the systems approach to incorporate principles of complexity science and to conceptualize population health outcomes as an emergent property of a dynamic and open, complex adaptive system [2] . The current paper explores these themes further and applies the principles of systems approach and complexity science (i.e. systems science) to conceptualize social determinants of health inequalities (SDHI). The paper begins with a brief overview of the existing models of SDHI, and then proposes a two step approach to remodel our perspectives and outlines possible implications.

Interest in studying social influences of population health outcomes dates back to at least the 19th century. Pioneering researchers in this area include Rudolf Virchow who reported on the role of political economy and poverty in causing an epidemic of plague in Upper Silesia of Prussia, and Friedrich Engels on the link between high mortality and poor living conditions of the working class in England [3] . Subsequently Salvador Allende's work in Chile attempted to show the role of social and political factors in generating health inequalities in populations [3] .

More recent expansion of a population-based approach to inequalities includes the work of Geoffrey Rose in the 1980's [4] . He distinguished between causes of incidence of a population group and causes of disease in individuals. The extreme example he proposes was to assume that every member of society smoked 20 cigarettes a day, which if investigates through cohort studies and case-control studies, will lead to the conclusion that incidence of lung cancer is determined by genetic predispositions. These smoking patterns are a reflection of social norms, values, traditions and their customs, in a historical context. Thus, societies with lower per-capita rates of smoking have a significantly lower incidence of lung cancer. The balances or imbalances of norms and social structures within the population lead to distinct patterns of individual behaviours in smoking rates or varying rates of disease prevalence or incidence among social groups, i.e. inequalities. Sick individuals represent the extremes of the population mean.

Recent literature uses the term social determinants of health inequalities (SDHI) to denote contexts, social norms, social structures, and their determinants. Three main pathways have been advanced to explain the generation of health inequalities from the social environment [5] .

(a) ""Social selection"", or social mobility which implies that health determines socioeconomic position, rather than the reverse. Thus, healthier persons will move towards better socioeconomic positions, compared to less healthier, leading to inequalities. (b)""Social causation"" proposes that a range of unequally spread material, psycho-social and behavioural factors, give rise to inequalities in health outcomes [6, 7] . Material factors include varying income levels and investments across infrastructure beneficial to the community. Psychosocial factors are the chronic stresses that arise from perceptions and experiences of personal status in an unequal society. Behavioral factors are, for example, the higher rates of smoking observed in poorer groups that lead to differential rates of diseases and mortality [8, 9] . (c) A ""life course perspective"" suggests that a multitude of factors across the life span (e.g. maternal malnutrition during fetal period, poor educational facilities in childhood, occupations with physical hazards etc.) determine and manifest disease trends observed over time. The ecosocial approach attempts to integrate these ecological, social and biological factors in disease causation through a dynamic process of their 'embodiment' i.e. ""we literally incorporate biological influences from the material and social world"" [10, 11] . There are several biological pathways that explain how social environment gets 'embodied' on health. One is the 'stress biology approach' whereby stress leads to chronic stimulation of the hypothalamo-pituitaryadrenal axis and the resultant hormonal changes increase risks of hypertension, insulin resistance, and hyperglycaemia [6] . The other relates to the advancing field of epigenetics, i.e. non-genetic modifiers of gene expression that are transmitted to future generation. They provide an explanation as to how environmental effects convert to lasting physiological changes and behavioral changes. An example is how psychological stress alters DNA methylation and histones in stress-sensitive brain regions such as the hippocampus, amygdala, and prefrontal cortex. These changes modulate subsequent gene expression [12] . Another pathway is through modifications of telomeres in dividing somatic cells. Telomeres are DNA repeat sequences, which together with accompanying telomere-binding proteins, cap and protect chromosome ends. Their length shortens with each cycle of replication, which is an expression of accelerated ageing as this process ultimately leads to a loss of capacity to replicate. It has been shown that lower socio-economic groups demonstrate shortening of the length of telomeres, thus suggesting that these groups acquire features of accelerated ageing with its consequences [13, 14] .

The Commission of SDH (CSDH) re-conceptualizes health inequalities by integrating these theories and concepts further [5, 15] . They describe SDHI to have a context, structural mechanisms and socioeconomic positions of individuals. It assumes a crucial role for the ""context"" which includes social systems (e.g. education system, labour market), culture (e.g. racism and caste) and political systems (e.g. structure of the state, redistributive policies). The structure of the state in relation to welfare and redistribution of wealth is recognized as a dominant institution. The 'context' should be viewed as a dynamic concept, having a historical past, a present and future trajectory. Structural mechanisms that are rooted in institutions and processes within the context generate stratifications in society according to socio-economic position, income or wealth, educational achievements and access, occupation, gender, race/ethnicity and other dimensions. These are inter-related dimensions and could act as proxies for each other. For example, in a heavily market-driven individualized society, incomes or wealth are good proxy indicators for socio-economic position. The socioeconomic position in turn is a key stratifier in most contemporary societies and reflects a hierachical system consisting of power, prestige and access to resources.

The SDHI operate through a group of intermediary determinants to mould health outcomes. The main groups of intermediary determinants of health are: material circumstances (e.g. quality of housing, exposure to pollution, financial means to purchase quality food, and work environment); psychosocial circumstances (e.g. levels of stress and social support); behavioural factors (e.g. rates of tobacco and alcohol consumption, nutrition and physical activity) biological factors (e.g. genetic predisposition to diseases in different population groups) factors) and the health system (e.g. access to quality care in populations). Increasingly, research evidence reports a widening range of influencing material circumstance (such as availability of safe water and sanitation, agricultural policies and food security, access to health and social care services, unemployment, under-employment and working conditions, access to housing, the living environment, access to education, and availability of transport) [15, 16] . Those holding higher positions in the hierarchies of social stratification (e.g. higher socio-economic position or most affluent) would hold an advantageous position in accessing resources, information and environments that are more favourable to better health outcomes.

An implicit and explicit recognition of an inter-related web of factors functioning as a system runs through the above discourse. Rose's concept of causes of incidence in a population group, implies that the population functions as a cohesive 'whole' or system, rather than being a mere collection of independent individuals. Similarly, the concept of SDHI proposed by the CSDH describes a system that consists of elements such as, a context, structural mechanisms, and intermediary determinants. These are related both as influencers as well as through feedback mechanisms.

However, as with most concepts related to health outcome, SDHI implicitly and explicitly accepts certain elements of a Newtonian view of reality (i.e. reductionism, linearity and hierarchy) [2, 17] . An example of this reductionist approach is the descriptions of a single factor that influences health outcomes (e.g. socio-economic stratification of mortality due to asthma) and selecting interventions that focus on a single determinant (e.g. improving thermal comfort in houses that have inadequate warmth) [18] . Another assumption prevalent in this discourse is linearity, which assumes that determinants of inequalities can be applied across a wide range of contexts. For example, differential access to healthcare or education is explicitly or implicitly assumed to lead to variations in outcomes, almost in a linear fashion [6, 7, 17] . This view does not give adequate credit to unintended consequences commonly seen in reality. For example, mobile phones have improved connectivity, but their use while driving have become an important cause of road traffic accidents, a feature that was never predicted at the outset. Another key concept is the role of hierarchies or power, position and access to resources (e.g. in the understanding of socio-economic position). The concept of hierarchies is implicitly used to explain the process of SDHI as exemplified by terms such as proximate or distal determinants of health inequalities. This indicates a clear path of influences that arise 'distal' to the population group (e.g. labour laws that determine wage structure) and affect it through more 'proximal' factors that are closer to the population (e.g. income) [6, 7] . The statistical methods of estimating the effects of determinants also imply other features of the mechanistic reductionist paradigm. Earlier generation of studies used relatively simple statistical models such as Odds Ratios [19] . These methods assume that explanatory variables have a cause and-effect-pathway (i.e. unidirectional path of influences) and do not encompass positive or negative feed-back loops between the outcome variable and explanatory variables. For example, poor education leads to higher probability of ill-health, which combined together lowers the level of employment and ability to generate income, which in turn influences the ability to live in a more affluent neighbourhood and therefore reduces opportunities for further education, and higher grades of occupations, as well has increases exposure to more polluting environments. They also ignore interrelations among individuals. For example health education could have a positive health impact on an individual, that could indirectly improve the health of the individual's friends. More sophisticated statistical methods, e.g. generalized linear models such as multiple regression, logistic regression and Poisson regression, account for multiple explanatory variables and to those that are not normally distributed. However, these analyses do not include feedback loops and interrelations among individuals. The latter require multilevel or hierarchical regressions models [20] . They 'implicitly assume that these effects can be isolated from each other and do not allow for feedback loops or reciprocal interactions between groups and individuals, or between outcomes and predictors' [21, 22] .

Systems science combines systems theory and complexity science. Systems theory states that properties of a complete system cannot be predicted by disaggregating, analyzing and exploring its individual constituent parts alone [23] . Complexity applies systems theory to open and adaptive systems (i.e. complex adaptive systems) and views health outcomes as an emergent property of such systems [1, 2] . The next sections propose a two-step process to visualize SDHI from a systems science perspective, firstly, by shifting away from a reductionist paradigm towards a systems approach and secondly, by enriching this with principles of complexity science.

In applying the systems approach, a point of departure from the conventional model of thinking is to consider population health outcomes as one of many components of the human condition or the 'standard of living' of a population. This human condition has several other facets or components such as educational attainment, economic well-being, and social status. These components too exhibit patterns of inequalities, in a manner similar to health outcomes. Health inequalities should be viewed as patterns in health outcomes that arise in association with other patterns of human condition, and lie within this milieu. Extricating health outcomes from these other human conditions and exploring it individually is therefore arbitrary, though justified on grounds of interest, existing disciplinarity and convenience of tackling one component at a time SDHI can be visualized from a systems approach using a matrix that captures at least part of the elements of the human condition system. Each group of columns will represent a facet of the human condition (e.g. health outcomes, educational attainment). For comparison between countries, the parameters should be uniform and preferably continuous variables. The bundle of parameters in health outcomes could include life expectancy at birth (LEB), vaccination rate of children at 5 years, inverse of infant mortality rate (IMR), inverse of maternal mortality rates (MMR), and inverse of childhood malnutrition rates. Similarly, the parameter bundle on educational attainment could be percentage enrolment by 6 years, percentage in secondary level education, and per-capita investment in education, and for socio-economic status, the per-capita income, and employment rates. Each row could be for a particular year or for specific intervals (e.g. 2005 to 2010). An appropriate colour coding for the parameters will give rise to a pattern in the matrix that will be a fingerprint of the human condition of a particular country. The whole matrix represents the totality of the human condition as an output. A similar method of visualization is used to illustrate worldwide trends in life expectancy at birth from 1970 to 2010 published in the Human Development Report [24] . This process will also demonstrate the disadvantages of narrowing our perspective to a particular health outcome (e.g. obesity rates) or its determinants (e.g. physical activity). When such single parameters are selected from the matrix, we are in reality focusing on a single facet of health outcomes extracted from a column of the matrix. Instead, the preferred option is to express data on several other health related outputs such as IMR, MMR, LEB, and morbidity rates. This will immediately highlight unintended consequences, a feature of complex adaptive systems. Once a predetermined bundle of health outcomes are used to describe health, e.g. LEB, IMR, and MMR, comparisons between countries or regions become easier.

The second step is to incorporate an inequalities dimension to this form of visualization. This could be done on standardized measures of inequalities or stratifiers (e.g. across income or wealth or educational attainment, or geographic region) over a period or 10-20 years (see Fig. 1 ).

This will allow tracking of trends within a country. For example, a stratifier such as income could impact across several categories of the human condition. This impact could be visualized using the following summary measure of inequalities: a) Health inequalities: Odds Ratios between highest and lowest income quintile in parameters such as IMR, MMR, under-5 year vaccination rates, childhood nutrition, LEB b) Educational attainment: Odds Ratios between highest and lowest income quintiles in education such as primary school enrollment, secondary school enrollment, and tertiary education. c) Inequalities in social capital: Odds Ratios between highest and lowest income quintiles in measures of social capital, contact with social networks,

One option is for individual countries to have several of these charts, one for each stratifier, and track selected measures of inequalities (e.g. ratios of IMR, LEB, MMR, primary school enrollment) over a period (e.g. every 5 years). Each cell will be filled by the result of the Odds Ratio. In order to give an immediate visual impression, a simple set of rules could be observed to colour the cells in the matrix. The colour coding could be such that the cells showing extreme values of a ratio (e.g. above an Odds Ration of 2) and having the widest the inequalities will receive red colour and the least receive green, with other intermediates receiving light green, yellow, and orange. The precise values at which the colour transits would be arbitrary (e.g. one may choose a ratio of 2 and above to be red and below 0.5 to be green) See Fig. 1 .

However, it is necessary to be consistent in order to allow for comparisons along the time axis and between countries or regions. A series of matrices developed for each stratifer in a country, could be analysed subsequently using hierarchical clustering algorithms (e.g. hierarchical clustering and k-means clustering) and computational methods (e.g. organizing maps and artificial neural networks) [25] . Hierarchical clustering will produce a 'tree' of those cells that are closest to each other (e.g. those with closest values as percentages). Heat maps can also be used to illustrate the clustering and it increasingly used to describe multimorbidity [26] . Such analyses from individual countries and the emerging patterns of health outcomes will give invaluable insight on the processes that are involved in giving rise to these particular patterns. It is possible that this method will demonstrate clusters of inequality measures that would not be expected from usual epidemiological parameters. An analogous situation was seen with data from acutely ill patients in Intensive Care Units, where by clusters of physiological parameters were observed that could not be defined by conventional knowledge [27] .

The third step is to view the system as a dynamic entity and to include dynamic dimension to the approach. Describing outcomes at a given time is a mere snapshot of a dynamic process and analogous to prognostication of diabetes and its risks by using a single random blood glucose level. Extending this further, the predictions become more robust if a series of observations are made and this dynamism is incorporated into the model by using rates of change of parameters (e.g. rate of decline of IMR). Parallels are seen in systems medicine where serial analyses of the pulsatile secretion of insulin (rather than fasting insulin) was found to be an early feature of diabetes rather than a single value [28] . Data can now be gathered relatively inexpensively using crowd-sourcing techniques (i.e. gathering information by engaging with a large number of people usually via the Internet) and real-time surveillance of information in Twitter and other social media [29, 30] . 

A systems approach views the human condition and their determinants as causes as well as outcomes. They are interlinked in a causal web, rather than a linear path of social determinants leading to a range of health outcome. The feedback loops lead to outcomes influencing their causations. For example, low income and deprivation lead to poorer health outcomes, which in turn makes the group even poorer and worsening health outcomes. In order to operationalize the above, more sophisticated models such as systems dynamic models are required [31] [32] [33] . Analogous models are now being developed for specific disorders such as obesity [34] .

A systems approach to SDHI emphasizes the role of the context in determining health inequalities. The relationships between the variations in health outcomes and other parameters would be more or less unique to that particular system. The interpretation of the outputs is heavily dependent on the context and less generalizable across different nations, social groups, or environments. This is yet another reason to explore natural experiments to identify causal pathways and interventions for a given context [21] .

The next advance is to incorporate complexity science to the systems perspective. This will require perceiving the patterns of human condition in a given population group to be an emergent property of a complex adaptive system (CAS). The latter is a special type of system that is 'open' to its environment, with non-linear interactions among a dynamic set of other interconnected systems and subsystems. Other systems include the political system (e.g. the predominant political governance system), the physical environment (e.g. pollution levels or transport), and biological systems (e.g. genetic predispositions), within the context of a larger social system [2] . One could position this within the context of global ecosystems (e.g. the biosphere, the atmosphere, the hydrosphere, geosphere and cryosphere).

A feature of a CAS is that it has emergent properties, i.e. it is almost impossible to predict precisely what it the larger system will evolve to, by using knowledge relating to the interactions among its components and sub-components [35] . Rather than mathematical modeling where equations are the basis of the model, some complexity scientists use simulations using computer-based programmes (e.g. Python) [36] . The building blocks of these simulation models are considered to be as fundamental and irreducible as mathematic equations, and are being hailed as a 'new kind of science' [37] .

If the analogy of the matrix of SDHI used in the previous section is applied, the picture will be one of continuously changing colours and patterns that are not predictable. Complexity scientists would mimic these patterns through computer simulations using simple rules that describe the inter-relationships among parameters. Of the commonly used computer simulations, those most likely to mimic patterns of health outcomes seen in the matrix model are agent-based models, cellular automata, and networks.

Initial work on agent-based models by Schelling showed that segregation in a city (often attributed to racial discrimination) can be simulated by simple rules applied to a grid where each cell represents a house [38] . Consider an example where 90 % percent of houses are occupied randomly, either by blue or red, in approximately equal proportions. A programme will simulate future scenarios if they follow two simple rules: place each house where at least 2 of 8 encircling them are of similar colour as the house, and avoid the cell if they have one or none of same colour. Within a few iterations, the emerging model begins to mimic cities that are segregated by race, poverty, or social status. These simulations provide evidence (but no proof ) that several alternate pathways could potentially explain urban clusters of race or poverty, rather than discrimination. Extrapolating to health outcomes, they challenge area-wise aggregation of health outcomes are through pathway such as the neighbourhood effects or the effects of urbanization on health outcomes [38] .

Cellular automata is another simulation where the programme places lines of square cells next to each other (e.g. you fill the cell with a black cell, if two of the eight cells around the cell of interest are black) as in a checker board [37, 39] . The interesting observations include the following: minor changes in the rules and initial conditions lead to emergence of widely divergent patterns, some lead to recurring patterns, and similar patterns arise with different starting points and different set of rules. If this metaphor is applied to SDHI, it illustrates the uniqueness of the context to a particular pattern of health outcomes in a population, and the theoretical possibility that widely divergent determinants lead to similar patterns of outcomes in different situations.

Networks perceive systems as interlinked webs. The strengths and numbers of links among nodes can be varied to generate emergent properties mimicking reality. Milgram pioneered the concept of small world networks, in which the degrees of separation between two individual members is considerably small compared to the given population [40] . This was illustrated by an experiment that showed an average six intermediate acquaintances separate any two people on the planet. Thus a highly infectious disease could theoretically spread to all 7 billion on the globe in about six incubation periods! Another improvement of this simulation is to incorporate the highly connected super-spreaders who are disproportionately relevant to rapid spread of the disease, called scale-free networks [41] . In this model, new members of the network connect preferentially to those who already have a large number of contacts (i.e. analogous to individuals befriending the most popular members of a network). The resulting number of contacts per individual takes a power-law distribution. The recent epidemic of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) was such an example where a significant proportion of the infections were due to 'super-spreaders' [42] . These networks resemble patterns observed in the spread of information along social networks and obesity in geographic areas giving rise to amazing patterns of spread [43] .

Characterizing outcomes of the human condition (including health inequalities) as patterns that emerge in a complex adaptive system has several implications. Firstly, isolating health outcomes from the other human conditions are problematic because they are features or dimensions of a larger picture and therefore more sophisticated forms of systems analyses will be required to shed light on SDHI. Secondly, emerging patterns of a complex adaptive system cannot be estimated with precision by using the known interactions among its components (such as economic development, political freedom, health system, culture etc.). Different combinations of the same bundle of factors or determinants can give rise to similar patterns or outcomes (i.e. property of convergence), and minor variations in the initial condition could give rise to widely divergent outcomes. This questions the ability to generalize with precision, the determinants of health outcomes from one contextual environment to another. Thus the favoured models would be those developed for the particular context using longitudinal data and using systems dynamics of feedback and interrelationships. Finally, computer simulation models (e.g. agent-based models) would shed light on possible mechanisms as to how factors or determinants interact and lead to emergent patterns of health outcomes of populations. The metaphor needs to shift from the current visualizations of health outcomes as rigid bar diagrams demonstrating the step-wise gradient to a more vibrant multi-coloured canvass with changing hues.

BMC Public Health Identifying strategies to improve access to credible and relevant information for public health professionals: a qualitative study,"Background: Movement towards evidence-based practices in many fields suggests that public health (PH) challenges may be better addressed if credible information about health risks and effective PH practices is readily available. However, research has shown that many PH information needs are unmet. In addition to reviewing relevant literature, this study performed a comprehensive review of existing information resources and collected data from two representative PH groups, focusing on identifying current practices, expressed information needs, and ideal systems for information access.","The need for improved access to high quality public health (PH) information has been echoed in various forums involving public health professionals, librarians, and information professionals since the mid 1990s [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] . The information needs of the PH workforce have become all the more urgent with the increasing frequency of emergence of new infectious diseases such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Asian bird flu, as well as the increasing concern about acts of bioterrorism, such as spreading anthrax spores via the US Postal Service in 2001.

A major difficulty in meeting these needs is the great breadth of the PH discipline which makes it difficult to identify and collect a body of evidence-based literature to address the growing multitude of specific PH information needs. The PH workforce may be more diverse than any other group of health professionals [6] and includes professionals trained in dozens of disciplines [3, 5] , ranging from environmental health to veterinary medicine, from sanitary engineering to epidemiology.

Studies of the information needs of PH professionals have addressed information seeking behaviors of PH workers, obstacles to information access, and defining and classifying the specific types of information needed. Reports of studies focusing on how PH workers look for the information they need note that many PH professionals have been slow to adopt electronic information-seeking behaviors, sometimes because of the time required for users to acquire the requisite skills and other times because access to electronic databases is not available [7] [8] [9] . Studies focusing on obstacles to electronic access to and use of evidence-based information in the PH field [1] [2] [3] 5, [10] [11] [12] [13] have identified many relevant obstacles including: (1) limited awareness of the importance of evidence-based information to inform practice and lack of encouragement from opinion leaders to seek it; (2) limited awareness of what information is available electronically and from what sources; (3) limited access to computers, the Internet or email; (4) limited skills needed to access the information sources and lack of ease of use; (5) a diverse array of content needs requiring access to databases from many disciplines (and in other languages); (6) limited time to sift through the poorly filtered information that is returned by searches using sets of search terms inadequate for PH concerns; (7) limited ability of decision-makers to appraise the methodological quality of research; and (8) the paucity of systematic reviews of PH topics.

Lynch [14] suggested that information accessing needs among PH professionals often focus on immediate problem-solving and not on answering open-ended academic research questions. Investigators focusing on the kinds of information needed by PH professionals [5, 6, 14] have noted the need for diverse kinds of information including the grey literature and unpublished studies, practice guidelines, research studies and systematic reviews. These investigators also point out the need for information that is effectively summarized and synthesized. There is also a need for linkages among multiple databases as well as providing access to databases related to best practices, outcome measures, statistical information, policy updates, and information that may be unique to a particular location or region. Nutbeam [4] has formalized a valuable four-level typology of increasingly informative levels of research knowledge in the PH field. Nutbeam's model does not, however, include grey literature that may be needed to assist PH decision makers when the evidence needed to inform urgent PH issues is incomplete.

Access to evidence-based public health information has become a growing concern for medical librarians. In 1997, the National Library of Medicine along with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and other agencies launched the Partners in Information Access for the Public Health Workforce project to begin to address this concern. The Evidence-Based Practice for Public Health (EBPPH) Project at the Lamar Soutter Library of the University of Massachusetts Medical School was initiated in 2001. This Project initially focused on identifying resources available to clinical medical practitioners and PH practitioners for locating, summarizing, synthesizing and disseminating evidence-based information. It then compared resources available to clinical medical practitioners to those available to PH practitioners. We found that there were many more types of resources focused on clinical medical practice than on PH practice. The clinical medical resources were based on several different models of information search, summary, synthesis and delivery, and some of the most promising models had little or no presence in the PH arena.

To explore and address this gap, the EBPPH project sought to examine and classify the features of the clinical evidence-based medicine resources, to assess their potential for improving access to the PH literature, and to develop new models that could effectively address the unique needs of PH professionals. EBPPH also works on identifying other existing projects aimed at synthesizing, summarizing or improving access to evidence-based PH information and publishes links to effective evidencebased resources it has identified via its website [15] .

This article presents the results from a qualitative study undertaken by the EBPPH project that combined three objectives that previous investigators had generally pursued individually: (1) characterization of information needs of PH practitioners, (2) identification of typical information seeking behaviors, and (3) assessment of barriers to information access. We have used the insights gained from the study to inform the construction of an extended classification of the types of information needed by PH professionals and of a hypothetical model for PH information access that could meet their needs for access to diverse credible sources.

Jenicek [16] defines evidence-based public health practice as the conscientious, explicit, and judicious use of current best evidence in making decisions about the care of communities and populations in the domain of health protection, disease prevention, health promotion, and health maintenance and improvement. We too are using the term ""evidence-based"" to refer to the best available evidence that is both credible and of the highest known quality.

The research project team of four consisted of 1) the Lamar Soutter Library Director with a DA degree, 2) one of her staff members with an MPH degree (both had formal training in qualitative research techniques provided by the qualitative research consultant), 3) a medical consultant with an MD and expertise in medical informatics (quantitatively trained with prior experience working with the qualitative research consultant on other qualitative studies), and 4) a qualitative research consultant with a background in software development, a PhD in organizational and human development, and expertise in teaching and applying qualitative methods in a variety of studies related to medical and PH interventions. All four participated in the development of interview questions and the conduct of focus groups as well as reviewing the findings and developing the models.

The EBPPH research process was a seven-step process (See Figure 1 ). The first step was to identify and characterize existing information resources available to medical and PH professionals. The second step was to collect data on information accessing needs, behaviors, and barriers via individual interviews from one domain of PH practice, communicable disease control. Thirdly, after findings were analyzed, they were presented to a focus group of PH professionals previously interviewed along with examples of information accessing resources currently available to gather additional input on information accessing needs.

In the fourth process step we used information gathered to revise the individual interview script and make it more specific for interviewees in a second, but related domain of PH practice -community health promotion. The fifth step involved analysis of this new data and construction of a preliminary hypothetical model with features to meet the information accessing needs identified by the participants. In step 6 an analysis of the findings from both domains, examples of existing resources, and the hypothetical model were reviewed in a focus group with Community Health Promotion staff previously interviewed. As a result of step 6, we revised the hypothetical model to reflect the feedback gathered in the last focus group.

The research protocol used for this study was approved by the Committee for the Protection of Human Subjects in Research at the University of Massachusetts Medical School, IRB Docket #H-10507.

We chose subjects for our study from the Massachusetts Department of Public Health (MDPH) because of ongoing relationships between investigators and MDPH employees and because of the proximity of the Department offices to the EBPPH project site. We focused on the Bureau of Communicable Disease Control (BCDC) and

EBPPH research process steps Figure 1 EBPPH research process steps.

Step 1 -Identify existing PH and medical information resources and features

Step 2 -Develop individual interview script and interview participants from Communicable Disease Control

Step 3 -Focus group to present findings and existing information access resources & features to Communicable Disease Control participants for feedback

Step 4 -Revise individual interview script and interview participants from Community Health Promotion

Step 5 -Develop hypothetical model system for collecting, organizing and disseminating information responsive to findings of our research

Step 6 -Focus group to present findings from both groups, existing information access resources, and hypothetical model and features to Community Health Promotion participants for feedback

Step 7 -Revise hypothetical model in response to reactions of focus group the Bureau of Family and Community Services' Community Health Promotion (CHP) groups because they are both relatively large groups and because these two groups were likely to represent a significant portion of the broad spectrum of information needs in PH in general. One group deals primarily with prevention and control of communicable diseases (BCDC) and the other with health promotion related to prevention and control of chronic disease (CHP).

The Director of each sample work group was asked to provide names of individuals in his/her group who most often needed access to information from multiple sources. Twelve potential interviewees were selected by the BCDC Director from the program areas of tuberculosis prevention and control; epidemiology and immunization; sexually transmitted disease (STD) prevention and control; refugee and immigrant health; and library services. Eight potential interviewees from the CHP group were selected by their Director in the areas of cancer, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease prevention and control; nutrition and physical activity; and women's, men's and elder health. An email message was sent to each of those selected requesting agreement to participate and interviews were scheduled by either email or telephone. All twelve of the BCDC interviewees suggested participated in the individual interviews while seven of the eight approached from CHP participated. Seven of the BCDC informants (60%) participated in a follow-on focus group at a later time. Three CHP employees previously interviewed (43%) participated in the CHP follow-on focus group. The professionals in our sample ranged from information technologists, librarians, trainers and program directors to medical directors and division directors. Informants held various degrees in nursing, public health, medicine, veterinary medicine, and other specialties.

Data were collected from the two sample groups first via 45-minute individual interviews with all participants. During later focus groups, lasting about an hour and a half, preliminary findings were reviewed and validated and additional data were collected as participants reacted to PowerPoint slides presented describing existing information sources and accessing features. A hypothetical model for PH information access was also presented at the second sample focus group for feedback. All individual and group interviews were audiotaped. Individual interviews were transcribed verbatim, and the qualitative research consultant listened to the focus group tapes and took notes of study participants' comments related to information accessing features presented as close to verbatim as possible.

Based on a technique developed by LaPelle [17] , we employed Microsoft Word to transcribe data into tables of text responses where coding and sorting of text segments can be done based on theme codes. Our thematic analysis approach rests heavily on the qualitative research techniques described by Crabtree and Miller [18] [19] [20] , Miles and Huberman [21] , and Patton [22] . Transcribed textual data from interviews were reviewed by the qualitative research consultant through a continuous process of comparing data segments to other data segments, looking for similar or repeated ideas to be conceptualized as themes.

A continuously evolving codebook was developed defining themes identified in the interview script as well as subthemes as they emerged from repeated readings of the data. The transcripts in the Microsoft Word table structures were coded thematically in a table column adjacent to the relevant text segment using the preliminary draft of the codebook. Codebook development and coding were conducted solely by the qualitative research consultant. After sorting coded text segments via the Microsoft Word Table Sort function, coding validity was assured by reviewing the text that sorted into each code, correcting those that were miscoded and resorting. Some themes were further deconstructed creating additional subthemes after sorting when this seemed appropriate. Within-transcript analyses and data reduction were done, proceeding to cross-transcript analyses. A comparison table was constructed to compare summarized responses related to each significant theme across participants for each group. Subsequently findings were compared across groups. At each stage in the data analysis and reduction, findings were reviewed with other members of the project team. Additionally, findings were reviewed with participants from each sample at the focus groups for further validation.

The EBBPH medical consultant identified existing resources delivering information to medical practitioners and to PH professionals. These were advertised via mailings, email promotions, and vendor displays at academic meetings and identified in discussions with clinical and PH professionals who were intensive consumers of medical and PH information. He also performed informal Internet searches using Google. Through the use of trial and full subscriptions, the consultant informally explored the resources he identified and catalogued the features of these resources. The key access, formatting and content features these resources offered are listed in Table 1 : (1) keywords for searching large collections of research reports and reviews, (2) pre-formulated search filters, (3) automatic notification (e.g. periodic emails to subscribers with information on recently published research reports), (4) abstracts or summaries of research reports sometimes associated with commentaries, (5) systematic reviews, (6) evidence-based guidelines, (7) comprehensive knowledge sources, (8) within article indexing with links that allows access to the specific information needed, and (9) archiving capabilities.

The individual interview script was developed by the project team. The BCDC script included questions about the types of work tasks informants performed that required access to information, currently used and preferred information sources, preferred format for research information, current barriers to information access, and desired enhancements for access [see Additional file 1]. Individual interviews with BCDC professionals were done in person at their workplace by the project's qualitative research consultant hoping to observe their electronic information accessing behavior where possible. Those who were very computer literate or had sizeable offices met with her in their offices and were comfortable demonstrating how they accessed their preferred electronic sources. However, many either had no space in their offices to hold the interview or accessed most of their information in ways that were not easy for us to observe. The individual interviews with BCDC informants took place in the fall of 2003.

A follow-on focus group was held in the spring of 2004. The focus group agenda for BCDC included reviewing a summary of findings from their interviews for validation followed by a PowerPoint presentation on several existing website examples of PH information organization and dissemination (see Table 1 ) to ascertain their familiarity and preference for specific features of these models. The focus group was conducted by project team members without a detailed script.

The individual interview script for CHP participants used the BCDC script as a basis but was modified by the project team to add more specific questions regarding listservs providing links to current information, systematic reviews and comprehensive knowledge bases based on inconclusive findings in these areas from interviews with the BCDC participants [see Additional file 2]. Individual interviews with CHP professionals were conducted by the project's qualitative research consultant by telephone since most in-person interviews with BCDC participants had not yielded opportunities to observe their information accessing behavior directly. The individual interviews with CHP informants took place in the summer and fall of 2004.

Step 5 -hypothetical model development Following the individual interviews with CHP informants, we developed a preliminary hypothetical model of information reformulation, organization and access based on our interpretation of CHP informants' responses to the interview questions and prior findings from the BCDC informants.

The focus group agenda for CHP included reviewing a comparison of findings from BCDC and CHP, validation of CHP findings and a review of existing information accessing website examples (see Table 1 

Professionals at MDPH have a wide variety of needs for information and varied significantly in their level of skill in accessing it. All MDPH staff we interviewed had desktop computers and access to the Internet. MDPH itself hosts a multi-faceted website that provides access both for employees and for the general public to programmatic information, statistical databases and MDPH documents.

The main MDPH offices are located in multiple sites in the Boston area. The CHP group and the BCDC are located in different office buildings, each of which includes a small library staffed by part-time librarians offering document search and retrieval services. However, the urgency of information needs differed widely within and across programs, and use of external electronic information sources also differed widely due to variation in both need and skills.

The nature of the work of the two groups also differs. BCDC is concerned with both established and emerging communicable diseases and needs fast-breaking news about emerging diseases such as SARS as well as evidencebased information about more established diseases like tuberculosis. CHP deals primarily with health promotion related to chronic diseases and is involved in working with external coalitions to develop statewide collaborative prevention and control plans for diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular disease and diabetes. However, there is also significant overlap in the information accessing needs of these two groups.

Six distinct categories of information emerged from the participants' statements about the kinds of information they required in their work: (1) early reports on newly identified health risks and preventive behaviors; (2) Examples of the kind of information currently accessed by the participants in each of the six categories and typical associated sources of information can be found in Table 2 .

Those we interviewed in their offices demonstrated how they accessed many of the source examples in Table 2 , provided website information, or gave us sample copies of information available from these sources. The sources included websites, electronic automatic notifications often via listservs, journals, presentations at meetings, and personal communications. Websites and general search engines were commonly used to seek out the most relevant information. Email was a key means for receiving automatic notification via listservs and exchanging a variety of types of information. Existing listservs for PH professionals typically provide information from news sources and selected titles, abstracts, and links to recently published journal articles and other documents relevant to specific disciplines or diseases. A few informants who were less comfortable with Internet access to information still relied on hard copies of relevant journals that were circulated within their workgroup. The telephone and attendance at conferences provided other important means of accessing information, especially on emerging health threats and new PH practices.

We found that there were significant limitations on the available means of information access identified by participants that could be met by improving electronic access mechanisms. Stating that there were too many relevant websites to search them all effectively or regularly, both groups wanted one portal access to all categories of information via a good search engine. To address delays in becoming aware of important new information, they also wanted automatic notification of newly available information in areas specific to individual interests. They felt websites and automatic notification systems such as listservs were complimentary. Participants in both groups reported feeling bombarded with unfiltered, often duplicative information in emails and from participation in listservs with no way to screen out irrelevant information. They reported similar difficulties dealing with irrelevant and duplicative returns from searching websites because PH-specific keywords are not standardized or used effectively by search engines. Both groups expressed a need for better mechanisms for selecting and filtering information sought from listservs and via search engines.

Both groups noted limitations on access to information in selected PH sub-domains of interest. BCDC professionals noted information gaps in the areas of STDs and refugee and immigrant health. CHP professionals cited limitations on information in areas such as environmental links to cancer, elder health, legislative and policy change nationally and in other states, and newly identified health risks and healthy behaviors. CHP and BCDC informants identified problems in accessing relevant information from related domains outside of traditional PH domains such as in the literatures of marketing, human resources management, organizational behavior, operations management, and others. They would like to be able to formu-late searches, for example, that could access a broad range of databases to find evidence related to: (1) return on investment for worksites implementing health programs;

(2) programs that have been developed in worksites related to communicable or chronic disease prevention;

(3) effective educational strategies to reach employees in worksites; (4) effective interventions to motivate, men, women, elders and other specific population groups to take care of their health; (5) effective quality improvement projects in healthcare organizations; and (6) best practices related to communicable diseases in emergency rooms. They also identified limitations on access to grey literature as well as systematic reviews and full-text of journal articles. Informants stated that not many extensive sources exist for systematic reviews and summary information of interest to PH; however, a few participants were not aware of those that do exist, e.g., the Guide to Community Preventive Services [24] .

Many also expressed difficulty keeping track of information they wanted to save for future access and wanted better mechanisms to archive information accessed earlier in a way that could facilitate easy retrieval. Informants also expressed needs for training in electronic accessing skills and the availability of human-mediated searching via article retrieval services.

In response to the information content, format and access concerns raised by informants we developed a hypotheti-cal model for PH information access grounded in findings from our data analysis [See Additional file 5 for quotes supporting the features included in the model.] The model (See figure 2) includes PH-specific keywords, userselected filters, and pre-formulated search criteria for tailoring information sought via both automatic notification systems and search engines; an automatic notification mechanism that would send information to users that has been filtered according to the user's filtering requests; a scanning and reviewing system to locate, critique/review, and provide links to newly published information relevant to PH professionals, and a customized archiving database of credible information accessed by system users.

In early 2005 when we presented this model to the CHP participants, the component at the top right said simply ""newly published PH information."" We initially presented the model as an approach to accessing and delivering information that appeared in PubMed. Respondents stated that to be very useful the model would have to facilitate access to information from other sources and disciplines not represented in PubMed. It should also reference descriptions of best PH practices and other information often found in the grey literature. In response to this concern, we added the phrase ""in diverse disciplines of interest"" to the model component on sources of information in the upper right of figure 2 . Respondents liked the idea that information would be reviewed before it was disseminated. They expressed a desire to receive a narrative cri- tique of the information from the reviewers and not just numerical ratings expressing the reviewers' findings.

Other information accessing needs identified fell primarily into the category of grey literature and statistical data. These included the ability to search conference websites via a single portal for cutting edge information and expert contact information; access via keyword search to information the CDC has on programs being implemented in other states; easy access to news articles about what is happening statewide related to health programs in schools and other venues; and a database ""mecca"" for surveillance data.

In general, our respondents confirmed many of the findings of others who have investigated PH information needs [5, 6, 14] including the need for access to a wide variety of types of information from a number of different disciplines and the need for improved means to effectively and efficiently identify the information most relevant to specific problems. We believe that our study also adds detail, depth, and updating to preexisting characterizations of PH information needs in several areas: (1) categories of information needed, (2) typical present-day sources of information and common means of accessing information, and (3) perceived limitations of access and proposals for overcoming those limitations.

Six categories of PH information emerged from both groups in our study (see Table 2 ). The six categories can be arrayed along a continuum based on the amount of available research evidence supporting each of the categories. On the continuum shown in figure 3 , we have separated category 5 into two categories: published research reports and meta-analyses/systematic reviews to emphasize the difference between these two resources. The resulting seven-category continuum ranges from limited research support for early descriptions of emerging health threats and new interventions on the lower end of the continuum, through increasing amounts and quality of evidence for the types of information farther along the continuum.

Our classification of PH information extends the typology developed by Nutbeam [4] in that it covers the full range of information needed to inform PH decision-making from basic descriptive data to evidence-based guidelines. Our categories 3-7 are also an expansion of what Brownson [25] calls type 2 evidence or evidence that focuses on the relative effectiveness of specific interventions to address a particular health condition.

Like clinicians practicing medicine, PH practitioners are regularly confronted with new problems and complex tasks that require a timely response, often before researchers can complete studies to offer guidance. Our study con-

Hypothetical model for PH information access presented to CHP informants. firms the findings of others that PH practitioners need access to information at all levels of research support on the continuum in figure 3 . Anderson et al [26] highlighted the need for PH practitioners to access information supported by limited evidence and to weigh the credibility of this information before using it in PH decision-making related to urgent issues that cannot wait for conclusive evidence to accumulate.

Participants identified several limitations in information access and in some cases suggested means for overcoming those limitations. The limitations could be classified in three broad categories: (1) limitations affecting timely and convenient delivery of information including limited access to electronic full text of journals, (2) limitations in access to all categories of information in some content areas (i.e., disciplines outside traditional PH) and in the grey literature, and (3) limitations in locating information that is available, including problems with search terms and in organizing archives.

Participants did not specifically identify as a problem the very limited availability of summaries, commentaries and critiques of PH studies, even after we had presented to them examples of these resources from both PH and clinical medicine. We hypothesize that one reason informants did not report this limitation is that they have had little or no experience working with these types of resources. It is possible that as more summaries, commentaries and critiques become available to PH practitioners that their desire for more of these resources may increase. Participants did identify the need for access to systematic reviews of interventions that are more population-based and PHoriented. One of the few resources we identified that has begun addressing this need broadly is the recently developed Health-Evidence.ca website [27] that provides an online registry of systematic reviews of PH interventions. This project, funded by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research and conducted by Dr. Maureen Dobbins, searches for systematic reviews in a variety of databases of published literature including PubMed, CINAHL (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature) [28] , EMBASE [29] , Sociological Abstracts [30], BIOSIS [31] , and PsycINFO [32]. Selected reviews are rated by two independent reviewers. Review information is stored in a searchable registry. The site also provides summaries of the reviews but has not yet included access to unpublished work. Other databases that present summaries of synthesized evidence-based practice information for public health professionals are more limited, such as the Cochrane Health Promotion and Public Health Field website [33] which addresses only a tiny fraction of common public health issues currently, or more specialized, such as the Australian databases for occupational thera-pists, OTseeker [34, 35] , and physiotherapists, PeDro [36, 37] .

The informants offered a number of potential approaches for overcoming the limitations they identified in timely delivery, access, and location of information. They stated a preference for overcoming these limitations via enhancements made to sources and means of information access they were already using such as PubMed and listservs.

To overcome limitations in timely delivery of information, participants suggested that improved access to the full text of journals in electronic form would be critical. Many of the biomedical journals that publish articles relevant to PH professionals are already available in electronic versions, but the cost of offering access to these journals to dozens or hundreds of PH practitioners can be daunting for any local or state public health entity. However, there are some examples in other countries where this has happened. The Clinical Information Access Program (CIAP) [38, 39] in New South Wales, Australia, and similar systems in other Australian states, have provided access to over 55,000 clinicians in the public health workforce with access to in excess of 400 such publications by government negotiations for reasonable cost licenses for very large populations. An extensive evaluation of this system is being undertaken to examine how availability of such information influences practices.

Many informants from both groups in this study were already receiving news and automatic notification of newly published studies via listservs. Unfortunately comprehensive listservs are available for only a few PH disciplines (e.g., TB Update [60]). Our findings suggest that developing listservs that organize and deliver relevant new information for more PH disciplines may be an effective way to meet some key information needs.

A serious limitation of listservs identified by several subjects is that they tend to deliver large amounts of information in formats that make it difficult for a user to quickly seek out specific information relevant to his/her interests. We are aware of several technical means that some listserv administrators are using to deal with this problem. Items in an email can be linked to an index that appears as the first entry in the email. Links take the user to content contained in the email or on a website. Content developers for clinical medical automatic notification services are using two other techniques to help users avoid receiving irrelevant content: (1) breaking content into many subdomains and allowing users to select to receive information from specified subdomains and (2) engaging volunteer users in a process of filtering content by having them rate the quality and relevance of new information before it is delivered to all the users. Adoption of some or all of these strategies by the developers of PH listservs could effectively address some of the concerns raised in our study.

The request for access to a broader base of information from fields outside of traditional PH disciplines was driven by the need to develop effective evidence-based policies in emerging areas of PH practice such as designing environments to promote physical activity or increase pedestrian safety and developing economic justifications to encourage businesses to introduce health-related programs. CHP informants suggested that access to information from other industries, professions and disciplines would be needed including information from the realms of social marketing, advertising, sociology, engineering, human resources management, and others. Some of this information is contained in journals serving the disciplines of interest, which can be searched through reference databases such as CINAHL, EMBASE, Sociological Abstracts, BIOSIS, PsycINFO, and others. Access to infor-mation in these journals by PH professionals would require establishing access to the reference databases and to print and/or electronic access to the journals themselves. In domains beyond the biomedical, it is likely many PH professionals, like those in this study, do not have skills to efficiently gather evidence or formulate searches. Either the appropriate keywords and data sources are not known to PH professionals, or concepts and keywords that are familiar to them, such as ""intervention venues"" or the ""built environment"" related to injury prevention, are not used in the other disciplines.

Even when PH professionals have ready access to a database of relevant biomedical information such as PubMed, our subjects indicated that locating useful information is hindered by the paucity of PH-oriented search terms. For example, they stated a need for search terms like ""evaluated"", ""cost-effective"", and/or ""population-based interventions"". Development and adoption of more standardized PH search terms could make searches more effective and also facilitate the task of filtering listserv emails. Developers of the Health-Evidence.ca website Continuum of research support for common categories of public health information have not only provided access to systematic reviews of PH interventions but have also made strides in addressing the need for PH-specific search terms. These developers have generated their own set of PH keywords related to domains of PH, population characteristics, intervention sites, intervention strategies and types of reviews (metaanalysis, narrative or systematic).

Pre-formulated search filters use combinations of existing search terms to facilitate identification of information that meet predefined criteria. In clinical medicine, a set of filters aimed at identifying publications reporting high quality, evidence-based studies has been developed, tested and made accessible for routine use in PubMed (PubMed Clinical Queries [41] ). The Partners for Information Access for the Public Health Workforce project [42] has developed dozens of pre-formulated searches aimed at locating information in PubMed relevant to specific Healthy People 2010 goals [43] . Wilczynski et al [44] have developed a set of search filters for PubMed to enable efficient retrieval of articles relevant to healthcare quality and costs based on several criteria related to methodological rigor (appropriateness, process assessment, outcomes assessment, costs, economics, and qualitative research) [45] . Although some of our respondents were familiar with some available filters, they did not appear to be using filters on a regular basis to access information. There is clearly a need to develop and promote more and better search terms and filters for PH since these will be important for locating studies for reviews and for skilled and interested users.

The field of public health is so broad that any study of this sort is limited to collecting data in a few domains in a limited number of settings. Caution is advised in generalizing our findings more broadly to communicable and chronic disease prevention and control practitioners, especially those in city or county health departments or working at the federal level. Also, further investigation is needed in other unrelated PH disciplines to test applicability of findings in these areas because of the wide variation in content and nature of PH practices. Another limitation is that our interviews and group discussions may have been biased towards PH workers with the most interest in information issues.

It seems clear from our study that it is likely that many critical information needs of PH practitioners are not being met efficiently or at all; however, incremental improvements to PH information access are being made. Projects like Health-Evidence.ca and Partners in Information Access for the Public Health Workforce are emerging.

The increasing availability of all types of information on the Internet and ongoing improvements in search methodology and website organization are also occurring, but the task is complex and enormous, and progress seems to be slow. It is our assessment that tools and resources available to clinical medical practitioners are more advanced and sophisticated than those available to PH practitioners. The former include tools such as information sources that summarize and critique findings from research reports (e.g., Cochrane Systematic Reviews) [46] ; those for identifying and accessing a broad range of information including basic facts, research findings, expert opinion, and sometimes associated evidence ratings (e.g., electronic texts such as UpToDate) [47] ; automatic notification services (e.g., bmj.com Email alerting service) [48]; and periodic, discipline-specific literature updates with summaries and commentaries (e.g., Journal Watch) [49]. We believe one reason for this is that the market for information-related products for medical practitioners is large enough and lucrative enough to attract large investments in many new and creative ventures. The result is a proliferation of well-designed electronic texts, multiple sources of expert summary and critique of the literature, sophisticated and highly tailored automatic notification systems, and many other resources. A second reason that PH practitioners have fewer resources available to them is a lack of good primary research in PH that can be systematically reviewed [3, 26] ; however, PH practitioners also do not always have ready access to the best evidence that is available such as basic facts and expert opinion.

Based on our findings from this study, we believe that PH could benefit from a dual strategy for advancing information access. One strategy is the promotion of incremental improvements in existing information sources and access mechanisms, such as providing better and more PH-specific search filters for PubMed and developing more sophisticated listserv applications for disseminating automatic notifications. Initially respondents in this study seemed to favor improvements in simple tools and resources they were familiar with over new and more complex models of information access. This suggests that incremental changes may be more rapidly accepted and adopted than new and unfamiliar systems. However, the generally positive reception to our proposed information access model by the CHP informants, suggests that a welldesigned new system that clearly addresses expressed needs could be well received. Given that products are emerging that address some of these needs such as Health-Evidence.ca, the Partners in Information Access for the Public Health Workforce website, and the PubMed Health Services Research Queries discussed earlier, there is a clear need to integrate complementary efforts rather than duplicating what has already been done. This cannot be accomplished without collaboration across projects, stakeholders, funding sources, and even national borders.

Unraveling the complexities of disaster management: A framework for critical social infrastructure to promote population health and resilience,"Complexity is a useful frame of reference for disaster management and understanding population health. An important means to unraveling the complexities of disaster management is to recognize the interdependencies between health care and broader social systems and how they intersect to promote health and resilience before, during and after a crisis. While recent literature has expanded our understanding of the complexity of disasters at the macro level, few studies have examined empirically how dynamic elements of critical social infrastructure at the micro level influence community capacity. The purpose of this study was to explore empirically the complexity of disasters, to determine levers for action where interventions can be used to facilitate collaborative action and promote health among high risk populations. A second purpose was to build a framework for critical social infrastructure and develop a model to identify potential points of intervention to promote population health and resilience. A community-based participatory research design was used in nine focus group consultations (n ¼ 143) held in five communities in Canada, between October 2010 and March 2011, using the Structured Interview Matrix facilitation technique. The findings underscore the importance of interconnectedness of hard and soft systems at the micro level, with culture providing the backdrop for the social fabric of each community. Open coding drawing upon the tenets of complexity theory was used to develop four core themes that provide structure for the framework that evolved; they relate to dynamic context, situational awareness and connectedness, flexible planning, and collaboration, which are needed to foster adaptive responses to disasters. Seven action recommendations are presented, to promote community resilience and population health.","Recent disasters, such as the oil spill in the Gulf, the tsunami and nuclear reactor leak in Japan, global pandemic, and the earthquake in Haiti have all demonstrated the complexity of responding to events which cross jurisdictional, organizational and other forms of boundaries. Complexity is a characteristic of large scale events, but also manifests in routine disasters such as floods, tornados, outbreaks and hazmat events that occur more frequently. All these events present high levels of uncertainty and require collaborative action between multiple sectors, which are part of complex adaptive systems (Ansell, Boin, & Keller, 2010; Okros, Verdun, & Chouinard, 2011; Wyche, Pfefferbaum, Pfefferbaum, & Norris, 2011) .

Complexity theory and its basic tenets such as emergence, self organization, non-linearity, adaptiveness, and connectivity, are well suited for studying the dynamic and collaborative nature of disaster management. This theory has been useful in the analysis of complex adaptive systems, such as health care organizations, providing knowledge to assist with policy development, and design of information technology and work environments that support nonlinear processes that characterize the provision of patient care (Burns, 2001; Coiera, 2011) . Systems characterized by change, particularly those crossing jurisdictional boundaries, cannot be analyzed without consideration of the dynamic context influencing operations (Ansell et al., 2010; Cilliers, 1998) . The complexity frame of reference recognizes the interactions among system components, and between a given system and the larger environment (Coiera, 2011) , and is now recognized as an essential lens for disaster management and resilience-oriented development (Kahan, Allen, George, & Thompson, 2009) .

Each phase of a disaster has distinct objectives and its own degree of complexity, including time demands, organizational involvement, and functional needs for collaboration (Kahan et al., 2009; Wyche et al., 2011) . As observed during the 2009 influenza A pandemic, the response phase tends to be the most visible, yet depending on the event, the response can be quite short, whereas recovery efforts may extend for weeks, months and years (Norris, Stevens, Pfefferbaum, Wyche, & Pfefferbaum, 2008) . The 2010 earthquake in Haiti exemplifies this. The acute response spanned several months, yet recovery will continue for years, and will continue to require extensive collaboration between Haitian and international agencies to develop the infrastructure to promote population health and resilience in the country. Likewise, following the relatively short response phase for the 2003 outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), recovery and planning efforts to prepare for the next global outbreak have been ongoing for nearly a decade (Public Health Agency of Canada, 2009; Reissman, Watson, Klomp, Tanielian, & Prior, 2006; World Health Organization [WHO] , 2009).

Disasters are typically managed locally, however they become increasingly complex when the impacts cross jurisdictional boundaries and outstrip community resources (McConnell & Drennan, 2006) . Discussions of systems of critical infrastructure tend to focus on securing and protecting hard capital resources, such as facilities, supplies (e.g. vaccines), technology, and equipment. Recognition of soft capital (e.g. people and knowledge) has been slower, and there is a need for deeper understanding of the dynamics of critical social infrastructure and how it influences community capacity. Several authors have recognized this gap and suggest more empirical studies focused on social infrastructure such as communication networks, social capital, collaboration and community engagement, and methods for evaluating resilienceoriented intervention activities which focus on soft infrastructure are needed (Chandra et al., 2011; Sherrieb, Norris, & Galea, 2010; Wyche et al., 2011) .

Complexity theory provides an appropriate lens for modeling social infrastructure in a disaster context for several reasons. First, disaster management, which is dynamic and adaptive, involves cross boundary integration and a diverse mix of people. Second, previous literature has expanded our understanding of the complexity of disasters, but few studies have examined empirically what the necessary ingredients for crisis management are at the grass roots, micro level, and how dynamic elements of critical social infrastructure influence community capacity. This gap in the literature is particularly apparent with respect to protecting and promoting the health of high risk populations, who are people at heightened risk for negative impacts from a crisis, due to the intersection of the social determinants of health (O'Sullivan & Bourgoin, 2010) . These groups are reliant on community supports for activities of daily living, and when these supports are compromised, high risk populations, particularly people with complex medical needs, are at even greater risk for health and social problems, which create additional demands for health and social services.

Interventions to support disaster management have been published, such as checklists of essential tasks to be completed during disaster response and information systems to support aspects of complex collaboration, such as awareness and development of communities of practice (Carroll, Rosson, Farooq, & Xiao, 2009 ). However many interventions focus on macro outcomes, without relating to the complexity of inputs at the micro level, and there is a lack of emphasis on upstream initiatives to address the complexity. Mapping of hard and soft system infrastructure, and how they contribute to managing uncertainty in disaster management, is a gap that has not been adequately addressed in the literature. We suggest the development of resilience-oriented interventions requires unpacking of the complexity at the micro level, and that interventions must emerge from the underlying complex structure including dynamic organizations, processes, technology and people; therefore an essential first step is to model the complexity inherent in the social infrastructure of a community.

The purpose of this study was to explore empirically the complexity of disasters at the micro level, emphasizing the voices of community stakeholders, to determine levers for action where intervention strategies can facilitate collaborative action and promote health among high risk populations. A second purpose was to build a framework for critical social infrastructure informed by the emergent themes from this study and existing literature on community resilience, and develop a model to identify potential points of intervention. This study was conducted as part of The EnRiCH Project, which is a community-based participatory research study focused on enhancing resilience and emergency preparedness among high risk populations.

This study employs a community-based participatory research design. Over the past two years, partnerships have been established with emergency management, health, and social service agencies in five communities in Canada to promote community resilience and emergency preparedness among high risk populations. The communities were selected to represent different geographic and linguistic groups, as well as the presence of complex hazards (e.g. trepid climate; being a hub for transportation; or being located on a flood plain). As part of the broader project objectives, asset/need assessments were conducted in each of the communities between October 2010 and March 2011. The theoretical framework used to guide data collection combined Norris et al.'s (2008) components of resilient communities and Kailes and Enders's (2007) functional needs framework. The tenets of complexity theory were used for data analysis to 1) unpack issues around resilience and functional capabilities assessment, and 2) identify potential points of intervention.

The asset/need assessments involved nine focus group consultations across five communities, using the Structured Interview Matrix (SIM) facilitation technique (O'Sullivan et al., 2009) . We planned two focus groups per community (one evening and one daytime session), to ensure broad representation, however, in one community we canceled the evening session due to low recruitment. In another community, the second session was held on a Saturday, rather than an evening.

The number of participants per session ranged from (n ¼ 9) to (n ¼ 26), with lower participation in the evening sessions. Participants (N ¼ 143) were recruited for the focus groups via distribution of email notices, using purposeful sampling to recruit professionals and volunteers from emergency management, health and social service organizations. Additional recruitment techniques involved snowball sampling as the community members became aware of the sessions and disseminated information through their networks. Broad inclusion criteria ensured representation from different sectors, and fostered inclusion of community groups representing high risk populations. In each community there was representation from municipal or regional emergency management, public health, tri-services (e.g. fire, police, paramedic), emergency service organizations, food banks, and associations which advocate or provide direct care for people with disabilities. Multi-generational representatives from high risk groups participated in the focus groups, including stroke survivors and their family caregivers, several people who are hard-of-hearing or Deaf, people with low (or no) vision, and people who use assistive devices, such as a cane, wheelchair or service animal. The focus groups were conducted in English in three communities and French for the other two. Sign interpreters were provided for participants from the Deaf community and notetakers were provided for people with limited vision or fine motor control, to ensure they could participate. All participants signed a consent form approved by the university ethics review board prior to participating in the focus groups. Ethics approval for the study was obtained on July 23, 2010.

The SIM format for the focus groups involves three phases of data generation and collection. The room is set up with four tables and each table is assigned a different question. The first phase is a series of one-on-one interviews where each participant spends 5 min with a participant from another table and asks them to respond to a specific question. The participant who is the interviewer writes down the response in the form of field notes, whereas the participant being interviewed voices his/her thoughts about the question without the pressure of speaking in front of the whole group. The process is repeated until each participant has interviewed one person from each of the other tables and also responded to the questions from each table. The facilitator guides the group so participants know how to proceed through the matrix. Following the interview matrix, the participants return to their assigned table for the small group deliberation phase, to review and summarize the data from the interviews. Data during this phase is in the form of conversations as the people at each table discuss the responses they received to their question during the interview phase. Each group identifies 3 main findings to present to the larger group during the next phase, which is a facilitated plenary discussion with all the participants.

The SIM design has been used in previous studies to address common pitfalls in traditional focus groups (O'Sullivan et al., 2009) . It is designed for larger groups (10e40 people), yet enables voices of all participants to be heard, and provides a structure to reduce power differentials within the group. In this study, we repeated the phases twice, to generate data for eight questions which focused on strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats to disaster preparedness in each community, with emphasis on protection of high risk populations with functional needs related to communication, complex medical needs, supervision, independence and transportation. The questions were informed by the CMIST functional needs framework (Kailes & Enders, 2007) . Sample questions included: ""What are the strengths/assets/resources within your community that contribute to preparedness for, response to, and recovery from a disaster?"" (the same question was asked in relation to weaknesses/vulnerabilities) and ""In a disaster in your community, what supports and challenges would appear for people who have limited ability to communicate (due to disabilities affecting communication, being socially isolated, or communication technology being down)?""

The data generated from the focus groups was divided into three levels of analysis. The first was the field notes from the interview matrix, which were typically formatted as lists. They were transcribed and open coding was used to organize the data and create a coding grid. The second and third units of analysis were the audio recordings from the small group and plenary discussions. Following transcription and accuracy checks, the transcripts were coded by the first author, using the grid developed from the interview matrix; and additional nodes were added as needed. Preliminary themes were identified and then discussed and revised by all the authors until consensus was reached. The emergent themes, which related to the complexity of disasters, were used to develop a framework to depict the interdependencies and dynamics of critical social infrastructure at the community level.

There were two primary objectives of our analysis. First was to identify core themes that unpack the complexity of community resilience and population health as it pertains to disaster and emergency management. Second, we identified a set of action recommendations as potential intervention strategies, to address the complexity from the core themes. This approach is consistent with recommendations from several authors (Chandra et al., 2011; Coiera, 2011) who suggest it is important to map systems and reduce complexity to identify 'levers' which can be used to overcome system inertia and resistance to change. Hence, through a complexity lens we identified the core themes and action recommendations and mapped them (with directional relationships) into a framework of critical social infrastructure.

The results of this study are presented in two parts. First we discuss the core themes and action recommendations that emerged from our analyses. They provide an understanding of the complexity of disaster management and highlight the hard and soft system aspects of that complexity, as well as potential intervention strategies. Second we show a formalized model which maps the complexity from the themes with existing literature, and highlights the relationships between the components of critical social infrastructure ( Fig. 1) . This model depicts a framework for critical social infrastructure which can be used to protect high risk populations in the context of disaster management, but has broader applications for identifying levers which can be targeted for interventions to promote community resilience and population health.

What became clear during our analyses was the interconnectedness of the various components of the hard and soft systems in a community, and how culture provides the backdrop for the social fabric for both. The four core themes (dynamic context, awareness and connectedness, adaptive response and collaboration) underscore this interconnectivity and represent the structure for the framework, as shown by the darker line around these components in the model (Fig. 1) . From the action recommendations we identified micro level inputs that support core components in the model and represent levers for action to managing the dynamic complexity.

Interconnectivity and emergence are basic tenets of complexity theory and emerged in the discussions of how community context continually changes. This theme is represented in Fig. 1 as 'dynamic context', which changes in response to restructuring, political pressure, emerging hazards, generation of information, changes in human needs and capabilities, and the influence of increased situational awareness.

The factors influencing the context of a community in all phases of a disaster are multi-directional, and they interact with the culture. Political priorities influence funding structures and priorities and trickle down to the municipal level, while at the same time grass roots initiatives exert upward pressure to influence political priorities. Disasters highlight gaps in community systems and stimulate change in protocols to prepare for the next disaster.

Expanding knowledge and skills, social networks, emergent opportunities for collaboration, evolving relationships, lessons from previous disasters, and changing attitudes with increased awareness, all contribute to the dynamic context of a community and the complexity of the inputs that lead to an adaptive response. The following quotation from a participant in Community A exemplifies how vulnerability is a dynamic context: ""Vulnerability is an area that can change. We have a changing demographic .

[that] makes a difference in the makeup of your population, but if a new facility is built into your community, then it tends to draw people there, you've perhaps within a very short time frame changed the level of vulnerability within your community.."" Build situational awareness and connect the dots A second core theme was the need for awareness and connectedness in each community. Awareness develops in a nonlinear pattern, is influenced by a variety of processes, and loops back to exert influences on the inputs themselves, creating a catalyst for sustainable action. Along with connectedness, it exemplifies the tenets of emergence, self-organization, and connectivity in complexity theory. The participants listed numerous assets available in the communities, and there was a defined need to be more aware of various organizations, the services they offer, and the resources that could be drawn on to assist with a community response. Awareness and connectedness emerged as the foundation for a resilient community, to maximize the use of critical social infrastructure and enact a collaborative, adaptive response to a disaster.

All 5 communities emphasized the importance of relationships founded on trust, and learning from others who have expertise that could contribute to situational awareness, particularly around the needs of people with functional limitations. The following quotation from Community B exemplifies how this theme relates to resilience:

"". there is agency to agency communication, but it seems to be in pockets. how do we make that widespread? . [it is important to] broaden our links and make better use of our human capacity, so we're talking about person to person, whether that's through email or other links, making use of those.""

The stroke club is a group of people who are caregivers and stroke survivors who support people in the community who are recovering from stroke. This group was largely unknown to participants in the focus groups, yet it represents an important resource in the community with connections to a population at risk of being forgotten in disaster planning and response, due to changes in social connections, functional abilities, and participation in home, work and community life. During the focus groups the participants gained awareness about the important role the stroke club assumes in any community, and their connectedness to this high risk group. The population of people who have had a stroke in any community changes on a daily basis. Therefore, it is essential to leverage the knowledge organizations such as the stroke club have, because they monitor and actively seek connections with families coping with stroke.

One challenge in creating a more connected and aware community is the availability of time and opportunities to get to know people. In each community there was a need and willingness, but systemic barriers make it difficult for people to take time to develop connections and learn from each other. The following quotation depicts how participants in Community D felt leadership is needed to create opportunities for connectedness:

"". it does take leadership though, to bring people together and then to keep them together even if there is a willingness to do so. I'm not sure if we really know where the leadership needs to come from. . Provincially they're trying to do it, but the province is just so big and so diverse that there are pockets of activity.. Often it takes somebody who is not involved in any of the organizations that has a passion for it to happen."" 

The third core theme emphasizes how planning is important, but plans need to be pliable, so response activities and protocols can adapt to changing contextual demands. As plans become more complex, there is a risk that the response will become rigid and unrealistic, whereas optimal response relies on organizational adaptive capacity, to respond to the changing needs of a disaster. Plans provide a good structure to consider the 'what ifs', however, it is essential to have flexibility when the context changes quickly, and what was planned may not be easily implemented. This really underscores the importance of the collaborative process and the strengthening of relationships as the foundation of a good response.

Creative solutions emerge when people are open to new ways of thinking. It demands a shift in paradigm, which may require revisions to protocols or authoritative structure, and fluidity in sharing resources. Pliable planning and open mindsets align with resilience-oriented solutions that focus on assets and embrace complexity, as opposed to accounting for every imaginable risk and trying to control dynamic contexts. This core theme intersects with awareness, as the knowledge of resources and knowing where to find information provides empowerment among the population.

Participants in Community D expressed the need for "".agencies to move beyond their mandates to support clients where there might be a gap in service"". This comment was specifically oriented toward assisting high risk populations with complex functional needs, where privacy policies, resource constraints, and rigid authoritative structures often restrict organizations from collaborating in client care. The group was concerned about the risk of people ""falling through the cracks"" during disaster response, when gaps in service are likely to occur.

When systems are overwhelmed and demands for resources increase, a collaborative lens is needed. This theme crosses several tenets of complexity such as emergence, self-organization, connectivity and adaptiveness. Understanding how assets in the community can be used to assist with the response, and engaging non-traditional stakeholders (e.g. companies that sell RVs or snowmobile clubs) may provide new solutions to help systems cope with overwhelming demands. Redundancy in assets and services provides a safety net when capacity diminishes, but also duplicates efforts that could be used elsewhere; this is part of the complexity of resource distribution.

As described by one participant in Community D who was referring to surge capacity in hospitals:

""How do we move people around? The system is at capacity now, so how do we extend that in a disaster situation? We need to look at alternate supports . we need to get over the 'silo-ing' of our resources and be more flexible""

""We need to know what's out there because there's lots we've all said and there's different supports for different target populations but we're not always sure where they are and then you know you can marry those together with the needs. But it's what do we have? Who needs it? How do we bring it together?""

Seven action recommendations emerged in our analysis and are depicted as micro level inputs in the formal model (Fig. 1) . Each recommendation has embedded complexity to guide preparatory, response and recovery actions in disaster management and contribute to building social infrastructure for adaptive response.

They are presented as levers or intervention strategies to promote population health and community resilience.

The first action recommendation relates to the opportunity/ crisis dichotomy of how community assets often present vulnerabilities or challenges as well. It depicts non-linearity in complex systems and how interdependencies emerge as assets, but also liabilities when the system becomes disrupted.

The good news in each community was the extensive lists of available assets, particularly the knowledge within response organizations and community associations. The bad news, or challenge, was how to manage the complexity of coordinating the assets. Connectedness is considered to be an asset and is good news for disaster management, as it expands possibilities for resource sharing, training and access to information. However, the inherent challenge with increased engagement of community organizations is that the enhanced awareness prompts more demands for preparedness activities, information and support.

New technologies present good news because they expand possibilities for interoperability between organizations, however technologies also present vulnerability because of the dependencies that are created. Many technologies, such as electronic health records, resource databases, transportation, surveillance systems, and social media, assist with disaster response, but are reliant on power, hardware, and the skills and willingness of people to use them. When systems are disrupted, processes such as communication protocols, surge capacity, access to information, risk management, and supply chains dependent on transportation systems, are all affected because they rely on interoperability between humans and technology. The following quotations are from discussions in Communities E and D, respectively:

""We are at the technology era, with Blackberry and all the network gadgets. But one of the first things to fall apart during a catastrophe is electricity. We have our Blackberry but we still carry around our pager in case the system falls and we need to communicate with each other. I also always carry around my good old papers which inform me how to contact my people when something serious happens."" ""I think typically people rely on television for that source of communication. It could be through radio or now it's twitter, it's facebook, it's other forms of social media, and if those systems go down, it's how do you reach the population?""

The action lever recommended here is for communities to recognize that pliable contingency planning is influenced by awareness of the good news and bad news associated with each asset. Collaborative asset mapping which acknowledges the opportunities and threats associated with different resources or aspects of the community context enables organizations and support personnel to be open-minded and adapt to changing circumstances and demands.

Inherent in the complexity of planning and preparing for disasters is the matrix of uncertainty surrounding potential impacts of extreme events. There is often uncertainty about roles and responsibilities of various actors in the health care sector and extended community, the needs of the population, and potential solutions to minimize the damage and restore system functions as quickly as possible. Individuals need information about what to do in an emergency and how to prepare, while organizations need to know about resources and continuity planning, and how to align organizational plans with those at the macro level, The emergency management sector needs to become aware of the assets and needs of high risk populations and how to incorporate them into contingency planning activities. As discussed in Community B:

""As we were going around [during the focus groups] we found out that many organizations have incredible resources available already. that's where this whole knowledge, access, mobilization came in. Because we started talking about the different things, and everybody went 'wow I didn't know about that' and it's like none of us knew. And probably a lot of the rest of you didn't know, so we think that's really important""

Assumptions are part of the complexity in disaster management and the matrix of uncertainty. People are part of critical social infrastructure in a community, and they bring assumptions about how needs should be prioritized, what information is known or unknown about the situation, and what supports will be available. Situational awareness about available resources and potential solutions fosters adaptive responses to uncertain events, and these outputs are influenced by how people and organizations use information. As described by a participant in Community B: ""We all have to look at the bigger picture and make sure that we have our back up plan and our back-up-back-up plan"".

The availability of new communication technologies has streamlined many operations in disaster management, however there are complexities surrounding the sharing of information, both vertically and horizontally, formally and informally. Peoples' skills in using new technologies also contribute to interoperability of new information systems. Connectedness and having ample information are assets, however it is essential not to provide people with too much information that it becomes overwhelming and the messages confusing. The participants recommended having a central hub to manage communication. Sociotechnical considerations, such as training people how to use communication systems, making them convenient so people will use them, and ensuring they are interoperable between organizations are paramount to ensuring the flow of information is efficient and effective. These complexities around sharing and accessing information as a micro level input are represented in Fig. 1 .

The action lever recommended here is to ensure the complexity of pushing and pulling information across individual, organizational and broader societal levels is recognized and simplified as much as possible, to ensure essential information is accessible, but not overwhelming. Community engagement can contribute to determining what type of information should be shared, in what format, and through which channels.

The participants emphasized the need for target populations and agencies which advocate for high risk populations to be engaged in disaster management activities, particularly providing guidance on specific functional needs and how responders can identify and act when providing services. Community organizations can suggest strategies for talking to people with cognitive or emotional limitations during evacuation efforts, such as asking the individual how best to assist him/her. One person in Community D said: ""If I'm injured or something happens, I'll say, hey look, I don't have my hearing aids, I need you to look at me . so sometimes the support can be from the actual person that has the chronic condition"". During the large group discussion, a participant from Community C commented:

""Community organisations' field expertise is one of the strengths we can rely on for better emergency preparedness, response and recovery. Their leadership and sense of innovation along with their close contact and good knowledge of the high risk populations are of great value before, during and after disaster interventions.""

As shown in Fig. 1 , people and their skills and networks are part of critical social infrastructure. Engagement of target populations is not always a simple task. Opportunities for connectivity, collaboration and sharing knowledge require investment of effort, time and money, which in turn requires higher authoritative support and structures. However, the lever for action recommended here is for communities to invest in efforts to identify expertise among the population, and to reach out to the population and invite them to be part of planning and training for the response community. Inclusiveness and reaching out is an important antecedent for people to be willing to share their expertise and contribute to their community.

Organizational resilience requires diversification of skills and strategic redundancies to ensure key functions are maintained. It demands a paradigm shift where staff are trained to do tasks required for their own job as well as other jobs, in case a co-worker becomes injured, ill, or has competing demands at home (such as caregiving responsibilities, damage to their own home, or they have been displaced as a result of the event). This crosses the tenets of emergence and non-linearity in complexity theory. One group in Community E emphasized the need for surge capacity and the dilemma of being understaffed:

""Sometimes there's contradiction among contingency plans. In the case of pandemics, hospital recruitment plans would ask our staff, notably social workers and other stakeholders e already dealing with the crisis in our establishment e to give hospitals assistance. We would then become understaffed and have difficulty maintaining our services to the population""

The micro inputs identified in this theme are people, their knowledge and their skills. The action lever recommended is to build redundancies within the system and invest in human development, so people can step in and provide an adaptive response when context changes and the everyday protocols don't work, or the people typically responsible for a given task are unable to respond.

A recurring question was 'who would I call for this?' This theme speaks to the emergence of networks in a community, which is one aspect of the complexity. The value of fostering an inclusive culture must compete with the backdrop of the inherent challenges of having an enormous guest list for planning activities. Participants from one city noted there are 5000 organizations in their community, therefore the dilemma became one of balancing the complexity of identifying which organizations need to be at the table, and ensuring collaboration and engagement could reasonably be facilitated. However, to align with the predominant themes which endorse efforts to foster connectedness and draw on the expertise in the community, inclusivity must be front and center when fine tuning the invitation list for collaborative planning activities, to ensure high risk populations are represented and their functional needs are acknowledged.

Several participants emphasized stigma and lack of awareness about 'how' to include high risk populations in planning activities. An invitation to participate is a first step, however it is important to ensure people who are invited are provided with the means to support their engagement (such as support for communication through sign interpreters, ensuring barrier-free meeting spaces, and providing a safe atmosphere to feel comfortable expressing their needs). The following quotation is from a discussion that occurred among participants in Community D:

""I think most of us here are dealing with vulnerable populations.the very nature of our business has a certain stigma attached to [it] ..So that becomes one of those things that you have to get over in order to engage these other groups that could be a support""

Culture and networks were added to the model as micro level inputs to represent this theme. The action lever recommended is for communities to foster a culture where inclusion of people with different functional capabilities is valued, desired and expected. However, the extension of an invitation to the planning table must be backed with a commitment to accommodate needs so everyone can truly participate.

Invest time and effort in relationships . with haste Solid, trusted relationships were identified as the foundation on which collaboration, communication, mobilization of resources, and knowledge of population needs are based. The development of trust occurs as people recognize other peoples' competencies and intentions, and have the opportunity to work together. 'Knowing' that you can rely on someone for information or assistance contributes to trust and confidence in relationships as organizations and individuals let go of power, egos and rigid protocols to facilitate creative solutions and collaborative action.

An inherent complexity in collaboration is the need to invest time in developing and nurturing relationships, but few participants believed they had the time to do it, and some doubted whether their organizations would support it. Yet willingness to collaborate was expressed by this participant in Community E and was prominent throughout the discussions in each community:

""Maybe we shouldn't wait until the next meeting convened by a university research to get back to each other. I think we have the willingness to collaborate, we all wish to get together to be able to help one another.""

The micro level inputs from this theme are represented in the model as networks, people, and structures. They all feed into connectedness, willingness to collaborate, opportunities to share information and activities to foster awareness. The action lever recommended here is to invest time and resources in building relationships and establishing trust and common ground. This strategy supports the development of social capital and ultimately adaptive response to changing context.

Identifying high risk populations is a complex process and many communities have considered developing databases to assist response organizations in knowing who requires additional support during a response. However, because of privacy laws and other issues related to having lists of 'vulnerable people', there are strong arguments against the development of central databases. An alternative strategy is to engage community organizations that already have established relationships with high risk groups and contact lists for people who need particular supports. The following quotation is an excerpt from the focus group in Community D where the group discussed the merits and challenges with having a central database for people with disabilities:

""So the question is, should there be some sort of database available for all the people with disabilities that has a basic fact sheet? Their name, their family contact, their medication, their basic limitations, like not a big long 8 page summary, but their basic information.I don't know. I don't know what the answer is."" . ""it's a bit of a dilemma . you want to know where people are and help them, but on the other side respect their privacy...""

In our model, the micro level inputs relating to this theme are informal and formal protocols, structures, information and boundaries. These inputs require coordination, resources, and collaboration to foster awareness of who is most at risk during daily living, and in a disaster context. The action lever recommended here is to invest time, energy and human resources toward helping response organizations connect with community groups who are aware of and have established relationships with high risk groups. This fosters connectivity, which is one of the main tenets of complexity theory and an essential component of community social infrastructure. Fig. 1 depicts the Framework for Critical Social Infrastructure to Promote Population Health and Resilience which emerged as the summation of data analysis, informed by knowledge from previous studies on disasters, complexity, communication, awareness, collaboration, and community resilience. The model shows integrated complexity at the micro level where the inputs are continually in flux and interacting to influence the type and availability of resources, the coordination of hard and soft resources, and the willingness and empowerment of the population to collaborate, before, during and after a community crisis. All of these elements intersect to determine community capacity at a given time, and within a given context, and ultimately influence situational awareness and adaptive response.

The inputs in the model are potential levers for action, which can be targeted for interventions to enhance community capacity for adaptive response. For example, policies and structures respond to different political pressures, such as recognition of the need to provide more accessible spaces and services for people with disabilities. This has an impact on people, organizations, and demands for information. It also influences subsequent awareness, attitudes, willingness to collaborate, and the culture within a community. Because dynamic context requires continual adjustment, a 'new normal' is continually defined within a community and influences its resilience at any time. When a traumatic event exerts an impact on a community, the shift requires a tailored response and all the inputs represented in the model are drawn on to update situational awareness and adapt to the changes.

Each of the core themes were placed into the model with a label (e.g. dynamic context, awareness, connectedness, collaboration, and adaptive response). The themes align with different components of complexity theory, and show the interconnectivity of dependencies within a system. The action recommendations were also assigned a label and placed within the model to show how the micro inputs (e.g. people/information/structures/networks) feed into the core structures. The macro outputs exert critical influences on how a community responds to a disaster in an adaptive way. These outputs in turn loop back to influence micro level inputs such as formal and informal social networks, information, structures and protocols, and people's knowledge, attitudes, and skills. Many of these inputs change in response to previous experience or new context, such as hazard identification, new resources or political pressures within a community, vicarious experience from disasters in other regions, and people leaving or entering the community. They all influence community capacity and resilience, and should be considered when designing community and organizational interventions.

Complexity occurs across different levels and between and within different systems, including agent complexity (e.g. individuals and families), organizational complexity (within formal and informal community groups), and cross-boundary complexity (between organizations and across jurisdictions). Previous studies have emphasized the need to unpack complexity and identify levers for action to improve health system performance (Coiera, 2011) and community resilience (Chandra et al., 2011) . In this empirical study we explored the complexity of community disasters at the micro level, to determine levers for action where intervention strategies can be used to facilitate collaborative action and promote health among high risk populations. The emergent themes were formalized into a model and combined with knowledge from existing literature to present a framework for critical social infrastructure, to simplify the complexity within health and social systems and identify potential points of intervention to promote population health and resilience.

The four core themes which emerged in this study showed complexity related to: a) managing dynamic contexts; b) situational awareness and interconnectivity; c) flexible planning to ensure adaptive response; and d) active engagement and the challenges of collaborative work. These themes created the structure for the emergent framework and are consistent with the suggestion by Okros et al. (2011) that complexity can be understood by analyzing adaptive systems which operate according to chaotic, spontaneous, unpredictable changes from ""dynamic interactions amongst multiple entities"" (p. 43). The key to unraveling complexity in disaster management is to understand how these issues intersect and develop interventions to enhance community capacity and promote collaborative activities, to increase situational awareness and facilitate adaptive responses to dynamic, complex events.

The inputs we identified are contained within and across all types of boundaries, such as those identified by Ansell et al. (2010) (e.g. political, geographic, functional, time) . The outputs in our framework are consistent with previous literature (Carroll et al., 2009; Chandra et al., 2011; McConnell & Drennan, 2006; Pfefferbaum, Reissman, Pfefferbaum, Klomp, & Gurwitch, 2007) , however an important finding from our study is that complexity is a constant at each input and output of the system, and is an integral part of interactions with other systems. Our results support the objectives of resilience (resistance, absorption and restoration) outlined by Kahan et al. (2009) and the guiding principles outlined in the FEMA National Response Framework (2008), which emphasize ""engaged partnership; tiered response; scalable, flexible and adaptable operational capacity; unity of effort through unified command; and readiness to act"" (p. 8). While the participants in our study acknowledged the need for leadership and centralized coordination, more prominent themes emphasized collaboration, awareness, and flexible planning, with the understanding that coordination of resources and protocols is a way of building relationships and situational awareness for better understanding of community assets and needs. These themes support suggestions by Kahan et al. (2009) that complexity is the backdrop for community resilience and must be integrated into any intervention strategies designed to support high risk populations who are dependent on the health and social system supports. Chandra et al. (2011) also emphasized the need for empirical studies to unpack complexities and provide specific mechanisms or levers for action which can be used to tailor intervention strategies, such as the action recommendations provided here.

The intersection between health and social services systems is a good example of how community crises naturally cross system boundaries. In Canada, and worldwide, the transboundary nature 2006) . These examples underscore the need to consider how the impact of massive demands on the acute health care system radiate into other parts of the health sector where service delivery is provided, including public health and home care, as well as occupational health and safety, employee assistance programs, and other sectors which ultimately influence population health. There is extensive literature on the need for coordination and collaboration for unified, comprehensive response to disasters, and national frameworks for disaster response acknowledge the need for multisector engagement and action. Population health and resilience requires collaboration between multi-disciplinary sectors, to ensure there is adequate surge capacity, as well as efficient and effective communication, particularly when infrastructure and operating systems are disrupted (Chandra et al., 2011; FEMA, 2008; Okros et al., 2011; WHO, 2009) .

Contingency planning is an important community process, and the complexity of developing coordinated emergency plans amidst a matrix of uncertainty was a central point of discussion in each of the communities, consistent with extant literature promoting allhazards planning (McConnell & Drennan, 2006 ) and a whole-ofsociety approach (Chandra et al., 2011; WHO, 2009) . Coordinated plans provide structure to consider the possible scenarios and response strategies, however flexibility is essential because selforganization, a central tenet of complexity theory, is often what evolves during a disaster when the context changes quickly (Norris et al., 2008) . Action recommendations from our study, supported by the literature, include interventions designed to facilitate openminded, pliable contingency planning, to ensure organizational adaptive capacity (Cilliers & Preiser, 2010; Kahan et al., 2009) . Wyche et al. (2011) emphasized the role of flexible protocols in the provision of support for people evacuated after Hurricane Katrina. The responders were empowered when they were able to appropriately bend protocols to meet the immediate needs of the survivors and adapt to the emergent issues that arose in the shelters. In the context of pandemic, the WHO (2009) recommends contingency planning include designating and training alternate people for critical positions in any organization, to ensure back-up is available to sustain operations. This represents an important action lever for interventions at the micro level to utilize redundancy as a key strategy for surge capacity.

The need for situational awareness was the most prominent theme in this study, and the complexity of increasing awareness amongst organizations and the public was something each community struggled with. In particular, communities were challenged to connect the dots by identifying organizations with resources that could be used in training, information-sharing, and service provision. This finding is consistent with previous studies (Chandra et al., 2011; Norris et al., 2008) emphasizing organizational and individual linkages as key components of community resilience. Our results underscore the need for possibility thinking, to allow organizations to dismantle silos, create functional and informational linkages, and cross boundaries more easily to manage the dynamic context during a disaster.

Collaboration emerged as an important output in our study, with an emphasis on inclusion of people with functional needs, and community organizations who are not traditionally involved in disaster planning. This is consistent with the findings from Chandra et al. (2011) suggesting engagement and partnerships are critical for community resilience, but that opportunities to engage in resilienceoriented activities are limited. Part of the complexity of fostering collaborative activities is the culture clash between different sectors and organizations, which McConnell and Drennan (2006) describe as institutional fragmentation. The expense and logistics of engaging a wide variety of organizations create additional barriers, yet interventions which foster collaborative activities can be useful for sharing information, social learning, and building collaborative relationships (Carroll et al., 2009; Kuziemsky & Varpio, 2010) .

Two important limitations of this study should be considered. First, the data from this study is limited to five communities in Canada, therefore cannot be generalized. Second, recruitment for this study was broad, including participants in full time paid positions with extensive expertise in emergency management, as well as volunteers and employees from community organizations with little to no experience with disaster planning. Our study provides an empirical model to map critical social infrastructure within a community and identify levers for action to promote community resilience. It represents an assets-based lens for identifying resources and opportunities to reduce vulnerabilities for high risk populations, but can also be applied to the broader community to promote well-being. Future studies could explore the directional relationships depicted in the model and effectiveness, feasibility and appropriateness of different intervention strategies targeting each of the inputs in the framework of critical social infrastructure presented in this paper. In particular it will be important to determine how to fully engage representatives of high risk populations and non-traditional organizations not typically involved in disaster planning activities.

Promoting population health in a disaster context requires a shift from risk management to one of resilience, which by its very nature acknowledges changing complexities. The results from this study underscore the need to move from a command and control model to one of collaboration, which is at the core of the Framework for Critical Social Infrastructure to Promote Population Health and Resilience presented in this paper. By unraveling the complexities of the inputs and outputs influencing adaptive community response, it simplifies the identification of target points for intervention to enhance resilience. 'One size fits all' solutions are not adequate to promote community resilience. Instead, intervention design must emerge from the complexity of the situation and be tailored to the community context at any point in time.

Risk Management and Healthcare Policy Dovepress Critical role of ethics in clinical management and public health response to the West Africa Ebola epidemic,"The devastation caused by the Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in West Africa has brought to the fore a number of important ethical debates about how best to respond to a health crisis. These debates include issues related to prevention and containment, management of the health care workforce, clinical care, and research design, all of which are situated within the overarching moral problem of severe transnational disadvantage, which has very real and specific impacts upon the ability of citizens of EVD-affected countries to respond to a disease outbreak. Ethical issues related to prevention and containment include the appropriateness and scope of quarantine and isolation within and outside affected countries. The possibility of infection in health care workers impelled consideration of whether there is an obligation to provide health services where personal protection equipment is inadequate, alongside the issue of whether the health care workforce should have special access to experimental treatment and care interventions under development. In clinical care, ethical issues include the standards of care owed to people who comply with quarantine and isolation restrictions. Ethical issues in research include appropriate study design related to experimental vaccines and treatment interventions, and the sharing of data and biospecimens between research groups. The compassionate use of experimental drugs intersects both with research ethics and clinical care. The role of developed countries also came under scrutiny, and we concluded that developed countries have an obligation to contribute to the containment of EVD infection by contributing to the strengthening of local health care systems and infrastructure in an effort to provide fair benefits to communities engaged in research, ensuring that affected countries have ready and affordable access to any therapeutic or preventative interventions developed, and supporting affected countries on their way to recovery from the impact of EVD on their social and economic lives.","The magnitude of the recent Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in West Africa has been unprecedented in many ways. This is the first time an EVD outbreak has occurred in West Africa although EVD outbreaks in Africa have been documented since 1976. This outbreak is unique in its size, duration, and spatial extent. 1 It has generated intense debates on appropriate international responses to infectious disease emergencies, the processes of researching new treatments and vaccines during an epidemic outbreak, and standards for prevention and care. These debates have also focused national and international attention on disparities in health care standards between developed and developing countries, on differing applications of ethical standards governing the right to health between developed and developing countries arising from these disparities, and the ethical responsibilities of various agencies in the current and future infectious disease outbreaks.

In this paper, we analyzed the ethical considerations that arose from the clinical management and public health responses to EVD outbreak in West Africa, identified the similarities and differences in the application of these ethical standards in developed and developing countries, and considered the implications of our findings for future global health emergency responses. Our analysis is based on a reflection of the social-ecological model widely used in health behavior research and practice to assess the multiple levels that influence a health issue. More specifically, this model is unique because it allows the researcher or practitioner to identify the individual, interpersonal, organizational, community, and public policy factors that contribute to a particular health issue or event so that health professionals and/or researchers may identify the best intervention or research methods. Therefore, we will detail the ethical issues that impact the Ebola epidemic from a social-ecological model analysis.

The West African EVD epidemic resulted in the death of five times as many people as every other known EVD outbreak combined. 2 It is also the largest ever emergency operation in the 70 year history of the World Health Organization (WHO). 3 Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Guinea bore the brunt of the epidemic, though cases were also reported in Nigeria, Mali, Senegal, the United States, and Spain. Only three infections occurred outside West Africa (two in the US and one in Spain). At the time of the EVD epidemic in West Africa, another EVD epidemic caused by an unrelated EVD strain occurred in the Democratic Republic of Congo in August 2014, with 66 cases and 49 deaths. This was contained, and the country has remained EVD free since November 2014. The West African region had been on the brink of being declared EVD-free several times but for instances of new case identification in Sierra Leone 4 and Liberia. 5 The region was finally declared EVD free on January 14, 2016. 6 There are, however, potentials for multiple flare-ups in the region as some survivors could sexually transmit infection. 7, 8 The West Africa epidemic was different in many respects to past EVD epidemics. First, it is the largest and longest EVD outbreak in history, 3 involving several developed and developing countries. Fears of cross-border transmission resulted in over 50 countries around the world issuing travel restrictions to and from EVD-affected countries. 9 Second, the epidemic garnered international support, including significant investment in the research and development of vaccines 10 and therapies 11, 12 for EVD infection, although the response was slow and arguably inadequate. 13, 14 Third, it stimulated debates at many international, regional, and national fora about compassionate access to experimental regimens for therapy during epidemics and alternative clinical trial designs to test the efficacy and effectiveness of vaccines and therapies. The debates resulted in guidelines being developed, 15 and considerations for revised ethical guidance on clinical trial design and sharing of biospecimens and data. 16 Actions are also being taken to institute structural measures for improved emergency response capacities around the world. 3 One of the ethical debates was the overarching moral problem of severe transnational disadvantage, which has very real and specific impacts upon the ability of citizens in Liberia, Guinea, and Sierra Leone to proactively exercise their right to health under normal conditions, let alone when their countries were in the grip of an epidemic. 17 Of note, Liberia had 51 doctors for its population of 4.3 million people. 18 The drastically under-resourced health care structures and systems in these countries constitute moral problems in themselves and both heighten and complicate the other ethical issues that arose in relation to the epidemic. Accordingly, we reviewed the literature and discuss ethical considerations in the West African EVD outbreak from a perspective that is grounded in a critique of the social and structural elements that contributed to the deprivation of the individuals and communities that bore the brunt of the epidemic. These include ethical analysis of public health measures such as quarantine, isolation, protection of health care workers, and travel restrictions. We also analyzed the debates that had taken place regarding research ethics, including the conduct of research during public health emergencies, the ethics of randomization, standards of care both within and outside research studies, and the sharing of biospecimens and related data internationally. Finally we considered the ethical issues surrounding the topic of EVD survivors.

Three months elapsed (from December 6, 2013 to March 10, 2014) between the first death now attributed to the West African outbreak, and the first notification of national health authorities. By this time, there were clusters of infection in four districts. 19 The recent histories of civil war, unstable government, and political violence in the affected countries negatively impacted the ability of the health systems to meet the care and containment demands of an exploding public 

Ethics, Ebola, and public health health crisis. Also, the civil distrust of and misgivings toward the government, due to long years of neglect of health services and systems, slowed down the public response. 18, 20, 21 At the time of the outbreak, many international donor agencies that had handled past emergency health problems were establishing fledgling transitional systems intended to reduce donor dependence in the region and were therefore not operating at maximum potential. [22] [23] [24] [25] Also, individuals had grown to depend on alternative health care providers in view of the dilapidated health care structures and systems. 25 Thus, the initial calls by the government to take precautions against EVD infection were treated with levity. The disease was unknown in the region, and the public health messages stigmatized cherished traditional practices as ""risky behaviors"", arising from the logical clinical and epidemiological framings of contagion. 26 For example, the cultural practice of burial rites, which were designed as a means of parting with the dead through a show of dignity and respect, were now labeled ""bad"", and people were requested to make immediate and extensive changes in their core practices and ways of relating and interacting to curb EVD spread. 26 Also, the sudden urgent need for clean water for regular hand washing brought with it its own challenges as access to regular clean water was limited. 27 Public myths and misconceptions soon grew from the government actions, with many believing that the government was merely interested in sourcing for new foreign aid for further personal enrichment. 28 With increasing cases of EVD infection, poor standards of care in health facilities, 29, 30 high case fatality, 31 and large numbers of people turned back from treatment centers, 32 many individuals also had to become personally responsible for their individual care. Care of the sick at home became the backup for managing many cases, 33, 34 and in such situations, individuals had to learn to provide care for infected and affected loved ones while ensuring personal protection.

Quarantine helps to contain new infections during an infectious disease outbreak. 35 One of the criticisms of the initial outbreak response was that the quarantine was poorly managed. Koch 35 and Barbisch et al 36 argue that quarantine of whole communities could be ethically justified, particularly if the containment area included the entire area within which individuals from a community would usually travel. Koch 35 describes this as a spatial focus for quarantine rather than one focused on a targeted population. It allows for better concentration on humanitarian medicine for the infected, as far greater concentration of resources would be available for a smaller pool of infected people. A call for ""spatial"" quarantine for EVD containment may be at odds with the ""principle of least infringement"", an ethical principle applied in public health contexts to curtail the use of liberty-restricting interventions to the least restrictive action required to meet a public health goal. But when the public health goal is containment of an infectious disease to meet the dual goals of enabling the best possible care for the sick within the quarantine zone, as well as to reduce the spread of infection, such a measure could be ethically justified. Restrictions should therefore be done in a way that is relevant, legitimate, and necessary, and stakeholders should be fully informed about the risks and benefits, especially as they affects their health, well-being, and personal liberty. 37 Those quarantined should also not suffer unfair economic penalties. 37 The tension between quarantine as a public health measure and individual rights to privacy, liberty, and freedom of movement is well recognized, and the need to strike a balance between the utilitarian aim of promoting public health, on the one hand, and libertarian aims of protecting privacy and freedom of movement on the other hand, have been widely discussed. [37] [38] [39] There is a reasonable expectation that when people are asked to surrender their liberty through quarantine, there is a reciprocal obligation to provide adequate care for individuals who have complied. When such care is not forthcoming or when it is inadequate, it can be argued that the individual, who is legally required to report for quarantine, does not have a moral obligation to do so.

For a situation like the EVD epidemic where scientific uncertainty about the disease was pervasive, respect for the rights and dignity of affected persons required commitment to planning to address the associated challenges. 38, 39 The lack of consideration for the needs of the most affected individuals when quarantines were instituted during the EVD epidemic affected the success of quarantines measures to quickly contain the epidemic: 3 the associated unmet basic needs and economic constraints resulting in the need for food were common reasons given for the breach when affected cities were ""shut down"", 35 thereby limiting the effectiveness of instituted quarantine.

As part of the ""fear"" response to EVD in the USA, asymptomatic health care workers returning from West Africa were required to be quarantined for 21 days. 9 This form of quarantine is similar to one proposed by American law Risk Management and Healthcare Policy 2016:9 submit your manuscript | www.dovepress.com

Folayan et al professor Gostin 39 who, in another infectious disease context, suggested that citizens may be forcefully excluded from returning to their home for a period of time when an infectious individual poses a risk to others on international conveyances. We consider, however, that the probable benefits of a restrictive measure for health care workers returning to their home country are not sufficient to justify any burden placed on individuals through the restriction of their liberty, taking into consideration any probability. 40 Subsequently, the quarantine order for health care workers returning to their homeland from the EVD zone was deemed counterproductive and ""morally wrong"" by the President's Bioethics Commission. 41 The action was also not evidence based, infringed the right to liberty of affected individuals, 42 fueled stigma, 43, 44 and constituted a roadblock to the ongoing EVD response. 45 It imposed barriers to the movement of health care workers to and from affected areas and impeded their ability to contribute their skills to the management of the public health emergency. 45 

Isolation of individuals sick with EVD during the period when they could transmit infection is an appropriate public health response. Confinement should, however, be in safe places, and isolated individuals should have access to adequate health care, food, clothing, and means of communication with families and friends. 39 The appalling state of many isolation units 46 and the poor treatment of infected persons in West Africa 47 was a disincentive for anyone to self-report at EVD treatment units. Sick patients in West Africa may not be morally obliged to seek isolation, regardless of the law, knowing that isolation likely implies dying alone without family and friends. WHO 3 noted this as one of its main challenges for EVD containment: people continued to stay at home and secretly bury their dead even when sufficient treatment beds and burial teams were available. Sick patients in developed countries will, however, be morally obliged to seek isolation, since optimal care will be provided in well-equipped care centers.

For a situation like the EVD outbreak where no curative medicine was available and where access to a reasonable standard of supportive care was the best that treatment facilities could offer, equitable distribution of such care is of great ethical importance, given the public health imperative for people to show up at treatment units. No preferential treatment should be offered on the basis of profession as a show of respect for the rights and dignity of infected persons.

Concerns about the potential for EVD to travel across borders resulted in travel restrictions in many countries, and screening for fever was recommended at the airports in Liberia, Guinea, and Sierra Leone and instituted in many airports worldwide. 9 The possibility of Ebola being used for bioterrorism intensified concern about cross-border movement of people who may have been exposed to EVD. 48 Instituting travel bans far from the Ebola epicenter, however, defies the public health ethics principle of least infringement, which recognizes the need to respect and protect individual and community needs, interests, rights, and liberties and to ensure that these are curtailed to the minimum degree required to curtail a public health threat. 41 The international laws recognize the right to freedom of movement to leave and return to one's country of origin. 49, 50 While restricting travel of persons infected with EVD may seem intuitively right to contain the epidemic, such restriction would reduce the opportunity for medical evacuations, which was demonstrated to increase rates of survival. 51 In addition, allowing travel in and out of Ebola-affected nations facilitated the movement of humanitarian workers and supportive materials for EVD prevention, care, and infection control.

Ethical dilemmas that informed health care workers' response to the epidemic Health professionals of all kinds, from a village midwife to hospital doctors, featured in the transmission chains. 52 The poor infrastructure and support systems for sick persons 53 resulted in health care workers in some facilities being afraid to provide care 54 -a reasonable fear, given the high number of infections affecting the health force. 55 Yakubu et al 56 recognized the fundamental issues that underscored health workers concerns and possible reluctance to offer services during the epidemic in West Africa and advocated that health care workers are under no obligation to provide medical care for patients with EVD when the government cannot provide them with required personal protective equipment and training to play their role safely and effectively.

For health professionals working outside the West African region, the risk of exposure was remote, but nonetheless did occur due to people with EVD either traveling while ill 57, 58 or being medically evacuated. 57, 59 Some of the health professionals who handled patients' care were not adequately trained to provide care for patients with EVD and were left vulnerable to infection. 60 The infection of foreigners who traveled to the West African region resulted in considerable debate about which categories of health care workers are obliged to provide care and which are not, and whether there are particular medical procedures that should be barred for patients with EVD because of the risk posed. 63, 64 In addition, public concerns focused on the obligation of employers to ensure provision of adequate equipment for health care workers faced with the risk for EVD infection. Debate over the optimal design of protective equipment 65 resulted in protocols recommending different levels of respiratory protection 66 and detailed training on the use of personal protective equipment.

The EVD outbreak catalyzed a flurry of scientific activity to consider investigational compounds under development and to hasten their pathway into human trials. In 2014, the Ethics Advisory Committee to the WHO met and issued a statement that supported the use of unregistered interventions in the EVD epidemic. 15 This gave credence both to EVD research efforts and to compassionate use of unproven agents. There were intense debates about the appropriate design and conduct of EVD vaccine and drug trials. Much of this debate centered on the ethics of randomization in the midst of an epidemic with high case fatality. [67] [68] [69] [70] [71] Those in favor of randomized clinical trial argued that EVD clinical trials present a situation of genuine uncertainty, and therefore justified randomization to experimental treatment versus placebo. [72] [73] [74] Also, drug registration for licensure would require data generated through randomized clinical trials. 70, 71 Those in favor of alternative trial designs 67,68,75-78 noted that ethical standards guiding therapeutic research should be flexible enough to give the dying ""a chance at rescue"". 78 Also, alternative research designs facilitated access of persons to experimental products to reduce the risk of fatality, especially with promising experimental products. 67, 78, 79 The Ebola ca Suffit trial provided evidence on the suitability of an alternative vaccine trial design to generate evidence on the effectiveness of a vaccine. 80 Ethical dilemmas informing policy response to the epidemic Within a public health emergency, values defined by public health ethics -an overriding priority afforded to ""greater good"" considerations 57,81 -should take precedence over individual concerns, according to ethicist Dawson. 82 Dawson was particularly concerned that the WHO Advisory Panel meeting held in September 2014 83 focused on ""individualistic"" values -the use of unregistered interventions for clinical care or prevention -rather than on the ""old fashioned public health methods"" such as quarantine, contact tracing, and social distancing. 82 In response, Haire and Folayan 79 argued that access to treatment, whether experimental or not, should not be separated from ""public health ethics"", given that community support for and compliance with public health containment measures requires some reciprocity. Also, some hope of an effective treatment, however remote, could assist individuals and communities in accepting otherwise unwelcome public health measures.

Some scholars argued that developed countries have an ethical obligation to support countries in the EVD zone. 20 Countries in the EVD zone were in dire need of support to control an outbreak that was out of hand, and such support would be at minimal cost to the developed country. 84, 85 As sponsors of EVD therapeutic research, the developed countries had an ethical obligation to contribute to the containment of EVD infection by strengthening local health care systems and infrastructure in an effort to provide fair benefits to communities that are engaged in research. 20 Also, recognizing that relationships with others will inevitably require mutuality and reciprocity implies that developed countries need to provide support for affected West African countries at their time of need. 45 The strengthening of the health care systems to enhance EVD response and support current and future research should be considered a social response to the needs of developing countries by developed countries. 20 Ethical considerations on sharing of data and biospecimens for EVD response

The collection of biospecimens is critically important for advancing research into treatment and preventative interventions and for improving understanding of the pathogenesis and genetic variation of EVD. 86 As such, specimens must necessarily be collected during an outbreak and shared with other researchers working on developing treatment and vaccines long after the epidemic is over. This raises ethical issues about informed consent. While informed consent ought to be obtained before taking any specimen, caring for very ill people focused on survival in often suboptimal treatment units makes this difficult. Also, there are concerns about obtaining informed consent from minors who may not have parents or guardian present while quarantined, or the parents may have died as a result of the epidemic. In 

Folayan et al the case of deceased people, the USA regulations do not require consent before taking biospecimens. It is, however, recognized that deceased people may have had interests and values regarding the use of their specimens that should be respected. 86 Similarly, the USA does not require consent for use of deidentified specimens, but the ethical concerns still hold, since genomic research, where data cannot truly be deidentified given that every human genome is unique, is possible. 48 Jecker et al 87 therefore identified the need for additional guidance on the challenges of obtaining informed consent for collecting and sharing biospecimens in the context of a public health emergency.

Concerns about sharing of benefits accruing from biospecimen and data sharing has been raised in view of the competitive and privatized nature of EVD research and drug development and the reality that most of the EVD-related research would need to be conducted in high-tech Biological Safety Level-4 laboratories found more readily in developed countries. 88 Lessons from the 2009 influenza A (H1N1) vaccine development process, and how financially empowered economies bought up manufactured vaccines, are recent examples that cause concern about future access to EVD treatments and vaccine. 89 It is proposed that before data sharing of any kind occurs, there should be clear and equitable benefit sharing arrangements created through legally enforceable contractual obligations to ensure that people in EVD-affected countries have ready and affordable access to any therapeutic or preventative interventions that result from research. This proposal is in line with the principles enshrined in the 2011 Pandemic Influenza Preparedness Framework 90 and respects the principle of reciprocity. 91

For EVD survivors, a different set of dynamics come into play. Many survivors are left impoverished. EVD infection means that personal property is confiscated with little or no support to replace these assets upon recovery. 92 Misconception about the likelihood of contagion of EVD post-recovery gives rise to stigma and discrimination resulting in many survivors not being able to retain their jobs or get new jobs. 93 The high demand for the blood of EVD survivors for therapeutic purposes meant that selling of blood, even in the black market, was a good means of income generation for many survivors. 94 The sale of blood and blood in exchange for income by the poor is a well-recognized practice in many countries, including those affected by the Ebola outbreak. 95 This consideration posed an ethical dilemma for the Global Emerging Pathogens Consortium when considering how to compensate blood donors for their research on use of EVD survivors' blood for EVD therapy research, recognizing that EVD survivors have a right to the income they make from sale of their blood. 96

The EVD epidemic resulted in extensive loss of life and property. Altogether, 26,350 persons were managed for EVD infection and 11,315 lives were lost. 97 The extensive casualty and the embargoes on travels and movements during the outbreak also affected trade and agriculture, resulting in food insecurity in affected countries. 98 The impact of the epidemic on education remains unmeasured, yet the fact that schooling was extensively disrupted would have short-, medium-, and long-term consequences at the individual, family, and community/national level. Extensive donor investment in the EVD response also has implications for funding of other research in the region as research funds were moved away from other disease areas to address the EVD emergency response needs. 99 The instituted infection control measures also affected social interactions, although the scope of impact of EVD epidemic on the social dynamic of affected countries remains largely unknown and would be difficult to measure because pre-epidemic data are rarely available due to the unpredictable nature of disease outbreaks. However, it is known that infectious diseases have severe impact on biodiversity. [100] [101] [102] The WHO's report on lessons learned from the 2014 EVD outbreak in West Africa 3 identified four big lessons all related to the structural interventions provided during the epidemic. The report failed to recognize the immense changes in the dynamics of life and livelihood of affected individuals, communities, and the country and the need to support affected countries on their way back from recovering from the social, environmental, cultural, and economic tolls of the epidemic. Such support would involve long-term commitment from international partners and donors. Unfortunately, the outcomes of such long-term support are difficult to measure. Yet, the people in West Africa impacted by EVD outbreak need such long-term support.

At the individual level, support is needed to help survivors resume normal lives and to address challenges such as emotional distress, health issues, loss of possessions, and difficulty regaining their livelihoods. 103 

Ethics, Ebola, and public health face stigma, rejection, loss of jobs, 104 and have to deal with posttraumatic stress disorders and health challenges associated with EVD. 105, 106 If affected countries organize their EVD surveillance systems in line with WHO requirements, 3 it will be possible to organize the provision of support for survivors in need. However, surveillance systems as an epidemiological measure and a potential tool for intervention come with ethical challenges. First, it limits privacy as names of persons with EVD diseases will need to be reported. The use of namebased surveillance for HIV infection 107 set the precedent for this public health measure. Such surveillance systems must however, be less intrusive. Affected communities need to be consulted on its importance, design and use, and the data must be used for legitimate purposes 39 only, such as providing relief materials for interested individuals, as we have identified.

While confidential handling of data may not be a challenge in developed countries, this will likely be so for countries in the EVD zone, which have poorly developed health systems in general and surveillance systems in particular. 108 This once again highlights the need for support to build the health systems in affected countries not just to be able to respond to the EVD epidemic but also respond appropriately to the management of infectious diseases in general. The absence of basic essential elements of public health is a recognized vector for EVD in affected countries. 28, 38 The call to strengthen health care systems in EVD-affected countries is an ethical and moral call.

Effective EVD responses require extensive consultations and discussions with communities on appropriate measures of and support for instituted mechanisms to respond to the epidemic. The privacy-limiting nature of name-reporting associated with the operations of surveillance systems to monitor EVD requires that the public be educated about this measure and consulted on how best to undertake contact tracing. EVD survivors should also be consulted about how best to institute surveillance and contact tracing systems that reduce the risk for stigma. 39 Social interventions at the community level include galvanizing support for members of the extended families who have adopted children orphaned by EVD. 109 The possibility of supporting prompt adoption of orphaned children by qualified persons should also be explored. International support programs or projects should not seek to subsume these community practices of orphaned and vulnerable chil-dren's support with attractive alternatives. Rather, safe local practices of child care should be promoted. 110 Ethical obligation for EVD response at the country level At the country level, it is the ethical obligation of governments and appropriate authorities to ensure that hospitals maintain resources and adequate health care professionals to isolate and treat new patients with EVD. With depleted numbers of experienced health care workers in EVD-affected countries resulting from the high case fatality rate (as high as 59%), 111 affected countries will need regional and international support to augment health care delivery for citizens beyond providing support for those infected with EVD. The global community needs to continue to support medical personnel to travel to affected countries to help provide medical care for the short and medium term while the country makes effort to train more medical staff. There have been such past practices between national governments through North-South Collaborations and South-South Collaborations. 112 Public policies on management and control of epidemiccausing infectious diseases in general, and EVD management and control specifically, need to be developed. For example, in the wake of the EVD outbreak in Nigeria, the national research ethics code was revised to allow for country access and use of experimental drugs on compassionate grounds for the management of EVD. The absence of this policy was a disincentive for the use of experimental drugs for Dr Sheik Humarr Khan in Sierra Leone. 113 Public health policies in developing countries would also need to be revised to address the obligations of health care personnel to work in the time of an infectious disease outbreak. Policies that can guide the scientific and ethical conduct of research at the time of a national emergency would also be helpful and a welcome development. Policies on isolation of infected persons and quarantine of affected persons need to be based on robust legal and ethical justification. For EVD, where the probability of transmission and severity of harm justifies the need to restrict movements of people for public health purposes, consultation and communication with affected communities on ""why"" and ""how"" to implement measures is an ethical imperative. The options for practicing quarantine and isolation should not create divides between social classes and result in unjust treatment of the poor, such as creating food insecurity. 38, 39 Resources should also be committed to providing support for those who lose income through isolation and quarantine, as equity requires that those who 

Folayan et al forgo their freedom for the public good through quarantine and isolation should be compensated. 39 A broad public debate in each country is, however, required on how best to achieve equity. The outcome of the debate should inform policy and guidelines development.

Ethical obligation for EVD response at the global level While travel advice and warnings about EVD-affected countries are welcome and appropriate global EVD public health responses, travel bans are not an effective response, but rather have significant negative consequences. Global solidarity for responding to a regional crisis can make significant difference to a health crisis at the individual, community, and national levels, as lessons from the field of HIV studies have demonstrated. The success of the US response to global HIV epidemics through its PEPFAR (President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief) program is a testimony to this. 113 US funding for the global HIV response is less than 1% of the annual budget. 114 Yet, this minor budgetary allocation has had tremendous impact on the epidemic in developing countries. The same could be done for EVD-affected countries in West Africa.

As we go into the future, one of the ethical responsibilities of the global community is ensuring prompt unconditional access of low-income countries to developed therapies for EVD management. EVD outbreaks could still occur in the future. In view of the health and social development challenges of countries affected by EVD, the focus of the EVD response in West Africa should be one that combines genuine respect for the dignity of people with the idea of human development. 115 This, therefore, requires that the global community should plan ahead for future outbreaks. While current EVD therapeutics are being developed by pharmaceutical companies and researchers in the North, plans need to be instituted for future access of these therapies by affected communities in the South. The WHO and appropriate entities like Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization need to start discussing modalities for future access to developed therapeutics ahead of product licensure and future outbreaks.

A global response to the EVD epidemic in West Africa is an ethical requirement of national, regional, and international governments in view of globalization and the diminishing relevance of national boundaries. The EVD outbreak dem-onstrated the magnitude of what can be achieved within a short time with global solidarity. We live in a time of fluid borders brought on by ease of travel, technological innovations, and an aggressive global media. This denies us the intellectual luxury of viewing global issues such as HIV infection, global warming, and, now, EVD from the narrow lens of a domestic crisis. It is a global crisis with impact at the individual, community, national, and international levels associated with ethical responsibilities for individuals, collectives, governments, and donor agencies.

Risk communication and management in public health crises,"As the world faces its first influenza pandemic in 40 years, it has been argued that we have never been better prepared. Concern about emerging infectious diseases has fuelled significant public health and political developments, such as the coming into force of the International Health Regulations (IHR). Since the turn of the century, the World Health Organization (WHO) has documented a historically unprecedented number of emerging infectious disease outbreaks, and lessons drawn from their management have confirmed the critical importance of effective communications, specifically through formal channels such as WHO and in the public domain.","As the world faces its first influenza pandemic in 40 years, it has been argued that we have never been better prepared. Concern about emerging infectious diseases has fuelled significant public health and political developments, such as the coming into force of the International Health Regulations (IHR). Since the turn of the century, the World Health Organization (WHO) has documented a historically unprecedented number of emerging infectious disease outbreaks, and lessons drawn from their management have confirmed the critical importance of effective communications, specifically through formal channels such as WHO and in the public domain.

In concert with novel emerging infectious diseases, the communication landscape itself has also changed radically. We now live in an era of real-time electronic communications; consequently, approaches to surveillance are being transformed. Data sources, information messengers, mechanisms of data and information transfer and audiences are all changing. Instant and global transmission of information has become a powerful ally, along with peer pressure, for WHO in ensuring that member states comply with new obligations to swiftly declare outbreaks considered to be of public health importance. There is now significant global attention and accompanying investment which should, the authors suggest, be used as an opportunity to improve strategic and operational communication capacity to respond not only to pandemic influenza but also to other public health threats.

There are many concepts of communication in relation to risk associated with outbreaks. As these are relatively new concepts, this article will consider approaches relating to highlighting public health threats and supporting operational management, addressing these as the communication of risk and subsequent risk management. Strategic considerations are critical to both, although information, messengers, communication tools and audiences may differ. The communication of risk refers to the process by which information regarding outbreaks is identified and shared with the purpose of increasing awareness amongst key stakeholders of the threat. Key stakeholders for public health threats include WHO, national governments and the public. Risk management, by contrast, refers to the management processes associated with response to the outbreak, for which communication is crucial at each stage. Three examples are used to explore the challenges and demands of communicating effectively and coherently given this changing landscape. This brief paper will attempt to show the progress made, draw lessons to be learned and outline the ways forward.

The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2002-2003 was an unprecedented public health emergency played out on the international stage. The disease, caused by a novel coronavirus, resulted from spread of the virus from civet cats to humans in the food markets of southern China; once individuals were hospitalized, the virus spread nosocomially to infect other patients and staff. The first reports of this novel disease outbreak came from the local media, and were later substantiated by e-mail messages. These caused international concern, in part because it was feared that a new influenza pandemic was emerging, and heightened as formal confirmation from Chinese authorities was not forthcoming. 1 Whilst the international community remained largely powerless, there being no legal mandate to ensure that China clarified what was occurring, cases appeared in other countries, further raising the stakes.

Thus, the SARS story highlighted a number of challenges to the communication of risk. First, with the advent of, and wide access to, the Internet and e-mail, information through informal and largely unverifiable sources can be transmitted to worldwide audiences within the public domain ahead of information sharing through formal channels. Second, because of the speed of movement of people, diseases can emerge in countries far from their source before outbreaks or the pathogens that cause them have been confirmed or identified.

SARS galvanized the international community to finally conclude drafting of the revised IHR. The IHR bind WHO member countries to not only notify all events that may constitute a public health emergency, but also to respond to requests for verification of information. WHO has also produced outbreak communication guidelines to aid in the dissemination of information to the public, recognizing that 'expertise [in communications] has become as essential to outbreak control as epidemiological training and laboratory analysis'. 2 The boundaries between risk communication and management are not, however, sharply delineated, as illustrated by the controversy surrounding H5N1 influenza virus sharing. Indonesia is one of the countries hardest hit by outbreaks of H5N1. Virus sharing with the international community is the mechanism by which, first, viruses developing pandemic potential can be tracked (risk communication), and second, vaccines can be developed to meet global need (risk management). Indonesia refused to virus share, not because it was opposed to the sharing of technical information to better understand the threat posed by H5N1 avian influenza, but because it felt excluded from equitable access to the resulting vaccine, meaning that its management of a subsequent pandemic would be constrained. 3 It could be argued that Indonesian authorities currently view virus sharing as an important element in risk management and thus a sovereign issue, although the international community, by contrast, views virus sharing as a critical element of risk communication and, by extension, a global risk management issue. Differing interpretations of international treaties are possible and resolution is proving challenging. 4 Ultimately, the debate is centred on the boundary between the governance of risk communication and risk management, the former now being mandated through international laws, with the latter remaining, to a large degree, a national sovereignty responsibility.

Implicit to better risk communication is a belief that better risk management will automatically follow. Surveillance is, after all, 'information for action'. Communication, co-operation and coordination are necessary at an international level. However, they are also, as the illustration below highlights, necessary at national and subnational levels.

In August 2005, Hurricane Katrina made landfall on the Gulf coast of the USA. The worst consequences were felt in New Orleans, Louisiana, where the levee system was breached and billions of dollars of damage occurred. The storm also caused significant loss of life and many people were displaced from their homes. The magnitude of the hurricane was anticipated, the risk having been communicated at both local and national level. However, this risk warning was not heeded appropriately. For example, although mandatory evacuation was eventually ordered, there was little provision for the large numbers involved or for those citizens who could not evacuate themselves. The aftermath of the storm, with many people left living in squalid conditions, also revealed a risk management process that left much to be desired. 5 One notable example was in the coordination of a bi-partisan emergency federal health policy response, attempts at which were blocked by the White House, citing multiple concerns including relevance and cost. The subsequent delay resulted in profound health, economic and political consequences. 6 Several lessons may be drawn for the risk management of disease outbreaks. Firstly, although risk communication may occur, it does not automatically result in a co-ordinated risk management response. Second, this occurred in the USA, a country which clearly has the public health and disaster management resources to deal with such a problem. However, these resources were not mobilized effectively, efficiently or in a timely manner. At the heart of many of the problems were fractured communication systems. Among operational problems, there were failures in communication technologies subsequent to the weather conditions and, whilst some decisions required extensive information, others were made on the basis of unverified rumours reported by the media, leading to incoherent responses. 5 Communication failures occurred between the local, state and federal agencies, and there was a lack of clear roles and responsibilities. Although New Orleans had experienced previous hurricanes and had a disaster management plan, the plan was clearly operationally fragile.

It is important to ensure that national strategic plans are operational. Recent reviews have reported that this does not yet seem to be the case. [7] [8] [9] The confusion and lack of clarity in the response to Hurricane Katrina show that traditional ways of working and their dependency on traditional communication systems may falter in the heat of a crisis. New ways of communicating allied to clearly defined roles and responsibilities may be needed.

In the changing landscape outlined, there are clearly many challenges for effective risk communication and risk management. In terms of the communication of risk, this article has focused on progress on the international stage. It is recognized that challenges still remain at national level, but the diversity of these is beyond the scope of this brief paper.

As illustrated by the examples above, tensions exist at national level between international commitments to communicate risk and risk management responses. However, because of the speed of movement of people and goods, global risk management is now as fragile as the weakest link in the community of nations. The challenge is, as with risk communication, to develop an operational framework that acknowledges national sovereignty but is also cognisant of national and individual interdependencies and connectedness.

The global response is building effectively upon the 'dry-run' of SARS, and lessons can be drawn from other public health crises such as Hurricane Katrina. The current global influenza pandemic and the attendant international attention offer an opportunity that should not be squandered. The almost unprecedented energy, political commitment and resources committed to this need to be built upon and harnessed, integrated and extended to support effective responses to public health threats. As the current H1N1 pandemic unfolds, it will be interesting to see how well lessons drawn from earlier public health emergencies have been learned. 10 Ethical approval None sought.

Assessing Community Reactions to Ebola Virus Disease and Other Disasters: Using Social Psychological Research to Enhance Public Health and Disaster Communications,"Drawing on the lessons learned from previous disaster and disease outbreak studies over the past two decades, in the following article we review research related to social psychological assessment of community attitudes, knowledge, and beliefs associated with the recent Ebola outbreak and other public health threats, and discuss the use of this information to assist in future disaster planning and crisis communications. Psychologists, physicians, and others in the healthcare field need to be aware of these developments and involved with preparations related to mitigating the psychological impact of Ebola disease outbreaks among different populations, as well as other potential public health threats in the future.","Given the scope of the recent Ebola outbreak in West Africa, exportation of Ebola virus disease (EVD) to other parts of the world is likely to continue (Farrar & Piot, 2014; Toner, Adalja, & Inglesby, 2014) . At this time, much is to be learned about EVD virology and epidemiology (Toner et al., 2014) . Several metropolitan areas in the US serve as ports of entry for travelers from West Africa and have communities of immigrants who regularly travel to West Africa, as well as healthcare workers who travel to this region (Benowitz et al., 2014) . In New York City (NYC) during November, 2014, several hundred persons believed to be exposed to the virus were being monitored by health department officials (Hartocollis, 2014) . Many public health agencies have experience with controlling previous disease outbreaks, such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), measles, novel OBJECTIVE This review is based on previous research related to bioterrorism, the environmental health impact of major disasters, and disease outbreaks over the past two decades (Boscarino, 1988; Boscarino & DiClemente, 1996; Boscarino et al., 2003; Boscarino, Adams, & Figley, 2011; Boscarino et al., 2013; Galea et al., 2002) . These events not only increase the public's concern about environmental health threats, but also have affected the psychological well-being of local populations. For example, research suggested that 11% of New York adults, approximately 700,000 persons, suffered a panic attack during the World Trade Center (WTC) attacks . Other studies, conducted nationally and within the New York area following the WTC attacks, also reported widespread psychological distress (Schlenger et al., 2002; Silver et al., 2002) . Findings related to the sudden occurrence of environmental health threats among other populations provide further evidence of the adverse psychological impact of such events, including the Tokyo Sarin gas attack (DiGiovanni, 1999; Ohbu et al., 1997) , the Scud missile attacks in Israel during the Gulf War (Karsenty et al., 1991) , and the West Nile virus outbreaks in the US (Covello, Peters, Wojtecki, & Hyde, 2001) . The onset of psychogenic illnesses have often been reported following such events Hallman et al., 2003; Wessely et al., 2001) , and even a limited EVD outbreak would likely have a significant psychological impact, making public health management difficult Foa et al., 2005) . Consequently, to assist with community preparedness, we suggest that future research needs to be focused on the following objectives:

• Assessment of level of knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs in the community related to the perceived environmental health threat.

• Evaluation of community preparedness and evacuation planning, including perceptions of public safety and beliefs about quarantining.

• Identification of higher risk subgroups, including key demographic, socioeconomic, and psychosocial groups, which have less knowledge, are misinformed, and are poorly prepared for a major environmental health threat.

• Appraisal of urban versus rural locality, gender, income, education, race, ethnicity, and healthcare facility access, as these relate to beliefs, knowledge, misinformation, and disaster preparedness.

• Discovery of the most effective means to disseminate disaster information through local/regional communications, social networks, and public/professional release of results.

From a public health perspective, managing psychological reactions among the public after a major environmental threat, and even before it occurs, is important DiGiovanni, 1999; Glass & Schoch-Spana, 2002) . Despite this realization, most of the public health preparedness activities to date have focused on the technological and biomedical aspects of these events, not the psychological impact (Bravata et al., 2002;  Committee on R&D Needs for Improving Civilian Medical Response to Chemical and Biological Terrorism Incidents, 1999; Keim & Kaufmann, 1999 ; US Department of Homeland Security, 2014). To examine the social psychological aspects of bioterrorism threats in New York following the WTC attacks a decade ago, we studied a random sample of nearly 1,700 adult residents (Boscarino, Adams, Figley et al., 2006) . We found that 45% of these residents were concerned about future attacks and that nearly 20% reported a fear level of ""10"" on a 10-point analog fear scale. In addition, while 43% indicated that they would wait for evacuation instructions following a chemical, biological, or nuclear event, 34.4% (95% C.I. = 31.5-37.3) reported that they would evacuate immediately without instructions from health or police department officials, actions that might result in greater civilian casualties. In this WTC study, predictors of higher fear levels included Hispanic ethnicity (odds ratio [OR]=2.0, p=0.006), lower levels of education (OR=4.4, p<0.001, and OR=3.7, p<0.001, respectively, for non-high school and high school graduates, compared to college graduates), being exposed to recent stressful life events (OR=1.6, p=0.048), having posttraumatic stress disorder (OR=3.1, p<0.001), having a high fear of death (OR=2.5, p=0.002), and reporting a high likelihood of fleeing an event against official advice (OR=1.5, p=0.034) (Boscarino, Adams, Figley et al., 2006) . In 2013, we reported that 6 months following Hurricane Sandy at the New Jersey Shore, 48% of area local residents reported major environment health concerns and those who had these concerns were more likely to have psychological problems, including posttraumatic stress disorder and depression, and/or to have sought mental health treatment . Thus, previous research suggests that better understanding of the public's perception of health threats is important for efficient preparedness planning, risk communications, and disaster management (Boscarino et al., 2003; Boscarino et al., 2013; Covello et al., 2001; Foa et al., 2005) .

We note that past disaster research findings are consistent with terror management theory, a social psychological concept, which suggests that a key to understanding reactions to environmental threats is understanding of the fear of death (Pyszczynski, Greenberg, & Solomon, 1999; Strachan et al., 2007) . Similar to stress-process theory Boscarino et al., 2014) , this fear is affected by social factors, level of education, self-esteem, and social support --factors responsible for buffering individuals against traumatic episodes and the subsequent adverse cognitive processes associated with these events Pyszczynski et al., 1999; Strachan et al., 2007) . It is noted that our New York terrorism study found that residents had the greatest level of trust in disaster evacuation information provided by local police and fire department officials (69%) (Boscarino et al., 2003) . This was followed by trust in information from their private doctors (59%), state health department officials (53%), US government officials (49%), and friends and neighbors (41%) (Boscarino et al., 2003) . Interestingly, residents had the least trust (17%) in evacuation information provided by health insurance companies or managed care plans, an important public health revelation at the time, suggesting that different risk communication strategies should be deployed (Boscarino et al., 2003) .

Given the threat to public health and the possible adverse impact on healthcare delivery systems, community interventions should be planned and implemented, including community surveys, workplace and family-based education and public service announcements (Engel & Katon, 1999; Foa et al., 2005) , as well as provider-focused interventions Gershon et al., 2004; Hu et al., 2006) . Post-event health surveillance also should be planned in the aftermath of a major event or disease outbreak Boscarino et al., 2014; Engel & Katon, 1999; Foa et al., 2005) . Drawing on past experiences, it has been suggested that public education and communication can reduce or limit adverse population reactions (Covello et al., 2001; Foa et al., 2005) . It has been previously suggested that ""risk communication"" can have the effect of not only reducing fear, but also promoting self-protecting behaviors (e.g., stockpiling emergency supplies, planning escape routes), building trust, and preventing the spread of misinformation (Covello et al., 2001; Foa et al., 2005) . Without these efforts, vulnerable persons and groups may increase the level of social disruption in the community (Boscarino et al., 2003; Boscarino, Adams, Figley et al., 2006) . The nature of these threats makes both media coverage and risk communications critical, warranting disaster planning considerations (Foa et al., 2005; North & Pfefferbaum, 2002) . It has been noted that a particular challenge with new disease outbreaks, such as EVD, is that much of the medical science is still unknown at the time the disease emerges (Rosenbaum, 2014) . Consequently, risk communications would need to incorporate this uncertainty, not ignore it, much like meteorologists do in forecasting extreme weather events using various ""warning systems,"" such as with hurricanes or tornados (Rosenbaum, 2014) . Of course, this was the same challenge with the outbreak of HIV disease in the 1980s (Boscarino, 1988; Boscarino & DiClemente, 1996) . Interestingly, our WTC disaster study indicated that simple, worksite crisis interventions offered by NYC employers immediately after the WTC attacks were effective in reducing a number of mental health problems post-disaster, including binge drinking, depression, PTSD severity, and anxiety symptoms (Boscarino, Adams, & Figley, 2005; , clearly a positive public health finding.

Much of our past disaster research was based on random community surveys of household adults in the affected disaster areas Boscarino et al., 2003; Boscarino, Adams, Figley et al., 2006; Boscarino et al., 2013; Galea et al., 2002) . These household population surveys were typically stratified geographically with the population sampled proportionately. At least one follow-up survey is also recommended, if research funds are available. For the follow-up surveys, typically, the investigator attempts to re-interview the participants 6-12 months after the baseline survey. For both baseline and follow-up surveys, trained interviewers using a computer-assisted telephone interviewing (CATI) system are preferred. In-person and mailed surveys are also sometimes feasible (Freedy, Kilpatrick, & Resnick, 1993) , but telephone surveys have several key advantages (Groves et al., 2009) . Generally, the duration of these surveys would be about 30-40 minutes for a baseline survey and about 20-30 minutes for a follow-up survey. For both surveys, sampling weights would normally be developed to correct for potential selection bias Boscarino, Adams, Figley et al., 2006; Boscarino & Adams, 2009; Boscarino et al., 2011) . The goal should be to complete at least 600-800 interviews, in order to have sufficient statistical power to test specific hypotheses and to allow for analyses of important subgroups Hulley et al., 2013) . One of the limitations of the telephone survey, however, is the cost (Groves et al., 2009) . These studies can be expensive to conduct, depending on the sample size, length of the interview, and the use incentives to increase participation (Groves et al., 2009) . As a result, other methods for data collection are sometimes used, generally considered more qualitative, such as focus groups and on-line internet surveys (Groves et al., 2009) . The other chief method used in public health disaster research is the post-disaster research registry (Institute of Medicine and US Department of Health and Human Services, 2014; Jordan et al., 2011; North et al., 1999) . Registries are disease surveillance systems chiefly developed by epidemiologists to track disease outcomes over time (Rothman, Greenland, & Lash, 2012) . One of the more well known of these post-disaster registries is the World Trade Center Disaster Registry (Institute of Medicine and US Department of Health and Human Services, 2014; Jordan et al., 2011) . Another one is the World Trade Center Responder Registry (Pietrzak et al., 2014) . However, regardless of the methodology used, it is extremely important for investigators to use reliable and validated research instruments in data collection (Boscarino et al., 2003; Boscarino, Adams, Figley et al., 2006; Boscarino et al., 2013; Boscarino et al., 2014; Galea et al., 2002) . If not, data issues may confound the study results for years afterwards (Dohrenwend et al., 2006; Kilpatrick, 2007) . Finally, studies of healthcare professional and first responders are also important for disaster planning and may warrant special research considerations (Adams, Figley, & Boscarino, 2008; ).

Given current threats and emerging knowledge related to both environmental and humanmade disasters, we think that interventions should be considered, including community, workplace and family-based programs and public service announcements, based on new and existing research (Boscarino, Adams, Figley et al., 2006; Boscarino et al., 2014; Engel & Katon, 1999; Foa et al., 2005) . Post-event health surveillance also should be planned in the aftermath of major incidents. The World Trade Center Disaster Registry is one of the more well known of these approaches (Institute of Medicine and US Department of Health and Human Services, 2014; Jordan et al., 2011) . Drawing on past experiences, it has been suggested that public education and communication can reduce adverse population outcomes Covello et al., 2001; Foa et al., 2005) . It has been previously suggested that effective ""risk communication"" can have the effect of not only reducing fear, but also promoting self-protecting behaviors, and preventing misinformation (Boscarino, Adams, Figley et al., 2006; Covello et al., 2001; Foa et al., 2005) . Without these efforts, vulnerable persons, including the elderly and the disabled, might increase social disruptions and the burden of healthcare utilization in the community (Boscarino et al., 2003; Boscarino et al., 2014) . The very nature of these threats make media coverage, risk communications, and social media critical, warranting advanced disaster planning considerations (Boscarino, Adams, Figley et al., 2006; Boscarino et al., 2014; Foa et al., 2005) . As suggested, our post-WTC study indicated that simple, workplace ""psychoeducational"" interventions offered by NYC employers after the WTC disaster were highly effective in reducing future mental health problems among employees, including significant reductions in anxiety symptoms Boscarino et al., 2011) , clearly a positive public health finding.

In summary, while there is concern related to adverse events following the outbreak of EVD and gaps in knowledge currently exist, the research tools needed to mitigate the impact of these threats are available (Boscarino, Adams, Figley et al., 2006; Boscarino et al., 2014; Engel & Katon, 1999; Foa et al., 2005) . Psychologists, physicians, and others in the public health sector need to be aware of these developments and become more involved with preparations related to the psychosocial mitigation of disease outbreaks, and other public health threats in the future.

The three domains of public health: An internationally relevant basis for public health education?,"By focusing on the Masters of Public Health course, this study took a pragmatic approach to exploring the interface between public health education and public health practice. The commonly utilized 'three domains of practice' framework could provide a robust and explicit link between educational provision and practice for public health. This model provides the workforce, the university, the students and the potential funders of the course with an easily comprehensible framework for understanding how the modules of an MSc can support the development of competency within the context of practice.","The 'three domains of practice' is an operationally robust framework for public health practice. The utility of the model is increased by the overlap of the domains, which reflects the lack of clear boundaries in practice. It has proven to be popular with the specialist public health workforce for its ability to provide a cohesive framework that encompasses the broad-ranging challenges and roles within the broader field of public health, 1,2 at specialist and practitioner levels, and enables the mix of skills to be contextualized within a practice-orientated context. 3-5,a The model describes public health in terms of three interrelated but distinct aspects of public health practice: health improvement, which draws heavily on the local government roots of the profession, socioeconomic influences and health promotion, tackling the underlying determinants of health; health protection, which incorporates communicable disease control; environmental, chemical, radiation and nuclear threats; and occupational health; and health service quality improvement, which incorporates healthcare systems, service quality, evidence-based practice, clinical effectiveness and health economics.

Practice within the three domains draws upon the underpinning core skills and knowledge of epidemiology, biostatistics, use of information, law and ethical practice, conceptualized within the model by the overlap between the domains (Fig. 1 ). This provides a robust operational framework to describe the areas of practice, the services to be delivered, and the roles and responsibilities of those delivering them, particularly the core skills, knowledge and competencies that are needed. Theoretically, this systemized approach to public health delivery can be used to draw out the different levels of competency that will be required by the workforce to carry out their respective roles, and as such has potential for adaptation to underpin educational provision.

Rasmussen's research into theories of learning supports a competency-based approach to learning. Theoretically, courses that are able to recreate the practice environment, e.g. by looking at the competencies required to function in the field, rather than the competencies in isolation, would improve the ability of the students to apply the theoretical skills of the classroom to the workplace, and improve their ability to make intraprofessional linkages. [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] Professional support for the concept of education linked to practice is high, and it is already firmly embedded in the USA for both professional development and educational provision, with competency frameworks reflected in the curricula for training programmes, and both courses and schools for public health subject to assessment and accreditation of their programmes. 13, 14 The purpose of this study was to explore the interface between public health education and public health practice. This is particularly important because of the ill-defined nature of the public health workforce. As an analysis of job vacancies in Australia demonstrated, public health skills and competencies are applicable across a wide range of workforce roles, with the lack of clear practice boundaries complicating workforce planning. 15 By providing a snapshot of current provision, this paper helps to create a common framework for dialogue between stakeholders and has the potential to inform future curriculum planning.

This study incorporated a background literature review using Cinahl and Pubmed, a web-based survey of Masters of Public Health (MPH) prospecti to identify their modular provision, and a case study in Hong Kong. Concept analysis techniques were used to deconstruct the concept of competency in public health systematically, using the routinely available data on MPH educational provision (i.e. web-based prospecti) as a surrogate for public health education provision.

To inform the analytical methodology, a PubMed search was used to identify academic frameworks that had been used for studies informed by concept analysis. This suggested that there were four main models or frameworks. [16] [17] [18] [19] In line with Botes' analysis of the limitations of concept analysis, a dual methodology, which incorporated both empirical investigation techniques (i.e. the web-based survey and data analysis) and a literature review, was used to enhance the quality of concept analysis and increase the reliability and validity of the study, 20 enabling a greater focus on the way in which support for the development of public health competency was 'operationalized' within MPH prospecti (Box 1). 18 A three-stage process was used to identify and map existing courses:

identification of relevant MPH courses within overall postgraduate provision within the UK; identification of 'core modules' common to the majority of courses-theoretically, the 'generic' skills or competencies taught within universities; and mapping modular provision to the three domains of practice model to determine how MPH modular provision mapped against the operational framework for public health practice and competency development.

At the time of the study (October 2005), the search strategy identified 1079 postgraduate courses, across 55 universities, which included 'public health' in their course description. Many of the courses identified were subsequently excluded as they only offered discrete modules on public health and were not primarily about public health, e.g. animal care and science degrees, with a total of 35 MPH courses identified by the research strategy.

Inevitably, the eventual data-collection methodology, i.e. a web-based collection strategy for the module descriptions, had implications for the depth of information that was available on each of the modules. Whilst future studies could take a more detailed approach to this to validate the findings, the chosen methodology reflects consideration of the ethical justifiability of approaching universities for copies of their course prospecti for research and not enrolment purposes, and the time restraints involved in undertaking and submitting an MPH dissertation.

The use of the Internet in research, although generally found to be valuable, raises particular concerns about the quality, authority and credibility of sources, as the ability to post on the Internet is unrestricted. 23 Whilst currency, in theory, is one area in which Internet resources have been found to have a potential advantage over print resources, 24 sites are often undated, with inconsistent updating of the links between the sites affecting the efficacy of the research tool.

In the UK, the policy trajectory for professional development in public health shows an increasing emphasis on the acquisition of health improvement skills and competency-based frameworks at all levels [25] [26] [27] [28] to support the development of a 'fully engaged scenario'. 25 There is now, in essence, a framework that could be utilized to form the progressive steps of a 'skills escalator' 29 model for public health and health improvement by

The web-based survey used the free-text terms 'public health' and 'post graduate' to identify the universities offering postgraduate public health and/or MPH courses in the UK. The case study involved a series of informal interviews with key stakeholders in Hong Kong to establish the levels of support for and understanding of the proposed changes. E-mails were sent out at the time of the Hong Kong case study to identify any grey literature of relevance, identifying only one other study. 21 A copy of the interim report from this study was obtained. The web-based survey and competency analysis was undertaken as part of an MSc dissertation submitted by one of the authors. 22 defining what is expected of staff working at each of the workforce levels, and increasingly within each of the domains of practice. The standardized competency framework for specialists 30 and practitioners [31] [32] [33] in public health is already in place at a generic level, and work is underway to define the intraspecialism and entry-level competencies. 34 With the introduction of 'Agenda for change' and the underpinning knowledge and skills framework, the relationship between demonstration of competency and standards of practice is articulated across the whole of the health service workforce. Alongside this notion of a wider workforce for public health, the professionally led response has been to put developmental work into place that defines more clearly what is meant by being a 'specialist' in this wider conceptualization of the workforce, with explicit articulation of what it means to be a 'competent' specialist or a 'competent' practitioner (Table 1) .

However, a recent review of the specialist examination system suggested that this model is incompletely reflected in postgraduate educational provision for public health development. 35 The survey of provision identified 55 universities in the UK offering public health courses, of which 35 were marketing their MPH course as generic. Analysis was restricted to these 35 generic courses. Looking across the spectrum of modular provision across the courses, perhaps unsurprisingly, labelling of modules was inconsistent, with 310 different titles in operation. However, the accompanying notes suggested that despite labelling inconsistencies, there was consistency in the coverage and stated purpose of the modules, for example in the skills and knowledge development offered within health protection courses ( Table 2) .

MPH course descriptions were analysed to identify those that referenced the Faculty of Public Health (FPH)/Voluntary Register and the National Occupational Standards (NOS) for Public Health explicitly. Twenty-three course descriptions did not mention the existence of the competency frameworks currently in operation in the UK, or of the FPH or the Voluntary Register. These descriptions tended to suggest that the courses were intersectoral and interprofessional, non-medical, internationally relevant and supported working in the 'broad field of public health'. However, module descriptions within these courses were comparable with those that did make explicit references to the FPH and NOS, sharing no common modular content or description that was not identifiable in the other category (Table 3 ). Table 2 Overview of gross provision.

Fifty-five universities were identified in the UK offering 'public health' courses, of which 35 a were generic MPH courses and 20 were dual specialisms, with health promotion and nutrition being the most common dual specialisms.

Three hundred and ten different modular titles in use; descriptions suggest skills development consistent; twenty-seven of the 35 generic MPH course websites stated explicitly which modules were core to their qualification and which were elective; and the 'top five' most commonly occurring modules, without differentiating between core and elective status, were:

No clear picture of the operational framework emerged, nor was there a sense of how overall provision reflects and supports the development of competencies within the operational context of service practice. To address this shortfall, the 'three domains of practice' model, which has been found to be an operationally robust framework for scoping public health practices, was applied to the data collected on national modular provision.

Courses were grouped into four sections: generic skills for public health; health improvement courses; health protection courses; and courses that focused on the quality of health and social care. The placement of a module within a grouping was not arbitrary, but was informed by an analysis of the competency development work carried out by the FPH, Skills for Health and other partners, and utilized the framework produced by the scoping exercise undertaken in Hong Kong. 34, 36, 37 The advice of senior public health specialists was sought where necessary to ensure that the positioning of courses within the domains was impartial. For some of the courses, it proved impossible to place them within a single domain, e.g. dental health. This reflects the content of the modular descriptions, which implied that the module proposed to build competencies in more than one domain of practice (Table 4) .

A count was made of all the courses available within each of the domains. Courses that could not be placed within a single domain, or were categorized as core skills, were placed in a generic category of 'insufficient detail'. Two different analyses of the data are given in Fig. 2 . This reflects the ambiguity in the literature around the status of epidemiology. Whilst some researchers have suggested it is a core public health skill, it has also been suggested that this is more appropriately visualized as a core skill for the health protection domain of public health. The available course descriptions did not give sufficient data to determine if the modules provided were purely introductory or if they gave a more in-depth analysis and, as such, might be more appropriately situated within the health protection sphere (Fig. 2) .

It was noteworthy that the range of courses within the quality of health and social care domain was much wider than within the other domains, which tended to demonstrate greater consistency in the modules offered within the overarching framework. For example:

health promotion modules largely focused on theory and lifestyles issues; health protection modules focused on disaster management and communicable disease control; and Table 3 Links between Masters of Public Health and operational context in the UK.

Twenty-three of 35 courses made no reference to FPH/NOS on their website. Twelve of 35 courses made explicit references to FPH/NOS, with: six suggesting that the course is compatible with preparation for FPH Part A examinations; four offering the opportunity to focus on 'defined areas of specialist practice', explicitly health promotion and health protection; three acknowledging the existence of frameworks, but not clarifying the role of the course in relation to frameworks;

one running the specialist trainee programme in its region; one stating that the primary objective of the course was to 'provide the necessary academic components of training for those on a training scheme'; and one geared towards portfolio development for voluntary registration. Health improvement: oral health strategy, promotion of health, e.g. balanced nutrition, diet, less carbonated/ sugary drinks, sweets and snacking; health protection: water fluoridation, more fluorides in contact with tooth surfaces, mouthguards in sport, cycle helmets and effective tooth cleaning/mouth rinsing after food; and health services quality: dental health services with evidence-based practice, e.g. dental hygiene, National Institute for Clinical Excellence guidance on wisdom teeth, recall intervals for check-ups. quality of health and social care modules covered the range from policy to management, often offering very discrete modules, e.g. on personnel management and project financing.

The data collected suggest that elective courses tend to be offered more frequently in the fields of health promotion and quality of health and social care than in health protection, suggesting that students engaging in MPHs are offered more opportunities to develop competencies in these fields as part of generic provision.

The revision of the MPH in Hong Kong offered the opportunity to use the three domains as the basis for restructuring the course. The model was deemed to be appropriate to this setting because Hong Kong College of Community Medicine bases its professional standards on those of the UK FPH, and the specialist examination system is common for Part A, although Part 2 has been retained rather than Part B OSPHE b . To inform the review, MPH courses within the existing school of public health were mapped to identify the range of modules already on offer within the school, with many modules, i.e. epidemiology and biostatistics, being common to multiple Masters programmes. A series of interviews with relevant local stakeholders were undertaken to establish the strength of support for the proposed changes and their understanding of the conceptual framework.

The interviews established that stakeholders understood the concepts behind the three domains model, and believed that it could provide employers with a better understanding of the skills acquired by graduates during their course and their applicability to the practice environment. In general, interviews suggested that it was feasible that the MPH could support competency acquisition for specialist status in both public health and medical administration, if flexibility in choosing electives and modules were more fully developed. By broadening the base of teaching, linking across to other Masters courses for modules, the course would be able to attract a wider market of students and ensure the relevance of modules to the wider public health agenda. Fig. 1 shows the current course.

The restructured MPH is an integrated theorypractice curriculum that allows students to achieve professional public health competency. It provides broad public health perspectives and skills necessary to assume effective leadership in public health practice, reflecting the three domains of health improvement, health protection and health service quality. All students are expected to gain core competence in the three domains. Students can then select courses in their areas of interest, as well as elective courses relevant to their specialized area, including epidemiology, environmental health and communicable disease, health promotion, health policy and management, women's health and healthy ageing. This approach is congruent with that developed by the Association of Schools of Public Health (ASPH) in the USA, which recognizes five core areas with a set of common competencies. 38 It also includes occupational/ workplace health as part of public health practice, reflecting the unique professional context for practice, as well as placing greater emphasis on communicable disease than in the US model.

Public health is increasingly practiced globally; severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), avian flu, tobacco control and obesity are all challenges that are not unique to any one country. The Cochrane Collaboration reviews scientific evidence on an international basis, particularly in the evidence-based healthcare domain. Reflecting this complexity of practice within an educational context creates a substantial challenge for the public health education system. There is a significant risk that failure to do so will undermine the provision of a coherent, realistic and appropriate education for public health practice, which meets the needs of the widest conceptualization of the workforce. 1, 15, 39 Increasing literature on disparities and inequalities and new or rediscovered policy approaches, e.g. social marketing, the increasing 'personal' focus of public health, pose challenges to the existing teaching provision, making it difficult for universities to keep pace with the rate of change. With greater attention being given to accountability and outcomes in higher education, 40-42 a strong emphasis on competency-based training for public health and its subdisciplines, 28 and the incorporation of competencies into accreditation criteria for courses and schools of public health, 43 the challenges for providers of public health education have never been more explicit. Two key challenges have been identified in the literature for public health educationalists in relation to supporting their students to develop competency: to balance student needs to understand and apply the principles of public health with the need for them to be confident that they will be able to practice safely if they do so, with the role of education being the empowerment of students 44 ; and to support students in developing a broad range of knowledge and skills, which is related to the practices and settings of service and programme delivery. 10, 15, 45 Paradoxically, the scope of the public health agenda has never been more diffuse, with new developments heralding changes in policy direction, in practice and in research directions. Structural changes, 46 concerns about sustainability 25 and the ever-evolving operational/policy agenda add to the complexity. Calman's definition of the three levels of the public health workforce 47 has, in many respects, been expanded with the introduction of the 'fully engaged scenario' envisaged by Wanless. 25 The introduction of 'Agenda for change', the knowledge and skills framework and the work on the National Occupational Standards for Public Health undertaken by Skills for Health in the UK have all combined to define the expected competencies of the workforce more clearly at each of these levels.

In the UK, it is recognized that effective public health practice requires drawing upon the skills of diverse professional groupings. The three domains approach offers a model to make sense of both the scale of the agenda and the relative contributions of groupings to the practice of public health. It establishes the boundaries of the field for which the competencies achieved through training and education can be applied to a framework based on the historical origins of public health. The Welsh Assembly Government and the National Public Health Service in Wales use the framework explicitly in strategic commissioning and providing public health services. Thus, the three domains approach could ground teaching practice, enabling the assimilation of new thinking into the curriculum. In itself, however, it does not validate the required competencies. To validate the importance of what is included in an MPH course, it is necessary to consider what graduates do, the challenges they face and the mix of skills they require in practice settings. 15, 45 As the National Public Health Partnership in Australia noted, any conceptualization of the core functions of public health needs to be relevant to the 'total public health effort and not just to those activities which government public health authorities are responsible for carrying out or funding'. 1 Whilst the approach was grounded within the UK system, the Hong Kong case study demonstrated that the course could be applied to other settings. The restructured programme was run for the first time in the 2006/2007 academic year. The conceptual fit between this model and the accreditation competencies used by the Association of Schools of Public Health for review of schools suggests that the model could be applied more widely. 43 As Table 5 demonstrates, by grouping courses within thematic areas, the three domains approach provides a way of conceptualizing those underpinning skills and knowledge frameworks that are core to all aspects of public health practice. By grouping other topics within the three domains, explicit concentra-tion domains are provided that can be updated as new knowledge and events dictate. For example, in the field of health protection, infectious diseases and post-disaster management have increased in profile since the advent of SARS and the 9/11 terrorist attacks, respectively. Students can make informed choices about how to develop their skills within public health, choosing to focus on one aspect of public health practice or, alternatively, to 'drill down' in the skills of biostatistics and epidemiology, for example. This process is not dissimilar to that adopted in the USA, fitting conceptually with the redefined curriculum proposed by the ASPH competency project.

Developing curricula that support students in acquiring practice-based competencies could potentially result in greater uptake of courses, as it makes explicit the congruence between educational provision and practice. 48 Furthermore, because the competency framework is used by the public health professional standard setting bodies in the UK, it could potentially facilitate career progression for students, as they will be taught in a way that maps explicitly and transparently against the assessment criteria used by the standard setting bodies for practice. The value of this to those seeking FPH membership would be considerable and may make the courses more attractive and sustainable. In practice, there has been limited operationalization of the competency frameworks within MPH provision, with only 12 of the 35 courses currently on offer making explicit reference to the FPH and the competency frameworks.

However, much of the literature assessing the impact of competency-based training on practice has been unidisciplinary. It suggests that the process is at its most effective when assessment strategies reflect 'real-world observation' and consist of a 'portfolio' of assessment tools. 6 This will be a challenge for public health, in particular, given the ill-defined workforce and portfolio of practice, 49 which reflects the disparate nature of people engaged in public health activity and the understanding that public health is 'everyone's business' (David Worthington, personal communication). Whilst there is literature available that provides a framework to match a curriculum to practice development, 50 it has not previously been applied to public health. Applying the model to the findings from this study suggests that competency in relation to public health is relatively well defined. However, as public health itself is less well defined and delineated, 49 the reference points that are informing the competencies and which would inform both practice and curriculum development to support practice would need some further study to ensure that the maximal potential of the evidence base is achieved and reflected within a curriculum. Ensuring that the perspective of practitioners, specialists and their employing agencies are reflected adequately within the framework will be key to achieving this goal. 45 

This study has suggested that current MPH provision in the UK may not be reaching its full potential, as the dialogue between public health practice, public health policy and public health educational provision lacks transparency. Whilst the concept of competency has achieved a stage of relative definitional maturity, its functionality as a common foundation for academic and vocational work is debatable without further exploration to ensure that the competencies are grounded in the current context of practice, and reflect the experience of the specialist and practitioner workforces, and the current vision for practice articulated in policy documents. Models that incorporate competency-based learning within a more explicitly realized visualization of the delivery environment may better support students' future learning and adaptability to the workplace by enabling students to take a systemized approach to their learning, which is more responsive to the changing political and practical agendas. The three domains model, which has been found to be operationally robust in the UK and is endorsed by the FPH, its specialist body, could be easily adapted for use by providers of public health education, as evidenced by the UK and Hong Kong case studies.

The politics and ethics of hospital infection prevention and control: a qualitative case study of senior clinicians' perceptions of professional and cultural factors that influence doctors' attitudes and practices in a large Australian hospital,"Background: Hospital infection prevention and control (IPC) programs are designed to minimise rates of preventable healthcare-associated infection (HAI) and acquisition of multidrug resistant organisms, which are among the commonest adverse effects of hospitalisation. Failures of hospital IPC in recent years have led to nosocomial and community outbreaks of emerging infections, causing preventable deaths and social disruption. Therefore, effective IPC programs are essential, but can be difficult to sustain in busy clinical environments. Healthcare workers' adherence to routine IPC practices is often suboptimal, but there is evidence that doctors, as a group, are consistently less compliant than nurses. This is significant because doctors' behaviours disproportionately influence those of other staff and their peripatetic practice provides more opportunities for pathogen transmission. A better understanding of what drives doctors' IPC practices will contribute to development of new strategies to improve IPC, overall.","In high income countries, an estimated 4-8% of hospital inpatients develop healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) [1] and nosocomial transmission of multidrug resistant organisms (MRDO) is a major contributor to antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and its associated healthcare costs [2, 3] . It is estimated that 35-55%, or more, of HAIs are preventable [4, 5] , although rates are highly variable, depending on how effectively IPC measures are implemented [6, 7] . Failures of routine hospital infection prevention and control (IPC) practices, in high income countries during this century, have resulted in devastating nosocomial outbreaks of exotic or emerging infections, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in Toronto, in 2003 [8] and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) in Seoul in 2015 [9] , causing preventable deaths and massive social and economic disruption.

Hand hygiene is the most obvious, easily audited and, arguably, the most effective IPC practice [10, 11] , Its efficacy has been recognised since at least the mid-nineteenth century, with numerous studies showing that significant reductions in pathogen transmission and HAI rates are temporally associated with improved hand hygiene compliance [12] . Nevertheless, the use of hand hygiene as a surrogate for IPC quality and the moral status of noncompliance have been questioned, largely as a consequence of ongoing controversy about auditing methods and plausible compliance targets [13] [14] [15] . Ethical considerations have particular salience in light of numerous studies reporting lower than average compliance with IPC policies among doctors, compared with other health professionals, albeit with wide variation [16] [17] [18] . Doctors' attitudes and behaviours are important, because they disproportionately influence those of other hospital staff and doctors often overestimate their own knowledge and compliance [19, 20] . Yet their peripatetic clinical practice provides numerous opportunities to transmit pathogens [21] and to be pathogen ""super-spreaders"" [22, 23] .

Doctors retain considerable professional autonomy and power, despite repeated challenges from increased regulation, other health professions, evidence-based medicine and consumerism [24] [25] [26] . Despite recent attempts to redefine ""medical professionalism"", a universally agreed definition remains elusive; but all versions include common commitments to e.g. patient welfare; maintenance of knowledge and skills; and securing public trust through professional self-regulation and avoidance of conflicts of interest [27] [28] [29] . How doctors interpret these commitments depends on how they perceive their professional identity [30] . In practice, their attitudes and practices are complex and sometimes perplexing. Assuming that patient welfare is doctors' highest priority [31] , one may reasonably ask why some would expose their patients to preventable infection risks by failing to observe well-established IPC rules [30, 32] ?

Previous qualitative and mixed methods studies of factors that affect adherence to IPC practices have generally involved mixed groups of healthcare workers and/or focused on particular institutional settings, such as intensive care units. While these studies have identified factors that contribute to IPC practices including: self-protection, role modelling, belief (or not) in the effectiveness of IPC, knowledge, communication and workload [11, 20, 33, 34] they have not, for the most part, explained why these factors are so influential. The aim of this study was to explore what factors affect doctors' IPC practices and, more specifically, why they are so influential. It took the form of in-depth conversations between researchers and participants, all of whom were senior clinical leaders and or clinician-director/managers with many years' experience. Our expectation was that the perspectives of both ""insiders"" [senior doctors] and more objective ""outsiders"" [senior nurses] would provide new insights to inform strategies to raise the priority of IPC within the medical community and limit harm from HAIs and AMR more effectively.

Our research question was: What professional and cultural factors influence doctors' attitudes to and practice of infection prevention and control?

Both researchers are senior physicians, one female, one male. Our special interest in hospital IPC stems from longstanding experience in caring for patients who are at high risk, have suffered and, in some cases, died, from preventable HAIs and/or have experienced the uncertainty and fear associated with being colonised by a MDRO.

Both of us were employed, for many years before or during this study, at the hospital where it was conducted. Most of the participants were known to at least one of us, as colleagues, but with few exceptions, we had not worked closely with them.

Our aim was to build a rich portrait of doctors' attitudes to and practice of IPC, in one large Australian tertiary hospital, by means of in-depth interviews with experienced senior doctors and nurses. Together with them, we hoped to formulate new theories to better explain the reasons behind doctors' IPC practices, in order to develop more effective and generalisable strategies to improve them. We used a thematic analysis approach to data analysis [35] .

Participants were senior doctors (i.e. medical practitioners) and nurses with varied clinical and/or management responsibilities, who were purposively selected as being likely to have a broad perspective on the attitudes, beliefs and practices of the hospital's medical staff across age-groups and specialties. Invitations were sent by email, explaining the purpose of the study. Thirty-two potential participants -22 doctors and 10 nurses -were contacted sequentially. All of the nurses and 16 doctors agreed to participate; two doctors were unavailable, one refused and three did not respond. Sixteen participants were facility/divisional directors or unit managers, 10 were specialist consultants; they had had 10-40 years' professional experience and most had been employed in the hospital for more than 10 years. Doctors were either full-time staff specialists [SS] or visiting medical officers (VMOs) contracted on a sessional basis. Nurses were all full-time employees. Participant characteristics are summarised in Table 1 .

The setting was a~950-bed university teaching hospital, serving a population of about 0.9 million in Sydney and providing a broad range of tertiary specialist services to more than 90,000 inpatients, annually. The study was conducted at a single site to enable a rich and detailed understanding of the influences on doctors IPC practices and to avoid potential confounding effects of different policies, patient populations or physical environments.

Semi-structured interviews, lasting 27-77 min, were conducted by one researcher. They took the form of frank conversations between colleagues. Most were conducted in the participant's -or occasionally the interviewer's -office with no-one else present. Interviews were recorded and digitally transcribed by a professional transcription service, with participants' informed consent. Examples of questions used to prompt discussion are shown in Table 2 . Interview transcripts were checked for accuracy by one researcher.

Both authors reviewed the transcripts, coded them manually and analysed them thematically [35] , to identify themes and subthemes relevant to the research question. After initial analysis, transcripts and emergent themes/subthemes were reviewed, iteratively, and modified after further discussion. Recruitment ceased when data saturation had been reached.

Participants gave written informed consent to interviews being recorded and transcribed. They were assured that their comments would be confidential and quoted, if at all, only after removal of identifying information. In describing our findings, we identified participants' professions and roles, broadly, to preserve anonymity, as nursing director (ND), manager (NM) or consultant (NC); or medical director (MD) or consultant (MC).

The relevant Local Health District human research ethics committee approved the study.

Four major themes emerged from the data and, within Theme 1, four subthemes were identified. These themes and subthemes are outlined in Table 3 . Theme 1 is the subject of this paper. Other themes/subthemes will be discussed, in detail, elsewhere.

You can't tell doctors what to do (medical director [MD]1).

Doctors' highly valued clinical autonomy was seen as one of the most important determinants of IPC practices. Participants described doctors, generally, as self-motivated and averse to being told what to do, particularly as they become more senior. This was attributed to: the types of people who become doctors; doctors' perception that others expect them to be confident and decisive; and their tendency to rely on clinical judgment and experience, rather than ""rules"". However, participants described differences in how doctors enact clinical autonomy in their IPC practices. Those of some individual doctors and unitsrepresenting such varied specialties as transplantation surgery, haematology, general surgery and neurosurgerywere described, by participants, as exemplary. A unit director (MD4) recounted his own unit's practice, of having a junior doctor audit the team's hand hygiene compliance and present the results at weekly meetings, and his pride in the resulting improvement. At the other extreme, several participantsindependently -cited examples of units in which IPC standards were notoriously poor and HAI rates (reputedly) excessive; they also described individual consultants who had to be reminded, repeatedly, about basic IPC precautions and who vehemently demurred, refused or tried to avoid situations where they may be asked, to comply:

From a political point of view, we (intensive care unit [ICU] clinicians) are in a bind. We encourage outside (surgical) teams to see their high-risk patients daily, (but) they're saying ""I don't want to go to ICU, they always give me a hard time about washing my hands or taking my jacket off"". So, we're trying to make sure that they have easy access to the patients, but in such a way that the whole process is smooth. For some clinicians, hand hygiene presents an objectionable obstacle. (emphasis added) (MD3) Several (doctor) participants thought their colleagues' objections, to IPC ""rules"" that they perceived to be inflexible, inappropriately applied or imposed by outsiders, were legitimate. For example, patients being placed in contact isolation, when the risk of cross-infection was minimal, caused increased pressure on already over-burdened junior doctors and potentially endangered other patients, because of misplaced priorities.

The infection control nursing staff don't understand the pressures that medical staff, particularly junior medical staff, are under. Some of the attitudes to infection control appear to be given in isolation without really an understanding of how they might be integrated into all the various things that have to be done by residents and senior doctors and nurses.

A bit of an irritant is if I'm asked to take precautions that I don't think are appropriate (when) nursing staff have instituted a policy (and) gone a bit too far. (For example) a patient who has minor neutropenia and a (mild) fever that you're keeping in just in case.... they're given priority, put in a single room and everybody's in gloves and gowns; and they've got other people out in the ward coughing and hacking, perhaps harbouring something much more significant. (MD4) Several medical directors attributed doctors' poor IPC practices to ignorance, although on-line IPC training and attendance at education sessions was supposedly mandatory.

There's a poor understanding of what's required, even though you're meant to do mandatory training. But Apparent adherence to IPC principles sometimes reflected tradition or habituated behaviour, rather than knowledge of organisational policies. A surgeon contrasted his colleagues' almost ritualistic ""surgical scrubbing"" and donning of theatre attire in the operating theatre, with cursory adherence to standard IPC precautions in the wards: Participants emphasised the importance of leadership in moulding the IPC practices of junior doctors, who are likely to emulate those of senior consultants. They characterised good IPC leaders as consistently adhering to good practices, themselves, and being willing to discuss IPC principles and review practices and outcomes with their teams (see MD4's anecdote about registrar hand hygiene audits, above, and Unit X director's response to his patients' HAIs below). Of course, clinical leadership is about much more than IPC practices: I often talk about (a particular surgical unit) because they are a high performing team and their leadership is very strong across the board in all sorts of areas; they're very solid as a team and the interns know the rules and abide by them even when (the consultants) are not there. (ND1)

On the other hand, bad or absent leadership is often also associated with poor IPC practice. If the ""boss"" ignores or disparages IPC practices, junior doctors would follow suit.

It's about leadership and followership. Senior staff 's lack of role modelling -automatically the followers see that ""it's not a big deal for Sir, so it's not a big deal for me"". (MD1) One participant wondered whether leadership and role modelling might be less critical, now that junior doctors were increasingly aware of the importance of IPC and could influence consultants' IPC behaviours, by reminding them of the policies. The more prevalent view was that the (still) powerful medical hierarchy was a strong deterrent against any attempt to correct the ""boss"", even implicitly, for fear of retribution.

Where a junior person speaks to a more senior person (about) a protocol that hasn't been performed correctly, the senior person feels threatened. The normal thing is to stamp your authority and say ""well hang on, who are you?"". (MC2)

Most participants felt that any good habits learnt in medical school were likely to be superseded by hidden curricula assimilated during postgraduate training. Doctor participants admitted that they would not personally feel comfortable speaking to senior colleagues about poor IPC practices; on the other hand, some nurse participants said they would willingly speak up to a consultant or team with whom they had a good working relationship.

Participants acknowledged the devastating effects, on patients, of serious HAIs, but pointed out that most doctors personally manage such complications infrequently and hear about only the worst cases at morbidity and mortality (M&M) meetings. Many doctors have little appreciation of the incidence, or impact on patients, of more minor infections. Moreover, HAIs are often regarded as unavoidable; they are rarely attributable to specific actions, omissions or even patterns of behaviour, because of the inevitable delay and multiple factors and people involved.

Nevertheless, participants described doctors' contrasting reactions to their own patients' HAIs: one saw it as a disaster, for which he felt personally responsible, another as a driver for change.

A nurse manager described starkly contrasting attitudes between two unit directors:

(Unit X's director says) ""What did we do wrong: what are we going to do to make sure this doesn't happen (again)?"" He doesn't want to see bad things happen to patients.

(Unit Y's director at the departmental M&M meeting) … . it's: ""What's the patient done wrong this time? It's the patient's fault. It's not our fault. The patient's dirty (or) too fat; they should have looked after themselves better"". There's no accountability, no insight. (NM3) Several participants noted that HAIs are often overlooked because of inadequate patient follow-up; they were highly critical of some senior consultants' infrequent ward rounds, expectation that trainees would manage and follow-up patients, often with minimal supervision, and apparent lack of interest in patient outcomes.

Somebody who swans in, looks at something, swans out again and never understands that what he actually did was screwed up the patient's life -that's the problem. Interviewer: What can you do about it? Participant: Throw their noses in the data. (MD8)

Unfortunately, for most departments, very limited data are available. Collection of unit-specific HAI data was seen as the organisation's, not individual unit's, responsibility. While participants noted that monthly hand hygiene audit data were posted on ward notice boards, they believed that medical teams rarely reviewed them or, if they did, were skeptical about their accuracy and unaware of how they compared with those of other wards. One medical director (MD8) acknowledged that ward compliance data showed large discrepancies between wards and the lowest compliance rates amongst doctors, which were masked by the hospitals' satisfactory results, overall. Another director (MD5) suggested that audit results overestimate actual compliance because auditors were not strict enough, but he rationalised doctors' relatively low rates as being due to the fact that the auditors were nurses.

In answer to an open question about general issues of concern, all medical divisional directors mentioned their frustration at some senior consultants' apparent lack of commitment to their public hospital responsibilities, because of the demands or attractions of private practice.

[They] ... come in, do an operation, bugger off. They probably won't ever see that [public] patient again; they don't know what the outcome is. They don't have to front these patients in their office. [MD2] Participants attributed this to better remuneration, working conditions, infrastructure and capital equipment in the private sector. While noting that VMOs value the prestige and challenging case-mix of a public hospital appointment, one director (MD2) pointed out that their contracts do not stipulate specific obligations (that many would take for granted), such as teaching and supervision of junior staff or accountability for patient outcomes. He suggested that, rather than relying on VMOs' ""altruism"", the public system should provide more attractive conditions. If you want the talent you've got pay for it -an adequate salary, medical indemnity, secretary, reasonable office, parking space. It's a very big package, but that's what you need to do. If you offered them that they would be prepared to take a 30 or 40 per cent cut in income to concentrate their activities in one place and give up all the angst of being an employer. (MD2) While this solution seemed unlikely in the current public health system, a senior manager mentioned the hospital executive's plan to revise VMO contracts to define the ""rules of engagement"", to which applicants must agree, including regular attendance at ward rounds and teaching sessions, trainee supervision and formal delegation of decision-making at weekends.

In common with many Australian public hospitals, the case hospital's recent devolution of accountability for key performance indicators (KPIs), to divisional directors, had made them more aware and less tolerant of consultants, whom they perceived to be failing their implicit obligations, with impunity. In the context of this study, they linked this behaviour to ignorance of IPC policies and poor practice. However, they all agreed that instigating disciplinary action against senior doctors, in these circumstances, would be professionally and legally difficult, divisive and bitterly opposed, on principle, by medical organisations and most doctors, including those whose own behavior was above reproach. None of the divisional directors could offer solutions, other than more explicit employment contracts and/or more pay, but they conceded that it would still be difficult to monitor or enforce compliance. Despite their frustration, some directors described recent success, in delegating responsibility for clinical and administrative improvements, including in IPC, to unit directors, and assimilation of autonomous senior consultants into unit teams.

While doctors' relatively poor IPC practices, overall, have been well-documented, this qualitative study is one of few which have deeply interrogated why this is so. Participants regarded senior doctors' perceived entitlement to professional independence as a major contributor to how they choose to practice IPC and just one expression of how they fulfil implicit obligations to provide evidence-based patient care and clinical leadership. There was consensus that, although doctors are aware of the importance of IPC, for many it is not their highest priority. Nevertheless, most observe IPC policiessometimes with modification -and/or do not object to being reminded. Uncertainty about the efficacy of some IPC measures and a lack of data about HAIs are barriers to doctors' becoming more involved in IPC policy development and implementation. However, for most participants, the greatest concern was some senior consultants' hostile disregard for IPC policies and its adverse effects on patients and other staff and their apparent immunity from censure.

Participants regarded doctors as generally resistant to external rules, which they see as a challenge to their clinical autonomy and self-perception as independent thinkers [36] . In relation to IPC they may exercise autonomy, either by taking it very seriously (exemplary practice) or by choosing to remain ignorant or dismissive of basic IPC precautions, which participants interpreted as evidence of a perceived entitlement to decide, for themselves, what is important. It has been shown, previously, that compliance with hand hygiene is inversely related to educational level and seniority [37] . In making sense of this observation, we noted that many senior consultants completed their training and developed habituated behaviours at a time there was little focus on IPC, because of a prevalent belief that infectious diseases had largely disappeared [38] . While this belief is now known to have been misguided, the fact that it persists could be interpreted as a failure of continuing professional education (CPE).

Although CPE is a condition of annual medical registration, in Australia, it is largely confined to specialty topics. Specialist colleges endorse, and expect members to comply with, IPC guidelines and online IPC training is mandatory for all hospital staff, but many senior doctors choose to ignore both, with impunity. College expectations and hospital requirements are futile if professional autonomy is interpreted as meaning that compliance is discretionary [39] . Previous studies have also suggested that doctors' poor compliance with guidelines, in general, reflects ignorance or skepticism about their effectiveness and/or an exaggerated confidence in their own judgment [40, 41] . As Charani et al suggest: Senior doctors consider themselves exempt from following policy and practice, within a culture of perceived autonomous decision-making that relies more on personal knowledge and experience than formal policy [42] .

Senior consultants for whom IPC is a high priority may, nevertheless, seek to selectively 'modify' hospital IPC policies. This observation is supported by a recent study [43] that found that violations of transmission-based precautions were often not due to ignorance, but a clinicians' judgment that the risks did not justify the extra staff time and cost or adverse effects on patients [44] . Participants gave examples of such modifications, which they regarded as sometimes appropriate. However, they are likely to be interpreted as arbitrary and a source of confusion and conflict; they might be avoided if doctors were more willing to be involved in the development and local implementation of IPC policies, as leaders or champions [45, 46] .

Doctors' apparent independence may be partly illusionary, if their clinical practice is guided by habituated behaviours, learnt during their early postgraduate training, by emulating teachers and supervisors, whom they admire or fear [47] . Participants identified leadership, as others have done [46] , as an important determinant of (good or bad) IPC practice. Within a hierarchical hospital system, leadership is usually based on seniority, status and power [48] . Most senior consultants exercise their leadership roles appropriately and model acceptable or exemplary IPC practices but the attitudes of the minority, who repeatedly ignore or dispute basic IPC precautions, will also be transferred to junior doctors. Medical students are now taught about the importance of IPC and the risks of HAI and AMR but, as postgraduate trainees, they absorb the hidden curricula [47] of the specialties and units in which they train, which may be at odds with what they have been taught. Once entrenched, senior doctors' habituated behaviours are difficult to change, since even their peers are deterred, by professional etiquette and their own uncertainties, from challenging colleagues' unsafe practices [49] .

Even doctors who are knowledgeable about and aware of the importance of IPC may struggle to understand how HAIs occur, because the effects of practice breaches are delayed, hidden and uncertain. Some regard HAIs as unavoidable or someone else's fault -""the problem of many hands"" [50] -and many have little concept of patients' fears or the significant personal cost of even minor HAIs [51] . These problems are compounded by lack of data. Results of mandatory reporting to health authorities or internal incident reports of serious, but rare HAI-related events, such as bloodstream infections or unplanned readmissions, have little resonance and there are virtually no data about less serious HAIs. So it is impossible to monitor trends or reflect on individual consultant's or unit's performances vis-à-vis their peers, despite evidence that surveillance and feedback of results can motivate IPC improvement and reduce HAI rates [7, 52] . The lack of consistent national HAI surveillance, in Australia, is a recognised barrier to sustained IPC behavior change, particularly among doctors, and State-or hospitalbased surveillance is highly variable [53] .

The perceived failure of a small proportion of consultants to meet their obligations to the public hospital system was the issue that our participants spoke about most vehemently. Our participants felt strongly that senior doctors' infrequent presence in the hospital and poor trainee supervision, (public) patient follow-up and IPC practices were not valid expressions of professional autonomy and agency, but manifestations of disrespect both for patients, who are exposed to unnecessary risk and colleagues who conform with, or are responsible for maintaining, IPC standards. Moreover, the hostile reactions of some doctors, to being reminded about basic IPC precautions, were interpreted as a manifestation of the bullying, which is endemic in healthcare settings in many countries, including Australia [54, 55] , and as 'yet another' failure of professional self-regulation [56] . In this regard, recent media scrutiny of withdrawal of postgraduate training accreditation from two major Sydney public hospitals, largely as a consequence of bullying and harassment by senior medical staff [57, 58] , raises the question of whether hospital administrators and specialist colleges will act to address cultural problems in medicine, including bullying, more effectively.

Where to from here?

The Vanderbilt University Medical Centre's system of co-worker observation and reporting is one promising approach to doctors' (and others') unprofessional behaviours. It involves, as a first step, a suitably trained colleague initiating an informal, respectful conversation with a doctor whose behaviour has been the subject of complaint from a patient or co-worker. In most cases this is apparently sufficient but, if a pattern of behaviour emerges, it is followed by staged escalation [59] . It has proven to be feasible and effective in reducing bullying [60] , patient complaints [61] and poor IPC practices [62] and limits the need for more direct disciplinary action. It has been introduced or considered by several Australian hospitals [63] and the Royal Australasian College of Surgeons [64] . Such an holistic approach to organisationwide culture change, would complement better surveillance and feed-back of HAI-related data and innovative strategies, such as the use of video-reflexive methods that have been used successfully to raise clinician awareness and improve IPC practices [65] .

A major strength of this study was the seniority, varied clinical and management experience and broad vision of our participants, who were among the hospital's most senior clinicians and clinician-managers/directors. Many of them were responsible for service quality and efficiency across multiple departments and acutely aware of the issues discussed. In addition, we believe that, because the interviewer was an ""insider"", with comparable seniority and professional background, participants shared their insights and frustrations more candidly than they may have done with an external researcher. As researchers, we were inevitably influenced by our own perspectives and biases, which we sought to mitigate by discussion and self-reflection and by consulting as broad as possible a range of participants. As typical of qualitative research, they were but a small sample of the larger cohort of senior hospital clinicians, but represented a wide range of specialties, seniority, management responsibilities and attitudes to IPC.

The fact that participants and researchers were staff of a single hospital is appropriate for a case study but could also be seen as a limitation. However, our observations, experience and published literature suggest that the issues identified are common to most large, tertiary hospitals in Australia and countries with similar mixed public/private health systems. Moreover, limiting the study to a single site meant that all participants were familiar with the organisation's idiosyncrasies and illustrative examples of doctors' attitudes or practices were corroborated, and given added cogency, by multiple participants.

While participants expressed their opinions, frankly, about the attitudes and behaviours of colleagues, they generally did not identify them except by specialty. We did not seek to corroborate opinions about IPC practices with objective evidence of compliance, which was not the focus of this study, and none of the few units mentioned by participants, as having poor IPC practices, was represented amongst participants. This was unintended but may be seen as a limitation.

Clearly many factors contribute to doctors' IPC practices, other than (and sometimes contrary to) the norms, values and precepts of the medical profession. One of the most salient is how they interpret professional autonomy, which is a strongly defended principle of medical professionalism, but surely not intended to imply that doctors are entitled to ignore the policies of their employer organisations. Although participants sometimes defended doctors' objections to, or ignorance of IPC ""rules"", they clearly regarded doctors who reacted to reminders or requests to comply aggressively or unprofessionally, as an ""out-group"".

In common with other preventive programs, IPC is sometimes a victim of its own (partial) success; there is a widespread but unsubstantiated impression that IPC practices are ""good enough"" and further improvements not cost-effective. However, the continuing prevalence of preventable HAIs and nosocomial transmission of MDROs and the threat of emerging infections mean that sustained improvement is needed. We argue that this will not be achieved without the full support and participation of all healthcare professions, includingperhaps especiallydoctors. However, our findings suggest that improving doctors' IPC practices will require greater commitment from professional organisations and healthcare administrators to a) more appropriately measure, and inform clinicians about, the adverse effects for patients of non-adherence and b) effectively enforce appropriate policies and practices that prevent these harms. The poor IPC practices of some doctors are just one aspect of the broader issue of unprofessional behaviour and immunity from criticism that must be addressed, if the medical profession, in general, is to be seen to conform with its espoused professional values and those of the community that supports it.

Improving health services for African migrants in China: A health diplomacy perspective NIH Public Access,"Global health has been an increasingly prominent component of foreign policy in the last decade. The term health diplomacy has been used to describe this growing interface between foreign policy and global health, and it encompasses both the concept of using health to further foreign policy objectives, as well as the idea that diplomatic tools can be helpful for attaining public health goals. The Chinese presence in Africa has grown in the last 15 years, generating increased interest in Sino-African relations. While much has been written in recent years about the Chinese presence in Africa, the growing numbers of Africans in China have attracted considerably less attention. Many are small-scale traders and might be expected to face many of the health challenges common among foreign migrants, but their health needs have been largely unrecognised. In this paper, we consider how a health diplomacy approach could be applied to African migrants in China, and the potential advantages and limitations of this strategy. We identify areas of overlap between public health, trade, and foreign policy goals that can be emphasised to generate support for improved services for African migrants in China and to engage partners from a diversity of sectors.","Global health is increasingly a prominent component of foreign policy. Countries recognise that health programmes can achieve strategic foreign policy goals, such as improving security, promoting economic stability, and strengthening alliances (Feldbaum & Michaud, 2010) . The term health diplomacy, described by Adams et al. in 2008 , is a growing perspective that represents the exchange between foreign policy and global health (Adams, Novotny, & Leslie, 2008; Feldbaum & Michaud, 2010) . We adopt Lee and Smith's definition of health diplomacy, which encompasses both the concept of using health to further foreign policy objectives, as well as the idea that diplomatic tools can be helpful for attaining public health goals: ""policy-shaping processes through which state, non-state and other institutional actors negotiate responses to health challenges, or utilise health concepts or mechanisms in policy-shaping and negotiation strategies to achieve other political, economic or social objectives"" (Lee & Smith, 2011) . China's expanding foreign influence, including health-focused programmes abroad, provides a useful context to apply a health diplomacy framework. In 2007, China launched a multi-country malaria control initiative in sub-Saharan Africa (Freeman & Boynton, 2011) . China's recent pledge to increase health personnel training programmes in Africa (China Daily, 2011) , alongside other commitments, presents an opportunity to apply a health diplomacy approach to advance global health.

Health diplomacy may be particularly useful to investigate international migrant health. International migrants face a variety of unique health challenges (Zimmerman, Kiss, & Hossain, 2011) , and their transnational movement is relevant to both diplomats and health care professionals. In 2010, international migrants exceeded 213 million individuals, and South-South migration accounted for more than one-third of transnational migration (United Nations, 2012) . One of the newly emerging patterns of South-South migration is the bidirectional movement between China and countries in Africa. While much has been written in recent years about the emerging Chinese presence in Africa, the growing numbers of Africans 1 in China have attracted considerably less attention. Many are engaged in trade involving small amounts of capital (Mathews & Yang, 2012) and might be expected to face many of the health challenges common among foreign migrants, but their health needs have been largely unrecognised. In this paper, we consider how a health diplomacy approach could be applied to African migrants in China, and the potential advantages and limitations of this strategy.

The Chinese presence in Africa has grown in the last 15 years, generating increased research on Chinese aid to Africa and the experience of Chinese migrants living in African countries (Lee, 2009; Strauss & Saavedra, 2009 ). At the same time, the number of individuals from across Africa migrating to China for trade and study has increased substantially, but this aspect of growing Sino-African ties has not received the same degree of attention. Although the experience and conditions of Chinese workers in Africa has important implications for Sino-African diplomacy, this paper will focus on African migrants in China. The number of Africans living in China is not known, but the size of the population has grown since the 1997 Asian financial crisis led many African traders to leave Indonesia, Thailand, and other nations for China (Li, Lyons, & Brown, 2012) . Over 100,000 Africans are estimated to reside in China's third largest city, Guangzhou, where African traders have historically concentrated (Li et al., 2012) . The socioeconomic backgrounds of African migrants span a wide range, but many are traders with limited income and resources who engage in smallscale, informal trade activities (Mathews & Yang, 2012) . The health needs of this population are not well researched, and foreign migrants are not included in population-representative health surveys in China. However, there are a number of challenges Africans in China face (Lin, 2012) , some of which are common among foreign migrant populations and others unique to this group.

From the perspective of Chinese clinicians, managing care for African patients is complicated by the higher burden of certain diseases in Africa compared to China. Many countries in west Africa-where a large number of African traders originate-have generalised human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) epidemics with prevalence rates between 1 and 4%, up to 40 times the prevalence in China (UNAIDS, 2012) . Traders also migrate from countries in southern Africa, such as Mozambique, Zambia, and Zimbabwe, where HIV prevalence exceeds 11% (UNAIDS, 2012). Moreover, migrants who are immunodeficient are at higher risk for tuberculosis and multidrug-resistant tuberculosis, a prevalent and growing problem in China (Chaisson & Nuermberger, 2012) . Additionally, more than 80% of the world's malaria cases occur in Africa (World Health Organization, 2011). In contrast, less than 1% of China's population lives in high malaria transmission areas (World Health Organization, 2011) . A number of other parasitic and tropical diseases rarely seen in China are more common in African countries, including schistosomiasis (World Health Organization, 2013b) and buruli ulcer (World Health Organization, 2013a). Finally, mental health services remain underdeveloped in China , and research has demonstrated that foreign migrants are at greater risk for mental health issues (Cantor-Graae & Selten, 2005) . Many African traders arrive in China on one-month travel visas or three-month business visas, and some stay past the expiration date in order to finish their business (Mathews & Yang, 2012) . The constant threat of police arrest and deportation may cause stress and anxiety among Africans without documentation (Potochnick & Perreira, 2010) . Moreover, African migrants living in China have historically experienced racial discrimination (Cheng, 2011) , which in turn is associated with poor mental and physical health in minority communities (Pascoe & Smart Richman, 2009 ), including depression and increased alcohol use.

In addition to migrating from countries with a different burden of disease, Africans living in China face a variety of barriers to accessing existing health care services in Chinese health facilities. Interpersonal discrimination, different expectations for medical care, tenuous legal status, and communication problems with Chinese health care professionals who do not speak foreign languages act as barriers to Africans' utilization of health care services in China (Lin, 2012) . The absence of formal interpreter services in Chinese health facilities creates further challenges for providing high-quality care to Africans in China (Lin, 2012) .

The coverage of social insurance programmes for foreigners in China is incomplete. Health insurance schemes offering coverage for foreigners have been piloted in Beijing, but have not yet been widely implemented (Dezan Shira and Associates, 2012) . Medical services organised by embassies or consulates in cooperation with local facilities are insufficient because they only provide care to diplomats and their families (Guangdong General Hospital, 2012) . And with the exception of select groups from neighbouring countries living in Yunnan province, foreigners living with HIV are generally not eligible to participate in China's National Free Antiretroviral Treatment Programme (Bulterys, Vermund, Chen, & Ou, 2009; Shan, 2012; Zhang et al., 2009) .

Chinese cities with large numbers of Africans-Guangzhou, Beijing, Shanghai, and Yiwu, a city near the central eastern coast of China-already have existing medical infrastructure in place for delivering care. However, improvements and supplemental services are needed, particularly in districts and neighbourhoods with high concentrations of Africans. Potential improvements might include formal interpreters (trained in English, French, Igbo, Hausa, Swahili, and other languages spoken in Africa), cultural competency and international health training for physicians, affordable health insurance options for foreigners, and efforts to provide screening and basic health care services at community locations such as trading markets. Additionally, further research is needed in order to characterise and quantify the major health needs of Africans in China and to better understand the impact of migration from Africa on local infectious disease dynamics in China. Implementation research on the delivery of improved services is also needed to ensure these services are responsive to community needs. Although Africans living in China might be at risk for poor health and inadequate access to health care, their health needs have received little attention.

Framing African migrant health needs in terms of Sino-African health diplomacy might be a potentially effective approach to generate increased attention to this neglected issue. Areas of overlap between public health, trade, and foreign policy goals can be emphasised to generate support for improved services for African migrants in China and to engage partners from a diversity of sectors ( Figure 1 ).

Given the increasing importance of Sino-African trade relations, an emphasis on the intersection between health and trade concerns can be used to make the case for improving the quality of health services for African migrants. China surpassed the U.S. and Europe as Africa's largest trade partner (Wonacott, 2011) , and annual trade between China and Africa reached $166 billion in 2011 (King, 2012) . Many African migrants in China play a role in expanding trade between China and African countries, helping to bring Chinese-made textiles, electronics, and other exports to markets in Africa (Mathews & Yang, 2012) . Improving health services for African traders may help safeguard growing trade ties. A growing body of evidence shows that healthy workers are more productive (Bloom & Canning, 2008; Burton, Conti, Chen, Schultz, & Edington, 1999; Loeppke et al., 2008) .

Moreover, just as China has invested in health initiatives in Africa as part of a comprehensive strategy to pursue partnerships and economic interests on the continent, investing in health services for African migrants living in China is another strategy the Chinese government can use to build goodwill and potentially open up opportunities for expanding Sino-African trade.

Beyond expanding trade and business ties, the trajectory of Sino-African relations is multidimensional, encompassing strengthening diplomatic ties and increasing foreign aid. China has a long history of providing health aid in Africa, beginning in 1963 when the first Chinese medical team was deployed to Algeria (Li, 2011) . The number of Chinese medical teams in Africa grew during the 1960s and 1970s-a period when China was seeking to expand its influence in the developing world and providing support to countries that had recently gained independence from colonial powers (Huang, 2009; Li, 2011; Xu, Liu, & Guo, 2011) . China's diplomatic efforts were rewarded when in 1971, with support from many developing countries, the United Nations (UN) General Assembly voted to recognise the People's Republic of China, rather than the Republic of China (Taiwan), as the legitimate UN representative of China (Li, 2011) . The scope of Chinese involvement in Africa and China's commitments to health in the region have grown dramatically since the first Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC) held in 2000 (Figure 2 ). In 2009, China provided an estimated US$1.4 billion in development assistance to 48 African countries, accounting for nearly half of Chinese foreign aid disbursed (Freeman & Boynton, 2011) . Compared to China's investments in infrastructure and economic development, health aid represents only a small fraction of this development assistance, but it has been employed as a tool for promotion of Sino-African relations . Although the extent of China's health aid to Africa has not been officially reported, annual health aid to Africa is estimated to exceed US$80 million, based on pledges China made at the FOCAC summit in 2006 (Freeman & Boynton, 2011 ).

China's health diplomacy efforts in Africa have included constructing health facilities, organising training workshops for health care professionals, and providing government scholarships to African students to study medicine at Chinese universities (Freeman &Boynton, 2011) . At the 2009 FOCAC summit, China promised to help African countries train 3,000 doctors and nurses (China Daily, 2011) . China has built and equipped 54 hospitals (Freeman & Boynton, 2011) and 30 malaria prevention and treatment centres across Africa, including providing more than US$30 million worth of antimalarial medicine (China Daily, 2011) (Table 1) . Additionally, China and African partners have already convened four annual conferences of the International Roundtable on China-Africa Health Cooperation, the most recent of which was held in Botswana in May, 2013. The roundtable brings together not only ministry of health officials and academics from China and Africa, but also representatives of international organisations like the World Health Organisation, United Nations, and Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (Chen, 2013) . Existing platforms like this could be expanded to include multilateral cooperation on improving health services for African migrants in China.

China's investment in health initiatives in Africa aims to not only improve health but also strengthen diplomatic relations in the region (Chan, Chen, & Xu, 2010) . Sino-African diplomatic ties have strategic importance for China in terms of securing allies in international organisations like the United Nations and opening up trade and business opportunities. Forming political alliances with developing countries is a long-standing Chinese foreign policy strategy and has served national aims such as joining the World Trade Organisation (Huang, 2009; McGiffert, 2009 ). At a time when China has been expanding its energy and raw materials extraction in Africa-and coming under international criticism for these activities-investing in health initiatives in African countries has been part of China's strategy to build goodwill on the continent and emphasise the ""win-win"" nature of Sino-African relations (Chan et al., 2010; Freeman & Boynton, 2011) In the context of these existing health diplomacy efforts, and their acceleration in recent years, investing in improving health services for African migrants in China could form another component of China's efforts to strengthen Sino-African relations. It represents an opportunity for Chinese leaders and health care professionals to work together with African leadership in China, with the potential to deepen bilateral ties in the process. Providing culturally appropriate services for African migrants will require working in collaboration with African embassies, consulates, and community leaders, who are in the best position to understand the needs of this population and who are familiar with navigating the Chinese system.

Although China's investments in global health still lag far behind those of traditional donors like the U.S. (which allocated $8.9 billion for global health aid in 2012 (Salaam-Blyther, 2013)), China has begun to assume a more visible role in the global health arena over the past decade (Chan et al., 2010; Xu et al., 2011) . Since the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and avian influenza, China has demonstrated an increased willingness to pursue a multilateral approach to health, including leading several regional health surveillance networks (Chan et al., 2010; Huang, 2009) . As new patterns of South-South migration challenge low-and middle-income countries to provide health care for an increasingly culturally diverse population, China has the opportunity to take a leading role in responding to these challenges and build its image as a contributor to global welfare.

Approaching the health needs of African migrants in China from a health diplomacy perspective carries several benefits. First, appealing to the pragmatism inherent in a health diplomacy approach might help to increase attention to and resources for addressing migrant health. Strengthening diplomatic ties can enhance action more effectively than appeals solely to humanitarian goodwill (Valentino, 2011) . By identifying areas of overlap and potential synergy among health objectives, trade and economic interests, and foreign policy goals, health diplomacy explains why potential stakeholders should jointly invest in public health solutions.

Furthermore, a health diplomacy approach suggests new partnerships can be forged and avenues of action can be pursued. Increasingly health care and public health professionals are recognising a potential role for non-traditional stakeholders outside the health sector. For example, in 2011, President Obama issued a memorandum-reinforced during subsequent presidential visits to foreign countries-that elevated the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) persons to the level of a foreign policy priority (Obama, 2011; Tucker, von Zinkernagel, & Goosby, 2013) . In the memorandum, Obama directed foreign aid agencies to leverage foreign assistance to advance non-discrimination and to enhance engagement with governments, citizens, civil society, and private sector to support efforts to combat criminalisation of LGBT persons. Such efforts to address stigma, criminalisation, and discrimination are integral to improving access to antiretroviral therapy among HIVpositive gay men and other key populations (Beyrer et al., 2012) .

For an issue like migrant health that is linked to diplomacy and trade, effective partnerships will likely require engagement with embassy and consulate staff, trade organisations and businesses, and community groups representing African migrants. A health diplomacy approach suggests the need for a collaborative bilateral or multilateral approach-i.e., engaging African leaders and diplomats in the process of developing migrant health services in China. Surveys undertaken in Guangzhou have found that migrants from West Africa dominate, with Nigerians comprising the largest group (Bodomo, 2010; Li et al., 2012) . In cities like Guangzhou, Nigerians, Guineans, Malians, and other groups have established community organisations to encourage mutual support among migrants originating from the same country and to represent their interests in interactions with local authorities. These organisations provide an important channel through which the Chinese government and African diplomats can engage African migrants and ensure interventions are responsive to their needs.

New programmes and organisations have been established in recent years to encourage health diplomacy engagement. In 2012, the Department for International Development launched the China UK Global Health Support Programme to help strengthen the capacity of Chinese institutions to engage in bilateral and multilateral development cooperation for health (Department for International Development, 2012) . A core strategy of the U.S. government's newly established Office of Global Health Diplomacy is to support U.S. ambassadors to assume a role in the health arena and work effectively with officials in partner countries (Goosby, 2012; U.S. Department of State, 2013) . Similar partnerships between African representatives in China and Chinese leadership could help both to improve the quality of services for African migrants and to deepen Sino-African ties.

On the other hand, there are potential limitations to a health diplomacy approach. First, creating multi-sectoral collaboration focused on health diplomacy may be technically difficult, but the prominence of Sino-African ties may help catalyse this process. Second, improved access to health services might encourage increased migration from Africa to China, potentially leading the government to impose further limitations on visas for citizens of African countries. Increased services for African migrants might also reveal a substantial burden of disease and trigger more restrictive immigration policies. However, as China's investments in health and other sectors in Africa demonstrate, the Chinese government has an interest in both fostering positive relationships with African leaders and promoting goodwill among the public in African countries. Moreover, improving health care access is one of the government's strategic priorities for health reform (Yip et al., 2012) . Finally, health governance is weak in China and in many African countries (Huang, 2011; Kirigia & Barry, 2008) , perhaps limiting their ability to improve services for African migrants in China. However, the Chinese government is seeking to establish more accountability and improved health outcomes in the health system with on-going national health reform (Yip et al., 2012) .

New patterns of migration are challenging China to confront the need to provide health care for an increasingly diverse population. The Chinese government has experience managing the health implications of its massive internal rural-to-urban migration (Gong et al., 2012) . Some common themes characterise both foreign and internal migrant populations, including social exclusion, economic vulnerability, limited health insurance, and mental health stresses. The momentum of growing research and policy in the area of internal migration could be applied to improving services for African migrants. Moreover, the Chinese government recently launched the first phase of a national health care reform plan aimed at achieving comprehensive universal health coverage by 2020 (Yip et al., 2012) . One central goal of China's health reform is to promote health equity, which will require improving the quality of care for foreign migrants and other populations that have been marginalised in China's health system. Applying a health diplomacy approach to African migrants in China is a potentially effective strategy, and one that is aligned both with China's economic interests and with China's trend toward assuming a greater role as a donor country and global health leader.

ScienceDirect ScienceDirect Peer-review under responsibility of the scientific Biomedical Engineering Research in the Social Network Analysis Era: Stance Classification for Analysis of Hoax Medical News in Social Media ScienceDirect Peer-review under responsibility of the scientific Biomedical Engineering Research in the Social Network Analysis Era: Stance Classification for Analysis of Hoax Medical News in Social Media,"Biomedical engineering research trend can be healthcare models with unobtrusive smart systems for monitoring vital signs and physical activity. Detecting infant facial cry because of inability to communicate pain, recognizing facial emotion to understand dysfunction mechanisms through micro expression or transform captured human expression with motion device into three-dimensional objects are some of the applied systems. Nowadays, collaborated with biomedical research, mining and analyzing social network can improve public and private health care sectors as well such as research health news shared on social media about pharmaceutical drugs, pandemics, or viral outbreaks. Due to the vast amount of shared news, there is an urgency to select and filter information to prevent the spread of hoax or fake news. We explored in depth some steps to classify hoaxes written as news articles. This discussion also encourages on how technologies of social network analysis could be used to make new kinds improvement in health care sectors. Then close with a description of limitless future possibilities of biomedical engineering research in social media.","Biomedical engineering research is multidisciplinary works, which commonly related to medical devices used for improving the quality of life. It merges scientific and engineering fields such as nanotechnology, stem cell as regenerative medicine, biomechanics, and biomedical devices for helping diagnostics and therapeutics [1] . As an example, nanoparticles or nanomaterials can be used in diagnostic applications such as gene therapy or bioimaging in the brain. Some of the applied systems within biomedical engineering research [2] are detecting infant facial cry to help to communicate pain [3] and lip feature extracting on the frontal face for speech training of the deaf [4] . Another work is recognizing facial emotion to understand dysfunction mechanisms through micro expression or transform captured human expression with motion device into three-dimensional objects [5] . Those works use image-based data in unobtrusive smart systems for healthcare related models. A recent trend is not only about images but also about textual data in healthcare related models such as fake news or hoax spreading within the power of internet technology.

Fake news or hoax has many definitions such as recurrent issues used as a political weapon, irrelevant truths (posttruths) or intentionally spreading falsehood information (alt-facts) [6] . Alternative facts (alt-facts) are information with no basis in reality while post-truths are defined as beyond the truths or irrelevant information. This discussion has a focus on fake news or hoax in Indonesia [7] in the form of alt-facts [8] especially about medical related issues [9] . Conducted surveys in Indonesia gave perceptions about hoaxes, how they are spread, their topic classifications and their effects on the communities. The medium of communication for hoaxes is varied like image or video such that manipulating non-textual content becomes another problem. Meanwhile, text-based hoaxes are usually spread through social media like Twitter or Facebook and the analysis to recognize them are not limited to the hoax text itself but also on how it is presented, by who, and in what format and context [10] . Hoax text presentation means that the analysis is about linguistic-based features because microblog text like Twitter and email text have different characteristics. The sources who are spreading hoax texts tend to have verifiability issues. Thus in the case of Twitter usage as a medium of communication for hoaxes, analysis of retweeting topology network becomes necessary. Aforementioned hoax analysis can be categorized into two major approaches: linguistic and network. Here, we discuss hoax within online news text that put more weights on the linguistic aspect [11] . Linguistic approaches concern with texts as a bag of equally significant words, syntax structure like noun and verb phrases within the texts, and semantic analysis to recognize any contradictions on other texts with the similar topics of allegedly hoax texts. As network approach, some web-based tools are used to predict and track disease outbreaks through query keyword evaluation [12] .

Hoax analysis for the Indonesian language becomes interesting research as well since the government makes it as an important issue [7] [8] . Many unverified but widespread news can hinder the national policies. Hoax texts as bags of words were identified with some classifiers [13] in some conditions such as the experimented topics are general, the dataset comes from undeclared sources, and the training data needs manual label. Several selection features are implemented to filter the important words. Those limitations are understandable because of no Indonesian hoax text datasets available unlike English hoaxes or fake news datasets (http://www.fakenewschallenge.org/). However, those steps are not suitable for analyzing medically related hoax text since the article has convincing content but fabricated facts unless there is a refutation article to verify the false claim ( Fig. 1 , overall hoax content is showed in the left figure while the disagree texts are in the right figure) . Those articles give stance position whether supporting the claims or refuting the hoaxes to evaluate the attitude expressed in the texts. For that reason, in a medical hoax classification problem, stance articles turn out to be essential.

Fake News Challenge (FNC) use stance classification approaches for classifying fake news [14] [15] , and their topics are not medically related hoaxes. FNC classify news texts based on headlines concerning their stances of agrees, disagrees, discusses and unrelated. Fig.2 shows article samples with stances of unrelated (top), agree (middle) and discuss (bottom) concerning issues of Christian Bale passes on a Steve Job role. Stance labels need careful evaluation because headline text and body text can result in different attitudes.

Next section describes some compared methods and experiments as an analysis implementation of medically related hoaxes with stance classification approach using our primary collected small dataset. 30-year-old Moscow resident was hospitalized with wounds very intimate nature. As it became known LifeNews, in the hands of doctors, the man complained that his casual acquaintance opoila in the sauna, and then gently held his castration operation. And actions criminals were executed with surgical precision. … … … (top, stance: unrelated)

""Christian Bale will not be starring as Steve Jobs in Aaron Sorkin's upcoming Steve Jobs biopic, according to The Hollywood Reporter. The actor has reportedly decided that he was """"not right for the part,"""" deciding to withdraw from the film. Bale was announced as the star of the film just last week, with Sorkin saying that Christian Bale was """"the best actor in a certain age range"""" to play Jobs, and that he had agreed to the part without an audition.… … … (middle, stance: agree)

""Actor Christian Bale is in talks to play the leading role in the upcoming Steve Jobs biopic being produced by Sony, reports Variety. Leonardo DiCaprio was originally in talks to play Jobs, but withdrew from negotiations earlier this month. Penned by Aaron Sorkin, the Steve Jobs biopic was originally set to be directed by """"The Social Network"""" director David Fincher, who was said to be in talks with Sony earlier this year, but the director title went to Danny Boyle instead, who also directed the hit movie """"Slumdog Millionaire."""" When David Fincher was still attached to the project, he reportedly was hoping to cast Christian Bale in the lead role due to his undeniable resemblance to the former CEO. Christian Bale is also known for his ability to adapt to roles, shedding and gaining weight as necessary to accurately portray characters. … … … (bottom, stance: discuss) 

Some methods are compared for identifying hoaxes with different kind of texts (Table 1 ) such as Facebook, Twitter, Wikipedia, and article news. Recent researches give more attentions to word-embedding techniques, which need no knowledge about the language of hoax texts [14] [15] . The weight value of term vector is no longer occurrences based but also considering positions of phrase texts like word embedding. However, the text source influences methods of feature selection and classifier. For example, in Wikipedia articles [16] there are appearance features like word counting, content ratio of texts & non-texts, and links within articles. Another kind of feature for Wikipedia articles is network-based coefficients like clustering coefficient to differentiate legitimate and hoax articles. Unique characteristic of Facebook posts create user categories [17] , which are user who like hoaxes, user who like non-hoaxes, and user who like both posts. Those categories have an influence in preparing data collection. For Twitter allegedly hoaxes [18] , retweeting topology network can be a network feature for hoax analysis to verify the credibility of text source.

This paper showed experiments with steps are directly taken from the approaches of stance classification [19] (Fig.  3) . The purpose of our experiments is to show how stance classification implemented in hoax analysis especially with medial contents. The first step of our experiments is collecting data come from medical archives of snopes.com (http://www.snopes.com/category/facts/medical/). The articles are categorized as true, false, and unverified facts. For our Snopes small dataset, we have articles of 19 true claims, 42 false claims, and 17 unverified texts. Then we find 400 related headlines of news texts as stance articles from the search results which have states of for when the claim is true, against when the claim is false, and observing when it merely repeats the claim but uses hedging or vague language. Because of the possibilities for hedging texts, there are two kinds of features: headlines and claim-headlines. Headlines features are common bag-of-words representation from term frequency until distance between root word and refuting word in a sentence that needs a process of analyzing grammatical structure. Whereas, claim-headline features need aligning process between words in a claim with its parallel headline, i.e. Paraphrase Database (PPDB). After aligning words and know their positions, the similarity between vectors of the claim and the headline uses wordembedding results.

We used the available implementation [19] (https://github.com/willferreira/mscproject) with certain preparation steps for medical hoax dataset. The classifier with headlines features gives varied performances in all stances (Table 2) , although claim-headlines features have consistent results in the against class (Table 3) . It confirms that aligning phrase or words using Paraphrase Database (PPDB) between the claim and the headline is necessary for vague language. Hedging or vague texts are common in the headline instances of observing class. Some misclassified data sample are presented in Table 2 . The same misclassified texts for headlines are also found in Table 3 . In the other hand, accuracy value for the instances of against class is consistent between headline feature (Table 2 ) and claim-headline feature ( Table 3 ). This happens because in the instances of against class, the article contents show similar stance with the article headlines. Table 2 shows the instances of against class have better accuracy value compare to others, while the instances of observing class have better precision value, and the instances of for class have better recall value. This happens because the headline texts are usually short. Therefore, further works on a better understanding of semantic meaning in the article is needed to obtain a better stance. This ongoing research focuses on stance classification, as a preliminary research on hoax analysis. After the stance classification is done accurately, the next step will be on hoax classification.

We have showed that biomedical engineering research are not limited to bioimaging of diagnostics applications for improving the quality of life. Filtering health information in social media such as hoaxes can be associated with biomedical research as well. Because of social media characteristic, linguistic and network features are common approaches in clarifying the truthiness of hoaxes. Understanding the contents of medical hoax or non-hoax texts often uses phrase and word positioning like word embedding. The allegedly hoax texts can be truth claims, false facts, or vague description. For that reason, hoax analysis can be solved as stance classification and data collecting process requires the hoax dataset and the stance dataset. However, text sources such as Twitter or Facebook give another perception for determining hoax analysis. For future works, researches of Indonesian hoaxes still offer many possibilities since analyzing grammatical structure become language barrier.

The social-mediated crisis communication research: Revisiting dialogue between organizations and publics in crises of China,"The rapid diffusion of social media is ushering in a new era of crisis communication. To enhance our understanding of the social-mediated dialogue between organizations and their publics in crises of China, this study conducts a content analysis of 61 relevant journal articles published in 2006-2018. Results of this research present an overview of ongoing research trends such as theoretical frameworks and methodological preferences. This research also explores how the unique Chinese social media characteristics affect the dialogue between types of organizations and their publics. Contextual factors such as face and favor, relationship (Guanxi) and sentiment (Renqing), and the centralized political system that may facilitate/inhibit dialogue in crises of China are identified as well. Finally, this study suggests promising new directions such as a scholarly assessment tool for the social-mediated crisis communication research in China.","during their 2012 crises in China and found crisis response strategies should be contextualized and based on specific cultural variations. Mou (2014) conducted a content analysis of 6,186 microblog posts on 12 food safety incidents in China and results illustrated how different types of micro-blogs gratify diversified needs of online publics.

Considering a large amount of relevant literature focusing on the social-mediated crisis communication/dialogue in public relations or in the field of communication, the purpose of this paper is to provide a synthesized review of how global scholarship examines the realm of SMCC in China and offer insights for future research agendas. Through content analysis of 61 articles in 27 journals indexed in Web of Science core collection from 2006 to 2018, this paper gives an overview of current research trends such as theoretical frameworks and methodological preferences. Meanwhile, this study explores how social media has been changing dialogue between different types of organizations and their publics and the impact of unique contextual factors (e.g., cultural elements and political regimes) on the social-mediated dialogue. Aims of this study include three main dimensions: a) to enrich the global public relations literature by reviewing the SMCC research in a Chinese context. Not only a review is provided, but also a greater picture on theory building and practical implications of SMCC in China are addressed; b) to extend the dialogue research in China by exploring online dialogue between three types of organizations and their publics in crises; c) to illustrate how sophisticated cultural and political factors affect the SMCC practice in China.

Social media, as a ""double-edged sword"" has brought both opportunities and challenges for crisis communication (Cheng, 2016a) . On the one hand, scholars found that social media could facilitate organizations to monitor crisis issues, open up-to-date conversations with publics, cultivate critical relationships, and create transparency of organizational actions (Jin & Liu, 2010; Macias, Hilyard, & Freimuth, 2009 ). On the other hand, misinformation, rumors, negative opinions, and emotions were amplified on social media and crisis managers might lose control of official messages when user-generated contents emerged or even dominated the public opinion (Liu, Jin, Austin, & Janoske, 2012; Wigley & Fontenot, 2010) .

To address the impact of social media on crisis communication, Liu et al. (2012) created a social-mediated crisis communication model, serving as the first theoretical framework to describe relationships between organizations, online and offline publics, social media, traditional media, and word-of-mouth communication before, during and after crises (Austin, Fraustino, Jin, & Liu, 2017) . This model has been widely tested using different methods such as experiments or interviews in the context of the United States. Scholars mainly discussed 1) how crisis information form, sources, crisis type and history might influence publics' (e.g., influential social media content creators, followers, and inactives) crisis responses; 2) how types of organizations (i.e., corporates, NPOs, and governments) may respond to publics effectively by adopting different crisis communication strategies (Liu, Jin, & Austin, 2013; Liu, Fraustino, & Jin, 2015) . Besides this SMCC model, scholars also applied four main blocks of theories to study the interplay between social media and crisis communication (Austin et al., 2017) . These theories included audience and stakeholder theories (e.g., uses and gratifications theory, media dependency theory, and spiral of silence theory), form or medium influence-based theories (e.g., media richness theory), source influence-based theories (e.g., dialogic public relations theory), and content influence-based theories (e.g., framing theory, image repair theory, and situational crisis communication theory). For instance, Lev-On (2012) adopted uses and gratifications (U & G) theory to examine publics' motivations of using social media in a natural disaster context. continued to use the U & G approach and examined publics' gratifications-sought on social media of mobile devices during an earthquake in mainland China. Taylor and Perry (2005) 's multi-case study provided recommendations for organizational crisis responses based on dialogic public relations theory.

In sum, scholars in the past years have increasingly paid attention to the SMCC research in contexts (Cheng, 2016a; Liu et al., 2015; Tai & Sun, 2007; Taylor & Perry, 2005; Zhu et al., 2017) . This field also attracted updated reviews from several scholars such as Cheng (2016a) , Eriksson (2018) , and Rasmussen and Ihlen (2017) . However, none of these studies fully examined the SMCC research in a non-Western context such as contemporary China and a review of the trends and research domains on SMCC in China is lacking. To explore this emerging field, the first research question was raised. RQ1: What was the general trend of SMCC research in China (e.g., numbers of articles in each journal, theoretical frameworks, and methodological preferences)?

In the past decades, the concept of dialogue has emerged as an important research and professional issue in the field of public relations (Kent & Taylor, 2002; McAllister-Spooner & Taylor, 2007; Pang, Shin, Lew, & Walther, 2018; Taylor & Kent, 2014; Taylor & Perry, 2005) . Pearson (1989) first considered ""dialogue"" as a public relations theory and he suggested that the ethical public relations practice was to have a dialogic system with publics. To outline a dialogic public relations theory, Kent and Taylor (2002) traced the roots of dialogue from interdisciplinary areas and defined dialogue as ""an orientation that valued sharing and mutual understanding"" (Taylor & Kent, 2014, p. 388) . They defined dialogic communication as ""any negotiated exchange of ideas and opinions"" (Kent & Taylor, 1998, p. 325) . To extend the conceptualization of dialogue in crisis communication, Romenti et al. (2014) reviewed organizational development and management literature (Innes, 2004; Shotter, 2008) and they found that dialogue might not require mutuality or openness as public relations literature assumed. Instead, dialogue served strategic communication purposes, and organizations and their publics could adopt a dialogic approach for any single or two-way communicative interactions in crises (Romenti et al., 2014) .

Studies also found that social-mediated dialogue might play a critical role in building and maintaining organization-public relationships (Pang et al., 2018; Yang, 2018) and social media contained different functions in crisis communication. For instance, Liu and Kim (2011) found that social media could provide emotional support during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic. Muralidharan, Dillistone, and Shin (2011) demonstrated the use of social media interacting with publics and disseminating organizational information in the Haiti earthquake. Cheng, Jin, Hung-Baesecke, and Chen (2018) also supported the important role of social media tools in corporate social responsibility engagement in a natural disaster. This review study focuses on social-mediated dialogue in crises and specifically any exchange of ideas or opinions between organizations and their online publics in China.

According to Cheng and Cameron (2017) , social media as one of the fast-growing areas has significantly influenced crisis communication research in the U.S. In the mainland Chinese society, Huang, Wu, and Cheng's (2016) study supported the impact of digital transformation in crises. Contrasting with the social media system in Western countries such as the United States, the Chinese new media landscape contained a large number of highly engaged users. For instance, one of China's most popular social network, Sina Weibo has over 411 million monthly active users in the first quarter of 2018 (China Internet Watch, 2018), while Twitter only has 336 million users globally (Statista, 2018) . Experimental research also disclosed that this large crowd of social media users in China could generate more online negative crisis-reaction intentions such as boycotting companies and writing negative comments than those in the U.S. (Chen & Bryan, 2017) .

According to Tong and Lei (2013) , Chinese social media also functions more dialogically than those tools in the rest of the world. WeChat in China, for example, integrates features from Twitter, Facebook, and WhatsApp, targeting 1.5 billion Chinese users who averagely spend 3 h a day on their smartphones (People's Daily, 2017). WeChat not only performs as a tool for personal and social communication, but also functions in crisis communication by offering updated news and geo-localized services, collecting donations, and facilitating direct money transfers. On Weibo, a post with 140 characters in Chinese can express more meanings than a tweet in English. Compared to Twitter, Weibo contains several unique features such as threaded comments, verified accounts, trends categorization and Weibo events, and the medal reward system and hall of celebrity (Chen & Bryan, 2017) .

Furthermore, research shows the live broadcasting function of social media in China has dramatized crises in China. Domestic social media features such as rich media and virtual red envelopes have motivated a huge online crowd to watch, cyber-manhunt, comment, and edit media content (Goode, 2009) . In crises, Luo and Jiang (2012) found that Chinese online users were driven by rumors online and had a tendency to follow the crowd. This study thus posited the second research question to explore the types of social media commonly discussed in current SMCC research. Most importantly, RQ2 intended to explore how social media was changing the dialogue in crises of China.

RQ2: What were the types of social media discussed in current SMCC research and how did these tools influence dialogue between types of organizations and their publics?

Different from Western contexts, which value low-power distance, the need for equality, and democracy, Chinese cultures emphasize high-power distance, group harmony, and authoritarianism (Hofstede, 2001; Wong, Wei, Wang, & Tjosvold, 2017) . Power distance, as an important contextual factor measures inequality across culture and affects the relational dialogue between organizations and their publics in crises (Mathew & Taylor, 2018; Sriramesh & Vercic, 2011; Taylor, 2000) . For instance, practitioners' selection of communication models were different depending on levels of power distance in a society (Sriramesh & Vercic, 2011) . In a low-power distance culture, which ""better supports the multilevel distribution of data, information, and certain types of knowledge"" (Leonard, Van Scotter, & Pakdil, 2009, p. 855) , organizations preferred to apply a dialogic communication process with their publics in crises. In contrast, the high-power distance existed in Chinese societies and effectively influenced the crisis communication strategies and public responses in crises (Huang et al., 2016; Hwang, 1987) . Organizations such as governments in a high-power distance nation were perceived to be very powerful and they avoided using extreme strategies and preferred passive crisis communicative strategies (Huang et al., 2016) . Powerless individuals expecting an equal distribution of power might distrust organizations and reacted more strongly in crises than those in low-power distance nations. (Taylor, 2000) .

Meanwhile, several other contextual factors such as face-saving/giving, favor-seeking/giving, relationship (Guanxi) and sentiment (Renqing), and the centralized political system may also challenge the Western-dominated crisis communication practice and characterize a distinctive dialogue between organizations and publics on social media in crises Jiang, 2014) . Rooted in Confucianism, the Chinese culture emphasized face (Mienzi), favor (enhui), relationship (Guanxi), and sentiment (Renqing). In crisis communication, Chinese organizations frequently adopted face-saving strategies since losing face means losing prestige, reputation or honor (Huang et al., 2016) . Meanwhile, organizations and publics in China exchanged face and favor in the processes of social exchanges and resource distributions (Hwang, 1987) . Giving face and favor to others could help establish and reinforce relationships between each other (Ting-Toomey, 2005) . To build an effective dialogue, relationship and sentiment also served as key cultural factors. In China, creating a long-term and strong relationship is the precondition of opening conversations, developing cooperative goals, and reaching commited relationships (Wong et al., 2017) . Defined as ""the emotional responses of an individual confronting the various situations of daily life"" (Hwang, 1987 , p. 953), public sentiment, rather than regulations and rules, may become the top priority that organizations should take care of in crises of China.

Besides the above-mentioned cultural elements, the political regime in mainland China is also significantly different from those in Western countries such as the U.S. (Chou, 2009 ). The dominance of political power over social power is manifest very well when the central government strictly controls information dissemination in any types of social-mediated crises in China . Scholars found that the ubiquitous control of the central government and strict media censorship have significantly influenced the communication pattern and dialogue building between organizations and their publics (Huang et al., 2016) . Thus, this study proposed RQ3 to explore the contextual influence on the social-mediated dialogue in crises of China.

RQ3: How did contextual characteristics influence the social-mediated dialogue in crises of China?

To answer the above-mentioned research questions, a keyword screening method was applied to filter related articles written in English in the Web of Science core collection, which included over 20,000 worldwide scholarly journals in over 250 science, social sciences, and humanities disciplines (Clarivate Analytics, 2018). Articles with the following keywords in the topic section were selected for review: any of ""online,"" ""Internet,"" ""social media,"" ""new media,"" ""blog,"" ""micro-blog,"" ""WeChat"", ""Weibo"", ""video,"" ""Web,"" ""social network service,"" or ""SNS,"" and any of ""crisis"" or ""crises"" or ""incident"", and any of ""China"" or Chinese"".

Meanwhile 

Previous review studies focusing on new media, crisis communication, and public relations provided a framework of analysis for this study (Huang et al., 2016; Ye & Ki, 2012) . Coding categories included four dimensions: 1) general information, including the name of the journal, publication year, names and locality of authors; 2) research focus (organization, media or publics), types of organizations (corporations, governmental institutions, and NPOs), theoretical frameworks (the spiral of silence theory, U & G theory etc.), and methodological preferences (survey, experiment etc.) 3) social media types (Weibo, blogs etc.); 4) crisis types (natural crisis, crisis of malevolence, confrontation crisis etc.) and occurred time.

To test inter-coder reliability, two well-trained coders analyzed 15 randomly selected articles, representing 25% of the 61 articles. Using Scott's pi, the inter-coder agreement was 1.0 for the general information (i.e., the name of each journal, publication year, and authorship), 1.0 for social media types, 0.93 for research focus and organizational types, 0.90 for theoretical frameworks, 0.95 for methodological preferences, and 0.95 for crisis types and occurred time. The overall inter-coder agreement was 0.96.

RQ1 investigated the trends in current SMCC research including general information of articles, theoretical frameworks, methodological preferences, and crisis types and occurred time. first-authors were from Greater China (i.e., mainland China, Taiwan, Macau, or Hong Kong), 24 from the United States, 2 from Australia, 2 from England, 2 from Singapore, 1 from Japan, and 1 from Germany.

In terms of theoretical frameworks, approximately half of the articles (30 out of 61) applied theoretical frameworks. As shown in Table 1 , scholars mostly applied content influence-based theories, including image repair theory (12%), situational crisis communication theory (8%), and framing theory (8%). Meanwhile, audience and stakeholder theories (e.g., U & G theory, media dependency theory, and spiral of silence theory) were also frequently adopted (13%), followed by the social-mediated crisis communication model (3%), and other theories (5%).

Regarding methodology, results indicated that quantitative methods included content analysis (n = 14, 23%), survey (n = 6, 10%), and experiment (n = 2, 3%). Qualitative methods included case study (n = 15, 25%), interview (n = 3, 5%), and other methods such as literature review and discourse analysis (n = 9, 14%). Overall, we found that qualitative methods (44%) were more frequently employed than quantitative methods (36%). Mixed methods were also common (n = 12, 20%).

RQ1 also examined types of crises studied in current SMCC research in China. Fifty-four articles (89%) have mentioned specific crises. The most frequently examined crises were managerial misconducts (n = 25, 41%), followed by natural disasters (n = 9, 15%), confrontation crises (n = 8, 13%), malevolence (n = 3, 5%), and technological crises (n = 1, 2%). Other eight crises (13%) RQ2 inquired into types of social media examined in current research. Data from Table 2demonstrated that the majority of articles examined Weibo (n = 20, 33%), followed by Blogs/Forum (n = 7, 11%), online news apps (n = 13, 21%), and social media in general (n = 15, 25%). Six articles (10%) examined multiple types of social media such as Tencent QQ, Taobao blog, and Tianya forum. Regarding the impact of social media on dialogue in crises of China, this paper demonstrated results from perspectives of three main organizations (i.e., governments, corporates, and NPOs) and their publics.

Serving as the principal actor in dialogue, governments become the research focus among nine articles (15%). Scholars found that the Chinese central government has absolute power to interfere with other actors in a crisis event (Cheng, 2016b; Lyu, 2012) . For instance, in the Xinjiang riot crisis, Chen (2012) found that the Chinese government maintained a highly controlled, reserved, and less direct conversation with publics. In addition, in the first 8 h of the Wenzhou train collision crisis, the Chinese government closed the dialogue by abandoning the rescue process and trying to bury the collided train under soil (Bondes & Schucher, 2014) . On social media, however, Chinese governmental institutions in recent years retained a certain level of openness by setting up an ""online supervisory system"" (Chen, Liu, & Deng, 2018) . Instead of completely ""controlling"" dialogue with publics, the Chinese government was ""guiding"" dialogue to maintain a positive public image in crises (Xie et al., 2016) . As shown in Fig. 2 , the central government first posted messages on its official website and linked to local governments' social media accounts. Then local governments applied these messages as main sources for crisis communication. Second, serving as inspectors, local opinion leaders were hired to transmit crisis information and they were authorized to scan user-generated contents as well. These online opinoin leaders reported publics' feedback following local governments' directions (Chen et al., 2018) and meanwhile responded to online publics' requests or inquiries. Scholars also found that the dialogue between local opinion leaders and their online followers was more direct and efficient than the top-down dialogue between governments and publics in crises of China (Tong & Lei, 2013) .

Studies also indicated that governments allowed social media users to post opinions directly and even shared negative comments on governments during a certain period of politically sensitive events (Cairns & Carlson, 2016; Cheng, 2016b) . Chinese governments began to open dialogue with online publics in strategic decision-making processes and thus several public emergency events were solved through online petitions (Xie et al., 2016) .

Scholars increasingly focused on corporations in previous years, publishing 13 articles in total (21%). Different from governments as leaders in dialogue with publics, Chinese private firms such as Taobao (China's version of Amazon) had to avoid any conflicts and open dialogue with governments for possible future cooperation (Na, 2017) . However, when facing publics, these firms guided dialogue through using strategies such as framing, denying, or even covering up the truth (Kim et al., 2016; Veil & Yang, 2012) in crises. Online publics correspondingly were found to dislike a denial of responsibility in dialogue and their negative sentiments easily triggered secondary crises in the dialogue with corporates (Luo & Zhai, 2017) . Meanwhile, due to Weibo's rapid circulation of information, crises evolved from the breakout to regression stage at a faster pace than through other social media channels. Liu, Yu, and Wang (2016) argued that the cycle of public talking about crisis issues would not be longer than five days if no new topics plugged in. In both Baidu and Ctrip cases in 2016, since the corporates did not respond to critics immediately, public opinion was guided under the direction defined by social media (Liu et al., 2016) .

Only three articles (Cheng, 2016b; Long, 2016) addressed NPOs' crisis communication with their publics. Within limited literature, Cheng (2016a) examined responses of the Red Cross of China in a credibility crisis. Results demonstrated that this NPO adopted an accommodative communication strategy to open dialogue with angry donors on social media during the crisis, but finally shirked responsibility and shifted the blame onto others. Although many donors lost their trust toward the Chinese charitable system and refused to donate again, the Red Cross of China insisted on conducting a closed dialogue and did not disclose any donation information to the general public.

A majority of current research (24 articles, 39%) examined publics and a significant increasing trend towards online stakeholders was found from 2006 to 2018. Scholars discussed antecedents that motivated publics to engage in dialogue on social media in crises, including a low-level of trust toward governments and traditional media, gratifications-sought from social media, and the increasedlevel of civic awareness and media literacy (Mou, 2014; Xie et al., 2016) . Results also showed that Chinese online publics are highly dependent on social media and a growing number of users have used social media to express and share opinions during public emergency events (Xie et al., 2016) . During the Sichuan earthquake, for example, grass-roots activists began to build up mutual trust, pave the way for more regular and extensive dialogue between online and offline activism (Lu, 2018) . In the ""occupy central"" social movement, large quantities of online publics also expressed their extreme voices through proactive dialogue with authorities (Luo & Zhai, 2017) . Finally yet importantly, the Chinese social-mediated dialogue consists of many nonverbal languages such as emoticons and figurative language. Scholars such as Kim et al. (2016) found that when Alibaba, China's largest e-commerce companyadopted an informal personable communication style in dialogue with their online publics in China, the communication outcomes were positive in terms of consumer sentiments.

RQ3 explored how contextual characteristics in China affected the social-mediated dialogue in crises. Results identified several major contextual factors, which included high-power distance, face-saving/giving, favor-seeking/giving, relationship (Guanxi) and sentiment (Renqing), and the centralized political system.

This cultural trait significantly influenced the government-public dialogue in crises. For instance, (Hong, 2007) found that in the SARS crisis, instead of sending updated information to the publics, local officials concealed the real number of infectors until receiving upper-level orders from the central government. The high-power distance prevented the occurrence of true dialogue and could easily trigger publics' high-level of distrust toward organizations when people felt disempowered and helpless during crises (Cheng, 2016b) .

Due to the traditions of Chinese culture, another factor that influences social-mediated dialogue in crises is face-saving/giving. Private corporations in China have developed a unique dialogic pattern with governments by giving the face to governments and saving face for themselves. For instance, Na (2017) found that the corporate blogger Taobao has never directly threatened the face of governmental officials in crisis responses. Instead, the blogger rhetorically passed the buck to a third party as the scapegoat. Veil and Yang (2012) also found that in the Sanlu milk contamination crisis, the value of ""face-saving"" led to a totally closed dialogue between the state-owned corporate and its publics. The accused firm in crises chose to cover up the truth and manipulated media coverage since ""the ugly things in the family shall not go public"" (Veil & Yang, 2012) . Thus, in the Chinese context, face-saving/giving resulted in a closed and unethical dialogue between corporations and their online publics.

In the social-mediated dialogue, both organizations and publics valued ""favor"" in their relationships. For instance, Mou and Lin (2017) found that individuals build online social networks and engage in dialogue with others since they expect resources for favorseeking/giving between each other. To engage in a relationship, Chinese social media users categorize their virtual community members and choose to open dialogue with connections following a favor-seeking or giving tradition.

Results showed that cultural traits such as relationship and sentiment have significantly influenced the social-mediated dialogue in crises. On the one hand, Chinese people heavily relied on relationships and their online dialogue with others was to enhance interpersonal relationships in a collectivist culture (Zheng, Liu, & Davison, 2018) . Relationship has become the basis for maintaining a dialogue in Chinese society (Yang & Jiang, 2015) . On the other hand, sentiment is the top priority in crisis communication of China. Yang and Jiang (2015) identified the hierarchical sequence of sentiment, reason, and law and they found that totally relying on the law was ineffective or even useless in handling a crisis in China. Instead, sentiment (Renqing) should be specially taken care of during crises. For instance, the chief executive officer (CEO) of Vanke, the largest property firm in mainland China, stated that he would donate two million RMB (around 300,000 US dollars) in the 2008 Sichuan earthquake. However, online publics attacked his blog post since this CEO ignored the sentimental feelings of victims in the natural crisis (Yang & Jiang, 2015) .

Scholars (Bondes & Schucher, 2014; Cairns & Carlson, 2016; Cheng, 2016b) found that the organization-public dialogue was strictly controlled by the centralized political system in China. In crises, sensitive words and social media accounts were blocked; nonverbal languages such as emoticons and figurative language were strictly filtered out; private-personal data could be easily collected by governmental institutions. Between governments and corporations, the political control restricted ""all the argumentative moves of a corporate weblog"" (Na, 2017, p. 344) . Even if publics stayed in their daily conversations on social media, the political system could monitor users' online dialogue and detect any negative comments on governments. Thus, the centralized political governance in China impedes a transparent, equal, and open dialogue between the above-mentioned three types of organizations and their online publics in crises.

By reviewing 61 articles published in 27 academic journals, this study presented an overview of current SMCC research in China from 2006 to 2018. Results demonstrated that increasing academic attention focused on online publics. Scholars widely discussed public motives of using social media, highly engaged online communication, and public emotions and non-verbal language use in online dialogue (Kim et al., 2016; Mou, 2014; Tai & Sun, 2007; Xie et al., 2016) . Findings also demonstrated the two sides of social media's impact on dialogue between organizations and their publics in crises of China. On the one hand, social media may act as a mediator for rapid information transmission and promote transparent dialogue in crises. Chinese social media helps balance the organizational power as the ""dominator"" and the public power as the ""challenger"" in crises. On the other hand, social media serves as an open-platform to all types of users, so it is hard to control information due to the highly engaged dialogic interactions. Messages online have the power of directing public opinion and can cause damage to an organization's reputation. Last but not least, the unique contextual factors such as power distance, face-giving/saving, favor, relationship (Guanxi) and sentiment (Renqing), and the centralized political system that may facilitate/inhibit dialogue in crises of China were identified. Implications and directions for future SMCC research were presented below.

Within the current literature, scholars extensively discussed the social-mediated crisis communication between three types of organizations and their publics in China. However, results found only half of current SMCC studies applied a theoretical framework. Meanwhile, theories such as the social-mediated crisis communication model, form/medium influence-based theories (e.g., media richness theory), and source influence-based theories (e.g., dialogic public relations theory) were not frequently applied. Moreover, a theoretical framework that explains the antecedents, process, and outcomes of dialogue on social media in crises of China is lacking. This study consequently posits a theoretical framework of the SMCC research in China, which confirms the importance of Chinese contextual elements and may help crisis managers to consider dialogue as an alternative communication approach for crisis responses. As shown in Fig. 3 , this scholarly assessment tool first lists major contextual antecedents that can significantly influence social-mediated dialogue in crises of China, which include high-power distance, face and favor, relationship (Guanxi), sentiment (Renqing), the centralized political system, and media censorship system. Second, as what Romenti et al. (2014) suggested, dialogue fulfilled the strategic goals of organizations. Dialogue orientations and approaches determined types of dialogue strategies, serving for different purposes and functions in crisis communication. This new framework thus argues that purposes, strategies, and functions of social-mediated dialogue should be examined in the future. Last but not least, this assessment tool contains measurements of SMCC outcomes such as organization-online publics relationships, image construction, economic value (e.g., stock, revenue, cost reduction, market share), and social media publicity (e.g., cognitive or affective attributes). Future research may test the antecedents, processes, and outcomes of social-mediated dialogue in crises of China based on this scholarly assessment tool.

As social media has become increasingly important and powerful in facilitating publics to express their own opinions, scholars showed a keen interest in secondary crisis communication (SCC), which was defined as ""the public disseminate crisis information and post negative comments about firms in crisis"" (Schultz, Utz, & Goritz, 2011; cited in Zheng et al., 2018, p. 56) . For instance, Noguti, Lee, and Dwivedi (2016) found the unique feature of SCC is the capacity for large quantities of information transmitted rapidly on social media (Noguti et al., 2016) . Moreover, SCC not only spread crises events, but also led to new crises (Luo & Zhai, 2017) . SCC has magnified the consequences of crises and certain publics' posts in a celebrity-endorsement crisis even generated more ""likes"" than organizational crisis responses (Jiang, Huang, Wu, Choy, & Lin, 2015) . Currently limited research focused on the effects of SCC and stakeholders' crisis communication strategies, while in crises of China the public-generated dialogues had a high degree of diffusivity and interaction. The highly active publics and their crisis responses strategies on social media deserve exploration. This study calls for more future studies on secondary crisis communication in China.

Results presented that large quantities of current studies focused on stakeholders/publics, governments, or corporates, rather than NPOs. In China, two main types of NPOs exist: one is initiated and sponsored by governments; the other is organized and financially supported by private citizens or institutions (Cheng, 2016b) . Future research agenda may focus on the social-mediated crisis communication from perspectives of NPOs and provide theoretical and practical suggestions to increase organizational transparency and accountability in crises.

Meanwhile, dominant studies focused on mainland China and little attention was paid to Greater China, which included Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan. Although Hong Kong and Macau for instance, have returned to the territory of China, local residents may still hold a different political stand and stay out of the strict control of mainland Chinese governments (Huang et al., 2016) ; people there can easily get access to Facebook and Twitter, which are entirely blocked in mainland China. The Hong Kong government currently is facing the crisis of mistrust from publics in the post-handover period (Luo & Zhai, 2017) . In Taiwan, the relatively mature democratic policies may lead to a different adoption of dialogue strategies in crises. Thus, future research can thoroughly explore each specific region and compare the social media and crisis communication practice in Greater China.

According to Eriksson (2018) , a good systematic review should not only describe directions for theory development and research topics, but also provide implications for practitioners. This review research filled the gap of global public relations literature by presenting lessons for practitioners who are interested in the social media and crisis communication practice in China. First, in China, emoticons and figurative language were popular on various domestic social media tools. Results suggested that it is important for organizations to adopt an informal personable communication style in dialogue with online publics in crises. Second, the appearance of social media such as Weibo and WeChat makes timing an essential factor in crisis communication. Thus, organizations need to change their dialogic approaches from being passive to being active and open true dialogue on China's social media sites for crisis communication. It is also essential to grasp publics' sentimental feelings at the outset of dialogue and regularly monitor items such as customer satisfaction and word-of-mouth on popular social media platforms (Kim et al., 2016) . Finally, as results from this study demonstrated, organizations should particularly understand the cultural norms and societal forces of China, if their strategic goal is to establish and maintain a positive relationship with publics in such a challenging marketplace.

Several limitations must be mentioned. First, this study did not explore articles written in Chinese from local Chinese scholars, future research might conduct a complete review and compare findings between the international and local scholarship on the subject of social-mediated dialogue in crises. Second, to explore the stand-alone empirical research, this study only reviewed journal articles and excluded book reviews, commentaries, and conference proceedings. With the rapidly growing productivity in the SMCC research, 

Public Relations Review xxx (xxxx) xxxx many journal articles, books, and conference papers from interdisciplinary areas such as business, psychology, and public policy could also provide rich references on this topic. Future research may include those resources into discussions.

"Understanding community perceptions, social norms and current practice related to respiratory infection in Bangladesh during 2009: a qualitative formative study","Background: Respiratory infections are the leading cause of childhood deaths in Bangladesh. Promoting respiratory hygiene may reduce infection transmission. This formative research explored community perceptions about respiratory infections. Methods: We conducted 34 in-depth interviews and 16 focus group discussions with community members and school children to explore respiratory hygiene related perceptions, practices, and social norms in an urban and a rural setting. We conducted unstructured observations on respiratory hygiene practices in public markets.","Many human respiratory pathogens including influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, and the coronavirus that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) are spread by coughing or sneezing [1] [2] [3] . These respiratory viruses contribute importantly to the global respiratory disease burden [4] . When people are infectious and cough or sneeze, these viruses can be expelled through aerosols and large droplets and spread virus from person to person [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] .

Transmission prevention is accorded a high priority in Bangladesh for two reasons: the high respiratory disease burden and high population density. Acute respiratory infection is a major cause of child mortality in Bangladesh, accounting for 21% of all deaths in children aged less than 5 years from 2000 to 2004 [7] . When pandemic influenza A (H1N1) occurred in Bangladesh in 2009, there was concern for its potential to rapidly spread due to the high population density and lack of respiratory hygiene. To contain or reduce transmission of viruses such as pandemic influenza the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended non-pharmaceutical interventions and public health messages on maintenance of respiratory hygiene/cough etiquette [8] . The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) identified certain respiratory hygiene measures, including: covering the nose and mouth when coughing or sneezing; using tissues to contain respiratory secretions; disposal of used tissues in the nearest waste receptacle; and washing hands with soap after having contact with respiratory secretions and contaminated objects. CDC recommended that if persons do not have a tissue, they should cough or sneeze into their upper sleeve, not into their hands, to stop the spread of germs [1, 6] . Nevertheless, a recently conducted quantitative study in a rural and an urban site in Bangladesh found that very few people in these areas currently practice respiratory hygiene. Of the 1,122 observed coughing and sneezing events, 907 (81%) people coughed or sneezed into the air, 119 (11%) into their hands and 83 (7%) into their clothing [9] .

To design an effective intervention to improve respiratory hygiene in a community, it is important to understand the community's perceptions on respiratory infections and their perceived barriers to practice respiratory hygiene. Finding ways to communicate health messages that could prevent respiratory infections is difficult for several reasons: respiratory diseases tend to have multiple symptoms rather than a single symptom, e. g. coughing, fever, and difficulty breathing; symptoms of respiratory infections exist on a continuum from mild to severe; people perceive respiratory illnesses as ""mild"" events even among those who have severe signs and symptoms; some symptoms are related to non-infectious illnesses such as asthma or allergies; some respiratory viruses are spread through the air and thus not easily traced [10] [11] [12] [13] . The inability to recognize the severity or understand transmission patterns of respiratory illness is a concern because when viral respiratory infections occurs within a community people may not respond or may take ineffective actions to reduce personto-person spread of the viruses. For example, they might try to avoid being exposed to cold weather or water rather than avoiding persons with respiratory symptoms. Improved respiratory hygiene, such as coughing or sneezing into the upper sleeve, could reduce the risk of respiratory illness, especially in densely populated countries like Bangladesh, because both crowding and poor ventilation facilitate respiratory infections spread quickly from person to person [3] . In low-income countries like Bangladesh, disposable tissues are considered a luxury and not commonly used.

In this study, we explored whether the determinants of respiratory hygiene in our study population matched our hypothesis. We hypothesized that persons in the community share traditional beliefs, culture, social norms and perceived risk of illness about the transmission of respiratory infections that may not compatible with germ theory. These determinants are important to address in a successful respiratory hygiene intervention. Our formative qualitative research study examined the above hypothesis and this paper reports our findings about community perceptions on respiratory infections, why they occur, how they are spread, and the preventive measures that people take to protect themselves and their families. We collected these data to facilitate the development of appropriate behavior change interventions to interrupt respiratory disease transmission.

We conducted the study during December 2008 to September 2009 in an urban area of Mirpur, in the capital city Dhaka, and in rural Fulbaria, a sub-district of Mymensingh District, in north central Bangladesh. We selected these sites as they are typical of urban and rural areas in Bangladesh and both had other ongoing International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh (ICDDR, B) studies that allowed us to easily build rapport with the communities and collect data. The study site at Mirpur included three different socio-economic neighborhoods to increase variation of data. The study site at Fulbaria included two villages.

We selected our participants purposively in both sites to include persons from different settings, ages, socio-economic status, and occupational, educational and religious backgrounds according to the criteria described below for each qualitative method. Data saturation occurred after 16 in-depth interviews in urban Mirpur area and 18 in-depth interviews in rural Fulbaria with adult males and females. We identified three different socio-economic neighborhoods in urban Mirpur and recruiting participants from every tenth household. In each of the two selected villages in Fulbaria, we selected informants from every 10th household in purposively identified areas near four schools. We also selected two informants from Hindu families in each village.

We conducted eight focus group discussions in each of the study sites of Mirpur and Fulbaria. Each of these eight focus discussions took part with a pre-selected group, including some of the most influential members of Bangladeshi society, to maximize the variety of data collected relating to message dissemination for hygiene practices uptake. The groups included adult males, adult females, school boys, school girls, male teachers, female teachers, paramedics and religious leaders. Eight to 11 people participated in each focus group discussion. Selecting focus group discussion participants, to ensure that there was no overlap with the in-depth interview informants within the same geographic area, we started the selection process where the in-depth interview sampling had ended. We then enrolled adult male and female informants from the next 10th households. We prepared a list of all schools situated within or contiguous to both study sites and randomly selected two schools from each site; we selected male and female students of level three to five from one school and male and female teachers from the other. We selected paramedics from among those whom the informants commonly sought treatment as noted during in-depth interviews. To recruit religious leaders, we identified all of the mosques within the two study areas where Friday prayers take place.

For our observations, we identified the three closest public markets in each of our study sites. We chose 6 h during the busiest times of trading, between 7 AM to 10 AM in the morning and 5 PM to 8 PM in the evening to observe and record the behavior of shopkeepers and customers.

We employed in-depth interviews and focus group discussions to explore community's perceptions, reported practices, and social norms related to respiratory infection and respiratory hygiene. Although the purpose of both of these qualitative tools overlapped, the focus group discussions covered a larger number of participants, and highlighted the vital role that each group could play in disseminating the messages. We used observations to explore and understand actual practice in natural settings. All three helped in triangulating our findings. A multidisciplinary team including public health specialists, social scientists, epidemiologists, and a communication specialist developed each of the qualitative guidelines for in-depth interview, focus group discussion and unstructured observation. Each tool was pretested in the field and revised (Appendix 1-3).

The data were collected by the first author, who is a sociologist, along with three anthropologists, who all had extensive experience in collecting qualitative data. Before data collection commenced we thoroughly reviewed the research objectives, research tools and specific data collection techniques to effectively and efficiently collect quality data. During in-depth interviews, lasting from 35 min to 60 min, and focus group discussions, ranging from 55 min to 90 min, we used an interview guide that started by asking people to list all of the illnesses they could think of that they associated with respiratory functions. We also asked about their perceptions on causes of respiratory illness, how respiratory infections are passed from one person to another, how disease transmission can be prevented, existing social norms, current practices related to respiratory hygiene, and for suggestions of messages and channels to promote respiratory hygiene behavior. We also conducted unstructured observations in markets to see respiratory hygiene practices in public places. During observation, we took notes about customers' and shopkeepers' behaviors linked to respiratory hygiene (Appendix 3). Nevertheless we did not count the events as we conducted unstructured observations in extremely crowded market places. Rather than quantify, we were more interested in observing people's actual respiratory hygiene practices including: whether people covered their mouths during coughing or sneezing; if so, how they covered their mouths (with hands/upper arm/ cloth); whether they turned away from others while coughing or sneezing; whether they spat on the ground; and whether they washed their hands after nasal cleaning or coughing or sneezing into hands.

We recorded the in-depth interviews and focus group discussions using audio recorders. We transcribed these audio recordings in Bengali, and to describe signs, symptoms and respiratory illness, we retained the local terminology. We manually coded the data according to our research objectives. After coding, we translated these data into English. We performed thematic content analysis in order to provide a descriptive of our result. Though we analyzed each in-depth interview and each focus group discussion separately, in the results we have drawn inferences collectively from both types of data. Moreover, indepth interviews and focus group discussions findings were compared for consistency and were triangulated. No attempt was made to quantify study findings, as the number of informants interviewed was small. We followed the similar process for the unstructured observation notes.

Before taking part in the in-depth interviews and focus group discussions, we asked adult participants to provide written informed consent. We asked school students to provide assent with parental consent. This study protocol was reviewed and approved by ICDDR, B's Ethical Review Committee.

The majority (22/34) of our informants for in-depth interviews were aged 18-35 years; approximately 1 quarter were illiterate or could only sign their name. Over two-thirds (13/17) of female informants described themselves as homemakers (Table 1 ). In total, 144 participants took part in our focus group discussions. There were 70 adult males and 32 adult females, and 20 school boys and 22 school girls. Adult male focus group discussion participants were mostly street vendors or laborers in urban sites, and in rural sites most of them were farmers. In both study sites, adult female focus group discussion participants were homemakers.

In the analysis of the 34 in-depth interviews, 16 focus group discussions, and six unstructured observations, there were no notable differences in the findings between the heterogeneous groups. We found similar responses and behaviors related to respiratory infections between urban and rural residents, different socio-economic groups, Muslims and Hindus, and school students and trained paramedics and lay persons. Therefore we have provided a summary of the findings aggregated across all study participants.

Our informants were not familiar with the Bengali translation of the term ""respiratory infection"" and did not have a specific Bengali word for this term. When asked to explain respiratory infection, informants used the phrase 'shas-proshassh jonito sangkromon', which literally translates as 'breathing and exhalation related infection'. The research team had to give detailed explanations and use hand gestures to indicate the focal areas of the body related to respiratory infection. When we asked informants to name some diseases transmitted during either breathing or exhalation, informants gave a wide variety of answers. Some answers had no direct relation to respiratory functions such as a stomach ache or skin diseases (Table 2) .

Most of our informants associated transmission of respiratory infections with coming into close contact with a sick person's breath, cough droplets and spit; sharing a sick person's food or utensils; or allowing flies or mosquitoes that have had contact with human secreted substances (mucous/spit) to land on food. Focus group discussion data also supported these findings. A female teacher in a focus group discussion who was from the rural site stated;

""I need to avoid close contact with a sick person. My sister-in-law had difficulty breathing and her daughter-in-law took care of her and the daughter-in-law became infected with difficulty breathing.""

Nevertheless, a few informants mentioned that respiratory infection could be contracted through blood transfusion, by genetic pre-disposition (heredity), by fate/luck and from contact with dead animals. A male teacher in a focus group discussion from the rural site attributed patterns of spread of infection to the direction the wind is blowing;

""If someone doesn't cover his mouth and nose during coughing or sneezing, the germs come out from his body. Anybody can be infected with these germs if they are carried in the same direction as the wind. How far away he is does not matter. But if the wind is blowing in the opposite direction other people will not be affected.""

During in-depth interview, when we asked informants about how they caught cold during the previous 12 months, all of them linked catching a cold to imbalances of hot and cold, e.g. ambient temperatures or water temperatures. Specific responses included: exposure to excessive cold, change of weather from hot to cold, or vice versa; drinking cold water and bathing in cold water. A 36 year-old male informant from the urban site said;

""Winter is going and summer is coming. It is hot during the day and cold at night and the mixing of hot and cold weather brings on a cold.""

Most informants reported that respiratory infections could be prevented by keeping distance from a sick person and by avoiding sharing utensils and food of a sick person. Paramedics also told us that when patients came to them with a respiratory infection they advised patients to keep warm and stay away from cold water. After probing, four informants also mentioned that washing their hands could protect them from respiratory illness. Nevertheless, these same informants continued to link the idea of internal imbalances of the body with catching a cold. One 43 yearold female informant from an urban site said;

""A person should not be in contact with cold water for a long time to avoid getting cold/cough.""

Informants from in-depth interviews and focus group discussions reported that there are no specific social norms related to respiratory hygiene. When we asked them about what they and their community considered as appropriate practices when someone has a cold in order not to spread it to other people, they mentioned a variety of actions that they felt were 'good behaviors'. These included covering the nose and mouth with hands or a handkerchief; turning the face away during sneezing or coughing; avoiding spitting, coughing, or sneezing into the environment; avoiding close contact with sick people; and keeping the body neat and clean. Religious leaders told us that hygiene was related to cleanliness before prayer time five times per day and that people should sneeze only into their left hand. In general they endorsed saying ""Praise be to Allah"" (Alhamdulillah) after sneezing. We found from our unstructured market observations that, almost universally, people did not practice these 'good behaviors' related to respiratory hygiene that they had identified during interviews and focus group discussions.

When exploring the perceived feasibility and effectiveness of handwashing to prevent respiratory infection, informants commonly stated that, if they did not wash their hands after coughing or sneezing into their hands, they Table 2 Signs, symptoms, and illnesses that informants associated with respiratory disease could become ill. One adult informant from a rural site said;

""Our hands are always dirty because of dust, which is everywhere. So without washing hands, anyone can be affected by any kind of respiratory disease.""

Informants thought that it was not feasible or practical to wash hands after every event of coughing or sneezing, especially when someone has a runny nose. A 30 year old female informant from the urban site commented;

""People don't wash their hands after sneezing and coughing. Is it possible to wash hands frequently? If you sneeze 100 times, will you wash your hands 100 times? But we should wash our hands before taking a meal.""

After probing about how messages should be delivered and which channels of communication should be used, informants mentioned that awareness of respiratory hygiene behavior can be promoted by delivering messages related to their identified 'good behaviors, which could be disseminated through interpersonal communication, dramas, videos, television programs, during paramedic-patient interaction, and through the school curriculum. The teachers, imams and the paramedics told us that they can contribute to improving respiratory hygiene by disseminating related health messages. One religious leader in a focus group discussion from an urban site said;

""We can deliver information among people during Friday prayers, the special prayer day for Muslims.""

A female teacher in a focus group discussion from a rural site said;

""We can deliver respiratory hygiene related disease messages among our students and at the time of stipend when all guardians come to the school and during mothers assembly we can discuss with parents about respiratory hygiene.""

Our findings suggest that local understandings about who gets sick, why, when, how illness spreads and how it can be prevented are varied, and therefore could contribute to the transmission of respiratory infections. Responses from our participants highlighted a contrast in people's minds between contracting a respiratory illness and its transmission and prevention. We have linked local interpretations of disease transmission to both the cultural model of hotcold imbalance and the bio-medical understanding of transmission of respiratory infections. Understanding communities' perception of how an individual's behaviors can be linked to infectious disease transmission can help us engage in meaningful communication regarding behavior change. Well-designed and targeted communication interventions are more likely to be effective if they are theory-based or if they can be linked to a theoretical underpinning of established determinants of behavior and behavior change [14] . We could use these findings to develop culturally compelling behavior change interventions to interrupt respiratory disease transmission [15] .

Informants related their individual experience of catching a cold with the hot-cold imbalance concept where health is maintained through equilibrium, or not having an internal imbalance in the body caused by an excess of either hot or cold. For example, keeping the body warm or avoiding cold elements can maintain internal equilibrium [16] . Our findings related to catching cold are similar to other anthropological and qualitative studies conducted on childhood acute respiratory infection during the 1990s. These studies suggested that people related the occurrence of acute respiratory infection to imbalances of hot and cold in the body, rather than to an infectious agent that can be transmitted from person to person [10, 11, [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] . For example, Bangladeshi mothers avoid feeding cold foods to prevent child from catching pneumonia [10] , and Filipino mothers withhold breast milk from their infants after they have been exposed to cold weather, to prevent the child from catching a cold [21] . Identifying and understanding examples of these cultural perceptions could help in the development of communication messages to develop positive social norms related to respiratory hygiene behavior.

For transmission and prevention, most of the informants' responses aligned more closely to the bio-medical understandings of transmission that originated in the germ theory [22] . For example, although informants may not know that Streptococcus pneumonae and Influenza virus are some of the organisms responsible for pneumonia and influenza, and that this is where the common names of the illnesses were derived from, our informants were aware that respiratory infections were contagious and mentioned avoiding the cough, breath, spit and blood from an infected person. Communication messages could build on our informants' understanding of effective prevention measures.

About the prevention of respiratory infections, the community members had some perceptions that matched with the cultural model of hot-cold imbalance. Nevertheless, community members also had perceptions that aligned with the bio-medical concept as well. Though they perceived some 'good behaviors' were related to respiratory hygiene that could prevent respiratory infections, we observed that they did not translate those into practice. Informants told us that covering nose and mouth or turning the face away was a way to prevent the spread of infection. Nevertheless, almost all shopkeepers and customers we observed in the markets coughed into the air. In another study, where school children's respiratory hygiene behavior was observed, 956 (85%) of 1126 events, children coughed or sneezed into the air [9] . We speculate that the people we observed were not aware or did not value how their behavior could affect their health and that of others. Also many adults and young people do not have the habit of practicing respiratory hygiene, perhaps due to longterm exposure to an unhygienic physical and social environment. Communication messages that remind people to practice these 'good behaviors' on a daily basis could make positive changes in the overall environment.

A limitation of this study is that we collected data from only one urban site and one rural site. Nevertheless, the sites were typical of Bangladeshi communities, and we enrolled a heterogeneous mixture of informants from a variety of social groups. As our groups of informants had similar perceptions related to prevention and transmission, our findings from this formative study provide a foundation to design communication materials promoting respiratory hygiene practices that might be applicable for both rural and urban settings. Although we could not recruit informants from all geographic areas in the study sites for in-depth interviews and focus group discussions with adult males and females, we systematically selected participants from every 10th household in order to select them to diminish the bias of sample selection. Focus group discussions were limited in scope to fully explore complex beliefs. Nevertheless, we also conducted numbers of in-depth interviews, which were more appropriate to explore community beliefs. In focus group discussions, some participants were not vocal, and while the group facilitator tried to encourage them, this may have led to bias. Nonetheless, we triangulated our findings from indepth interviews, focus group discussions and observations.

Our understanding regarding the perceptions about why a person catches a cold and how respiratory infections are transmitted can be used to frame communication messages. Health professionals could use local terms to explain transmission of respiratory infections from the bio-medical perspective to highlight how changes in behavior could prevent transmission. These messages could make people more conscious about respiratory hygiene and then motivate them to follow their identified 'good behaviors' on a regular basis. Since the informants indicated that it is not feasible or practical to wash hands after every event of coughing and sneezing, our communication message could be to ask people to cough and sneeze into their upper arm or sleeve. We suggest piloting these messages with a variety of communication approaches and channels with all community members to reduce respiratory infections. 4 .

BMC Public Health Can the concept of Health Promoting Schools help to improve students' health knowledge and practices to combat the challenge of communicable diseases: Case study in Hong Kong?,"The growing epidemics of emerging infectious diseases has raised the importance of a setting approach and include the Health Promoting School (HPS) framework to promote better health and hygiene. Built on the concept of 'the' HPS framework, the Hong Kong Healthy Schools Award scheme includes ""Personal Health Skills"" as one of its key aspects to improve student hygiene knowledge and practices. This study examines the differences in student perceptions, knowledge and health behaviours between those schools that have adopted the HPS framework and those that have not adopted.","Health behaviours are strongly determined by the differ-ent social, economic and environmental circumstances of individuals and populations. Improvement of health lit-eracy can help individuals to tackle the determinants of health better as it builds up the personal, cognitive and social skills which determine the ability of individuals to gain access to, understand and use of information to promote and maintain good health [1] . Schools are essential in helping students to achieve health literacy [2] . The concept of the health promoting school (HPS) has been advocated as an effective approach to promote health in schools [3, 4] . It embodies a holistic, whole school approach in which a broad health education curriculum is supported by the environment and ethos of the school and shifts health into a more dynamic and political domain to address the determinants of heath [2, 5] . Healthy Schools Award schemes are very popularamong the European countries as structured frameworks acting as systems for monitoring and recognition of achievements [6] . Moon has shown positive award-related changes in terms of children's health behaviours, and that the awarded schools have more health promoting culture and organization [7] .

The outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) has highlighted the importance of maintaining a healthy and hygienic environment as one of the effective public health measures to combat infectious diseases, but the major challenge is that some of the most important public health measures are to be taken outside the health sector [8] . Schools have become an important setting to build up the skills and capacity for students, parents and the wider community to combat the challenges of outbreak of communicable diseases [9] . Rosen et al has demonstrated that a hygiene program can produce a sustained increase in hand washing rates among toilet-trained preschool children [10] . Hand washing has been shown to be an effective means to prevent spread of infection [11] . These findings illuminate the potential of schools as promising venues for promoting hygiene and health in prevention of infectious diseases.

The Centre for Health Education and Health Promotion, The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CHEP) launched the first territory-wide ""Healthy Schools Award Scheme"" (HSA) in 2001 [12] . It was modeled on the World Health Organization (WHO) Regional Office of the Western Pacific Health Promoting School (HPS) framework covering six key areas (health policy, physical and social environments, community relationships, personal health skills and health services) designed to assist schools in addressing particular health issues strategically [13] [14] [15] [16] . The scheme has developed a set of indicators and guidelines to meet the local needs. Each key area has a number of components with targets for the schools to achieve [13] [14] [15] . The participating schools attended training programme on development planning at the start of the project helping them to appreciate the breadth of the scheme and consolidate their thoughts for appropriate action. The HSA project team met with the co-ordinating group of the school to identify and prioritize four to five areas of potential action. The project team visited the school at least once per term to offer advice and support and obtained detailed information on each of the activities for evaluation. The amount of support given varied from area to area according to the needs of the schools and the summary of health promoting activities have been described in the special issues [17] [18] [19] .

The process of selection of indicators for the scheme and also the accreditation process have incorporated advice and validation by a number of local and international experts in the field [15, 20] . A practical manual with detailed guidelines was developed for participating schools [13, 14] . ""Personal health skills"" is one key component, where basic knowledge and skills in hygienic measures and prevention of communicable diseases are incorporated in a variety of school activities like classroom teaching, interactive learning initiatives, community-wide health promoting campaigns, and teaching staffs are equipped with relevant training and resources [9, [13] [14] [15] 20] .

While process evaluations showed that health promoting activities had been successfully implemented in schools, the evaluation of the effectiveness of HPS reported a wide range of outcomes [21] [22] [23] . This survey explores the differences in student perceptions, knowledge and health behaviours between schools that have adopted the HPS framework and those non-HPS. The Education Authority in Hong Kong recommended using the concept of HPS to improve school health and hygiene [24, 25] with the hypothesis that children in HPS schools more likely to perceive that their school is a healthier place. The result would have significant impact on the future planning, implementation and substantiation of HPS in different parts of the World as the problem of emerging infectious diseases becomes a global issue.

A cross-sectional study was conducted in two categories of schools, namely HSA and non-HPS by multi-stage random sampling.

At the time of the study there were 24 primary and 17 secondary schools that had obtained awards for HPS. For comparison between the two categories of schools, assuming the odds ratio of 2 with the non-HPS school having prevalence of 30% of parents participated in school cleaning activities, a sample size of 240 were needed for each group (N = {1.28 × [P 1 × (1-P 1 ) + P 2 × (1-P 2 )] -2 + 1.96 × [2 P 0 (1-P 0 )] -2 } 2 /(P 2 -P 1 ) 2 P1 = proportion of control, P 2 = P 1 × OR/1 + P 1 (OR-1); P 0 = P 1 + P 2 /2) [26] . Random sampling method was used to target at least 500 students from primary and secondary schools in HSA category (double the required numbers) and 750 non-HPS category (triple the required numbers) from primary and secondary schools. Schools were randomly selected from each category respectively and letters of invitation were sent out in lots of tens to the selected schools until the targeted numbers of students had been reached.

The first stage consisted of random selection by category and the selected schools were invited by letters. In the second stage, we stratified the participating schools by grades, with samples from Primary 4 (P4) to Primary 6 (P6) (aged around [10] [11] [12] and Secondary 1 (S1) to Secondary 3 (S3) (aged around [13] [14] [15] . The third stage was a systematic random sampling, where one class of students was randomly selected from each grade to participate in the survey.

The questionnaire testing health-related knowledge and hygienic practice was devised by the research team in CHEP based on evaluation tools used by Hong Kong HSA [12, 15, 20] and the content was further validated by two medical doctors with postgraduate degrees in Public Health. Health-related knowledge was reported as a score for each student, and other outcome measures adopt an ordinal scale (e.g. ""very clean"", ""clean"", ""not quite"", ""not clean""), which was then grouped into binary variables (e.g. ""very clean"" and ""clean"" as a group vs. those not) for statistical analysis. The complete set of questionnaire had been pilot tested in a primary school for face-validity and reliability with good results. The items are well understood. The 2-week test-retest reliability has shown all the items with kappa statistic 0.7 or higher.

The following aspects were examined in the survey: For the HSA group, 510 students and 789 students were sampled from 5 primary schools and 7 secondary schools respectively. For the 'Non-HPS' group, 676 students and 725 students were sampled from 8 primary schools and 7 secondary schools respectively. The response rate from students of the participating schools was nearly 100% for all the schools (except those absent from schools). Letters were sent out to students and parents to obtain consent for participation on voluntarily basis. The questionnaires were collected without identifiers to ensure confidentiality. It took about 30 minutes to complete the questionnaire. No refusal was noted from parents and students. The study has been approved by Survey and Behaviour Research Ethics Committee of the Chinese University of Hong Kong

Proportions of students with particular behaviours and perception of school environment were tabulated. Chi square statistics was used to analyse the difference in proportions between HSA and non-HPS. For knowledge, scores were calculated for each category and t test statistics was used to analyse the difference.

The sample consisted of approximately equal gender distribution (see Table 1 ). The majority of students (around 79%) were born in Hong Kong, with a minority born in Mainland (21%) or other countries. The mean age of the participants from secondary schools was 14.46 (S.D. ± 

Handwashing practices In terms of hand washing habits after toileting, only small difference was detected as this is something that has been enmeshed into the children's everyday life especially since the SARS epidemic.

There was a significant difference between HSA schools and non-HPS schools in teachers reminding students to wash their hand before meals ( Table 2) . Also higher proportion of secondary school students washed hands with their own initiatives before meals although the reverse was observed amongst primary students (Table 2) Tooth Brushing and Bathing Table 2 shows that in primary schools, higher proportion of students from HSA schools (28.2%) always brushed their teeth after meal than the non-HPS category (19.7%) with statistical significance (p = 0.001) ( Table 2 ).

The majority of students had a bath everyday but HSA primary school students reported a significantly higher proportion than non-HPS schools (99.6% vs. 98.1%, p = 0.02; table 2).

Higher proportion of students from HSA schools in both primary and secondary schools (80.9% vs 75.2% and 64.0% vs 58.0% respectively) coped correctly when they had fever with statistical significance (p = 0.02; Table 2 ).

There was no significant difference amongst primary school children encouraged to wear face mask or staying away from school if they had symptoms of Upper Respiratory Tract Infection (URTI). However difference was observed in mask wearing between the HSA and non-HPS secondary schools (86.8% vs 80.4%) and in staying away from schools if students had URTI symptoms (93.6% vs 90.1%) with statistical significance (p = 0.001 and p = 0.01 respectively, Table 3 ).

The Hygiene Charter, launched in 2003 as a community initiative supported by various business and industry sectors to pledge their long-term commitment to fight against the challenges posed by SARS and create a healthy and hygienic environment for Hong Kong [23] . Its website is of high reference value for schools. In secondary schools, higher proportion of students from the HSA group reported that teachers had mentioned the Hygiene Charter website (28% vs 15.3%; p < 0.001) ( Table 3) .

In secondary schools, higher proportion of students from the HSA group (23.6% vs 19.2%) felt that their schools joined community cleaning with statistical significance (p = 0.04) ( Table 4 ). The organization of activities to promote health and hygiene was also reported by higher proportion of students from the HSA than the non-HPS (Table 4) .

Primary school students in the HSA group had higher proportion choosing ''very clean'' or ''clean'' for playground hygiene (72.2%) as compared to 61.6% in the non-HPS group (p < 0.001; Table 4 ). For classroom 73.6% of students from HSA schools chose ''very clean'' or ''clean'' compared with 68.5% in non-HPS schools (p = 0.058) ( with cleaning with statistical significance. More HSA primary school students reported having prefects for environmental protection (63.1% vs. 59.7%), and similarly in secondary schools (49.4% vs. 23.7%) with statistical significance (p < 0.001) ( Table 4) .

In most areas of health-related knowledge, it was found that the majority of students in both groups have ever acquired related knowledge. There was no significant difference amongst the secondary school students between the HSA and non-HPS groups in the overall scores for both categories (12.40 vs. 12.41; p = 0.95). However in primary schools, the difference in overall scores between the two groups was found to be statistically significant (12.13 vs 11.58; p < 0.001) ( Table 5) .

Higher proportion of primary school students in HSA group had chosen ""very much"" or ""quite a lot"" in getting health information from student health ambassadors (32.8% vs 17.7%; p < 0.001), media (46.5% vs. 43.2%; p = 0.002), and pamphlets (52.3% vs 46.2% p = 0.04) with statistical significance (Table 5) . For secondary schools, it was also found that higher proportion of students in HSA group had chosen ""very much"" or ""quite a lot"" in getting health information from student ambassadors (19.0% vs 10.5%; p < 0.001) and pamphlets (36.5% vs 27.3% p < 0.001) with statistical significance (Table 5 ).

On the whole, students from the HSA group showed positive outcomes in most aspects of health and hygiene particularly the hygiene practice of students and actions taken by schools. It is not unexpected as HPS embodies a holistic, whole school approach to personal and community health promotion [27] . The Hong Kong Healthy Schools Award scheme builds on the concept of HPS which helps to create a supportive environment for healthy development in schools, home and the community [6] . Studies have shown that students from schools which had comprehensively embraced the HPS concept as indicated by attaining the 'Healthy School Award', were better, in terms of health and educational outcomes, than students from schools that did not reach the standard of the award [28, 29] .

St Leger and Nutbeam [30] stated that HPS contributes to four school related outcomes. They are: (a) lifelong learning; (b) competencies and behaviors; (c) specific cognate knowledge and skills; and (d) self attributes. Therefore HSA schools would confer a great impact on school health and hygiene, in addition to students' health habits, as was demonstrated in the present study.

Positive changes were observed in certain aspects of school health and hygiene particularly in getting relevant health information from various reliable sources amongst secondary students in the HSA group. Previous studies have indicated the potential for a settings approach to school health, like the Hong Kong HSA scheme (HKHSA), to provide a promising strategic framework allowing health literacy outcome to be achieved [2, 31] . This group of schools also established actions to promote better health and hygiene as the schools participated in community cleaning activities and the parents also supported the schools in cleaning activities. This study reveals that these HSA schools have also organized more health promotion activities. This moves to a more collaborative communitybased approach for students to learn, as opposed to a teacher-dominated school hierarchy [2] , is one of the strategies to achieve critical health literacy [1] .

School-based implementation of HPS was shown to be associated with significant greater levels of positive personal health habits. Although this study is cross-sectional and no cause and effect can be established, it would still highlight how HKHSA might exert its influence individually as well as the school level. Although some of the significant findings of this study is marginal, HPS has only been implemented over a short duration in Hong Kong. HPS programme has been shown to be effective if the intervention is intensive over a long duration [32] . Recent evidence suggests that the way the school is lead and managed, students' experiences in participating and taking responsibility for shaping policies, practices and procedures, teachers-students relationship and school engagement with its local community including parents actually builds many protective factors for health and minimises risk taking behaviour [32] [33] [34] [35] . Many of these gains have occurred without a specific health 'intervention'. It appears that a whole school approach to build and maintain a caring school social environment might be the most effective way in achieving good health outcomes.

However putting the HPS in practice takes considerable amount of time and efforts and effective implementation requires commitment and support of various schools' stakeholders. The success of HPS depends heavily on teachers' training like Health Education diploma programmes, which could introduce the concepts to the teachers so they can start making improvements on some fundamental areas of school health and hygiene [36, 37] . With time and more teachers being exposed to the concept, teachers would then gradually develop their schools to become HPS. The primary school students in HSA group have shown to have better knowledge scores. Although the difference in knowledge scores between two groups is not statistically significant in secondary schools, it is well known fact that there are other factors in adolescents leading to behaviour and practice change apart from knowledge and belief.

There are some limitations of this study. Schools with more health conscious students or their families might be more willing to adopt HPS. The study design might not be able to control for that history which would have some threat to internal validity. It is a cross sectional survey so it might not capture the longer-term impact of HPS on health behaviours of students due to the different components of HSA interventions. The differences observed might or might not be due to the effect of intervention and future longitudinal studies are needed to ascertain the causal effect fostered by HSA. Furthermore, some outcomes were reported by students only and may involve recall in the past few months, and the effect of multiple comparisons should be taken into account when interpreting statistical significance. In addition, we assumed that randomized sampling minimized the heterogeneity of different clusters and demographic characteristics among schools, which have not been controlled for. This study did not comprehensively assess all the outcomes of HPS as there are different types of outcomes which require different methods of data collection. [14] A descriptive design was adopted instead of randomised control study design because one cannot randomly select schools from all schools in Hong Kong as intervention group since schools need to comply with the standards of HPS to make it an effective programme.

The study has demonstrated that schools involved in HPS activities through the HSA scheme in Hong Kong had more favorable hygiene practice of students, school environment and atmosphere in health and hygienic practice. Although all schools in Hong Kong have health elements in the curriculum, the primary objective of HPS is to modify the behaviours of school students rather than information giving, so more positive changes are observed in those schools that participated and met the standards in the HSA scheme. These findings highlight the potential of HPS in equipping schools to handle public health crisis such as SARS [9] . Therefore it is highly recommended that schools would further enhance the practice of HPS to empower their students, staffs and parents to enhance preparedness of possible future epidemics of communicable diseases.

"BMC Public Health Gatekeepers of health: A qualitative assessment of child care centre staff's perspectives, practices and challenges to enteric illness prevention and management in child care centres","Background: Enteric outbreaks associated with child care centres (CCC) have been well documented internationally and in Canada. The current literature focuses on identifying potential risk factors for introduction and transmission of enteric disease, but does not examine why these risk factors happen, how the risk is understood and managed by the staff of CCCs, or what challenges they experience responding to enteric illness. The purpose of this study was to explore the understanding, knowledge and actions of CCC staff regarding enteric illness and outbreaks, and to identify challenges that staff encounter while managing them.","In 2003, over 2 million Canadian children from the ages of 0-5 years were in some form of non-parental care and 28% of these children were in a daycare [3] . The cost of child care ranged from $300 to over $700/week and varied between provinces, territories and age in 2005 [4] . Two types of child care, regulated and unregulated, are present in Canada. There are approximately 11, 000 regulated child care facilities in Ontario which include nursery schools, preschools, centre-based full-day child care and regulated home child care. These centres must meet legislated requirements for operation of services as set out by provincial/territorial regulations. Unregulated arrangements may consist of care provided by a relative, by an unregulated family child care provider, or in-home caregiver [5] .

Canadian data from 1998 showed that over 98% of child care centre (CCC) staff were female and 45% were under the age of 30. Staff had a high level of experience; 60% had worked in the field over 5 years and 71% of teaching staff held an early childhood education (ECE) credential. Hourly wages varied between provinces and territories. The national average hourly rate was $11.62 for a teacher and $9.59 for an assistant. Only 74% of staff reported paid sick days, which averaged 7.6 days/year. Even with these challenges, a high proportion of staff reported experiencing enjoyment and reward from their work. Twenty percent reported feeling disrespected by some other professionals [5] .

Numerous enteric illness outbreaks in CCCs have been reported, although investigations rarely identified a common source. Reports commonly cited person-to-person transmission or risk factors that increased the potential for transmission and illness [6] [7] [8] . These factors included inadequate hygiene related to diapering, toileting and hand-washing [9, 10] ; poor cleaning of environmental surfaces [6] ; improper food preparation [6] ; inadequate exclusion of ill children and staff [9, 10] ; and working or being cared for in a younger age group [7, 11] .

Acts and regulations related to child care and health are issued by the provinces and territories in Canada. Additionally, public health officials at the local level have a high level of responsibility for performing inspections, responding to outbreaks and providing guidance or developing resources for CCCs according to these Acts and regulations. Staff of CCCs are most likely made aware of these Acts and regulations through their formal training, but also through regular interaction with public health officials. The variation between provincial/territorial or local health regions can make consistent public health response to enteric outbreaks challenging. Currently, knowledge is limited on how staff working in CCCs interpret and implement the guidance they are provided from public health officials. A previous study identified that staff may have inconsistent definitions of what constitutes diarrhea, and that their actions during an outbreak may differ from those recommended by public health officials [11] . Furthermore, reports from three recent Canadian investigations recommended the development of consistent guidance for CCCs related to outbreak management, prevention and control of illness [9, 11, 12] .

Resources or programs can be more successful when developed in collaboration with the groups or people who may be impacted by them [13] . Staff of CCCs were identified as an important group to consult with regarding the development of consistent guidance. The exploration of perspectives, understanding and opinions were important aspects, and thus qualitative research approaches were selected as the most suitable tool to gather this information. The qualitative approach allowed for data to be collected in the form of the participant's own words which provided a more detailed and deeper understanding than would be possible through quantitative studies. Use of qualitative methods required an inductive approach to explore the participant's experiences and perspectives [14] . Focus groups are a mechanism for collecting data. This form of group interview sets up an environment for the participants to interact, and interaction can lead to a wide range of information on experiences and perspectives [15] .

The purpose of this study was to explore the perspectives, knowledge, self-described practices and challenges CCC staff working in regulated centres in southern Ontario have related to enteric illness and outbreaks. It was also intended to investigate how staff use current public health guidance. The final objective was to gather information to feed into the development of consistent recommendations for the prevention and management of enteric illness in child care settings.

Between November 2005 and January 2006, five focus groups were conducted with staff from regulated CCCs in Southern Ontario. Four groups were conducted at different CCCs. Each of the four groups consisted of staff from the respective CCCs. The fifth group was mixed and consisted of staff from different centres and who did not work together. Ethics approval was obtained from the Research Ethics Board of the University of Guelph. All participants provided written, informed consent

A purposive sampling approach was used to recruit participants from regulated CCCs in southern Ontario. Centres were selected by the researchers and contacted by phone.

Study information and requirements were sent to each centre for their further consideration and permission to conduct the focus groups. This sampling approach sought participants who worked in a variety of settings and who could contribute their experiences on managing enteric outbreaks. Centres and staff members were defined as those who provided daytime care for an entire day to a group of children (e.g. did not include those who provided only after-school care), and whose staff's first language was English. Participating staff had daily direct contact with the children and had worked in a centre for more than six months.

Preliminary research was conducted with public health officials and CCC staff to develop appropriate questions for use in the focus groups. One-on-one interviews were conducted with public health officials to gather information related to the types of centres that they worked with, how enteric illness outbreaks were typically managed, what support public health officials provided, and their experiences while working with CCC staff. Observations of daily operations were also conducted in five centres to better understand the working environment and how staff interacted with their coworkers and supervisors. Time spent observing in the centres ranged from two hours to a full day.

Open ended inquiry was used in each focus group. Sixteen questions were developed and used per session. Questions related to staff priorities, knowledge of enteric illness in the CCC, definitions and practices, how they used information from public health officials, challenges they faced when managing enteric illness and recommendations for improvement of these situations.

Public health officials assisted in the verification of the question set prior to the focus groups to ensure clarity of the order, timing and flow of discussion. The inductive process used during and between groups with the CCC staff allowed the questions to be altered or refined. For example, follow-up or probing questions were added to allow for experiences and details not in the original question set to be captured as directed by the participants. This process of modifying questions ensured that new situations and recurring trends were explored thoroughly. Focus groups were conducted in a CCC or public location and lasted between 45 and 60 minutes. The principal investigator moderated all groups and a co-facilitator assisted by taking detailed notes. All groups were audiotaped using a digital recorder and transcribed verbatim by the principal investigator. Additionally, detailed memos were written by the researcher following each group. Notes pertained to group participation, how questions were responded to, interesting features of the discussion, and considerations for future groups.

Content analysis was used to analyze the data. This involved examining the transcripts and use of descriptive codes to compare and look for common patterns and themes among the groups [14] . All transcripts were examined by the principal investigator for common patterns within groups. Next, transcripts were reviewed and coded using descriptive codes such as: ""communication with parents"", ""description of diarrhea"" and ""acknowledgement"". Further content and theme analysis was done using NVivo 7. NVivo is a software program often used by qualitative researchers to handle text based data. It assists with the categorization, analysis and displaying of data [16] . Descriptive codes were later grouped into larger categories. Through continuous comparison of the transcripts, categories that were common among the groups were refined. This constant comparison allowed for the identification of themes based on common categories among the groups to be identified.

A total of 40 staff participated in one of five focus groups. The number of participants per group ranged from 3-12. All participants were female and the median age was 35 years (range 20-60 years). Eighty-three percent of the participants had an ECE Diploma (college), and 15 % had a University degree. The median number of years working in a child care centre was 11 (range 2-30 years). The centres represented a variety of settings from large, public centres with multiple classes for infants, toddlers, preschool and school-aged children to smaller centres which only had two rooms. The centres also differed on geographic location and the type of population they served.

Five major themes emerged from the data. The following is a description of the themes and text based examples to illustrate them.

Among the groups, the health and safety of the children was the primary concern and responsibility of the staff. Staff ensured health and safety through observation and the creation of an informal surveillance system for any illness among the children. Staff reported an intimate knowledge of the behaviour and health status of each child they cared for, including indicators of enteric illness such as bowel movements.

Their intimate understanding of the children was used to monitor and look for cues that indicated a change in the child's health. These cues included changes in behavior, eating or sleeping patterns, additional symptoms as well as a change in the frequency, colour and consistency of a child's bowel movement.

Staff: You get to know the smell, like the regular smell of somebody's bowel movement, the colour, you get to know the timing, like something is different or not right.

Staff recognized that bowel movements, and the causes of irregular bowel movements, vary between children and took these factors into account when making decisions and taking actions. This knowledge allowed them to consider additional factors such as the use of antibiotics and medication, teething, nutritional intake as well as the period of time that would most likely indicate an infectious disease as the cause of illness.

Staff:...and that's the hardest thing..., is this really diarrhea from a virus or is it just they're on antibiotics or they're teething.

Staff worked in a dynamic and continually changing environment. Based on previous experience, staff knew when enteric illness appeared infectious, for example, if they observed multiple children ill throughout the centre with similar symptoms in a short period of time. They also noted that illness was often first identified in younger ages and spread throughout the centre rapidly.

Staff: The number of cases of anything, you know when you start to see so many children with similar symptoms-quickly in succession that's when you start wondering if something is happening.

Staff monitored the health and safety of the children by collecting information on various forms (attendance, toileting, health, etc.) and in personal journals. Staff described collecting a large amount of information, however, the number and types of forms being used, the detail collected and how the information was recorded and shared varied between centres. There was no standardardization of forms, although in some jurisdictions standard forms may have been recommended by public health officials. Information collected by staff often remained specific to the room or the group of children that they worked with. The supervisor or director of the entire centre was responsible to collect it centrally and track the information. Staff relied on the supervisor to identify centre-wide health concerns and inform all staff, as well as act as a liaison with public health.

Monitoring and observation was reduced when a child was at home or in school, wherein the staff were unable to monitor hand-washing or health status and had to rely on parents and teachers for information. The staff had less ability to monitor older children (closer to kindergartenage), as the child's independence was much higher. For older children, staff were less involved in diapering and toileting and less in depth records were kept.

The staff role as ""eyes and ears"" created an informal surveillance system for enteric illness within the centre and was also the first stage in a decision-making process. Staff demonstrated knowledge of the children they worked with and the potential causes and symptoms of enteric illness through various cues. The system relied on the staff's recognition of symptoms and their ability to report this information for tracking and communication purposes.

In order to maintain the health and safety of the children, staff acted practically and responses were action-oriented. When a child was ill, their first actions were to care for the child. Staff 2: Get out the gloves, the pads, the wet cloths, the concentrated cleaning, clean that off.

These practical actions ensured a safe environment for the children through thorough cleaning, hand-washing, and restricting play areas (communal water and sand play) where the potential for transmission of illness from child to child existed.

During an outbreak, staff remained action-oriented but began a more intensive cleaning procedure. Responses to outbreaks were described: Staff spoke easily and frequently about they type of cleaning they did during an outbreak, how often they did it, and how it became a habit that they integrated into their day.

Staff: I mean you end up putting it into your program, you end up putting it into the transitions of your day. Like in the infants [group] for example, once one staff goes outside with the children that are awake, the other staff stays inside with the children that are sleeping and they're washing toys, it just becomes a daily part, an everyday practice.

Staff had a high level of comfort with this response and it was equivalent to practices that would be recommended by public health officials. From their experience working in the centre, staff felt that cleaning stopped further transmission of illness. This assisted them in meeting their goals of a healthy and safe environment for the children.

When staff defined diarrhea, they often used visual and sensory based descriptions like: ""uncontained"", ""out of the diaper"", ""running down their legs"". Staff used these cues to take action. However, staff definitions or descriptions of diarrhea were not the same; there was a level of ambiguity and uncertainty and they experienced a dilemma in determining whether a child was ill or not. The staff described two reasons for this uncertainty:

1) Diarrhea could be child specific. One definition may not apply to everyone.

2) The definition of diarrhea could vary between staff members and often was considered a ""judgment call"".

Staff experienced a similar difficulty in clearly defining an ""outbreak"". In public health, an outbreak is often defined as a sudden or unexpected increase of disease within a population.

[17] Staff discussed that there were a number of ways in which they determined when an outbreak was occurring. These included: increased number of children who were ill, comparison to a set baseline, more illness when compared to previous years, or situations where there were multiple illnesses.

Staff: But there's centres that are confused about that, you know I thought it was always 10% and you might talk to one public health person and she may say, oh, it's 10%, you might talk to another one who might say go on past history.

Staff stated very clearly their need for standard definitions for both diarrhea and outbreak to assist them when managing enteric illness. They felt that if the definitions were clear, they would know which actions to take and when.

Staff: It's diarrhea, even to recognize diarrhea versus a loose bowel movement, cause they're two different things, that would help everybody, this is where we need experts to tell us what is the true definition of diarrhea.

In these situations staff used their experience working in the centre, knowledge of the children and personal judgment to enable them to develop definitions that assisted them, but expressed that further guidance from public health officials would be welcomed.

Staff expressed that at times they felt overloaded with demands and/or had limited resources to respond appropriately to unpredictable situations of enteric illness. In these situations, they required flexibility in how they provided care and what actions they took. Staff discussed their use of judgment and previous experience in consideration with guidance provided by public health officials to make appropriate decisions. Staff had different forms of education and varying experiences. This attribute influenced how staff worked with children and managed enteric illness and outbreaks. Although experience could assist in making judgments, experienced staff indicated their personal judgments of diarrhea and how they responded to situations varied. This was in part due to the uncertainty associated with how to define diarrhea. New or inexperienced staff required training by more experienced staff to assist with decision-making. Although policies and guidance related to management of enteric illness are provided to the centre as a whole, staff reported that modification took place on a situation specific basis. This was reported by staff when they felt that the procedures and guidelines were inflexible or differed from a situation that they experienced. In some cases, staff actions varied from what they knew, leaving the individual staff member with a great deal of responsibility in deciding what to respond to and when.

Staff: We have to say that this is our policy, like there are certain things that we can bend on, like if the fever is 99 degrees and our policy is whatever, then yes-bring your child in. But when it's something like that [excluding a child with diarrhea], it's ""this is our 24 hour policy"".

Guidance provided to staff from public health officials and CCC management in this dynamic environment needed to be flexible and pragmatic. Staff used the recommended information provided by public health officials, but also felt that they had adequate ability to modify it to unique situations. This created new practices at the frontline level that were often more specific to the situation and the centre. This responsibility, and the decisions staff made, could significantly influence the management of enteric illness and the potential for outbreaks.

In certain situations, staff experienced conflict in the care they provided due to a specific challenge. These challenges prevented them from taking required actions, and fell into four areas: money, time, staffing and parents.

Most centres identified that on a regular basis they used bleach and water to clean and disinfect. During outbreaks or increased illness one of the first precautions was to change to a more powerful cleaning product. Use of these products was considered important for making the environment safe for the children.

Staff: We tend to be a little proactive, well just yesterday we had one case of diarrhea and today we sent a child home with vomiting, so that room has now been totally disinfected with Virox.

Many staff reported that when the outbreak was considered to be over, centres returned to normal bleach and water solution due to the higher cost associated with using alternate cleaning products on a regular basis even though they felt the use of the product was beneficial.

Staff: I was going to say that's truly the reason why, the cost, bleach is a lot cheaper than Virox.

Staff described that they were always pressed for time, and in certain circumstances, additional responsibilities could require changes to routines in child care that may not be feasible. The expectations to keep the environment clean, especially during an outbreak, are very high and staff felt increased pressure to find ways to incorporate this demand into an already busy schedule and maintain a high level of care.

Staff: I mean it's a lot, on top of all the stuff with parents and the kids and keeping everyone healthy ... during outbreaks we are disinfecting every surface, every toy, like every half day to every day ... cause not only are you trying to run your usual program and everything else but you're also trying to take time within those hours to care for sick kids and do this mass disinfecting...it's just added stress and workload.

Staff worked hard to provide the cleanest and safest environment possible, but recognized they were limited by time and resources. Cleaning products which are fast acting and can be used around the children throughout the day were deemed as necessary. Staff also often suggested that having additional staff support just to clean would be high on their wish list.

Record keeping was cited as an important component of routine monitoring, and especially so during an outbreak. Staff used several forms related to the group they cared for (e.g. attendance) and each individual child (e.g. bowel movement records). This record-keeping required a large amount of time and may prevent staff from performing other actions such as cleaning, speaking with a parent, planning other programs and activities, or looking after themselves. Forms related to enteric illness were only some of the records staff kept. Staff were also responsible for documenting information related to diet, allergens, what activities the child participated in, or behaviour they exhibited.

Staff said that it was difficult for them to take time off from work when they were sick. Reasons included not having compensated sick days, concern over loss of pay, and the inability to find a substitute staff member. Staff knew that they should, and were expected to take time off when experiencing symptoms of enteric illness. For most of the staff, this could be a challenge due to a limited incentive to remain at home while ill, and they admitted not always excluding themselves.

When staff were ill, they relied on a substitute staff member to replace them. However, if a substitute staff member worked in a centre during an outbreak they were not permitted to work in another centre concurrently. This policy is in place to prevent disease transmission. Staff reported that when they are unable to find a substitute staff, they may choose to work.

Staff: If she happens to come to my centre and then the next day we were officially in an outbreak, I would have to call that supply teacher and say ""you know what, you were here yesterday and we're in an outbreak"". She can come back to my centre but she can't go to [another] centre, so that's the frustrating part.

Appropriate ratios between staff and children are regulated and must be maintained in a centre at all times. When staff became ill and were unable to work, or when an ill child needed to be segregated from the larger group until a parent could come and pick them up, the maintenance of ratios between staff and children could be compromised. In these circumstances, there may not be enough staff to segregate the child from the rest of the group. Staff balanced variables such as how ill the child was, how long they had already been in the centre, and the number of available staff, before proceeding to make an informed decision regarding how to appropriately exclude children while maintaining required ratios. Staff 2: sometimes we just don't have the staff or ability to segregate a child.

The relationship between staff and parents was described as positive. During an outbreak, or when a child needed to be excluded, it could become strained. Lack of understanding and level of parental awareness about the transmission of enteric illness created a barrier with staff. Some parents did not understand the importance of keeping their children at home when ill. Staff felt that experience working in the CCC gave them a greater understanding of the severity of symptoms, potential causes for illness, and when a child was truly ill due to infectious diseases.

Staff: That is probably one of the biggest reasons as well as being inconvenient, perhaps inconvenience is the first one...just the financial end of it is another reason why parents are perhaps tentative to withdraw their child from daycare...""we paid for that"".

Staff recognized their inability to monitor the child and ensure proper hygiene when they were sent home.

They relied on the parent's honesty regarding their child's health status.

Staff 1: I mean the hard part with it is we are relying on parents to be completely honest. A number of reasons why they felt parents found it difficult to come and pick up an ill child or keep them at home was discussed. These reasons included a lack of access to alternate care providers or the inability to take time off for financial reasons or the nature of the work place. During the focus groups, a number of the staff expressed empathy for the parents' situations, and staff often felt conflicted between balancing the needs of the parents and what they deemed best for the centre. They expressed that overcoming the challenges associated with parents would be the most helpful to assist them when dealing with enteric illness. 

This study illustrated that CCC staff had an intimate knowledge of symptoms and potential causes of illness in the children they cared for. This knowledge was used in addition to experience related to enteric illness to guide their decisions and actions. An informal surveillance system to identify illness and take appropriate actions was created using the knowledge gained from daily interaction with the children and the observations and records staff kept.

Staff described a high level of comfort in their ability to thoroughly clean, and thereby to help prevent and manage enteric illness within the centre. When staff felt uncertain, they relied on their own judgment and experience to assist them. This was apparent when staff described their difficulty in defining both ""diarrhea"" and ""outbreak"". In situations where challenges related to money, time, staffing and parents were identified, or staff required flexibility in their response, staff adapted their actions to ensure appropriate care, even if it meant modifying recommendations provided by public health officials. Staff gave examples including: adapting cleaning schedules, exclusion guidance, and record-keeping. Public health officials provide guidance based on legislated regulations. The purpose of this guidance is to ensure that staff consistently achieve outcomes which protect the safety and health of the children. This includes the prompt identification of cases and outbreaks of enteric illness so that appropriate public health preventative measures can be put in place. Findings demonstrated the health and safety of the children was a priority for CCC staff but how objectives related to this priority were achieved and how guidance from public health officials was used may vary by staff and facility.

To the best of our knowledge, a study of this nature has not been done. However, the findings support other work that demonstrated staff may have inconsistent definitions and actions related to enteric illness [11] . The challenges identified, such as time, understanding and financial or logistical needs have also been documented in other studies that have examined health care practitioners and their challenges with hygiene [18] [19] [20] . Additionally, the findings help to support the need for consistent forms of management for enteric illness and outbreaks in CCCs. Consistent guidance was supported by the staff who discussed their needs related to standard definitions and actions to take based on the definitions.

The use of focus groups with staff of CCCs allowed for the collection of in-depth data about a wide range of experiences and opinions related to enteric illness and outbreaks. Development of the original question set using information collected from public health officials and staff of CCCs ensured thorough exploration of themes and experiences related to the management of enteric illness. The inductive process allowed for new questions and details to be explored, and led to a range of discussion about the perspectives, experiences and challenges of CCC staff that would not have been possible through the use of a standard, closed questionnaire. Using a purposive sampling approach ensured that participating centres represented a range of care settings available in Southern Ontario. Centres varied in the number and age of children cared for, and setting type (teaching facility, private, public, etc). Although there were some differences between staff and centres, the major themes, experiences and perspectives that the staff spoke of were the same regardless of what type of centre they worked in. Non-regulated facilities were not approached due to the challenges associated with identifying them, size and physical setting. The insight and understanding of CCC staff can be used in further development and implementation of practical guidance.

The process of developing, following and adapting policies at the frontline level has been examined in other public service workers. ""Street Level Bureaucrats"" are defined as public service workers who interact directly with citizens in the course of their job, and who have substantial discretion in the application of policies in the execution of their work [21] . This level of discretion and ability of the frontline worker to modify set government policies for the individual situation has also been described among police officers, social workers and others who work within the public sector [21] . Additionally, studies of nurses have demonstrated similar reliance on previous experience and visual cues such as touching, observing, listening, feeling or sensing, and ""knowing"" in decision-making [22, 23] . Conflict in care has also been reported in health care workers who demonstrated balancing the risks and demands of caring for patients [20] . The results of our study demonstrated that the decision making process and demands placed on CCC staff are similar to those experienced by other professionals, who work in high stress environments and care for others on a daily basis.

The decision-making process that CCC staff used could best be described as Naturalistic. Naturalistic decisionmaking is most often associated with proficient decisionmakers who have extensive experience [24] . The process is informal and relies on the intuition and judgment of the decision-maker. The environments where this decisionmaking process is most frequently used are those with shifting goals due to dynamic and changing conditions, time constraints and high stakes. Typically identified in firefighters or military personnel, this framework also appears to apply to CCC staff. Their decision-making relies heavily on using their judgment and experience to make decisions and modify plans to meet the needs of the situation in a workable and timely fashion [24, 25] .

Previous research has concluded that control measures in the form of standard guidance, education and hygiene are necessary to assist with the prevention and control of infectious diseases [26] . Other studies in areas of infection control and hygiene have highlighted issues related to compliance with guidance. To minimize these issues and increase compliance, they recommend guidance should be easy to follow, accessible and that identified challenges should be considered during their development. Strategies for changing practices should address needs at the individual and group level [27] [28] [29] . The staff in this study also highlighted these as considerations, and based on the findings in this study a number of factors were identified that could strengthen and be considered when developing further guidance to ensure optimal compliance.

The process of identifying, managing and preventing enteric illness in children in CCC settings is inherently variable due to the number of factors, but continuing to enhance consistent decision-making tools and resources for all CCC staff is important. For example, consistently updating public health manuals and onsite visits from public health officials would be beneficial. A visual framework to assist decision-making, which could be used by CCC staff and parents, could be designed to include the variables identified by CCC staff in this study, as well as additional factors considered important by public health officials (e.g., blood in the stool). This framework could be designed to allow CCC staff to incorporate their experience and knowledge into it.

Decisions and actions rely on a clear and consistent understanding of ""diarrhea"" and ""outbreak"" and CCC staff indicated a need for this guidance. Developing one definition may not be possible when there are a number of factors to consider, but inclusion of these factors in a clear decision making framework could be of assistance to staff. It is important for public health officials and management of CCCs to work together while continuing to develop and strengthen definitions of diarrhea and outbreak. As well, it remains an important task to continue to clarify procedures and activities with all CCC staff to ensure consistency.

In CCCs, staff require resources that they can use and adapt as needed. For example, improved record-keeping forms could be developed that are visual and easy for all staff to complete and which could improve challenges associated with time. The information collected on the forms is invaluable in illness surveillance for the entire centre. Staff were very aware of the children they work with but enhancing awareness and communication among staff could ensure the rapid implementation of preventative measures such as increased cleaning throughout the entire centre. This could be accomplished by exchanging information on a regular basis with staff in a consistent manner, through a regularly scheduled briefing session or standard communication log. Staff overwhelmingly expressed the desire for tools that would make the process of cleaning easier. This information is useful for public health officials and CCC management to consider when developing guidelines or providing guidance on cleaning methods and products that staff could use which are of high quality and efficiency but not seen as a challenge due to cost or time.

Consultation with public health officials indicated that public health training for CCC staff would be the most important tool to assist staff. In contrast, although continuing education offered by public health officials was important, CCC staff felt that education and information should also be made available to parents. This training would increase the parent's understanding of enteric disease and provide information on topics such as symptoms, the importance of exclusion and proper prevention and control. Outbreaks may provide educational opportunities to bring staff and parents together for education and information by public health officials. Therefore, it is suggested that educational material be directed to parents, as well as CCC staff.

Staff providing care to children on a daily basis were proud of the impact they had on children's development and education. The intrinsic value placed on child care is significant, but staff often felt that their work was undervalued. Staff need to be acknowledged for the work they do. Basic personal needs such as salaries, and paid sick days, should reflect the level of work and responsibility. Staff should not be penalized financially for taking time off when sick. Many of the staff relied on their wages to support themselves and their families and if not paid while ill, they might need to continue to work. Likewise, parents who keep their children home while ill receive no compensation for doing so, and in most cases they still pay for the days of care, even when their child is not there. Accommodations and incentives also need to be considered for families and parents, especially those in situations of financial need. In addition to staff specific needs, centres may require assistance to ensure additional staff for proper ratios, enhanced cleaning and ensuring substitute staff are available.

The relationship between CCC staff in this study and local public health officials was very positive. During an outbreak, staff looked to public health officials to provide assistance and to reassure them that they took appropriate actions, particularly when dealing with parents. Staff stated a number of times that they referred parents to public health for further support and regarded public health officials as an authority figure when further assistance was required. Guidance should be supported by all groups involved. The relationship between staff, parents and public health is essential to ensuring proper response and management of enteric illness.

As with all qualitative research, questions regarding representativeness and generalizability must be addressed. This study was restricted to a small geographic area in one province in Canada. Although the data and recommendations appear applicable to other jurisdictions, it would be useful to hold similar groups with staff in other jurisdictions to explore and confirm these themes further, taking potential regional differences into account. The one group that was mixed with staff from different centres demonstrated the highest level of interaction from the participants and also gave the greatest degree of contrast. Further research should consider maximizing the number of mixed groups to gain further interaction and insight which would allow for a deeper comparison between groups in analysis due to the potential for contrasting discussion. The relationship between staff and parents is important as it relates to monitoring and preventing enteric illness in CCCs. Recommendations from this study will have impact on parents and therefore further research with parents is required before any recommendations should be implemented. An intervention study could be conducted to test the effectiveness of the recommendations in reducing the amount of illness or improving the response and understanding of staff. Further work with public health officials to gain their perspectives regarding strategies to implement recommendations would also be of value.

This qualitative assessment provides an enhanced understanding and appreciation of the perspective, practices and challenges that staff of CCCs experience in responding to enteric illness and outbreaks. In general, it was found that CCC staff are dedicated to and well informed about the children they work with and have a tremendous responsibility. Results from this study will be useful to public health officials responsible for developing tools and resources to further support or better inform current knowledge and practices for preventing and managing enteric disease. The recommendations from this study were made based on data directly from staff of CCCs and are designed to be practical and developed in further collaboration with them. The experience and knowledge CCC staff use to identify and take action for prevention and management of enteric illness clearly demonstrates their responsibility as gatekeepers of health among the children they care for.

This approach attempts to enlist and empower communities to invest and emphasize their disaster health risk reduction efforts, thereby strengthening health systems and supporting community health resilience building. This Special Issue has collected 20 scientific papers that attempt to examine the research frontier in Health-EDRM.

Major Health-EDRM research evidence gaps were found during a global research agenda setting meeting of the 2018 WHO Health-EDRM global research group in Kobe. Kayano, Chan, Murry et al. [2] highlighted the development need for relevant research methodologies, risk communication approaches, health data management strategies, practical health emergency study ethical guidelines, bridging global research capacity disparities, and infrastructure constraints, to ensure knowledge advancement in Health-EDRM. The authors also pointed out the lack of understanding of psychosocial health risk profiling in population subgroups. Reifel's analysis showed a better understanding of current doctrines and practices in both clinical mental health practices and policy, which will help to bridge the conceptual interlinkages between the preventive-based disaster risk reduction policy agenda and the curative-focused disaster mental health discipline [3] . Genereux, Schluter, Tamahashi et al. [4] argued that standardizing psychometrically robust instruments would also be urgently needed to identify at-risk patients throughout-before, during, and after emergencies and disasters-to ensure that mental and social health needs are addressed throughout the pathway of care (prevention, screening, diagnosis, treatment, and rehabilitation). Aung, Murry and Kayano [5] discussed the need for new research and ethical guidelines to harmonize research efforts in Health-EDRM and Kubo, Yanasan, Herbosa et al. [6] described the challenges in the standardization of health data collection throughout the research processes.

Existing surveillance databases, new study tools, and innovation methodologies may help to identify population health risks and support Health-EDRM policy development. Using a syndromic surveillance database in the Philippines, Salazar, Law, Winkler [7] showed how an existing clinical based database might be useful in assisting emergency health service planning decision making during outbreaks in armed conflict. Even with the database limitations to report injuries and death, this existing data system was nevertheless useful to support non-communicable diseases' service caseload planning. Using the computerized random digit dialling methods for rapid data collection after a major urban subway fire incident, Chan, Huang, Hung et al. [8] captured health risk perception, misconceptions, and community first-aid response knowledge in urban man-made emergency incidents. Using social media data from Twitter, Gruebner, Lowe, Sykora et al. [9] showed how the spatio-temporal distribution of negative emotions varied in New York City after a natural disaster. Their study showed that pre-disaster status could be used as a significant predictor of post-disaster emotional outcomes in communities. Using a disturbance management model to estimate logistics constraints in medical supplies during natural disasters, Shi and He [10] examined how medical supplies, which required cold-chain support (e.g., blood and vaccines), might be optimized after natural disasters when transport might be disturbed. Using a three-phase methodology and the online, global, and publicly available databases, Chan, Huang, Lam et al. [11] developed a health vulnerability index (HVI) that captures seven main health dimensions with nine indicators. This index allows the inclusion of non-communicable disease burden of countries/communities into the disaster risk assessment and may reflect underlying health needs and the capacity requirement to address Health-EDRM at the country level.

This Special Issue also presents studies that attempted to capture health consequences of less reported extreme events and identify at-risk communities. With the increased frequency of climate-induced disasters and weather events [12] , household preparedness is regarded as an important means of bottom-up resilience. Yet, limited research evidence is currently available to understand how climate events might affect megacities in Asia. Chan, Man, Lam et al.'s [13] paper of health risks and impact after the 2018 Super Typhoon Mangkhut in Hong Kong SAR China showed that education status, risk perception, routine household emergency preparedness, and previous experience of direct disaster impact are factors associated with the uptake of typical typhoon-specific preparedness measures (TSPM). Belleville, Ouellet, Morin [14] documented the post-traumatic stress symptoms reported and experienced by evacuees after the 2016 Fort McMurray wildfires in Canada. Their study findings showed that a significant proportion of the study participants reported post-traumatic stress symptoms that might warrant clinical attention and argued that the mental health at-risk population should be identified to protect psychosocial well-being after large-scale disaster events.

Translation of research evidence to programme and policy agenda has been a major constraint to ensure evidence-based practices. Genereux, Lafontaine and Eukelbosh [15] identified some key determinants that facilitate knowledge-to-action strategies for better community health risk preparedness. The team argued that blending traditional and modern approaches, fostering community engagement, cultivating relationships, investing in preparedness and recovery, putting knowledge into practice, and availability of human and financial resources are key successful factors for integrating expertise and research in disaster management practice. Yet, a lack of emergency preparedness often exacerbates the underlying community health risks in resource-deficit minority-based areas in times of crisis and emergencies. Ho, Chan, Lam et al. [16] showed indicators capturing perceived water security in the non-emergency/normal period might not be associated with Health-EDRM preparedness attitude and coping ability in a water-stressed rural context of PRC China. Chan, Lam, Lo et al. [17] showed food-labelling and perceptions of food-related health risk might be influenced by face-to-face health education interventions and should be considered as a core emergency preparedness and health risk reduction management strategy to strengthen bottom-up resilience in minority communities. Kamara, Akombi, Agho et al. [18] conducted a systematic review of resilience and well-being evidence in southern Africa and showed disaster risk reduction interventions that were based only on Western modelled or scientific warning systems might undervalue traditional warning insights and undermine intrinsic and community capacities. To strengthen resilience and well-being outcomes, efforts should be invested to ensure household, community/indigenous knowledge, and government-level capabilities are harnessed. Public health planning models might be instrumental in facilitating the planning for Health-EDRM-related risk reduction efforts in both emergency and non-emergency situations [19, 20] .

Perhaps one of the most important global health emergency incidents for 2020 would be the global response to COVID-2019 [21] . With their proposed influenza A simulation model that considered the three main routes of transmission-long-range airborne, fomites, and close contact-Zhang and Li [22] found in a non-clinical office setting that mask wearing and regular cleaning of high-touch surfaces were more useful than hand-washing for viral-related disease transmission control. Through their retrospective public health response policy analysis of SARS and MERS in South Korea, Lee and Jung [23] showed that legislation and leadership influenced the overall emergency response process and the establishment of intergovernmental response systems and the success of risk communications during infectious-related events. Meanwhile, although new technology platforms (e.g., smartphones and internet) had generated interests and showed promises in efficiency and speed in mass communication in emergencies and crises, community receptivity of communication channels might differ with the nature of the emergency events [24] . For major infectious disease-based event such as the H7N9 outbreak in 2014 in Hong Kong, Tam, Huang and Chan [19] showed traditional risk communication channels (television and telephone) might still be the preferred channels of the general public.

New scientific evidence will be generated from the research studies for the 2019 novel coronavirus global epidemic. Not only will such knowledge facilitate a better understanding of new emerging diseases, but also identify treatments, enable a better uptake of community health protection behaviours, examine the usefulness of modern public health measures, and evaluate the effectiveness of technology innovation in health protection; it will also serve to remind researchers, academic, and policy makers that the landscape of Health-EDRM-related research is constantly evolving with global crises and emergencies.

Chinese Public Attention to COVID-19 Epidemic: Based on Social Media,"Since the new coronavirus epidemic in China in December 2019, information and discussions about COVID-19 have spread rapidly on the Internet and have quickly become the focus of worldwide attention, especially on social media. and described the trend of public attention on COVID-19 epidemic-related topics. ROST CM6.0 (ROST Content Mining System Version 6.0) was used to analyze the collected text for word segmentation, word frequency, and sentiment analysis. We further described the hot topic keywords and sentiment trends of public attention. We used VOSviewer to implement a visual cluster analysis of hot keywords and build a social network of public opinion content.","Pneumonia caused by the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) is a new infectious disease that is mainly transmitted by respiratory droplets and contact and is generally infectious to human beings 1 . On January 11, 2020, after pathogenic nucleic acid testing (NAT), China reported 41 cases of pneumonia infected with the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) for the first time 2 , which was the world's first reported human infection with the novel coronavirus. On January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization listed the novel coronavirus epidemic as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) 3 . As of February 20, 2020, a total of 75,465 confirmed cases and 2,236 deaths have been reported in mainland China 4 . The novel coronavirus has caused great challenges and threats to public health in China and has quickly become the focus of worldwide attention. Information and discussions about COVID-19 have spread rapidly online, especially on social media.

To fight against COVID-19 and promote the prevention and control of the epidemic, researchers have recently made efforts in various aspects; their research involves epidemiological research 5, 6, 7 , diagnostic methods of the novel coronavirus 8, 9, 10, 11 , clinical characteristics of the disease 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 , characteristics of disease transmission 17, 18, 19 , development of candidate therapies 20, 21, 22 , the identification of animal hosts 23, 24, 25, 26 , etc. However, there has been no research conducted on the public's attention to COVID-19. Since public participation is required to prevent and control the epidemic spread of infectious diseases, it is extremely important to learn about the public's attention to COVID-19 during the current epidemic. Such knowledge is of great significance when guiding people to respond appropriately to the epidemic and helping them learn how to cope with the sudden infectious disease of COVID-19, and it also supports social stability 27 .

Social media has developed rapidly in recent years. Increasing numbers of public health departments and individuals are using social media platforms to communicate and share information during public health emergencies. Social media has become an important channel for promoting risk communication during the crisis 28, 29 . The use of social media to measure public attention has also been gradually applied to research on infectious diseases, such as H7N9 27, 30, 31 , Ebola 28, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36 , Zika virus 29, 37, 38 , MERS-CoV 39 , and Dengue fever 40 .

Sina Microblog (""Weibo"" for short) is one of the most popular social media platforms in China and is equivalent to Twitter within China. As of the fourth quarter of 2018, the number of monthly active users had reached 462 million, and approximately 200 million people are using Sina Microblog every day 41 . The Sina Microblog hot search list is the ranking of the most followed and hottest information on Sina Microblog and is the most popular functional module in Sina Microblog applications 42, 43 . This ranking is sorted according to the search volume of the hot topics that users searched for within a certain period. The higher the search volume is, the higher the ranking is, which directly reflects the public attention and attitude toward the topic. This paper studies public attention given to COVID-19 on Sina Microblog by searching for and analyzing topics related to the COVID-19 epidemic on the Sina Microblog hot search list from December 31, 2019, to February 20, 2020. This is the first time that a Chinese social media platform (i.e., Sina Microblog) has been used to study the public attention of COVID-19 44 . In this study, we describe the trend of public attention given to topics related to the COVID-19 epidemic and the hot topic keywords of public concern, we analyze the emotional tendencies and trends of hot topics related to the COVID-19 epidemic, and we conduct a visual cluster analysis of the hot topic content. This approach is used to obtain timely access to public responses so that the government and the health department can better communicate with the public on health issues and take appropriate measures to prevent and control the epidemic 35, 39 .

The research process mainly includes five steps: (1) collect topics related to the COVID-19 epidemic on the Sina Microblog hot search list, (2) segment the collected text into words, (3) describe the Sina Microblog search trend about the COVID-19 epidemic; (4) evaluate public opinion through word frequency and sentiment analysis; and (5) construct a social network of public opinion through the subject analysis of public opinion content. Each step is described in detail below.

We obtained information on the COVID-19 infection in mainland China from the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China (PRC NHC) 45 . The Wuhan Municipal Health Committee first reported viral pneumonia of unknown causes on December 31, 2019 46 . This study collected topics on the Sina Microblog hot search list from December 31, 2019, to February 20, 2020, using Weibo Search Rank 47 from ENLIGHTENT 48 , and selected topics and search volume related to the COVID-19 epidemic. A total of 4,056 topics related to the COVID-19 epidemic were on the hot search list, and 3,234 remained after excluding duplicate topics; this group was used as the data basis for further processing, analysis, and discussion.

The topics related to the COVID-19 epidemic on the Sina Microblog hot search list from December 31, 2019, to February 20, 2020, were summarized and classified daily in chronological order. We used the Chinese words segmentation function in ROST CM6.0 (ROST Content Mining System Version 6.0) to segment the content of hot-search topics on Sina Microblog into words 49 . After word segmentation, the text was processed by merging synonyms and deleting nonsense words to provide a basis for subsequent research.

We plotted the number of topics related to the COVID-19 epidemic on the Sina Microblog hot search list and the cumulative search volume by date to explore the public's attention given to the COVID-19 epidemic over time. Pearson correlation analysis was used to explore the relationship between the number of hot search topics related to the COVID-19 epidemic and the cumulative search volume.

After Chinese word segmentation and invalid word filtering, we used ROST CM6.0 software to perform word frequency statistics and sentiment analysis on the Sina Microblog hot topics related to the COVID-19 epidemic. We calculated the frequency of keywords appearing in the hot search topics on Sina Microblog, explored the sentiment tendency of each hot search topic to the COVID-19 epidemic, and calculated the emotional score.

The high-frequency keywords and their frequencies were extracted from the Sina Microblog hot topic text after word segmentation and invalid word filtering. We used VOSviewer software to create a visual knowledge map of keyword co-occurrence analysis and cluster analysis, using the keyword co-occurrence frequency as the weight 50 . In other words, the more topics are listed, the greater the cumulative search volume related to the COVID-19 epidemic per day. We can see that the public's attention to the COVID-19 epidemic on Sina Microblog can be divided into three stages. Stage A (December 31, 2019, to January 18, 2020) has low and unstable public attention, which represents the incubation period. Stage B (January 19 to 26, 2020) has a concentrated increase in public attention, which represents the epidemic period. Stage C (January 27 to February 20, 2020) demonstrates continued public attention to the epidemic, representing a widespread period.

The top 15 keywords and their frequencies for the three stages of the public's attention to the COVID-19 epidemic are shown in Table 3 . We can find that ""Wuhan"", ""case"" and ""pneumonia"" always appear in three periods as hot keywords, and the remaining keywords in the different periods are slightly different. In stage A, ""unknown cause"" and ""new coronavirus"" are the main keywords, indicating that in the initial stage of the epidemic, viral pneumonia had just been discovered, and the cause was unknown. After the pathogen was initially identified as a new coronavirus, the public began to search for information on new coronaviruses to learn relevant knowledge. Compared with stage A, stage B has new keywords such as ""new"", ""mask"", ""first case"", and ""first-level response"". The reason for this is that the COVID-19 epidemic had spread across the country during this stage. The first cases had appeared successively throughout the country, and the number of confirmed cases was increasing. The outbreak of the epidemic made the people and the government aware of the importance of prevention. People began to buy masks, and governments at all levels initiated first-level responses to major public health emergencies. Compared with the previous two stages, the main keywords appearing in stage C are ""discharged"", ""national"", ""materials"" and ""Huoshenshan Hospital"". At this stage, the public's attention had shifted to material donation and medical service assistance in the key epidemic areas in Wuhan. Moreover, the epidemic had spread throughout the country, and the public was more concerned about the rehabilitation of patients.

negative emotions are subdivided into three categories: general, moderate, and high. Neutral emotions are not subdivided. We found that the sentiment of the hot topics of the COVID-19 epidemic on Sina Microblog in stage A tended to be negative, accounting for 29.17%, of which high and moderate negative emotions accounted for 4.17% and 16.67%, respectively, and positive emotions accounted for the lowest proportion at 8.33%. In stage B, the majority of the hot search topics were neutral; however, 22.85% of the hot search topics showed negative emotions, with 0. We can see that the three kinds of emotions are relatively unstable before January 9, 2020. From January 9 to January 20, 2020, negative emotions accounted for the largest proportion, followed by neutral emotions, and positive emotions accounted for the smallest proportion.

This outcome shows that as the COVID-19 epidemic began to spread throughout the country after January 20, 2020, the public eased their concerns and fears caused by their uncertainty toward and ignorance of the epidemic and responded to the COVID-19 epidemic with a more objective attitude. 

To explore the themes reflected by the related topics of the COVID-19 epidemic on the Sina Microblog hot search list, this study used VOSviewer to generate clusters and co-occurrence networks of topic keywords. The results are shown in Figure 4 . In the figure, the larger the size of the nodes and the font, the greater the weight of the keyword is, and the more it is in the core position. The connection between the nodes indicates that the keywords on the two nodes have appeared together. The thicker the connection is, the higher the frequency of co-occurrence and the closer the connection between the nodes. Nodes with the same color belong to the same cluster.

The core topic of public concern about the COVID-19 epidemic is COVID-19 itself, and the public was extremely concerned about the status of the epidemic in Wuhan and the new cases. We can divide the high-frequency keywords of topics into the following five clusters:

Cluster 1 (Red Cluster): Discussion on the new cases, the outbreak of COVID-19 across the country and the impact of the epidemic on the resumption of school and work. The keywords included are ""case"", "" newly increased "", ""appear"", ""Hubei Province"", ""Beijing"", etc. (Figure 5a ). Cluster 2 (Green Cluster): Search for news reports on the frontline of the epidemic and related measures for prevention and control. The keywords include ""Wuhan"", ""front-line"", ""inpatient"", ""quarantine"", ""living at home"", etc. (Figure 5b author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

(Figure 5c ). Cluster 4 (Yellow Cluster): Search for frontline medical services such as frontline hospital construction and medical team support. This cluster includes the keywords ""patient"", ""hospital"", ""Leishenshan"", ""Huoshenshan"", ""first batch"", etc. (Figure 5d ).

Cluster 5 (Purple Cluster): Search for the global spread of the disease and searching online for fellow passengers with confirmed cases. This cluster contains the keywords ""passenger"", ""carriage"", ""cruise"", ""suspend"", ""infection"", ""Japan"", etc. (Figure 5e ). 

In recent years, as people increasingly seek health information on social media, social media has played an increasingly important role in public health emergencies 29, 35 . However, there have been no relevant studies that have incorporated social media analysis into the public response to the COVID-19 epidemic. We used the Sina Microblog hot search list to analyze the public's attention to the COVID-19 epidemic from December 31, 2019, to February 20, 2020, which was 52 days after the first disclosure of COVID-19 by the Chinese health department. There are four main findings from this study. First, we analyzed the changing trend of public attention given to the COVID-19 epidemic, which can be divided into three stages. Second, the hot topic keywords of the public's attention at each stage are slightly different. In addition, the public's emotional tendency toward the hot search topics related to the COVID-19 epidemic changed from negative to neutral across the study period. As a whole, negative emotions weakened, and positive emotions increased. Finally, we divided the topics of public concern about the COVID-19 epidemic into five categories through social semantic network analysis. This study analyzes the public's response to and attention given to the COVID-19 epidemic, which will help public health professionals monitor public response, identify public needs as early as possible, make timely public health prevention and control measures, and disseminate knowledge to citizens in a targeted manner to better respond to the current COVID-19 epidemic.

From December 31, 2019, to February 20, 2020, the public's attention given to the COVID-19 epidemic on Sina Microblog can be divided into three stages. In the beginning, there was little public attention paid to the epidemic, and then the .

concentration of attention increased. Next, the public's attention given to the epidemic generally declined, but continued attention was still paid. In the first stage (December 31, 2019, to January 18, 2020), the Chinese public paid less attention, as pneumonia was only reported in Wuhan, China. On January 19, 2020, suspected cases appeared in Shanghai and Shenzhen, and body temperatures began to be measured at the Wuhan Airport and Railway Station. People began to notice the severity of the epidemic, and the level of attention paid to the COVID-19 epidemic began to increase until January 26, 2020. We can see that when the epidemic began to spread across the country, the public responded quickly to news of the COVID-19 outbreak on Sina Microblog 39 . This is because COVID-19 is a new infectious disease, which means that no effective treatment has been found and no corresponding vaccine has been developed. When the outbreak began, the public was eager to search the relevant knowledge and information online to meet their own protection needs 27, 30 . In the third stage (January 27 to February 20, 2020), although the number of cases of COVID-19 was still increasing, the number of Sina Microblog topics and search volume was decreasing. The reason for this may be because the epidemic information was relatively saturated, and it was difficult for people to acquire more new knowledge through a Sina Microblog search 27 . It may also be that people are no longer paying close attention to the epidemic dynamic to gain a sense of security as time goes on, and the public's consciousness tends to be rational 51 .

The keywords for the three different stages of the public's attention to the COVID-19 epidemic are slightly different. From the hot search keywords of each stage, we found that the public did not know much about the virus and its causes in the first stage. The main keywords of the search to seek relevant knowledge were ""unknown cause"" and ""novel coronavirus"". During the second stage, the epidemic began to spread throughout the country, the first cases were reported in different areas successively, and the number of confirmed cases continued to increase, thereby making the public and government aware of the importance of prevention. During the third stage, the epidemic spread widely throughout the country; Wuhan was the most seriously affected area, and the city was locked down. The public's attention was mainly shifted to material donation and medical assistance in Wuhan. Compared with a qualitative research, it is more accurate to obtain the hot spots of public attention through keyword frequency analysis, as this process has higher accuracy and credibility in the research of hot spots and their development trends 40 . Based on our high-frequency keyword analysis of the Sina Microblog topics related to the COVID-19 epidemic, we can obtain information about the concerns and opinions of Sina Microblog users at different stages 52 . Studies have found that people's interest in infectious diseases on social media is linked to the latest news .

According to the sentiment tendencies of the hot search topics on the COVID-19 epidemic on Sina Microblog, the first stage of emotion was negative, and the second and third stages were neutral. On the whole, negative emotions weakened, and positive emotions increased. Previous studies have pointed out that there is also an important relationship between emotions and content on social media 53 . The content analysis of social networks can identify people's attitudes or reactions to specific health hazard events 30, 39 . In the first stage, there was less public attention given to the Sina Microblog hot search list. Most of the topics related to the COVID-19 epidemic were about the notification of pneumonia and the virus, and the emotions tended to be negative. At that time, the public had a strong demand for information on public health emergencies such as infectious diseases. When the information demand could not be fully satisfied, the users' emotions were negative 40 . As the epidemic progressed to the second and third stages, the public sentiment tended to be neutral because increasingly more news was reported at this stage, and objective events became the mainstream information on the Sina Microblog hot search list. The public reduced their previous levels of worries and fears about the epidemic; their negative feelings weakened, and their positive emotions increased. More hot search topics mentioned information about prevention or protection, which is conducive to public health communication and promotion.

We divided the COVID-19 topics with the highest levels of public concern into five categories: (1) new COVID-19 epidemics and their impact, (2) frontline reporting of the epidemic and prevention and control measures, (3) expert interpretation and discussion on the source of infection, (4) medical services on the frontline of the epidemic, and (5) focus on the global epidemic and look for suspected cases. From the search of the subject content, we can see that during the outbreak of the novel coronavirus, the public, the news media, and the health department all actively used Sina Microblog as a platform for disseminating COVID-19-related information 29 , indicating that Sina Microblog is a communication channel for both individuals or organizations to publicize COVID-19 symptoms, preventive measures and related policies 37 . In addition, as a real-time and extensive online platform, Sina Microblog provides a channel for information dissemination. For example, in this emergency outbreak, the public has made good use of the platform to find fellow passengers with confirmed cases, thereby playing an important role in preventing and controlling the disease transmission.

There are some limitations to this study. First, our study was limited to the period 52 days after COVID-19 was first disclosed by the Chinese health department; thus, the situation after February 20, 2020, was not included in this study. Second, the data source for this study is relatively narrow. We regard Sina Microblog as the only social media platform in China, excluding other popular social media data sources, such as WeChat and ByteDance, and the study is limited to the publicly available data on the Sina Microblog hot search list. In addition, due to the lack of detailed information about the users who contributed to the search volume of the Sina Microblog hot search list, we could not describe the social demographic information of the Sina Microblog users, and we failed to obtain the geospatial distribution of Sina Microblog active users; thus, we could not calculate the average attention of the public in different regions of China.

Our study found that social media platforms (i.e., Sina Microblog) can be used to measure public attention given to public health emergencies. Our study shows that a large amount of information about the COVID-19 epidemic was disseminated and received widespread public attention on Sina Microblog during the novel coronavirus epidemic. We have learned about the hotspots of public concern regarding the COVID-19 epidemic on Sina Microblog. These findings can help the government and health departments better communicate with the public about public health and then translate public health needs into practice to create targeted measures to prevent and control the spread of COVID-19.

ethical and Philosophical considerations for Gain-of-Function Policy: the importance of Alternate experiments The Department of Health and Human Services Framework for Guiding Funding Decisions about Proposed Research Involving Enhanced Potential Pandemic Pathogens,"PPPs) contains a series of principles for governing the funding and conduct of gain-offunction (GOF) research resulting in the creation of PPPs. In this article, I address one of these principles, governing the replacement of GOF research with alternate experiments. I argue that the principle fails to address the way that different experiments can promote the same values as those promoted by GOF research resulting in PPPs. I then address some objections to this claim, and provide policy recommendations moving forward.","Concerns over the accidental or deliberate release of novel pathogens has prompted a debate about the conduct or funding of biological research in the name of human health and security. Of particular concern is ""gain-of-function"" (GOF) research resulting in the creation of a ""potential pandemic pathogen (PPP)"" (GOF/PPP research) where, inter alia, the host range, virulence, or transmissibility of a pathogen is enhanced. For example, in 2011 researchers modified highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 to transmit via respiratory droplets in mammals (Herfst et al., 2012; Imai et al., 2012) .

The 2011 HPAI H5N1 studies, and indeed all GOF/PPP research, generate biosafety and biosecurity concerns. 1 Initial concern over the 2011 HPAI H5N1 studies focused on biosecurity: the risk of a deliberate release of an organism through, e.g., the use of a biological weapon (Evans, 2013) . This concern evolved to encompass biosafety concerns that an accidental release of recombinant influenza could cause a global pandemic (Lipsitch and Galvani, 2014; Lipsitch and Inglesby, 2014; Evans et al., 2015) .

In 2014, in response to these concerns, the US Government imposed a funding pause of GOF research involving influenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus, and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus (The White House, 2014). The pause was accompanied by a deliberative process undertaken by the US National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine (2016) , National Research Council Institute of Medicine (2015) , and National Science Advisory Board for Biosecurity (2016) to develop policy that managed the risks and Box 1 | Policy principles.

Agency review mechanisms pursuant to this recommended policy guidance should establish that a project involving the creation, transfer, or use of enhanced PPPs should satisfy the following principles, which are based on similar principles in the NSABB.

Recommendations:

3.1. The proposal or plan for such a project has been evaluated by an independent expert review process (whether internal or external) and has been determined to be scientifically sound. 3.2. The pathogen that is anticipated to be generated by the project must be reasonably judged to be a credible source of a potential future human pandemic. 3.3. An assessment of the overall potential risks and benefits associated with the project determines that the potential risks as compared to the potential benefits to society are justified. 3.4. There are no feasible, equally efficacious alternative methods to address the same question in a manner that poses less risk than does the proposed approach. 3.5. The investigator and the institution where the project would be carried out have the demonstrated capacity and commitment to conduct it safely and securely and have the ability to respond rapidly, mitigate potential risks and take corrective actions in response to laboratory accidents, lapses in protocol and procedures, and potential security breaches. 3.6. The project's results are anticipated to be responsibly communicated, in compliance with applicable laws, regulations, and policies, and any terms and conditions of funding, in order to realize their potential benefit. 3.7. The project will be supported through funding mechanisms that allow for appropriate management of risks and ongoing Federal and institutional oversight of all aspects of the research throughout the course of the project. 3.8. The project is ethically justifiable. Non-maleficence, beneficence, justice, respect for persons, scientific freedom, and responsible stewardship are among the ethical values that should be considered by a multidisciplinary review process making decisions about whether to fund research involving PPPs (Office of Science and Technology Policy, 2017). Pathogens, marking an end to the funding pause. A diagnostic for the success of this policy process, and indeed a mark of progress after 6 years of debate about GOF/PPP research 2 would be to ask ""does this policy adequately select between GOF/ PPP research that on balance advances scientific knowledge and human values, and research that poses unacceptable risks to human health and security?"" Here, I argue the answer to this question is ""no. "" The P3CO principles fail to select between GOF/ PPP experiments by failing to consider that alternative experiments may provide a superior expected net benefit. In doing so, the policy fails to account for a range of important opportunities to enhance the safety and security of the life sciences without unduly burdening researchers or policymakers, or sacrificing meaningful progress in the life sciences.

In what follows, I describe the P3CO principles and their relationship to GOF/PPP research. I then argue that the principle suggesting that GOF/PPP research is justified if ""no feasible, equally efficacious alternative methods to address the same question in a manner that poses less risk than does the proposed approach"" is inappropriately permissive. I consider a series of objections to my account, and argue that none are sufficiently strong to justify the principle as it stands. I conclude with an alternate framing of these principles in the context of the DHHS policy.

The P3CO principles echo the Recommendations' guidance on federal department pre-funding review and approval of GOF/ PPP research. These principles apply to ""Gain of Function Research of Concern"" (GOFROC): GOF research that is (1) highly transmissible and likely capable of wide and uncontrollable spread in human populations and (2) highly virulent and likely to cause significant morbidity and/or mortality in humans (National Science Advisory Board for Biosecurity, 2016). Recommendations, P3CO, and the DHHS policy note that all principles must be satisfied in order to pursue GOFROC. The document also suggests other risk mitigation strategies should biosafety and/or security issues arise post-funding, including measures should the final publication of results pose an information risk. I have discussed information risk posed by GOF/PPP research-of which I consider GOFROC a subset 3 -elsewhere (Evans, 2013; Evans and Selgelid, 2014) , and set this aside for the purpose of my analysis.

P3CO and the final HHS policy outline the following principles for the funding and conduct of GOFROC. First, GOFROC must be subject to independent review to determine it answers a scientifically sound question. While the NSABB intimated in their articulation of this principle that this review should ideally be supplemental to existing review mechanisms for funded research, the P3CO principles remain silent on whether existing grant review mechanisms (which presumably select for scientifically sound projects) satisfy this principle.

Second, pathogens anticipated to be created by projects subject to the policy must be a credible source of a potential future human pandemic. Moreover, the experiments must also be assessed to provide benefits that outweigh the risks of conducting GOFROC. These principles respond to general concern that some GOF/PPP research presents risks that ultimately outweigh its potential benefits. The 2011 HPAI H5N1 papers, for example, were published after the NSABB reviewed revised drafts of the papers, which defended the public health benefits of the research to respond to an emerging HPAI H5N1 pandemic (Enserink, 2012) . Interestingly, the language between Recommendations and P3CO changes significantly regarding the second principle above: the former requires that the pathogen be expected to ""arise through natural processes, "" while the latter merely requires a ""credible"" source, opening the possibility that GOFROC research might be funded to address human-engineered PPPs.

My analysis will focus on the fourth principle, which is that research should be funded only if ""there is no feasible, equally efficacious alternative method to address the same question in a manner that poses less risk than does the proposed [GOFROC] approach. "" The Recommendations add that Alternative approaches must be explored and critically examined before funding [GOFROC]… modifications of the experimental design, use of attenuated or other strains that pose fewer risks to humans, or different approaches with less risk that may provide the same or very similar information may be feasible. Lines of experimentation that entail less risk should be pursued whenever possible (National Science Advisory Board for Biosecurity, 2016, 45).

The next three principles are procedural components on GOFROC funding. First, researchers and their institutions must have sufficient capacity to mitigate the risks of the research. While paradigm cases of GOF/PPP research occurred within large and expensive, high-containment laboratories, the increasing power of the life scientists mean that resource constraints on GOF/PPP research will ease in the long term. The research must also be communicated in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, and ""supported through funding mechanisms that allow for appropriate management of risks and ongoing Federal and institutional oversight of all aspects of the research throughout the course of the project. "" That is, the funding mechanism under which these projects are conducted ought to be flexible enough to accommodate changes to methodology, or additional resource requirements for risk mitigation.

Finally, the principles require the project be ethically justifiable, citing ""values"" 4 such as non-maleficence, beneficence, justice, respect for persons, scientific freedom, and responsible stewardship. While P3CO does not articulate what these mean 4 I place values in quotes because it isn't immediately clear what kind of values these are. The first four are drawn from Beauchamp and Childress, who articulate them as mid-level principles that point at a range of fundamental values, but do not depend on our strict commitment to particular values for us to agree to their importance (Beauchamp and Childress, 2012) . For example, respect for persons is derived from a (primarily negative) conception of autonomy, that is, being able to pursuing one's own projects without interference by others. Scientific freedom, on the other hand, need not be a ""value"" per se, but may be valuable as a component of the right to freedom of speech (Evans, 2013) or freedom of inquiry (Miller and Selgelid, 2008) . I won't inquire more into these ethical principles, except to note that their status as values is subject to considerable debate. for the governance of GOFROC, the Recommendations reference an ethical white paper produced during the deliberative process (Selgelid, 2016) .

A critical question is what these principles might permit or exclude. The NSABB acknowledged some GOF/PPP research (or GOFROC) might be too risky to fund or conduct, but did not give a specific example of what such an experiment might entail (National Science Advisory Board for Biosecurity, 2016, p. 4). Bearing in mind that GOFROC must meet all of these criteria some research is clearly excluded from funding: research that does not ask a scientifically sound question, does not address a credible source of human pandemic, or whose expected benefits are clearly outweighed by its expected risk. Moreover, in cases where a researcher or institution is unable to comply with federal laws and regulations, or ensure a safe research environment in the context of GOFROC, funding ought not be given for such experiments.

When it comes to the fourth principle-that the research cannot be feasibly or efficaciously pursued through another methodology that answers the same scientific question-it isn't clear that any experiment would fail to satisfy this criterion. Methodologies in the life science closely track the organization of the field, its priorities, and the kinds of question that are asked. In a very simple sense, different methodologies, even if they create similar (or similarly valuable) knowledge, do not ask ""the same question. "" To change methodology is, in a very basic but important sense, to change the question.

This principle highlights, moreover, a strong division in the debate over GOF/PPP research. Advocates for GOF/PPP research have argued that GOF as a methodology has unique epistemic merits. While other experiments may allow us to demonstrate the potential for a pathogen to alter its host range or experience enhanced transmissibility or virulence, advocates maintain that only GOF can show us this is possible. As such, a change to an alternate methodology deprives us of the one methodological tool we have to conclusively prove that a (wild-type) virus can acquire the potential to cause a human pandemic (Casadevall et al., 2014) .

It is thus difficult to understand, then, what work is done by the fourth principle as it is written. One suggested case in which an alternate methodology might answer the same question would be one in which a specific part of a pathogen's structure altered to demonstrate a change in function. 5 Say, for example, we wanted to determine whether a virus with a substituted HA protein would bind to human receptors. It would be possible to answer this question using an attenuated virus rather than its wild-type progenitor. A more radical alternative might be cell-free study of single proteins-for example, H5 or H7 receptor binding to mammalian sialic acids-could take the place of GOF/PPP research with similar aims (Lipsitch and Galvani, 2014) and eliminate the need for a live virus (at least, in initial research). 6 This a rare example, however, and does not represent paradigm GOF/PPP studies studying which mutations in a viral genome are attributed to changes in phenotype under laboratory conditions. Alternate experiments to these GOF/PPP experiments may answer-related questions (Lipsitch and Galvani, 2014) and have considerable scientific and public health value, but do not answer precisely the same question. They are thus excluded as potential replacements for GOF/PPP studies under the new policy.

Yet the existence of alternate experiments, and the serious risks presented by some GOF/PPP research gives us a pro tanto justification for substituting experiments even if they do not ask the same question. This justification is particularly compelling if alternate experiments advance therapeutics development, disease surveillance, or public health response to emerging pandemics. Next, I'll consider three objections that might arise from those who may wish to retain the current formulation of the fourth principle.

Here, I outline four potential objections and respond to them. These are:

1. Assert the P3CO principles are appropriate in the context of existing scientific governance; 2. Beyond instrumental benefits, scientists should be free to choose which questions they ask; 3. Appeal to the NSABB Recommendations for guidance on ""same or similar"" questions; 4. Appropriately tailoring the risk-benefit difference in principle three will select against the right set of experiments.

I respond to these in turn.

One could contend these P3CO principles are appropriate in the context of existing scientific governance. That is, as long as the expected risk-benefit difference is positive (i.e., sufficiently in favor of benefit), the (scientifically meritorious) research ought to proceed. We ought not be in the business of guessing whether other questions might give equally valuable answers, or trying as policymakers to guess which scientific question is more worthy of pursuing.

Advocates typically justify GOF/PPP experiments on their role in achieving some other end, e.g., developing novel vaccines or therapeutics (Schultz-Cherry et al., 2014), or enhancing disease surveillance (Casadevall et al., 2014) . There is some value in GOF/ PPP research for its own sake, but this is the case for any scientifically meritorious question. Moreover, the value of preventing an accidental or deliberately caused disease pandemic arguably outweighs the mere value of scientific knowledge for its own sake. Advocates of GOF/PPP don't just leverage the instrumental value of these studies in their argument; they rely on them.

Yet funders prioritize those ends, and thus partly determine what scientific questions can be asked; we already do what advocates of GOF/PPP research deny. Allowing similar, but 6 Thanks to an anonymous reviewer for this suggestion. not identical questions to take the place of GOF/PPP research amounts a small change in degree from existing practice. Only occasionally is GOF/PPP research a unique means to medical and public health ends (Evans, 2014) ; other experiments may answer different scientific questions, but still answer questions that achieve the same ends as GOF/PPP research. The GOF benefit analysis conducted during the deliberative process demonstrated that only in 9 of 24 scientific and public health goals addressed for influenza was GOF/PPP uniquely useful; this number was only 3 in 13 for coronavirus (SARS and MERS) research (Gryphon Scientific, 2016, pp. 249-254) .

A proponent of GOF/PPP research might reply that what matters isn't (only) that we achieve our scientific or public health aims, but that scientists are also free to choose which questions they ask. Scientific freedom, after all, is not simply an efficient means to achieve material ends, but valuable for its own sake (Evans, 2013) . This response also fails: scientific freedom is important, but we already acknowledge limits on that freedom given certain risks to others (e.g., in human experimentation). Given that the set of experiments we can permissibly fund-and thus, the questions we ask-is already much smaller than the total set of scientific questions we have available to ask, it seems minimally invasive to ask that where possible, we pick from a set of related questions that accomplish our aims while entailing fewer, or less extreme, risks.

One might appeal to the Recommendations for guidance. In their fourth recommendation, the NSABB notes that review of GOFROC should include consideration of alternate methodologies that provide the ""same or very similar information"" at lower risk. This presumably a larger set than methodologies that strictly answer the same scientific question. How large a set this is, however, depends on what constitutes ""information"" in this sense, and what our basis for comparison determine similarity might be.

What might this conception of similarity look like? Consider an interesting piece of scientific knowledge such as ""the sequence changes required to confer mammalian transmissibility via respiratory droplets onto HPAI viruses (Watanabe et al., 2014) . "" GOF/PPP experiments, at least those that spurred the deliberative processes, ultimately provided one set of information that produces the kind of scientific knowledge we want. It did so, moreover, in a very specific way: by providing the exact sequence change required for specific isolates of HPAI. In the case of the 2011 experiments, these were sequence changes for influenza virus A/Indonesia/5/2005 (Herfst et al., 2012) , and six reassortant viruses from a library of reassortants from A/Vietnam/1203/2004 (H5N1) and A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (H1N1).

Critics have noted that while these experiments provide sequence changes required to confer mammalian transmissibility via respiratory droplets onto HPAI viruses, the sequence changes developed in laboratories may not be likely or even plausible in wild flu viruses (Enserink, 2011; Lipsitch and Galvani, 2014) . Other methodologies may provide likely sequence changes for a broader range of viruses, some (or more) of which are plausible in nature. This provides a similar kind of knowledge, albeit less precise (in the sense that it does not provide us with an exact sequence) but with a greater degree of generalization. Both give us our sought after knowledge in some sense of the initial parameters.

How we understand similarity depends, in part, on what kinds of knowledge we find valuable. Let us assume, plausibly, that the general scientific interest of each study is equal (though perhaps to different sets of scientists). Whether these two sets of experiment provide relevantly ""very similar"" information depends, again, on the relationship between our ends and the kinds of knowledge about which we are interested. If our interest is cataloging individual HPAI viruses for their capacity to undergo sustained transmission and are able to look for those specific sequences in nature, then GOF/PPP experiments occupy a fairly narrow space in which we could find other, similar experiments that generate similar information. If, however, we are interested in determining which kinds of sequence are most likely to appear in flu viruses in the wild, GOF/PPP experiments are arguably not unique and may even by counterproductive as a form of knowledge generation . How we define similarity depends on our ends; P3CO's reduction from similarity to identity commits us to valuing scientific information in a way we might otherwise not endorse.

While I have used the 2011 HPAI H5N1 studies in my argument, other experiments may have different goals for which GOF/PPP methodologies are more suited. Studies involving MERS coronavirus, for example, were allowed to continue after the initial pause because their aim was to develop an animal model for MERS in which to conduct experiments (Kaiser, 2014) . Arguably, GOF/PPP research in aid of this pursuit may contribute uniquely to the development of an animal model in MERS or be so efficacious a method as to outweigh potential risks.

Finally, one might respond that the most crucial aspect here is the risk-benefit difference in principle three. That is, one might argue that the primary principle on which we ought to judge GOF/PPP research is whether its expected benefits outweigh its expected risks. Moreover, if we set our threshold for acceptable risk correctly, we will exclude those experiments that are too risky relative to their expected benefits and default to other methodologies. This is promising insofar as it forces us to specify exactly how much our purported benefits must exceed potential risks in order to justify funding GOF/PPP experiments. Yet it elides the comparative nature of risk assessment. Decisions under conditions of risk are, and ought to be, comparative (see, e.g., Hansson, 2003) . Say we believe the right decision is one that maximizes the probability-weighted net benefits of our actions. And let us also say a GOF/PPP experiment might lead to the development of a novel vaccine: say, a 90% chance, and would save 10 million people; but also entails an independent nontrivial ""global catastrophic risk"" of 0.01% of a disease pandemic that kills 1 billion people. Our probability adjusted net benefit is thus 8.9 million people: we expect, all things considered, that many more people will be saved than die as a result of our experiment. Now imagine an alternate experiment called alt-GOF. This experiment has the same probability of causing benefit or harm, but the magnitude of the benefit and harms are 9.9 million and 10 million, respectively. Our expected value is now 8.909 million lives: about 9,090 more than the initial case. It isn't sufficient to say GOF leads to a positive net benefit. We have clear reason to prefer alt-GOF to GOF/PPP, regardless of whether or not it answers the exact same question. 7 Risk assessments ought to be understood as comparisons rather than absolute references (National Research Council Institute of Medicine, 2015) . It isn't sufficient to say we are justified in funding GOF/PPP research just in case its expected benefits outweigh its expected risks. Rather, we want to say GOF/PPP provides the most justifiable tradeoff between benefit and risk. What that tradeoff ought to be is unclear from the P3CO policy. Regardless of what criteria we use for decision-making under risk, our principles for governance ought to be comparative. Principle four undercuts this by precluding a large set of options from which comparison can follow.

In response to my argument, the following solutions could be implemented individually or in concert.

(1) Clarify principle four in broader terms. HHS and other agencies could release additional guidance that would clarify principle four to include considerations of a reasonable range of alternative experiments with independent scientific merit that promote the same aims as GOF/PPP research. A move away from the ""same question"" or ""very similar information"" to a broader conception of alternatives would develop the governance of this research in important ways, critically in forcing policymakers and scientists to specify what, exactly, they wish GOF/PPP research to accomplish.

This is a plausible in the context of section V of the current HHS policy, which claims that ""HHS will periodically re-evaluate and modify this review process, as necessary, to reflect scientific advances and changes to the regulatory landscape"" (Department of Health and Human Services, 2017). We could envisage such a review tackling, first, the question of alternate experiments and building on existing work [e.g., the risk and benefit assessment from the deliberative process (Gryphon Scientific, 2016) ] to develop specific guidance on alternate experiments that fulfill a range of scientific and public health aims.

(2) Introduce comparative subprinciples into principle three.

That is, rather than attempt to realign principle four with the above critiques, further incorporate comparative risk assessment into the third principle and its translation into actionable policy. By explicitly noting that risk assessments must be comparative over a range of plausible alternatives within the broader aims of the funded research, agencies can side-step potential issues with principle four.

This recommendation would be a plausible alternative to my first recommendation by incorporating the substance of my critique into principle three, rather than principle four. It would conceivably render principle four unnecessary. Rather, the risk assessment would be comparative and account for alternatives that produce valuable scientific information that is both similar to and as valuable as proposed GOF/PPP research, but may entail fewer serious risks. This could be accomplished without a specific policy change in the context of the HHS policy, instead built into future procedural elements of the review process that have yet to be described. The risk here is that excluding principle four as an explicit consideration reopens the possibility that alternates are never taken seriously; I acknowledge this, but note that my above suggestion, taken in good faith, makes this unlikely.

(3) Fund comparative assessments of scientific research and alternatives to GOF/PPP. Requiring a risk and benefit analysis as part of policy is itself challenging, and other policies on dual-use research of concern have been criticized by practitioners for requiring analysis that is beyond the skills of any institutional oversight body. Rather than require de novo analysis for each GOF/PPP experiment to arise, research on these experiments-using the risk and benefit analysis from the deliberative process as a template-could develop a hierarchy of comparatively low-, medium-, and high-risk experiments, and the conditions under which they are uniquely justified or overwhelmingly efficacious. A kind of ""GOF/PPP case law"" is itself a valuable addition to the life sciences, and an important policy innovation.

We already have some precedent for this in the form of those MERS studies that were reinstated after the initial pause. This kind of research arguably provides us with an important data point on what counts as efficacious and justified GOF/PPP research looks like. In contrast, research that created mammalian transmissible variants of a virus that has never been recorded in mammals (Sutton et al., 2014) is arguably a high-risk, unjustified form of GOF/PPP research.

The new GOF/PPP principles require further interpretation to become effective governance. In this article, I have argued that principle four, ""the research cannot be feasibly or efficaciously pursued through another methodology that answers the same scientific question, "" is overly permissive and have suggested reform for policymakers. The debate over GOF/PPP research is surely not over, and whether these changes are ultimately incorporated is a matter for future policy work.

Social media engagement analysis of U.S. Federal health agencies on Facebook,"Background: It is becoming increasingly common for individuals and organizations to use social media platforms such as Facebook. These are being used for a wide variety of purposes including disseminating, discussing and seeking health related information. U.S. Federal health agencies are leveraging these platforms to 'engage' social media users to read, spread, promote and encourage health related discussions. However, different agencies and their communications get varying levels of engagement. In this study we use statistical models to identify factors that associate with engagement. Methods: We analyze over 45,000 Facebook posts from 72 Facebook accounts belonging to 24 health agencies. Account usage, user activity, sentiment and content of these posts are studied. We use the hurdle regression model to identify factors associated with the level of engagement and Cox proportional hazards model to identify factors associated with duration of engagement. Results: In our analysis we find that agencies and accounts vary widely in their usage of social media and activity they generate. Statistical analysis shows, for instance, that Facebook posts with more visual cues such as photos or videos or those which express positive sentiment generate more engagement. We further find that posts on certain topics such as occupation or organizations negatively affect the duration of engagement. Conclusions: We present the first comprehensive analyses of engagement with U.S. Federal health agencies on Facebook. In addition, we briefly compare and contrast findings from this study to our earlier study with similar focus but on Twitter to show the robustness of our methods.","An increasing percentage of the population uses various social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, and Tumblr for reasons varying from casual conversations to debating social issues. Around 68% of U.S. adults use Facebook [1] which has over 180 million daily active users in the U.S. and Canada [2] who spend around 40 min per day on this medium [3] . A recent study by PricewaterhouseCoopers showed that in the United States, 24% of adults post about their health experiences on social media with 16% of them posting reviews of medications, treatments, doctors or health [4] . A survey on social media preference among medical students showed 77% of first year medical students and 80% of graduating medical students use Facebook and prefer online media as their primary source of information [5] .

Facebook, the most popular social networking website [1], has invigorated a wide range of health sciences studies. Facebook use for disease surveillance [6] or public health issues [7] [8] [9] shows its broad scope for improving public health. Researchers have also used Facebook to address specific health concerns. For example, studies have been conducted to assess Facebook's potential in engaging smokers in smoking cessation treatment [10] and to evaluate it's scope in recruitment and retention of young adult American veterans into an online alcohol intervention study [11] . While most Facebook based health studies focus on information dissemination to individual users, surprisingly few have focused on how health agencies are involved in Facebook based communications [12] [13] [14] . This paper addresses this gap.

We ask the general question: How can health agencies be more engaging on social media? We perceive 'engagement' as interactions designed to promote some common goal as seen for example in [15] . In the context of this study the interactions between the U.S. Federal health agencies and Facebook users are meant to promote better healthcare knowledge through successful information dissemination and consumption.

The importance of social media for communicating to a broad audience is well acknowledged in journalism [16] , politics [17] , marketing [18] , entertainment [19] , etc. Healthcare organizations such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) or Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have a crucial responsibility to inform the public of critical pandemic events like the spread of H1N1 [6, 20] or Coronavirus [21] and about drug recalls [22] and sexual health information [23] . Interestingly, while the two organizations differ significantly in the number of Facebook posts they are quite similar in the response (activity/post) generated. Like the CDC, the National Cancer Institute of National Institutes of Health (NIH) also has several thousand posts, but their response is quite low compared to the other two organizations. While it may be that the intent behind a post is to inform rather than to generate a response, differences in engagement are notable. We do not yet understand if there are factors associated with these differences. The nature of public engagement with an organization's messages is an active focus of research in health sciences and in marketing [24] . This is traditionally studied by surveys of healthinformation seekers [25, 26] . Studies on engagement can inform organizations about topics of public interest [27] or strategies to increase public reach [28] . In contrast to surveys, our study of engagement on social medial is 'observational' where we assess public activities in response to posts by U.S. Federal health agencies.

We address two specific questions with respect to Facebook posts from U.S. Federal health agencies and the responses they generate. First, which Facebook account and post features are associated with the level of engagement, i.e., level of public response in the form of Facebook activity (likes, shares, comments)? Second, which Facebook account and post features are associated with the interval length between an agency's Facebook post and the last activity it generates?

We analyze an almost comprehensive set of Facebook posts from 72 Facebook accounts of 24 U.S. Federal health agencies. We explore associations between various features and level of activity using hurdle models. We explore the features related to our second question using survival models. Features we examine include standard ones such as the number of page likes as well as less studied features relating to the semantic content of a post.

We selected health agencies through the Health and Human Services (HHS) Social Hub website [29] which lists all Facebook accounts affiliated to various U.S. Federal health agencies.

The Facebook Graph API [30] was used to collect all posts from an account's timeline as of late January 2013. For each post, we recorded its unique identifier, number of likes, shares, comments and other metadata as described below.

We included features that are generally used in Facebook-based studies [12, 31, 32] as well as those that are seldom considered (see Table 1 ).

The number of page likes shows the number of users endorsing an account. A page like is different from a post like which is considered an engagement activity. Users liking a page receive all posts from the account in their news feeds [33] . It seems reasonable to expect page likes to associate with engagement.

The Facebook Graph API provides information about the type of a particular post. Posts are classified into six selfexplanatory categories, namely link, music, photo, question, status (a post is an uncategorized status if it is simply textbased and does not belong to any of the other categories), and video/Adobe's ShockWave Flash format (SWF). 

We hypothesize that the sentiment of a Facebook post may be associated with engagement. Perhaps more positive sentiment is linked with greater activity, or maybe the reverse holds. We analyze sentiment using a state-of-the-art lexicon-based sentiment classifier, SentiStrength [34] . SentiStrength has been widely applied to social media postings [35] and has been shown to outperform other lexical classifiers [36] . SentiStrength classifies each Facebook post into positive and negative on a scale of +/−1 (neutral) to +/−5 (extreme).

One aspect of Facebook analysis that is often overlooked is post content. We hypothesize that some topics are more attractive to a wider group than others. For example, a post about information dissemination of the outbreak of West Nile virus (""West Nile virus is a potentially serious illness. What you need to know: http://go.usa.gov/r9g4"") generated far more activity compared to a job posting from U.S. Public Health Service Nurses (""National Park Service has a Registered Nurse Manager position open in Yosemite, CA. This position closes on November 19. If interested, please send a cover letter and CV to S**** C**** at email@nps.gov."").

We use the National Library of Medicine's Medical Text Indexer (MTI) [37] to assign Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) [38, 39] recommendations to each post. MTI is commonly used to recommend MeSH terms to titles and abstracts of biomedical literature and has been shown to be useful in other domains such as clinical text [40] . As an aside we show a novel application of MTI in the social media domain. The semantic types of the MeSH terms are mapped to the fifteen higher level semantic groups by the National Library of Medicine [41] . For example, the high level semantic group ""Disorders"" comprises of 12 semantic types, namely, Acquired Abnormality, Anatomical Abnormality, Cell or Molecular Dysfunction, Congenital Abnormality, Disease or Syndrome, Experimental Model of Disease, Finding, Injury or Poisoning, Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction, Neoplastic Process, Pathologic Function, and Sign or Symptom.

As shown later, around 20% of Facebook posts have zero activity (i.e. they receive no likes, shares or comments). This type of distribution of data where the variance (of activity count) is much greater than the mean implies overdispersed data [42] with zero-inflation [43] . Typically linear models such as Poisson or negative binomial regression are used to model count data. However the zero-inflation and overdispersion (p < 0.001) requires using two-part count data models such as the hurdle regression model [44] . Hurdle models have two separate components: a zero-portion used to fit the sizeable portion of zero counts in the data and a count-portion to fit the non-zero counts of the data. The zero-portion models whether a count is zero (no activity) or not using a binomial probability model. The count portion determines the conditional distribution of the non-zero counts using a zero-truncated negative binomial or Poisson model. Previous studies on social media engagement [10, [45] [46] [47] have shown the power of hurdle models for modeling data with similar characteristics.

We compared different count data regression models (namely, the Poisson, negative binomial, hurdle Poisson and hurdle negative binomial (HNB)) using standard goodness-of-fit measures. The HNB model had the lowest AIC value (297667.3) compared to the Poisson (1,443,334), negative binomial (304590.7) and hurdle Poisson (1,292,709) models, signifying a better fit. The Vuong statistics signifies that hurdle negative binomial model has a better fit compared to the other models. Our comparison of full and nested models such as hurdle negative binomial and negative binomial using the likelihood ratio test also indicates that the former model fits our data best. Variance inflation factor (VIF) yielded VIF scores for all independent variables in our regression analysis that were within the range of zero to five indicating no multicollinearity issues.

The temporal characteristics of a post are also of interest. We use methods from survival analysis [48] , the branch of statistics dedicated to modeling such temporal behavior. Similar to other social media based studies [49, 50] , we use the Cox proportional hazards regression model [51] , specifically, to predict how the different features (see Table 1 ) associate with the time duration between the Facebook post and the last activity in response.

Seventy two Facebook accounts corresponding to 24 health agencies were identified. Seventeen are NIH division such as NIH/NIDA, NIH/NIMH and NIH/ NICHD. Some agencies have quite a few accounts such as NIH/NLM (6 accounts: Women's_Health_Resources, NLM_4_Caregivers, etc.), CDC (10 accounts: CDC_Tobacco_Free, Health_Hazard_Evaluation_Program, etc.), OS (16 accounts: HealthCare.gov, Medi-cal_Reserve_Corps, etc.) while several others have just one account such as ACF, FDA, NIH/NCCAM, etc. Table 2 lists the various agencies, the number of accounts for each and of accounts.

As shown in Table 3 Table 4 shows the top 10 accounts ranked by activity per post. We note, for example, that one of the six NLM Facebook accounts is in the top 10 list. Let's Move affiliated to the Office of the Secretary has the highest activity per post (246.2) when excluding posts with no activity. CDC's official account, with the most number of posts (2867), also leads in total number of activities (285,347). (115,940) .

Post types Table 6 shows the various types of post as well as their counts. Links are the most common (28,830) while questions are the least common (74).

In Table 7 , we see that Facebook posts are generally positive (percentage of moderate to extreme positive is 61.89% while for negative this percentage is 47.04%). Modeling activity using hurdle model Table 9 presents results from the hurdle regression model. Regression coefficients in the zero-portion are exponentiated as odds ratios (OR) while the exponentiated regression coefficients in the count portion are treated as incident rate ratios (IRR) [52] . When we interpret the results of a particular variable we consider all other variables to remain constant.

The coefficients of the logit regression in the zero portion of the model indicate how the features relate to crossing the 'hurdle' of obtaining at least one activity (i.e. either a like, share or comment). 

We now analyze the coefficients of the negative binomial regression in the count portion of the hurdle model (Table 9 ). This allows us to focus on posts that cross the 'hurdle' of getting at least one activity.

Given a unit increase in the log-transformed count of page likes, the rate of activity is expected to increase by a factor of 6.033, while holding all other variable in the model constant. For sentiment, a unit increase in positive sentiment increases the rate of activity by a factor of 1.126 while a unit increase in negative sentiment decreases the rate of activity by a factor of 0.934, with all 

The median number of days between a date of posting and date of last activity is zero. Almost 80% of posts have their last activity on the same day as the post date, but there are posts garnering attention for months or even years. Regression coefficients from the Cox proportional hazards model are exponentiated as hazard ratios (HR) and used in the interpretation of the survival models. It is important to note here that a longer interval is desirable for the time to last activity. Thus features with negative coefficients are beneficial. Interpreting the coefficients is as follows. For continuous variables such as log-transformed counts of page likes, a unit increase in these values may change the time to last activity with all other variables remaining constant. For binary variables (each post type or each semantic group) the time to last activity may increase or decrease based on the presence of a feature compared to its absence in a post. In Table 10 we find that a unit increase in the number of log-transformed page likes increases the time to last activity by 34.6% with all other variables remaining constant. A unit increase in positive sentiment increases the time to last activity by 2.1% while a unit increase in negative sentiment has no significant association with the time to last activity. Of the various post types, the presence of photos or videos are both linked to an increase in the time to last activity. The other post types are not significantly associated with the time to last activity. Amongst the 15 semantic groups, only eight are significantly related to the time to last activity. Posts containing semantic groups ' Activities & Behavior' , 'Concepts & Ideas' , 'Genes & Molecular Sequences' , 'Phenomena' and 'Procedures' are positively related by 2.9, 2.3, 13.6, 6.5 and 2.7% respectively. 'Devices' , 'Organizations' and 'Occupations' are the only ones that decrease the time to last activity by 14.7, 4.3 and 5.6% respectively.

Our results show that there is considerable difference between levels of Facebook use and public engagement among organizations. OS and CDC have the most Facebook posts while NIH/NINDS and NIH/NIGMS have less than 200 posts. In terms of engagement, CDC with more than 7000 posts generates the most Facebook activity among agencies. Overall, less than 5% of Facebook posts get more than 100 total shares, likes or comments. We also found that an account's page likes have strong positive relationships with Facebook activity. This is in line with previous research where page likes have been used as proxy for engagement with specific health condition pages on Facebook [53] . While it is not an easy task for agencies to increase the number of users liking a page [54] , it is still an easy metric to follow. Results also show that the photos, videos or interactive links may increase the likelihood of getting [31, 55, 56] , which show that media content and links are key to engaging Facebook users. Quite surprisingly, questionrelated posts, which are typically posted to encourage public participation or interaction, are apparently not useful in engaging the public. As observed in previous research [31] , it can be argued that while questions might encourage user comments, they are unlikely to encourage likes or shares. Probably the organizations can look into more innovative ways to frame questions that would encourage user engagement. The presence of positive sentiment in posts from these government agencies is associated with higher activity. We speculate that positive posts generate greater readership and thus higher engagement compared to negative posts on Facebook, especially in the healthcare domain. This is in contrast to previous research, albeit in a different domain, which show that users participate more in discussions regarding problems or concerns in political posts with negative affect [57] . Semantic groups have not been previously studied in the context of Facebook activities. We found that posts about activities and behaviors, and phenomenon are positively associated with level of engagement. In contrast, posts about organizations and occupations tend to lower engagement. It may be that such posts are meant to be more informative than engaging.

With goals similar to this research (i.e. to identify factors associated with engagement), we previously published an article where we analyzed tweets from 130 U.S. Federal health agency Twitter accounts [47] . Nineteen out of the 24 Facebook agencies studied here also had accounts on Twitter. Here we compare and contrast the findings from our previous Twitter-based study to our findings from this study. Comparison of accounts from same agencies but across the two platforms shows that Twitter-based accounts post more than Facebook-based accounts. This is likely due of the relative simplicity of Twitter postings. However, Facebook posts on average get more likes, shares or comments than retweet for tweets. In fact, around 27% of Facebook posts get more than 15 total likes, shares and comments, compared to only 10% of tweets that get more than 15 retweets. Comparison of the results of the statistical models from the two platforms reveals many interesting findings. As in Facebook, the use of URLs in tweets translates to higher engagement. Interestingly, while positive sentiment in Facebook posts correlate to higher engagement, it has negative or no association with the level of engagement in Twitter. The reasons for this are not quite obvious and we would like to investigate this in future research. In terms of semantic categorization, we find that across both social media platforms posts about activities and behaviors, and phenomenon are positively associated with level of engagement. In contrast, posts about organizations and occupations tend to lower engagement across both platforms. Overall, we find our results to be consistent and our methods to be robust for engagement analysis on Facebook and Twitter.

Our research has a few limitations. First, the social media landscape is extremely dynamic. We captured the number of likes, shares and comments as well as the time to last activity of a Facebook post as a snapshot within this dynamic system. Hence the recorded numbers may have changed over time. While our longitudinal data analysis shows that for four out of five posts all activities are generated on the date of the posting itself, we cannot guarantee that a post won't gather any activity after months or years. This limitation, however, is bound to affect almost any social media based research conducted at a specific point in time and that uses these counts or similar ones as metrics. Second, our study focused only on U.S. Federal health agencies and thus our findings may not be generalizable to other organizations. While we find ample evidence where our findings mirror those of Facebook studies in other domains (as shown in the Discussion section), we would like to investigate the generalizability of our approach in future studies. Third, the intent behind a post is only known to a posting agency. It could be to encourage discussion or to disseminate information. Engagement may not always be the primary motivation of every post or every agency. Hence our results should not be interpreted as general performance metrics for these agencies. Finally, we studied a specific set of features and their correlation to the extent and duration of engagement. While we included many commonly used features as well as some novel ones in this study, there could be other features such as post frequency [58] or posting time [59] that also have correlation to engagement.

While some previous studies (referenced earlier) have focused on engagement of health departments at a local level, to the best of our knowledge, we present the first comprehensive analyses of engagement with U.S. Federal health agencies on Facebook. Examination of over 45,000 Facebook posts from 72 Facebook accounts belonging to 24 U.S. Federal health agencies reveals a wide range of activity across these accounts. We find that a very small fraction of the 45,000 posts get more than 100 likes, shares or comments, while one-fifth of posts see no activity at all. Content analyses of the posts show, for example, that the majority of posts contain links and are generally positive in sentiment. Statistical analyses show that the number of page likes of an account is associated with higher engagement. We also find that posts containing media or links and expressing positive sentiment correlate with higher or longer engagement. Depending on their goals and objectives, these findings may be used as recommendations by the U.S. Federal health agencies for communications on Facebook.

"Personal View Pathogens, prejudice, and politics: the role of the global health community in the European refugee crisis","Involuntary migration is a crucially important global challenge from an economic, social, and public health perspective. The number of displaced people reached an unprecedented level in 2015, at a total of 60 million worldwide, with more than 1 million crossing into Europe in the past year alone. Migrants and refugees are often perceived to carry a higher load of infectious diseases, despite no systematic association. We propose three important contributions that the global health community can make to help address infectious disease risks and global health inequalities worldwide, with a particular focus on the refugee crisis in Europe. First, policy decisions should be based on a sound evidence base regarding health risks and burdens to health systems, rather than prejudice or unfounded fears. Second, for incoming refugees, we must focus on building inclusive, cost-eff ective health services to promote collective health security. Finally, alongside protracted confl icts, widening of health and socioeconomic inequalities between high-income and lower-income countries should be acknowledged as major drivers for the global refugee crisis, and fully considered in planning long-term solutions.","The UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) stated that the number of displaced people globally rose by 16% between 2014 and 2015-the greatest ever increase in 1 year-reaching an all-time high of 60 million worldwide. 1 This fi gure includes about 38 million internally displaced people, 20 million refugees, and 2 million asylum seekers. Between January, 2015, and May, 2016, more than 1·2 million people have crossed the Mediterranean Sea to Europe, including economic migrants hoping for a better life and refugees fl eeing confl icts, political upheaval, ethnic discrimination, and religious persecution. The continuing swell of refugees worldwide is creating an ever-increasing economic and social burden on host countries and presents new public health challenges, alongside the deeper humanitarian and social issues. With such mass involuntary migration-and the associated overcrowding, poor sanitation, and restricted access to clean water-often comes a substantial increase in risk of infectious disease outbreaks, depending on the context. For example, after an offi cial declaration of cholera outbreaks in Iraq in September, 2015 , and with the continued degradation of health services and surveillance infrastructure in neighbouring Syria, the risk of disease contagion and large-scale outbreaks occurring in the wider region is increasing. 2 The overwhelming burden to host large populations of displaced people, and to manage potential infectious disease risks associated with their infl ux has, for decades, fallen on low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs). Between 2009 and 2013, for example, 86% of all refugees were hosted in LMICs, many of which already face a substantial infectious disease burden. 1 The number of refugees hosted by LMICs is more than fi ve times the number hosted by the ten richest countries in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD; fi gure). 3, 4 Turkey, Pakistan, Lebanon, and Iran together host a staggering 5·2 million refugees. 5 Political, infrastructural, and fi nancial constraints in LMICs have often been obstacles to pro viding access to health services and infectious disease screening programmes for the refugee populations. Constraints in the host countries have often had to be mitigated through support from UNHCR and other international organisations.

With refugees now being forced to migrate to highincome countries-most notably to Europe-the issue has rapidly risen up the global political agenda. The World Economic Forum now, unsurprisingly, ranks involuntary migration as one of the greatest risks to the world economy. 6 However, in some of these high-income countries, migrants and refugees have been coalesced into one emotive security issue, with the risk that policies ignore other softer, but equally important, issues such as collective health security, which can only be guaranteed by social integration and equitable access to health care.

After terrorist attacks in the past year in Turkey, Lebanon, France, and Belgium and media reports of sexual and physical assaults in Europe, there is a danger that exaggerated associations will be drawn between refugees, terrorism, and criminality. As a result, policies and interventions in high-income countries taking in refugees will be increasingly framed mainly in relation to risks to national security rather than equity and global health security. We propose three broad contributions that could be made by the global health community to help assess, better inform, and reduce potential infectious disease risks associated with incoming refugees, and improve social integration in relation to the refugee crisis in Europe.

First, we propose to ensure that evidence is obtained about the true infectious disease risks from refugees and the burden they cause to health systems to prevent prejudicial concerns and unfounded stigmatisation.

Many refugees come from areas with high poverty and weak health systems, and several European countries are concerned about refugees bringing previously controlled infections within their borders. The arduous journey that many refugees have endured might increase their risk of infectious diseases-particularly of measles and food and water-borne diseases to which they are at an increased risk if immunisation programmes were interrupted in their countries of origin. 7 However, despite the commonly held view of an association between migration and spread of infectious diseases, no systematic association has been shown with many of the infectious diseases of concern. For example, enteric fever is already reported in the European region with most cases occurring in returning travellers rather than refugees or migrants. Additionally, the risk of other infectious diseases, including viral haemorrhagic fevers or Middle East respiratory syndrome, is low with most cases occurring in health-care workers or travellers rather than refugees. 7 The threat of infectious disease outbreaks from population movements to Europe might thus be substantially less than perceived.

Any misinformation reported in the press and on social media exaggerating the health and infectious disease risks associated with incoming refugees must be fi rmly countered with epidemiological data and a pragmatic approach to disease control. The evidence must be clearly provided and understood by politicians and the general public. To generate a strong evidence base, a coordinated approach to health needs assessments and surveillance should be developed, leveraging institutional networks such as the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control and its links to reference laboratories and individual national public health agencies. Estimation of the infectious disease risk to Europe from cholera, for example, should take into account the well developed public water and sanitation systems, excellent health infrastructure, and well integrated and responsive disease surveillance networks, all of which substantially reduce the chances of large outbreaks of cholera. Accurate communication of infectious disease risk assessments to the general public and policy makers is thus key to rationalise the broader debate for this issue.

For example, concerns about transmission of polio from Syrian refugees into Europe after the 2013-14 outbreak of polio were unfounded. Although cases traceable to Syria were identifi ed in Iraq, 8 no cases were identifi ed in asymptomatic toddlers screened in Germany. 9 Yet, both the medical 10 and lay press coverage had extensively discussed the so-called polio threat in view of low vaccination rates in the UK and Germany. What these reports did not consider was the ability of the global system to respond appropriately. The global response in that instance was measured, and risk communication on the whole was eff ective, with WHO's Emergency Committee's declaration of a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. The declaration brought WHO's Global Polio Eradication Initiative together with diff erent organisations to complete several rounds of vaccinations in aff ected areas, and was eff ective at controlling the outbreak and minimising risk of spread.

Similarly, for tuberculosis, another infectious disease of concern, the potential for spread and disease progression will likely be reduced in the European population-compared with low-resource settingsowing to improved nutritional status and housing conditions. Most refugees entering Europe come from Syria, which had a tuberculosis prevalence of 23 people per 100 000 population in 2011, and 19 people per 100 000 population in 2014. 11, 12 Tuberculosis prevalence in Syria is thus lower than the average in the European region of 39 people per 100 000 population, 13 and substantially below many European countries (table). 3, 4 Furthermore, tuberculosis transmission from refugees to local populations does not occur often because of sparse contact. Early diagnosis and eff ective care of this disease will further minimise risk. Studies 14 completed in countries with low tuberculosis burden, such as Denmark, have indicated that trans mission from refugees to local populations is low, and that refugees are more likely to be infected with tuberculosis by local populations than vice versa. Thus, the evidence indicates that infectious disease risks to Europe are small. This risk level needs to be eff ectively communicated to both host communities and the incoming refugees.

Second, we strongly recommend that access to health care for all refugees and migrants is ensured through regular health checks for both communicable and noncommunicable diseases (NCDs); hospital and highquality health-care prevention and curative services are provided without discrimination on the basis of sex, age, religion, nationality, or ethnic origin; are cost-eff ective; and are culturally appropriate approaches, maintaining people's human rights and dignity. WHO emphasises that results of infection screening should not be a reason to deport a refugee. 7 Refugees have suff ered long and arduous stressful journeys, enduring cramped and unhygienic environments, which take a toll on their mental and physical health and existing NCDs. Many European countries, including the UK, request medical screening in the host country and then complete further screening of refugees on arrival, including targeted tuberculosis screening for those in the UK. 15 The USA has an established programme of mandatory screening of refugees both before departure and after arrival to establish immunisation status and the presence of parastic infections or other communicable diseases. 16, 17 A review 18 of the screening stratetgy after arrival of Iraqi refugees in the USA completed between 2008 and 2009 identifi ed a 14·1% prevalence of latent tuberculosis infection. Additionally, the review 18 noted that despite the traditional focus of refugee medical screening, morbidity due to NCDs was of higher prevelance. This observation is mirrored in other refugee populations from the Middle East, particularly in those of Syrian origin, in whom NCDs are more prevalent than infectious diseases. WHO does not recommend compulsory mass screening of refugee or migrant populations, although it does recommend health checks for both infectious diseases and NCDs and access to health services while maintaining the dignity of refugees and migrants. 19 No evidence shows that mass compulsory checks have a benefi t or are cost-eff ective. Furthermore, these checks have a possible risk of causing anxiety to individuals and deterring refugees and migrants from seeking health care if needed. 7 Screening programmes should be rationalised and prioritised for incoming refugees from settings with a large disease burden, for conditions which can be shown to have eff ective treatments, 20 rather than attempt to cover all arrivals particularly where local services are overwhelmed by volume. After arrival, screening and assessment of immunisation status might be particularly important to reduce the risk of outbreaks, especially if refugees originate from areas where vaccination programmes were interrupted.

Promotion of refugee access to appropriate and culturally acceptable health services, and encouragement of their integration is, we believe, fundamental to ensure Europe's collective health security. This aim can only be achieved if incoming refugees feel welcome and not the subject of stigmatisation or persecution. 7 Experience from around the world shows that many refugee groups-eg, Myanmar's Rohingya minority-have long been deprived of essential health care in their home countries, and arrive in host countries in extremely poor health. These poor baseline health conditions might be exacerbated by provision of inadequate health services at refugee reception or processing centres, which can thus become a risk to the collective health of host populations. For example, conditions in Australia's Nauru and Manus Island detention centres for off shore processing have resulted in outbreaks of infectious diseases. 21 By contrast, the strong system of vaccination surveillance in Germany identifi ed low measles immunisation in incoming refugees to Lower Saxony; measures are being taken to vaccinate arriving groups, illustrating how evidence can be used to reduce health inequalities in refugees and host communities. The European Vaccine Action Plan 2015-2020 22 details the importance of equitable access to vaccination and to encourage access for refugees and migrants with culturally appropriate services. 7 High-income countries have all the experience, knowledge, and resources to fi nd cost-eff ective solutions to health challenges that might arise from incoming refugees, as well as the institutional strength and innovative capacity to integrate and harness the potential socio economic benefi ts of these incoming groups. Innovative solutions to strengthen the control of infectious diseases in refugee populations could include mobile diagnostic and surveillance units similar to the Find and Treat service for tuberculosis for homeless and disadvantaged people in London. 23 These solutions could also include an integrated support function for psychosocial care and new public-private partnerships for health surveillance, delivery of messages about health promotion and phone-based incentives, and signposting of essential health services. Lessons could be learnt from the large US refugee resettlement programme 17, 24 and their electronic disease notifi cation system used since 2006, which has improved the timeliness and accuracy of infectious disease notifi cations. However, further studies should include economic analyses that account for longterm outcomes for conditions, such as latent tubterculosis infections, detected in incoming refugees. Sweden, where more than 100 000 refugees were taken in during 2015, is trialing creative approaches to integrate refugee communities, improve health literacy, and ensure adequate access to health services. Sweden has introduced many fast-track schemes to integrate refugees (particularly from Syria), who are already medically trained, into the labour market, thus addressing many diffi culties associated with staff shortages, language barriers, and cultural sensitivity. 25 However, for interventions to be eff ective, improved coordination and cooperation is needed by European countries. Additionally, there is a need for a more integrated and well managed role for humanitarian nongovernmental organisations to provide services for refugees in the absence of adequate provision by government and local authority agencies. In 2015, an important step was taken in this direction with the publication of a joint statement-by European countries, the European Commission, and WHO-addressing the health needs of incoming refugees to Europe 26 and the development of a patient health record that will be piloted at borders to evaluate refugees' medical needs and to reconstruct their medical history. 27 A joint technical statement by UNHCR, WHO, and UNICEF on vaccination for refugees entering Europe provides further support to harmonise and develop consistent standards in the continent. These eff orts are important and build on the continuing work of WHO's Europe Public Health Aspects of Migration in Europe project, 28 which has developed both evidence-based guidance and a series of tools to assist countries to assess and address the health needs of migrant and refugee populations. Unfortunately, the eff ectiveness of these initiatives continues to be limited by the insuffi cient fi nancial and political commitment to improve cross-border coordination for the health needs of refugees.

Finally, political leaders need to understand and acknowledge that alongside confl ict and violence, widening socioeconomic and health inequalities (ie, the broader determinants of health) between and in countries is one principal driver of refugee migration. Development initiatives must therefore focus on improvements to health systems, transparency, governance, and political stability in the countries from which refugees derive. The 2015 EU agreement 29 to provide US$1·9 billion to address the drivers of outward migration from Africa implied some recognition of these drivers of migration. Hopefully, some of that fund could be used to support more equitable structuring of economic and commercial agreements between LMICs and high-income countries, and a more equal sharing of profi ts. Turkey has now been promised an additional $3·2 billion to stem the outward fl ow of refugees to Europe, but these funds are being directed more at border security and have not been suffi ciently aimed at addressing this underlying driver of health and socioeconomic inequalities experienced by refugees in unstable environments. 30 Leaders in European countries and other destination regions for refugees need to develop an improved awareness and understanding of this driver and resist measures that compound inequalities both abroad and at home. The 2015 UK Department of Health's consultation on extending charges to visitors, refugees, and migrants and accessing primary and secondary care services in the UK, done with little public or professional engagement, 31 highlights some of the prevailing attitudes developing in Europe that threaten collective health security. This consultation seems to show a continuing erosion of the founding principles of the UK National Health Service, framed about reducing inequalities through universal health coverage, free at the point of access. If implemented as planned, the recommended measures 31 will likely lead to late diagnosis of medical conditions, including of infectious diseases (although these are exempt from further charges once a diagnosis has been made), and worse health outcomes for refugees and migrants because the poorest groups delay accessing services to restrict outgoing costs.

In summary, one fundamental, long-term possible solution to the refugee crisis, and the associated potential infectious disease challenges for countries receiving refugees, is for more economically fortunate countries to increase eff orts to reduce the health and socioeconomic inequalities driving populations to become refugees. However, to ensure collective health security and prevent disease outbreaks in countries receiving refugee populations, a short-term solution must be to better engage with those who have already arrived and with those who will continue to arrive in the foreseeable future. Measures to address health inequalities, through improved disease risk assessment, better health-care access, and a more culturally sensitive health service support both refugee integration and help to reduce threats from infectious diseases. Such measures must be viewed as a key component in any broader security strategy.

The Aliens Order of 1920 barred entry of immigrants with a range of medical conditions to the UK. 32 This order was reversed during the World Refugee Year (1959-60), and allowed entry of refugees who had tuberculosis and other chronic illnesses. 33 In view of the overall number of refugees worldwide consistently increasing in recent years, we now have an even greater collective responsibility to help address the current crisis. The refugee situation is not, however, all doom and gloom. Many have readily engaged with and are actively contributing to improve the lives of displaced populations. 34, 35 These many individuals and host communities reaffi rm a shared humanity and demonstrate a commitment to a more equal world.

Personal View Towards a conceptual framework to support one-health research for policy on emerging zoonoses,"In the past two decades there has been a growing realisation that the livestock sector was in a process of change, resulting from an expansion of intensive animal production systems and trade to meet a globalised world's increasing demand for livestock products. One unintended consequence has been the emergence and spread of transboundary animal diseases and, more specifi cally, the resurgence and emergence of zoonotic diseases. Concurrent with changes in the livestock sector, contact with wildlife has increased. This development has increased the risk of transmission of infections from wildlife to human beings and livestock. Two overarching questions arise with respect to the real and perceived threat from emerging infectious diseases: why are these problems arising with increasing frequency, and how should we manage and control them? A clear conceptual research framework can provide a guide to ensure a research strategy that coherently links to the overarching goals of policy makers. We propose such a new framework in support of a research and policy-generation strategy to help to address the challenges posed by emerging zoonoses.","Nearly two-thirds of human pathogens are zoonotic and, of greater concern, nearly three-quarters of emerging and re-emerging diseases of human beings are zoonoses. 1 Emerging diseases include avian infl uenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), West Nile virus, Nipah virus, and bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), which have all received substantial media attention and, in the cases of avian infl uenza and pandemic infl uenza A H1N1, many resources.

New infectious diseases emerge because of a complex set of multifactorial circumstances that include population growth, changes in nutritional, agricultural, and trade practices, and shifts in land use including accelerated urbanisation, deforestation, and encroachment on wildlife. [2] [3] [4] [5] Additionally, ancient zoonotic diseases such as rabies, anthrax, brucellosis, bovine tuberculosis, zoonotic trypanosomiasis, and disorders associated with tapeworm infections are re-emerging because of a combination of similar factors, including transmission of pathogens from wildlife to domestic reservoir species. 3, 6, 7 Increased complexity in food chains and diff erent systems of food production and preparation are also leading to rising importance of food-borne zoonoses such as salmonella, campylobacter, and Escherichia coli infections, which are all linked to livestock production and processing systems. 8 How climate change will aff ect this complex dynamic mix of factors is unclear, but it is expected to aff ect the range, distribution, and diversity of pathogens, and possibly the associated morbidity. 9, 10 Two overarching questions arise from these observations. Why are these problems arising with increasing frequency? 11 And how should we be riskmanaging and controlling them? We outline some of the important changes in livestock systems and their eff ect on infectious diseases and describe a conceptual framework for a systematic approach to guide so-called one-health research and to aid policy formulation. We use the term one-health to denote the collaborative eff ort of many disciplines-working locally, nationally, and globally-to attain optimum health of human beings, animals, and our environment. 12 Background During the 1990s, there was a growing realisation that the livestock sector was undergoing a so-called livestock revolution. 13 This event was probably the second major livestock revolution, the fi rst occurring during the 19th century as European populations grew and became increasingly urbanised. The fi rst revolution largely aff ected ruminants and caused various livestock disease problems that were, especially in developed countries, controlled through creation of veterinary services, investment in research, and education systems. 8 The benefi ts from these investments were felt in the control of several livestock diseases and in human health. 14, 15 There were also advances in livestock production methods and marketing systems that helped to feed a growing urban population. However, this fi rst revolution also created major zoonotic problems, such as bovine tuberculosis and brucellosis, that were left unattended for decades. By the time they were controlled in livestock populations, these diseases had caused large-scale human morbidity and mortality. [16] [17] [18] The second livestock revolution that probably began in the 1980s originated from the rapid expansion of intensive pig and poultry production systems and, to some extent, from a growth in milk production. It was facilitated by the availability of antimicrobial and antiparasitic treatments used for preventive purposes to allow high densities of animals to be kept under suboptimum husbandry conditions. Research into pig and poultry production systems has changed breeding, feeding, and management systems, leading to improvements in overall productivity and standardisation of products. These profound changes in livestock production have been broadly welcomed because they have met the Personal View growing demand for livestock products. Initially, there were some concerns about poor livestock producers being left behind, [19] [20] [21] [22] and the potential negative eff ects on the environment. 23, 24 What was less expected were the increased problems associated with control of animal diseases that cross international borders and the resurgence, and in some cases emergence, of zoonotic diseases. Additionally, the emergence of antimicrobial resistance has led to demands to reduce or to avoid the use of antimicrobial preventive treatment in animal production. 25 The second livestock revolution has been concurrent with increased contact between wildlife and both livestock and people. This change has resulted from increased settlement or farming in wildlife habitats, wildlife farming, increasing diversity of animals kept as pets, and the increase of tourism in remote areas. 3, 5 Increased contact has heightened the risk of transmission of infections from wildlife to human beings and livestock. Reviews suggest that many emerging human pathogens have originated from wildlife, and that livestock intensifi cation probably exacerbates the emergence of zoonotic diseases by amplifi cation, irrespective of whether the infection source is livestock or wildlife. 11, 26 Throughout human history, populations everywhere have encountered new and resurgent communicable diseases. 27 But, despite this history, human beings have at times been optimistic in their perceptions. Famously, in 1948, US Secretary of State George Marshall proclaimed that the conquest of all infectious diseases was imminent. 28 It has been widely said that, in 1969, US Surgeon General William H Stewart expressed his confi dence that we had reached the frontiers of communicable diseases; although this is now dismissed as urban myth, other notable examples exist from the 1960s and 1970s of world leaders in the fi eld proclaiming that infectious diseases had been conquered. 29 Since then, the number and novelty of crises associated with communicable diseases have surprised researchers, practitioners, and policy makers. And the global reach and speed of spread has challenged public health systems in ways unimagined.

At least three important lessons can be drawn from past experience with emerging zoonotic diseases. First, that progress in public health and communicable diseases is not irreversible. Second, that more of the same tactics that have emerged in the modern era to control the emergence of new diseases in animals and human beings, and their vectors, will probably be insuffi cient to control future threats. Third, that a changing and increasingly interconnected world means changes in ecosystems that off er unpredictable opportunities to microbes that are more varied, numerous, and adaptable than we had once hoped, with spread occurring more rapidly. Experience in the past decade with, for example, Ebola, Nipah virus, avian infl uenza A H5N1, infl uenza A H1N1 2009, and SARS in 2002 are illustrative of new agents and zoonotic diseases associated with livestock or wild animals that are now burdening human public health systems on an international scale.

Despite the profound animal and human health and economic consequences of zoonotic diseases, until recently they have tended to be neglected. Shaw identifi ed four reasons for this neglect. 7 First, veterinary services had been given responsibility for control of these diseases, but had neither the farm-level economic incentives nor the societal resource allocation to fulfi l this role. Second, zoonoses in both human beings and animals are generally underdiagnosed. Third, zoonoses tend to aff ect rural, often poor, people with poor access to health services. Fourth, mechanisms to control and to restrict food-borne diseases are diffi cult and complex.

We might add to this list several additional reasons: including the challenges of interdisciplinary collaboration (be it research, policy, or practice); the complex intersectoral institutional environment within which animal and human health systems operate at global, regional, national, and local levels; and the upstream nature of prevention activities and their temporal and causal distance from human consequences. To deal with this complexity requires a conceptualisation of these systems that support a visualisation of the interfaces of animal and human health, which we attempt to address. Without a common conceptualisation of the systems across which animals and human beings encounter each other, questions and challenges sit in disciplinary isolation. Moreover, strategic responses to problems risk being merely disconnected activities.

Our goal is to defi ne health system research of policy relevance that provides a holistic systems approach that is needed for one-health.

The Democratic Republic of the Congo is subject to several emerging infectious diseases. One that results in substantial social disruption and high mortality is Ebola. The country has had fi ve Ebola outbreaks since the fi rst epidemic took place in Yambuku in 1976. The fourth and fi fth outbreaks took place in Mweka in 2008 and 2009.

The origins of the Ebola virus are diffi cult to establish, and prediction of where and when outbreaks are likely to occur is a challenge; therefore research into inputs might off er important strategic policy responses. Interventions to control outbreaks typically include early detection and rapid response including supportive clinical care and mass education. Research into specifi c pharmaceutical interventions is needed. Although the Mweka outbreak started in April, 2008, case confi rmation did not occur until September, 2009. These health system delays, which were the result of inadequate mechanisms to deliver interventions, resulted in poor control for many months. 165 people died. Ineff ective communication, poor stewardship, and insuffi cient resources contributed to delays in control. Research questions remain around which elements of the health system need to be strengthened to best support the management of such sporadic outbreaks, while the general health system is maintained and developed.

Overall, zoonotic and food-borne diseases have an eff ect across society, with everyone sharing some burden. As in the period of the 19th century when many veterinary and human health systems were initiated, there is a need to re-examine how existing systems are structured, resourced, and managed to create synergies between animal and human health and in the process reduce the eff ect of zoonotic disease burdens. This process requires an evidence base to eff ectively, systematically, and strategically inform policy developments.

Advances in public health, veterinary, and human medicine off er benefi ts, but only respond to part of the struggle that we face. Many stakeholders have important roles in researching, planning, and implementing eff orts to prevent, contain, and mitigate emerging infectious diseases at levels that stretch from the community to worldwide. These people work in many sectors and are involved in responding to the challenge as a primary aim, a secondary aim, or as a byproduct. They include, for example, wildlife management, farming and agriculture, veterinary medicine, the pharmaceutical industry, human public health, non-governmental organisations, the donor community, ministerial policy makers, and UN agencies, to name but a few. Moreover, many academic disciplines contribute essential knowledge (eg, climatologists, plant scientists, molecular biologists, economists, political scientists). One's understanding depends on paradigmatic and disciplinary perspective. We need an overarching or grand narrative to link all the sectors and stakeholders, and we need this narrative to have a framework.

Some of the questions that one might pose about the emergence of the global pandemic of infl uenza A H1N1 2009 illustrate aspects of this intersectoral, interdisciplinary complexity. For example, what upstream economic drivers contributed to the probable emergence of reassortment in hosts? How did globalisation contribute to the emergence and spread of H1N1? How has H1N1 contributed to ensuring that institutional relationships are constructive, eff ective, and effi cient in response to the threat of an infl uenza pandemic? How has the industrialisation of food production aff ected the risk of another pandemic? Are the International Health Regulations of WHO and the International Animal Health Codes of the World Organisation for Animal Health suffi ciently robust and aligned with each other to support global public health? What virological characteristics allow the virus to jump between species or person-to-person transmission? And how do characteristics of production systems or use of interventions such as vaccines infl uence these? What elements of veterinary and human health systems are crucially important in prevention of and response to pandemics?

Priority setting, whether research, policy, or implementation, should be based on a fi rm conceptual grounding with an understanding of the goals (whether

Rift Valley fever, an episodic vector-borne viral disease aff ecting domestic and wild animals as well as human beings, was fi rst reported in Tanzania in 1956. The disease re-emerged in the country in 1977, and between December, 1997, and April, 1998, an epidemic occurred that is believed to have been caused by unusually large rainfall, the result of El Niño, and subsequent expansion of the mosquito vector population.

A similar epidemic occurred in 2007. Is climate change an important input factor in the emergence of Rift Valley fever, and can interventions such as improved predictive surveillance linked to climate change or rainfall be harnessed to predict future epidemics? Although substantial delays occurred, in part because mechanisms to support interventions, including fi nancing and logistics of laboratory testing of samples, control of the 2007 epidemic was largely the result of animal and human health agencies working in an integrated manner. Indeed, the outbreak was classifi ed as a national disaster, thus falling under the authority of the National Disaster Preparedness and Response Unit, which involved several government departments and reported directly to the Prime Minister. Disease management units at local level were also established to support control measures across both human and animal populations. Questions remain about which elements of the health systems need to be integrated, and to what extent, to achieve policy goals that include human health protection and economic security, as well as ecological diversity. Furthermore, the response was in part dependent on a favourable and energised political context. Whether this factor is a prerequisite for eff ective control is unknown. Another question is how best to harness political support such that prevention through the targeted vaccination of at-risk livestock occurs before detection of clinical disease in animals or human beings.

From 2003, the re-emergence of the infl uenza A H5N1 virus in poultry and sporadically in people has emphasised the need for a comprehensive public health response integrating elements of both animal and human sectors. Since 2004, Cambodia has had 21 poultry outbreaks resulting in nine human cases including seven deaths. Backyard poultry production is widespread throughout the country and accounts for more than 90% of the poultry population. Spread of H5N1 infl uenza overall is driven by trade links with Vietnam in the southern parts of the country, where there is a much higher density of poultry.

Control of infl uenza A H5N1 is fairly well integrated across animal and human health systems at various levels, from surveillance to response coordination. For example, the Cambodian Communicable Disease Control Department hotlines can be accessed nationally and are often used by villagers to report poultry outbreaks. However, delays in reporting occur 31-33 as a result of inadequate fi nancial reimbursement for culled poultry, an intervention that has complex and ill-understood cultural as well as economic implications. Unlike neighbouring Vietnam, which has a similar domestic poultry economy, Cambodia has not adopted a poultry vaccination campaign. Contextual factors including the dominance of international donor agencies and concerns from the international community and Cambodia's neighbour, Thailand, which has a large export market, are important considerations that could be explored through policy analysis. Also, this disease response is driven by the perceived risk of an infl uenza pandemic and its associated costs to Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries, whereas it is ranked much lower among poultry smallholders in Cambodia. The short-term and long-term economic consequences of interventions, whether they be vaccination or culling, remain to be established. This information is likely to be important for evidence-based policy making.

public health, economic security, or social stability), the scale of the threat, the feasibility of the task in hand, and the likelihood of success, and with a timeline that is appropriate. The public health goal, as with other goals, is informed by sociopolitical principles including equity, sustainability, effi ciency, quality, and choice. 30 The research agenda will be informed by researchers and others advocating for their particular disciplinary interests. Ultimately, however, decisions on funding and the allocation of resources are political. But they should, and can, be informed by a clear conceptual framework.

The framework that we propose draws on analysis of human and animal health systems during recent years. We illustrate this conceptual framework with case notes from three countries and three zoonoses to draw attention to diff erent elements of the framework (panels 1-3) .

The diffi cult and challenging task of understanding of complexity requires a nuanced framework for research, which acknowledges that technical, economic, policy, and systems paradigms contribute to knowledge, albeit addressing diff erent types of to some extent overlapping research questions. Thus, in the context of research done to support policy, the fi gure shows in an abstract way the links between possible areas of intervention, and identifi es possible areas in which research might be valued by those charged with policy making and eff ective practice implementation. Research questions could be formulated at any or several intersections shown in the fi gure in which knowledge gaps exist to arrive at a coherent and systematically determined set of interdisciplinary research questions that could inform an overarching policy goal.

The proposed framework builds on the work of Pawson and Tilley, 34 who suggested fi ve elements or components that can enable researchers to see the links between their research endeavours and others to support the achievement of a policy goal-context, input, intervention, mechanisms, and outputs.

The context is the the political, legislative, cultural, economic, and technological environment within which programmes responding to emerging infectious diseases sit. Context is also the ecological environment-for instance, changing land uses, the eff ect of climate change, or changes in water management. The context, global or local, can aff ect policy and practice or be aff ected by them. Research questions are defi ned accordingly. For example, do the International Health Regulations support or hinder Indonesia's eff orts to protect global public health? Does Thailand's contribution to the global trade in industrially produced poultry threaten its public health? Is the poultry vaccination policy in Vietnam infl uenced by its trading relationship with China? What factors infl uence policy on beef exports from southern Africa and how do concerns in relation to foot-and-mouth disease aff ect policy? 

Likewise, sectors with primary functions other than health are included in context. Questions might relate to the media, telecommunications, education, criminal justice, and trade agreements. Which public health messages, and through which media channels, are best delivered to rural and urban populations in Tanzania? Does legal trade in exotic animals increase the risk of the emergence of novel infectious diseases?

Input refers to infection and the characteristics or microorganisms and disease. Input might be aff ected by upstream threats such as the emergence of novel strains of infl uenza A in animals, or questions related to transmission between individuals. For example, what are the genetic markers that confer ability in microorganisms to jump between species? What are the ecological driving forces that encourage genetic shift? What is the immunological mechanisms that make strains of microorganism highly pathogenic?

Interventions are the actions intended to serve public health (or other policy goal such as economic security or stability in the event of a pandemic). In the case of infl uenza A H5N1, these interventions might include culling or vaccination of poultry, vaccination of the human population with prepandemic vaccines, treatment (or prophylaxis) with antiviral drugs, ventilation of patients with severe disease, and social distancing. There are several questions related to interventions. What is the best combination of interventions to achieve the greatest public health benefi t (or economic benefi t)? Or does vaccination of poultry eff ectively reduce transmission of infl uenza A H5N1? Will poultry vaccination applied at insuffi cient coverage result in increased selection pressure for new and resistant strains? Or is treatment with one antiviral drug suffi cient to prevent development of resistance?

To the frustration of practitioners, policy makers, and health systems and health services researchers, research about how interventions shown to be useful (in clinical trials, for example) are best introduced receives little attention: 0·5% of research funding from the Wellcome Trust and 1·6% of the UK's Medical Research Council's funding was dedicated to health services or systems research in 2006. 35 However, the mechanisms by which interventions are delivered and the components of a programme needed to function eff ectively are important if policy goals are to be achieved.

Research analysing these mechanisms or functions, their interaction within human health systems, and, importantly, their interaction with animal health systems, off ers the potential to gain insights into the strengths and gaps in the eff ective and effi cient implementation of interventions. Questions relate to governance, planning, fi nancing and payment, information systems for monitoring, and evaluation and surveillance in relation, for example, to service responses to infl uenza A H5N1 in poultry or human clusters. A potentially important but neglected area of research should study how human and animal health-system resources can be mobilised both to support their primary function and to secure potential gains in integrating defi ned elements of these systems.

The fi fth element of the conceptual framework relates to outputs-the proximal consequences produced by programmes. Typically, outputs are the amount, quality, or volume resulting from the interventions. These outputs are public health concepts that can be measured, such as the proportion of animals vaccinated, or the number of people able to access care and receive treatment. They might include notions or measures of equity, acceptability, effi ciency, and eff ectiveness that are the direct result of interventions on populations. These outputs in turn, given biological and epidemiological assumptions, result in outcomes, such as reduced incidence of disease and broader measures of control. Outcomes ultimately lead to overarching policy goals, be they public health, security, or economic, for example.

Although the framework that we set out links coherently research themes that might support public health, the framework does not address policy timelines, the sometimes urgent need for evidence, issues of the feasibility of research, nor the receptivity of audiences and the willingness of research evidence to be acknowledged and embedded within policy-making processes. Such a framework does not nor can it hope to guide priority setting, nor national, regional, and global agendas for research. Other information should guide priority setting and research agendas, including timeline for results, risk of research programme failure, probable public health benefi ts in the short and long term, and likely benefi ciaries. However, we believe that this framework off ers a structure around which these issues can be discussed and from which a coherent research agenda might emerge.

Social determinants of health in Canada: Are healthy living initiatives there yet? A policy analysis,Introduction: Preventative strategies that focus on addressing the social determinants of health to improve healthy eating and physical activity have become an important strategy in British Columbia and Ontario for combating chronic diseases. What has not yet been examined is the extent to which healthy living initiatives implemented under these new policy frameworks successfully engage with and change the social determinants of health.,"Preventative strategies focusing on healthy eating and physical activity, collectively known as healthy living, have become an important strategy in Canada for combating chronic diseases. Chronic diseases are rising to epidemic proportions in the Canadian population and costs associated with treating them pose a serious threat to the sustainability of the health care system [1] . Addressing the underlying causes of chronic diseases and their inequitable distribution through a preventative health promotion strategy has been acknowledged as an effective way to reverse these trends in both Ontario (ON) and British Columbia (BC). These provinces have recently reformulated their chronic disease prevention strategies as part of Canada's renewal of public health systems, initiated in 2003 as a response to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). A common strategy that both provinces pursue is to address chronic disease prevention through healthy living initiatives -initiatives that work to promote healthy eating and physical activity as well as address other risk factors such as unhealthy alcohol consumption and tobacco use.

While healthy eating and physical activity were traditionally considered individual lifestyle choices, public health has shifted its perspective in the past several decades to encompass the broader context in which these choices are made. This includes daily living and working conditions that are not conducive to healthy lifestyles as well as broader structural determinants that create inequities between population groups, which together form the social determinants of health [2] . The World Health Organization (WHO) has defined the social determinants of health in the following way:

""The poor health of the poor, the social gradient in health within countries, and the marked health inequities between countries are caused by the unequal distribution of power, income, goods, and services, globally and nationally, the consequent unfairness in the immediate, visible circumstances of peoples livestheir access to health care, schools, and education, their conditions of work and leisure, their homes, communities, towns, or citiesand their chances of leading a flourishing life. Together, the structural determinants and conditions of daily life constitute the social determinants of health and are responsible for a major part of health inequities between and within countries"" [2, p.1] .

Within a Canadian context, some examples of social determinants of health that have been identified are: income and income distribution, education, unemployment and job security, employment and working conditions, early childhood development, food insecurity, housing, social exclusion, social safety net, health services, aboriginal status, gender, race and disability [3] . The social determinants of health have been consistently linked in the literature to chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease, respiratory diseases, diabetes and cancer in Canada and worldwide; for example, it has been found that low socioeconomic status (SES), often measured by income and education levels, is associated with higher rates of cardiovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases, diabetes mellitus and asthma [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] . Research on Canadian cities has shown that people living in low income neighbourhoods experience significantly higher rates of chronic diseases such as diabetes and die several years earlier than their wealthier counterparts [10] . Job insecurity, characterized by unemployment, part-time employment and temporary employment, has been found to result in elevated blood pressure and higher risk of death from cardiovascular disease [11, 12] . Even in a financially secure job, poor working conditions that place high demands on the worker, combined with low support and low job control have been correlated with elevated stress and increased rates of coronary heart diseases as well as higher risk of cardiovascular-specific mortality [13] [14] [15] . Nor are these trends colour-blind; racialized groups such as Aboriginal people, new immigrants and minorities of colour consistently earn lower incomes and experience higher rates of chronic disease than North Americans of European descent [16] [17] [18] [19] .

Canadian policy documents outlining priorities for public health have stressed the importance of an approach that addresses the social determinants of health [20] [21] [22] . In a recent high-level United Nations meeting on chronic diseases, the role that the social determinants of health play in chronic disease was recognized, as was the importance of addressing them in disease prevention strategies [23] . A delegation from Canada participated in this meeting, and Canada endorsed the resulting declaration [24] . An approach that effectively engages with the determinants has been suggested in Mikkonen and Raphael's The Social Determinants of Health: The Canadian Facts, and includes policies that offer a higher minimum wage, higher assistance levels for those unable to work, a more progressive taxation structure that redistributes income more fairly, increased unionization, better funding of public education, government regulation of post-secondary institution tuition, stronger legislation on anti-discrimination policies and equal opportunity hiring, a national childcare strategy, strategies to increase the affordability of nutritious food, increased spending on a housing strategy, policies that reduce barriers for refugees and immigrants to practice their professions, and recognizing Aboriginal government authority over a wider range of Aboriginal affairs [3] .

Provincial health policy on chronic disease prevention for BC and ON corresponds to federal priorities. ON has stated in policy documents that the causes of chronic diseases are complex and rooted in broad determinants of health, which encompass lifestyle, socioeconomic, cultural and environmental factors [25, 26] . In order to tackle these upstream causes, the province has decided on a comprehensive, integrated population health approach that is evidence-based [27, 28] . For example, in a policy document on combating obesity, ON committed to a population health approach, which explores health disparities and interactions among the social determinants of health in order to improve the well-being of populations [26] . This approach can also be seen in the Ontario Action Plan for Healthy Eating and Active Living [28] . ON has made efforts to integrate a social determinants of health perspective into the province's public health practice through data and information use guidelines for boards of health of public health units. In the Healthy Eating, Physical Activity and Healthy Weights guidance document, the board of health is instructed to use information on health inequities and the social determinants in order to assess population needs and identify groups at highest risk [25] .

BC shares fundamental similarities with ON in its agreement on the importance of the social determinants of health and the need for an evidence-based, population health approach to chronic disease prevention. In the Model Core Program Paper on chronic disease prevention in BC, the paper's working group identified key principles for successful disease prevention, which includes a focus on social, environmental and economic determinants of health, a ""whole of society"" approach to population health, and an equity lens to examine health disparities between different groups [29, p. iv] . The determinants of health are understood to interact with each other in a variety of ways, to compound vulnerabilities for certain sections of the population, and to be modifiable through health public policy and changing social norms. Like ON, BC also takes health disparities between different parts of the population into account, such as between men and women, different ethnic groups, those who identify as Aboriginal, or between people of varying socioeconomic status [29] .

In order to effectively address the social determinants of health, ON and BC have committed to multi-sectoral action that targets the population on a variety of levels. Both BC and ON have stressed the importance of partnerships in the public health model to achieve prevention goals with other levels and sectors of government, NGOs, private industry, service providers, researchers, and communities to name a few [25, 28, [30] [31] [32] . These partnerships are considered crucial for real change, given the upstream, wide-ranging impact of the social determinants of health. Both provinces advocate for comprehensive strategies that target the population in diverse environments and at multiple levels [25, 31] .

These strategies suggest a socio-ecological approach to healthy eating and active living, a model of health that recognizes the interaction between individuals and their greater environment and its impact on health. In a socio-ecological model, the health behaviours that individuals engage in are impacted by individual factors (such as knowledge, lifestyle choices, and attitudes towards health behaviours), as well as interpersonal, community, organizational and society-level factors [33, 34] .

Interventions that follow this model aim to target the population at all these levels and address downstream as well as upstream barriers to healthy living [35] . It is important to note that although the socio-ecological model is different from the social determinants of health approach, it does not preclude attention to the social determinants of health. The social determinants of health can in theory be addressed at multiple levels within the socio-ecological framework, especially those that are more upstream such as at the societal level.

Based on the priorities that are listed above for healthy eating and active living in ON and BC, it would be expected that initiatives in both provinces target the population in diverse settings and at multiple levels, with a majority of initiatives focusing on improving population health through a social determinants of health framework. However, what has not yet been examined is the extent to which healthy living initiatives implemented under these new policy frameworks successfully engage with and change the social determinants of health.

This study seeks to evaluate healthy living initiatives in BC and ON that focus on healthy eating and physical activity based on their approach to the social determinants of health and health inequities. The authors draw on a political economy of health perspective in order to evaluate the initiatives within their broader social, political and economic context [36] . This implies that the findings related to the data are discussed in relation to the larger discourse around the socioeconomic environment and acknowledge the effect of structures and processes external to the health sector. Recommendations that emerge from the discussion are approached in a similar way.

Publically-available provincial policy documents written between 2005 and 2011 in BC and ON that focused on chronic disease prevention were used as a starting point to identify relevant initiatives. The focus was on chronic diseases that are most affected by nutrition and physical activity -namely cardiovascular diseases, some cancers, diabetes, hypertension, stroke and chronic respiratory disease. Once initiatives were identified, a web-based search was conducted to obtain a detailed description of the program as well as its timeline and current status (in-planning, ongoing, discontinued) etc. Provincial organizations that had the potential to conduct initiatives were also researched online to find initiatives that may not have been mentioned in the original policy documents and database. The search was not restricted to initiatives led by provincial ministries related to health; they could be initiatives of other ministries, arms-length government agencies or independent nonprofit organizations that worked to improve healthy eating and physical activity. In order to ensure the list of healthy living initiatives was comprehensive, it was compared against recent documents and public databases that provide listings of healthy living initiatives at municipal, regional and provincial levels in BC and ON [26, 37, 38] . Lastly, two policy-makers in BC and ON reviewed the list of initiatives to fill any gaps.

a) Initiatives focused on healthy eating and physical activity as a preventative strategy to reduce chronic diseases or improve general health. The initiatives were not limited to government interventions -the initiatives could be funded and developed by various organizations including actors in the government, non-profit and private sectors. b) Initiatives were implemented in BC and ON between January 1, 2006 and September 1, 2011. c) Initiatives were provincial rather than regionally or nationally-based. Initiatives that focused on select sites in the province were also permitted provided they weren't restricted to a particular region or area. For example, an intervention targeting remote communities in ON would be acceptable for analysis, whereas an intervention led by a particular health authority and applied only to that health authority's region would not be included.

The findings are limited to the provincial scope of initiatives selected. It is difficult to determine if analysis of regional, municipal or community level initiatives would reveal convergent findings, and represents an area for future study.

Each of the identified initiatives was reviewed, analyzed and grouped using descriptive labels. Codes were developed directly from the data by asking the following questions of each initiative: a) What section of the population does the initiative target? (ex. general public, vulnerable populations, health service providers, community actors, etc.) b) What factor is the initiative trying to change that will lead to healthy eating and active living? (e.g. knowledge, skills, attitudes, built environment, access, social/economic/political factors, etc.) c) Does the initiative directly acknowledge and attempt to act on the social determinants of health? If so, in what way? (e.g. education, advocacy, public policy change, etc.) d) What is the mechanism that the initiative uses to promote healthy living? (e.g. direct program for population, resources, toolkits, consultation services, grants, etc.)

The predominant themes that emerged from questions b. and c. reflected three types of initiatives: lifestylebased, environment-based, and structure-based, which were defined for this paper in the following ways:

Lifestyle-based: These initiatives aim to improve healthy living through lifestyle change of individuals. Examples include raising awareness of the issues (e.g. obesity) in the general population, increasing knowledge around nutrition and physical activity, changing attitudes towards healthy living by appealing to social norms (e.g. social marketing campaigns) or directly encouraging the adoption of new behaviours through programs (ex. eating foods with lower salt content, exercising for 30 minutes each day). The target audience could be the general public or specific groups (e.g. low income individuals, children, or aboriginal people) Environment-based: These initiatives are meant to improve healthy living by influencing the immediate environment in which people spend their time, such as schools, workplaces and community spaces. Examples of these initiatives range from encouraging employers to initiate healthy workplace programs to banning the sale of unhealthy foods in schools or working towards a built environment that encourages physical activity. These initiatives were frequently settings-based and address the role that immediate environmental factors play in health. Structure-based: These initiatives directly acknowledge the impact of various structures (e.g. social, political, economic) that create inequities leading to chronic diseases and attempt to address the social determinants of health directly in order to improve healthy eating and active living. These types of interventions are most frequently centered around education and advocacy on the social determinants of health and worked specifically to correct health inequities caused by these structural conditions. Examples include a survey tool that assesses the cost of basic healthy eating in different geographic areas in order to monitor accessibility and affordability of a nutritious diet, the creation of community forums to discuss the social determinants of health and explore structural barriers to healthy living, or consultation services that provide gender equity audits to sport and recreation organizations. Of the three categories, this one is the only one that directly acts on the social determinants of health.

For each initiative type, it was also found using questions a. and d. that there was a broad variety of mechanisms by which the initiative was supported and delivered. Consequently, in each category, initiatives were classified according to the mechanism by which they were administered. Mechanisms were categorized as direct programs, blueprints, and building blocks, and were defined as the following:

Direct program: Initiatives that are developed and implemented to directly influence the health of the population. Initiatives could be implemented through organization staff, contracting of other staff, working with community partners, or enforcing mandatory policy. Examples include direct services from health professionals such as phone lines staffed by dieticians and specialists in physical activity, bills to prohibit certain foods, and programs that provide healthy snacks to schoolchildren. This category also applies to programs that reward organizations (communities, schools) for programs they have already implemented. Blueprint: Initiatives that are developed but require implementation and tailoring by a third party such as a school, public health unit, or community organization. These initiatives are categorized as blueprints because while they offer a ""plan"" for a healthy eating and active living intervention (HEAL), they do not directly act on the population and their implementation is optional. Examples include toolkits for healthy school policies, materials for teachers to encourage student physical activity, and frameworks for how to build healthy communities. These initiatives require more action at the local level than direct programs because although the initiative is planned, local actors are needed to carry it through. Building Blocks: Initiatives that are meant to act as resources for third parties to develop their own projects, within certain guidelines. Examples include grants for communities to build their own HEAL project, consultation and training services on program planning, and directories of HEAL initiatives to act as a resource for ideas in developing an initiative. These initiatives require the most action at the local level; their planning and implementation fall to local actors and they provide the least support from the organization that is offering the initiative.

From the systematic scan of the policy documents, database and website search, 60 initiatives were identified in ON and 61 were identified in BC. (Please see Additional file 1 and Additional file 2 for a full list of initiatives). Programs were headed by various actors in both provinces, including Ministries of Health, other government sectors such as the Ministry of Education, non profit organizations, and professional associations. Often initiatives were structured as a partnership among multiple actors across different sectors. While many different organizations led and implemented healthy living initiatives, the majority were linked to provincial government in some way -either through direct funding, funding through an arms-length government agency (e.g. Cancer Care Ontario or Public Health Ontario), funding through a non-profit organization that has received sizeable grants for healthy living initiatives (e.g. BC Healthy Living Alliance), or partnership with a government agency. Government involvement in ON programming or financing included the Province of Ontario, the Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care, the Ministry of Child and Youth Services, the Ministry of Community and Social Services, the Ministry of Education, the (former) Ministry of Health Promotion and Sport, and the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs. Government involvement in BC programming or financing included all Ministries, since all participated in Act-Now BC. Some key ministries involved in healthy living initiatives were the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Community, Sport and Cultural Development, the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Agriculture and Lands, the Ministry of Children and Family Development, and the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure. Many initiatives involved multiple ministries and most included a health-related ministry. In ON, 6 of the 60 initiatives were not linked to the provincial government, and were organized and/or financed by Parks and Recreation Ontario, the Ontario Heart and Stroke Foundation, Dairy Farmers of Canada, and a partnership between the University of Guelph and the City of Guelph. In BC, 8 of the 61 initiatives were not linked to government, and were organized and/or financed by the BC Parks and Recreation Association, the Heart and Stroke Foundation of BC & Yukon, the BC Dairy Foundation, the Greater Vancouver Food Bank and Breakfast for Learning BC. For examples of initiatives classified into the three intervention types, please see Table 1 . For examples of initiatives classified into the three delivery types, please see Table 2 .

In BC, 38 interventions were lifestyle-based, 27 were environment-based and seven were structure-based. Nine interventions had multiple components that targeted a combination of lifestyle, environmental and structural factors, and so were classified into more than one category. In terms of method of delivery, direct interventions were more prevalent in lifestyle-based initiatives: 18 initiatives used direct programming while 10 initiatives were blueprints and 10 were building blocks. In the environment-based category, there was more of a balance between mechanisms of delivery: a roughly equal number of environment-based initiatives worked through direct, blueprint and building block mechanisms (10, eight and nine, respectively). Structure-based interventions were those that received the least direct support: only one was enacted through direct programming, one used the blueprint format, and six were building blocks-type initiatives.

ON yielded similar results in terms of distributionthe preponderance of initiatives were lifestyle-based, followed by environment-based, with very few aimed at structural change. Of 60 provincial initiatives identified, 36 were lifestyle-based, 26 were environment-based and nine were structure-based. Six interventions had multiple components that targeted a combination of lifestyle, environmental and structural factors, and so were classified into more than one category. Most lifestylebased interventions were direct (23), while 11 were blueprint initiatives and four were building blocks. Environment-based initiatives were also more likely to A six week cooking program that is administered to 'at-risk' target populations.

This can be used to monitor how affordable and accessible foods are by comparing them to income levels of ON households be direct (13) while nine were blueprints and four were building blocks. Of initiatives that acted at a structural level, two acted through direct mechanisms, three were blueprints and four were building blocks. In summary, BC and ON had similar distributions of intervention types, with the majority falling into lifestyle-based initiatives, followed by environment-based initiatives, and a small proportion falling into the structure-based category. While many initiatives focused on changing lifestyle and the immediate environment to improve healthy eating and physical activity, very few were directed towards changing more upstream social determinants of health, such as the economic and social conditions that create inequities between genders, income groups and ethnic groups. Only 11.5% of initiatives in BC and 15.0% of initiatives in ON had structural components that directly spoke to the social determinants of health.

In terms of the mechanism by which the intervention was implemented, ON had a higher proportion of direct interventions than BC for all intervention types (63.9% vs. 47.4% for lifestyle-based interventions, 50.0% vs. 37.1% for environment-based interventions, and 22.2% vs. 14.3% for structure-based interventions). However, the same trend can be observed for both provinces: as the intervention becomes more upstream and attempts to target the social determinants of health more directly, the level of direct support for the intervention lessens. In BC direct programming drops from 47.4% for lifestyle-based initiatives to 37.1% for environment-based initiatives to 0% for structure-based initiatives. In ON direct programming drops from 63.9% for lifestyle-based initiatives to 50.0% for environment-based initiatives to 22.2% for structure-based initiatives. For a visual representation of this trend, please see Figure 1 .

The dominance of lifestyle-based and environmentbased initiatives is troubling considering that initiatives were expected (and directed) to focus on the social determinants of health. Although individual behaviour change theories were popular early in the health promotion movement, the field of public health has matured to embrace a more multi-level approach. This change of focus was in recognition of the fact that individual behaviour change strategies are not enough for lasting health improvements, given structural conditions which predispose people to illness [39] [40] [41] . They may actually be counterproductive; they tend to place responsibility to change directly on individuals and can lead to victimblaming should barriers prove too great for them to be successful [42] [43] [44] . The individual change strategy can be particularly problematic when it comes to addressing the impact of inequities on vulnerable populations, considering that such interventions often focus on increasing knowledge, changing attitudes and/or encouraging adoption of healthy behaviours. This approach in a marginalized group runs the risk of implying that the group is to blame for their higher rates of chronic disease, purportedly due to their own ignorance of healthy living or lifestyle choices.

Environment-based interventions, while more sensitive to the context in which people live and work, still do not tackle the structural determinants which create these conditions in the first place. Programs aiming to increase access to nutritious food and physical activity in particular settings such as schools, workplaces, government buildings and communities do not alter the factors which create inequities and unfavourable living conditions [45] . Environment-based initiatives can also have potentially negative implications for health equity when applied at a population level with no consideration for differential access. Programs that ""treat everyone the same"" and fail to acknowledge different positions vis-àvis the social determinants of health may in fact benefit those who already have access while excluding those who are more vulnerable. This effect was succinctly illustrated in Frohlich and Potvin's critique of Geoffrey Rose's population strategy [46] .

What is needed are structural interventions that are inherently redistributive in nature; interventions that broaden the distribution of power, income, goods and services across the population. Research has demonstrated limited effectiveness of downstream interventions (such as programs that focus on behaviour change) when structural barriers are not addressed [47] [48] [49] [50] . This is not surprising, considering that structural determinants have been found to influence the distribution of risk factors for chronic diseases such as smoking behaviour, overweight and obesity, and physical inactivity [8, 51, 52] . Therefore, attempting to prevent chronic disease by targeting risk factors at the individual or environmental level may not be effective without also addressing the broader determinants that shape those risk factors.

As can be seen from the paucity of structural interventions, this approach to healthy living is lacking in ON and BC despite provincial policy direction. Another discouraging trend found in the data is the decrease in direct initiatives (direct programs) and increase in more indirect ones (at the blueprint and building blocks levels) as the initiatives become more upstream. The amount of indirect initiatives could be interpreted as a move towards increasing community capacity, inclusion, local responsiveness and decision-making in healthy living initiatives. However, the more upstream and broadscale an intervention is (i.e. an environment or structure-based program), the more it would benefit from coordinated action at a higher, more structural level [3] . Initiatives that address the social determinants of health in order to impact the population at a broad level can extend beyond the scope of a particular community organization, whose on-going population reach and resource availability are limited.

Health equity interventions can also require more direct action from government -for example, an initiative that would help to balance the distribution of wealth in Canada is a more progressive taxation structure or an increase in minimum wage to account for inflation and provide a higher standard of living. These are initiatives which cannot be undertaken by individuals and communities. As the word 'structural' implies, they need to be acting directly on the structures (economic, social, political, etc.) which create and maintain health inequities. Instead, communities that do not have that capacity are more likely to receive this responsibility -in the form of grants, training workshops for program planning, or Mechanisms of initiative implemented included direct programs, blueprints, and building blocks and were calculated for a total of 61 initiatives in BC and 60 in Ontario. Please note that percentages may not add to 100% because some initiatives operated by more than one mechanism and so were placed in multiple categories. resource directories. These initiatives are framed as supporting communities in building their own initiative that addresses the social determinants of health. However, the pressure that it places on communities is enormous, and allows the public health system to abdicate its responsibility to address the social determinants of health directly and in a concrete manner. Instead it can point to these initiatives and claim that they are focussing on the social determinants of health -this is essentially the provinces of ON and BC ""passing the buck"".

Given the fact that policy documents on chronic disease prevention and healthy living at the provincial level in both BC and ON acknowledge the importance of the social determinants of health, why is the health sector not acting on them? An explanation can be found in the context of Canada's political and economic policy over the past several decades. A neoliberal approach to the economy that favours freedom of the market has resulted in the retraction of government intervention in the areas that are crucial to the health and well-being of Canadians. Research has found that Canadians are experiencing increasing levels of poverty and income inequality, as absolute levels of poverty increase and the gap between the poorest 10% and richest 10% widens [53] . Research based in Toronto has demonstrated this trend of polarization starting from the 1970s [54] . Urban poverty is also becoming more concentrated in peripheral areas -areas that have the highest rates of new immigrants and visible minorities. Not surprisingly, child poverty in Canada has also deepened in the 1990s [55] .

Other determinants of health have also been affected by government policy. The public education system has suffered cutbacks and labour conflicts that reduce its ability to provide quality education [56] . Stricter immigration policy that went into effect as of December 2011 will increase social exclusion of immigrants and refugees, while cutbacks to legal aid aggravate the situation [57] . Job insecurity is rising, with the percentage of people in full-time jobs decreasing and the number of people working part-time, in shift work, temporary contracts or self employed increasing [58] . Unionization rates have also dropped across the country [59] . Disproportionate spending on necessities such as housing comes hand in hand with increasing poverty and job insecurity. Canada is experiencing a national housing and homelessness crisis. As of 2007, over 35% of people renting in major urban areas such as Toronto, Montreal and Vancouver were spending more than 30% of their income on housing (the cut-off for affordable housing). Around 20% are spending more than 50% of their income on rent, which puts them at risk of homelessness [53] . When such a high amount of income is being devoted to shelter, not enough is left over for nutritious food, leading to food insecurity [60] .

The effects are felt as a result of inadequate policy and public expenditures on social programs, which are key characteristics of the neoliberal model. Public spending on family-related benefits has been scaled back since the 1980s, and taxation policy between 1990 and 2005 has increased the tax burden on the bottom 10% of income earners and relieved it from the top 1% [53] . Minimum wage, although it has increased in absolute terms, has fallen behind the inflation rate and made living above the poverty line more difficult to achieve. The fall of unionization in BC and ON can be attributed to policies put into place by Conservative governments that made unionization more difficult [53] . With respect to housing policy, it has been argued that a budgetary increase of 1% in Canadian government spending at the federal, provincial, territorial and municipal levels has the potential to end the homelessness crisis, but they have demonstrated their unwillingness to make that commitment [61] .

Within the context of a national and provincial neoliberal climate, it is not surprising that the health sectors of BC and ON have not attempted to implement widespread structural change to improve healthy living [62] [63] [64] . Even though well aware of the necessity to address the social determinants of health, they may feel powerless to do so in the face of conservative policies initiated by other sectors. As Alvaro et al. emphasized using a critical theory lens, government departments linked to economics and ensuring the dominance of the free market have more power than departments such as the Ministry of Health in a neoliberal model [45] . Those in the health sector face barriers to encouraging other sectors to effect policy change to improve the social determinants of health, and may resort to individual or intermediate behaviour change because they are able to effect that change either through their own department or allied with other de-prioritized departments such as the Ministry of Education or the Ministry of Environment. For example, partnering with schools to increase the amount of healthy foods sold in vending machines may be significantly easier than convincing the Department of Finance to raise the province's minimum wage.

We would argue that the ultimate goal of healthy living programs should be to improve the social determinants of health and eliminate health inequities. It is recognized that it is out of the scope of the health care sector to effect those changes on its own, and it faces barriers in partnering with sectors for collaborative, cross-sectoral action. However, public health should be constantly attempting to move towards those goals. It should not settle for programs that bring about changes in lifestyle and the immediate environment while only addressing the social determinants model at a conceptual level.

If programs cannot directly affect lasting, broader societal conditions, interventions should be focused around advocacy and education about the social determinants of health -advocacy at the level of the population, service providers, health organizations, and government in order to build political will to address them. The structural interventions listed in Additional file 1 and Additional file 2 are already taking the initiative to do this and more should be added.

One barrier for public health professionals to address the social determinants of health is a lack of understanding of how to do so; although there is a wealth of theoretical understanding of how these determinants affect health, there have been few examples to date that illustrate how to effectively change them [62, 65] .

In an environmental scan of the integration of the social determinants of health with public health practice, the National Collaborating Centre for Determinants of Health noted that implementation of programs that dealt with the social determinants of health in Canada was relatively scarce and, when extant, in early phases [66] . Some of the barriers noted to mounting programs that focused on social determinants included gaps in the existing evidence base on the social determinants of health and on interventions that were effective in addressing them, difficulties public health professionals faced in conceptually differentiating individual-level and population-level approaches, a lack of clarity on where in the path from determinants to outcomes public health is expected to act, and limitations in current public health practice methods, which rely mostly on quantitative data.

Even in a conservative political climate, it is clear that there are improvements that can be made within public health to foster a greater understanding of how to focus programming on the social determinants of health. The WHO Commission on the Social Determinants of Health notes that a comprehensive health equity surveillance system would capture the most upstream structural drivers of health inequities (the unequal distribution of power, money, goods and services) as well as more intermediate ones that encompass the daily conditions in which people live and work. Such a system could monitor health equity by stratifying morbidity and mortality data by indicators such as income, occupation, gender, region, ethnicity and immigration status [2] . Some such initiatives already exist, for example the EU Health Monitoring Programme, which could be used as a model for Canada [67] . Solid data on health inequities and the social determinants of health serve a dual purpose: not only do they allow public health professionals and provincial health care systems to understand inequities and design effective initiatives that address structural determinants, they can also be used as tools to advocate for change at a broader level, which may be outside the scope of the public health system. For example, data on the health effects of social exclusion faced by new immigrants and refugees could be used to advocate for progressive immigration policies.

It is equally important that health organizations and professionals know how to use evidence on inequities and the social determinants of health to create meaningful initiatives. To do this, there must be a comprehensive understanding among the healthcare force of the social determinants of health and how they affect populations. This includes awareness of the social, political and historical context of how these inequities are generated and continue to be maintained. The provincial health services authority in BC has a program modeling this principle called the Indigenous Cultural Competency Online Training Program [68] . This program consists of a series of online modules and discussions designed to educate health professionals across the province on the context surrounding Aboriginal health issues, including the history of colonization in BC, Indian residential schools and hospitals, structural and interpersonal racism, and their impacts on Aboriginal peoples and their health. It would be extremely useful to have such programs implemented in all provinces, ideally with specific sections that focus on chronic disease, as rates of chronic diseases such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease are much higher in Aboriginal populations.

With solid evidence and a comprehensive understanding of inequities, there are many ways that public health can begin to address the social determinants of health in programming. One possibility is using public health planning models that integrate the social determinants of health into the planning process. The Region of Waterloo Public Health in ON developed a planning model that does this, based on the Ontario Public Health Standards (OPHS) [69] . The model is called Evidence and Practice-based Planning Framework: with a focus on health inequities. In the first two steps of program planning (1. Define Issue, 2. Situational Assessment), planners are encouraged to consider the following: community health needs, the OPHS mandate on the social determinants of health, and the association between health status and the determinants of health. Further, they are asked to engage stakeholder perspectives [69] . Another model developed by the National Public Health Partnership in Australia makes the determinants of health even more central to the planning process [70] . This framework bases the intervention on the determinant that is causing the health problem, rather than the health problem itself. Public health teams are to identify the determinants of the health problem and their context, assess how determinants may be detrimental or protective, appraise different intervention options, decide on an option -taking into consideration its impact on health equity, then implement and review it [70] . When consistently implemented province-wide these types of planning models will help public health teams incorporate the equity and the social determinants of health into practice in a systematic manner.

Information and programs generated within the public health sector can be used to advocate for structural change to improve healthy living. An exemplary initiative in Ontario is the Nutritious Food Basket, described in Table 1 . The Nutritious Food Basket is a program mandated by Ontario Public Health Standards (OPHS) for boards of health to implement in municipalities across the province. Boards of health are required to survey local supermarkets and grocery stores in order to calculate the cost of basic healthy eating for individuals and families. This program is ideal for a number of reasons. It links what is normally considered a behaviour (healthy eating) to greater structural determinants such as income and regional differences in food accessibility. Because the survey is taken annually, it can keep pace with larger economic trends such as inflation and food cost patterns, and because it is performed systematically using a detailed protocol it presents reliable data. The data, as mentioned in the Nutritious Food Basket Protocol, can be used for program planning, policy decisions, and advocating for accessible, affordable foods. The Nutritious Food Basket can be used as powerful evidence for the necessity of income redistribution policies ensuring that families make enough money to maintain a healthy diet [71] . Certain boards of health, for example in the Cities of Hamilton and Sudbury, have used this tool for this purpose [72] [73] [74] .

A current leader in championing health inequities is the Sudbury & District Health Unit, whose team has launched public awareness campaigns linking the social determinants to health outcomes, created health planning and mapping tools that focus on equity, established in conjunction with the City of Sudbury a Food Charter that recognizes food as a basic human right, and developed a primer for municipal leaders explaining the connections of social determinants to public health and how they could address them effectively [75] . Although individual public health units are to be commended for their leadership, coordinated action at the provincial level would be much more influential.

External evidence from other countries can also be used as leverage -for example healthy living and chronic disease policy in Northern European countries such as Sweden and Norway. Sweden initiated a public health policy in 2000 which stressed improving employment conditions and decreasing poverty as primary goals for improving health [76] . Sweden has significantly lower obesity rates than Canada and research has shown obesity trends levelling off between 2000/2001 and 2004/ 2005 [77] . Elizabeth Fosse has pointed out that Norway focuses on structural measures that function to redistribute resources within society, which is characteristic of a social democratic welfare state [78] . In a 2005 health policy document, the Norwegian government outlined a number of strategies to combat health inequities, including reducing inequalities that contribute to poor health [78] . The government pledged to work to provide safe childhood conditions, fair income distribution, and equal opportunities in work and education. It was also recognized by the Norwegian government that individual behavioural choices which impact healthy living are influenced by broader structural determinants, and therefore the government must work to address those determinants by influencing cost and availability of resources to healthy living [78] . Lastly, a strategy employed to reduce inequities was to develop all initiatives to maximize social inclusion of all citizens. These types of policies could be used as models for health inequity reduction strategies advocated by the health sector in BC and ON.

This study is not without limitations. For example, the focus on provincial-level initiatives excluded initiatives happening at regional, municipal and community levels. This selection was strategic in that it attempted to maximize the likelihood of finding initiatives which addressed the social determinants of health -conditions that require multi-sector, systemic change. It was assumed that this type of change more likely to happen at the provincial level as opposed to in a city or region, but it is possible that initiatives that address the social determinants of health at a more local level were overlooked. Secondly, our search strategy was limited to initiatives that focused explicitly on healthy eating and active living and did not seek to identify social programs in other sectors (for example housing) that may address the social determinants of health and impact healthy eating and active living indirectly. We would like to emphasize, however, that our focus was on what is occurring within public health at a provincial level to improve healthy eating and active living. The presence of social programs in other sectors does not reduce public health's obligation or commitment to addressing the social determinants of health. Finally, our analysis did not attempt to document whether desired outcomes related to the social determinants of health were achieved by the searched

Social network theory in the behavioural sciences: potential applications,"Social network theory has made major contributions to our understanding of human social organisation but has found relatively little application in the field of animal behaviour. In this review, we identify several broad research areas where the networks approach could greatly enhance our understanding of social patterns and processes in animals. The network theory provides a quantitative framework that can be used to characterise social structure both at the level of the individual and the population. These novel quantitative variables may provide a new tool in addressing key questions in behavioural ecology particularly in relation to the evolution of social organisation and the impact of social structure on evolutionary processes. For example, network measures could be used to compare social networks of different species or populations making full use of the comparative approach. However, the networks approach can in principle go beyond identifying structural patterns and also can help with the understanding of processes within animal populations such as disease transmission and information transfer. Finally, understanding the pattern of interactions in the network (i.e. who is connected to whom) can also shed some light on the evolution of behavioural strategies.","One of the long-standing challenges in biology is to bridge the gap between individual behaviour and population biology (Sutherland 1996) . Population structure is a result of local interactions between individuals and their environment, and we need a framework to integrate over the different scales of individual behaviour, group-level phenomena and population-level patterns. In all cases where animal (and human) populations have been investigated, there has been evidence for social interaction patterns to strongly deviate from randomness (i.e. individuals have a greater affinity to interact with some than with others) and for individual variation in social contact patterns (e.g. some individuals have many while others have few contacts; Krause and Ruxton 2002) . The existence of social assortativity and individual variation (in contact patterns) has important consequences for population level processes such as the transmission of information in an animal population, the spread of diseases within and between populations and the evolution of behavioural strategies. For instance, the speed with which a disease will spread in a population can be very much dependent on which individuals get infected first. Are they highly and globally interconnected in the population and therefore carry a high risk of infecting many others over a short time span, or are they poorly connected meaning that no large outbreak will occur or only a localised one? We may also want to look at the structure of the population as a whole and ask if individuals with many social connections are connected to others with many connections (i.e. positive assortativity) in which case the disease might be expected to spread very fast. Therefore, in brief, we could ask what the implications of social structure are for the evolution of mate choice, learning strategies and disease transmission and how social structure allows animals to adapt to changing environments. To address these questions, we need to understand more about the social fine structure of the animal population in question, and the social networks approach is an ideal tool for doing so. Wilson (1975) identified the social networks approach as one of the main techniques for studying sociality in animals in his pioneering book ""Sociobiology-the new synthesis."" The networks approach provides details for a better understanding of the fitness implications of social structure at the level of the individual and the population. The social fine structure of a population as revealed by a social network might explain to us why an individual might be more susceptible to an infectious disease as a result of its particular network position and why the population as a whole might be vulnerable to the rapid transmission of a disease (as we will show below). However, Wilson's (1975) book was published more than 30 years ago. Therefore, why has the idea of using a networks approach in animal behaviour not become mainstream already? Wilson was a visionary in recognising the potential of network theory for the study of animal behaviour long before computational power was sufficient to make full use of it. Furthermore, many of the conceptual advances necessary to apply this technique to animal behaviour (such as meaningful network descriptors) have only been developed in recent years. In this review, we aim to highlight areas where we feel that a networks approach could be used as a valuable tool to address longstanding questions in behavioural ecology.

The network approach originated in the mathematical graph theory and has a long and distinguished history in the social sciences and psychology where it has been used to investigate human social organisation (see Scott 2000 for a review) with its main strengths being the potential to address population-level or cross-population-level problems by building up complex social structures from individuallevel interactions. Furthermore, network statistics can be used to derive novel quantitative measures that characterise social structure at the level of the individual, and these measures can then be used alongside other standard statistical variables (i.e. measures of relatedness or repro-ductive success). However, the appeal of the networks approach goes well beyond sociology and psychology and has widespread technological applications as well. Anything from transport networks (Sen et al. 2003) to communication systems such as the internet (Tadic 2001) can be considered as a system of interacting components. In biology, the network approach has been used in various areas, as biologists have realised that to better understand complex systems, we need to study interactions between components of the system not in isolation but as part of a network of interactions. Such an approach has made important contributions across biological disciplines and across different levels of biological organisation. For example, work on gene and protein interaction networks has provided unique insight into the functional organisation of the cell (Barabasi and Oltvai 2004) , work on neural networks has demonstrated how cells are interconnected to control complex processes (Laughlin and Sejnowski 2003) and considering trophic interactions between organisms as a food web has provided insight into how stable communities are to perturbation or the invasion of a new species (Dunne et al. 2002) . Surprisingly, in the discipline of animal behaviour, this approach has received relatively little attention despite its enormous potential.

A network consists of nodes and edges (Fig. 1) . When applied to animal groups or populations, nodes usually represent individual animals and the edges the relationships between them ). This statement highlights one important distinction from conventional statistics, namely that we deal with relational data (i.e. data that represent how individuals relate to each other) in networks rather than with attribute data (i.e. data that assign attributes such as body size or colour to individuals), although attribute data often play a crucial role as explanatory variables for the observed structural patterns. Social networks can capture some of the complexity of social organisation that eludes other methods. Relationships in networks can represent any type of social behaviour such as cooperative, hostile, predatory, competitive and aggressive interactions to name but a few possible associations. Furthermore, we can investigate the intensity, frequency and directedness (i.e. who initiated an aggressive interaction or provided support) of such interactions. Compared to more traditional approaches that focus on dyadic interactions between animals in isolation, the network approach allows us to put such interactions into the wider social context of the population.

Networks tell us who is connected to whom in the population and by what relationship. An individual's network position (i.e. its social environment) may also have important fitness consequences. As Maynard Smith 1982 pointed out, the frequency of behavioural strategies in the population can affect the evolution of individual behaviour. However, to better understand under which conditions behavioural strategies can evolve, we need to go beyond the frequencies of each strategy and obtain information on how the individuals are inter-connected. For example, in models of conflict, the success of a hawk (aggressive) or dove (yielding) strategy will be dependent on the frequency of hawks and doves in an individual's local interaction network. Skyrms and Permantle (2000) gave several examples of how social structure can arise from pair-wise interactions in a dynamic model in which agents receive positive and negative feedback from their interactions. At the level of the population, this means that the way in which individuals are inter-connected in a population, i.e. the network structure, can strongly influence the outcome of evolutionary processes (a topic we will return to in the section on cooperation).

In Fig. 1 , we have provided a simple example to demonstrate some of the potential uses of the network approach. For the purposes of this illustration, we have created a fictitious animal population of which we present a network of social contacts. Network theory provides us with a range of statistical descriptors that we can use to characterise the network as a whole as well as the properties of individuals in the network. Table 1 provides some examples of such descriptors. We can calculate for each individual in the network its degree (number of immediate neighbours), cluster coefficient (the degree to which an individual's immediate neighbours are connected), path length (number of connections on the shortest path between two individuals) and node betweenness (the number of shortest paths between pairs of individuals that pass through a particular individual; see Croft et al. 2007 for a detailed discussion of the terms and their calculation). We can also calculate these statistics for the network as a whole, which gives an idea of the global properties of the network system. Many of these network statistics can be calculated using UCINET (Borgatti et al. 2002 ; see also Croft et al. 2007 for a detailed discussion of the meaning of the different descriptors), which is readily available from the internet.

Any changes that occur in this network such as the experimental removal or addition of individuals can potentially have a profound effect on the network and can be measured using the above descriptive statistics. For example, the removal of a single individual (in this case, j) See Table 1 for individual-based measures from the network can have a number of drastic effects on network structure. First of all, at the global level, the network now subdivides into two sub-networks, and there is a drastic reduction in the average path length. This subdivision into sub-networks and the reduced path length may have important consequences for the transmission of socially learnt information in this population, for disease transmission and other processes, which we will explore in this review. At the individual level, we can also observe some strong effects. For example, individuals i and n, which were initially very central to the network, have a much reduced betweenness after removal of j. We could experimentally test now whether in real life the removal of one or more individuals does indeed produce the effect on social systems that the network analysis predicts. In our example ( Fig. 1) , we selected an individual for removal that occupies a crucial position in the network, which is not always the case. Therefore, it is important to keep in mind that the removal of single individuals (or even small groups) does not necessarily produce any strong effect on network measures particularly if the network is very large. In fact, many network structures are very robust against removal of individuals (which is considered a strength in technological networks and also found in some colonies of social insects; Krause and Ruxton 2002) .

In the following, we want to highlight a number of areas where we believe the network approach could make important contributions to the study of animal behaviour and social organisation. For this purpose, we have adopted a bottom-up approach by first discussing how the behaviour of individuals can be described, analysed and predicted in novel ways using the network approach. In the second section, we will look at processes (such as information transfer, disease transmission etc.) that can take place on networks that connect individuals forming a group or population. The third section is devoted to the topic of network comparisons. In this section, we explore how the same network of individuals can be compared between different contexts (i.e. social structure during control situation and during predation threat) and how networks of entire populations that are exposed to different ecological conditions can be compared. In this context, the network approach provides novel measures at the population level that allow us to obtain an understanding of how social structures are influenced by ecological conditions. The final section of this review is concerned with an overview of different taxonomic groups where the network approach has been applied and identifies avenues for future work.

Game-theoretical work by Maynard Smith (1982) and others demonstrated that the evolution of behavioural strategies can be frequency dependent if certain conditions are satisfied. This work was fundamental for our understanding of animal behaviour because it could explain how different behavioural strategies could co-exist over evolutionary time. To understand at what frequency two competing strategies obtain the same fitness, we need to know the details of the pay-off matrix regarding the interactions between the two strategies. The traditional game-theoretical approach, however, is non-spatial, and all individuals are equally likely to interact with one another. If we look at real animal populations, it becomes clear very quickly that the latter is not normally the case and that certain individuals are more likely to interact with certain other ones for a variety of reasons (e.g. neighbouring territories). This is where networks come in because they help us understand who interacts with whom and how often and what the total number of connections is that an individual has in a network. This type of information can be very useful for the study of cooperation (Croft et al. 2006; Ohtsuki et al. 2006) . Ohtsuki et al. (2006) showed that the evolution of cooperation is strongly dependent on the structure of the social network and is favoured if the benefit of the altruistic act b, divided by the cost c, is larger than the average number of neighbours, k, in the network (i.e. b/c>k). In an unstructured environment where all individuals are equally likely to interact with each other, defectors will have an advantage over co-operators. Understanding the network structure in relation to the behavioural strategies of individuals can thus provide new insights into the evolution of co-operation. Croft et al. (2006) examined the network structure of free-ranging guppy (Poecilia reticulata) populations and found non-randomness in the form of strong repeated interactions between pairs of females ( Fig. 2) . No persistent pairs were found between males or between a male and a female. When faced with a predator, these fish perform inspection behaviour, which means that the predator is approached by small groups of fish. Pairs of females that were frequently observed together in the social network (before predator exposure) were also frequently found together during predator inspection, which suggests that the social network was a good predictor of the inspection network. In subsequent tests, pairs of fish were isolated and exposed to predators, and their inspection behaviour was analysed. Pairs of fish that had frequently co-occurred together in the social network were found to perform the inspection behaviour more co-operatively (frequently switching the more dangerous lead position) than pairs of fish that were usually not found together.

Taking the work by Ohtsuki et al. (2006) and Croft et al. (2006) a step further, one could try to investigate what the network structure of wild populations is in terms of defectors and co-operators and the implications of this structure for the evolution of co-operative strategies in the population.

Sexual networks and questions regarding who mates how often and with whom have been addressed in the sexually transmitted diseases literature cited below. However, the network theory also provides us with several novel quantitative characteristics that can be tested as potential predictors of male mating success. Measures of network 'centrality' (Scott 2000) such as degree or betweenness of an individual (see Fig. 1 ) may have a bearing on social status or position in the hierarchy and thereby influence mating opportunities. However, we have to keep in mind that some of these quantitative measures are very sensitive to error. For example, high betweenness in an individual can change dramatically if only one or two observations are missing or were wrongly recorded from a network making this a risky parameter to operate with (Fig. 1) . Imagine for instance that the connection between individuals i and j was overlooked in Fig. 1 because of an observational error. This would result in two separate sub-networks and give individuals i and j much lower values of betweenness. In contrast, degree is a cumulative measure, and unless we have a case of mistaken identity in our network, this parameter is less likely to be affected by sampling errors. The degree of individuals could therefore provide a promising alternative when trying to link network position with social status or mating success.

The search for substructures or so-called communities within networks is based on a few simple conceptual ideas (although the calculation of network communities is not trivial; Croft et al. 2007; Wolf et al. 2007 ). Communities in animal social networks are defined as 'groups' of individuals that are more connected amongst themselves than with other individuals in the network in direct analogy to human social communities.

Why is the search for communities in networks important? We stated above that information flow or disease transmission in networks might be influenced by network structure, and communities are an important part of this structure. Figure 3 shows a network of the Trinidadian guppy, Poecilia reticulata, that was found to subdivide into five communities (Croft et al. 2006 ). One of the first predictions that one could make is that information flow or disease transmission might predominantly occur within communities before it spreads between them. Given that communities are based on the interconnectedness of individuals, this seems a plausible assumption. In this context, one could study for instance how the absence or presence of community structures in networks influences transmission processes in the network. Other aspects of interest are the individuals inter-connecting communities (Lusseau and Newman 2004) . If there was a disease outbreak in a human population, presumably the first individuals one would want to vaccinate would be the ones inter-connecting communities so that the spread of the disease could be contained within the community where it first arose. Clearly, the individuals that inter-connect communities occupy a key position in this context. One could further investigate why these particular individuals inter-connect communities and what makes them different from others in the network (Lusseau and Newman 2004) . This would raise questions such as whether they occupy these interconnecting positions only temporarily or over long time periods (potentially all their lives), and this could be linked up with the study of behavioural syndromes (Sih et Fig. 2 Social networks of Trinidadian guppies with males in black and females in white (Croft et al. 2006 ). The original network (a) in which all interactions are displayed was filtered so that (b) only those interactions are shown that occurred twice or more or (c) thrice or more. The latter (c) was a good indicator of cooperative interactions between pairs of individuals during predator inspection behaviour al. 2004). Network position could also be linked to social status and hierarchies, and one could test whether individuals that inter-connect groups are of particularly high or low rank in their group.

Above we discussed how network structure might determine mating success and thereby the flow of genetic material in populations. However, we could also investigate the reverse, namely how the genetic structure of a population affects the social structure. We might expect that at least in some animal populations, the degree of relatedness could be a good predictor of close social interactions-something that could be investigated by testing whether communities within networks are assorted by the degree of relatedness.

A number of studies have used networks to investigate how social contact patterns might influence disease transmission in both animal and human populations (Watts and Strogatz 1998; Potterat et al. 2002; Cross et al. 2004; Corner et al. 2003) . In humans, disease transmission, unlike some of the other research areas that we discuss in this review, is probably the field in which the use of networks is already fairly well established (see for instance the literature on socially transmitted sexual diseases in humans such as human immunodeficiency virus infection; see Klovdahl 1985; Rothenberg et al. 2000; Potterat et al. 2002) . However, very few studies have been conducted on animals so far using the network approach despite its obvious potential. Traditional epidemiological models do not take into account the differences between individuals (e.g. differences in the number of social connections; see Fig. 1 ) regarding their potential to transmit diseases through a population, and this is precisely where the network approach can make a contribution with its detailed information on individual interaction patterns.

The structure of social networks is important in that it is likely to help predict the speed with which the disease will be transmitted through the population and the pathway of the transmission chain. In some cases, the network theory can also be used to identify super-transmitters, i.e. individuals that have an unusually large number of connections in the network that can result in very fast spreading of a disease. In the case of a disease outbreak, targeted vaccination of super-transmitters could be an effective way of disrupting transmission despite the fact that only a relatively small proportion of the population was vaccinated.

There is great potential in integrating information on network conditions with disease transmission dynamics in animal populations. Cross et al. (2004) used behavioural data on association patterns of African buffaloes (Syncerus caffer) to study the potential spread of bovine tuberculosis. Their model is based on a fission-fusion system in which individuals can switch between herds, and the probability of getting infected is a function of the time spent in a herd with infected conspecifics. They found that the dynamics of the association patterns play an important role for disease transmission particularly if the disease requires only a relatively short association period for transmission. Using a slightly different approach, Corner et al. (2003) investigated the spread of bovine tuberculosis via brushtail possums (Trichosurus vulpecula) in New Zealand using a networks approach. We are not aware of a similar work for badgertransmitted bovine tuberculosis, but the potential for Fig. 3 a Social network of Trinidadian guppies taken from two interconnected pools in the Arima River. Individuals interconnected by lines were found at least twice together. b Five communities were detected in this system using simulated annealing (see Croft et al. 2007 for details of the method). The nodes are shaped according to which of the five communities they were found to be in (filled squares, filled inverted triangles, filled triangles, empty diamonds and empty circles) modelling between-species interactions using the network approach is obvious.

Recent examples in which the network approach had potential for making an important contribution to disease control are the foot-and-mouth outbreak in Britain and the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic (Bowen and Laroe 2006) . The way in which domestic animals are kept and moved around creates contact patterns that can be highly conducive to the spread of diseases (Webb 2005) . Therefore, knowledge of the network structure of a population can be of vital importance for making predictions about the disease dynamics as well as for taking preventive measures in terms of vaccinations of individuals (a point we discussed earlier in the section on network communities).

The implications of network structure for disease transmission dynamics is one issue; the probability of a particular individual to get infected is another. From a network's perspective an individual's chance of getting infected is primarily a function of how many connections it has in a network, what proportion of its network 'neighbours' are infected, the frequency and intensity of contact with those neighbours and the potential directedness of those connections (i.e. in some cases, transmission may be dependent on who initiates the contact or takes which role in the interaction). The study of Cross et al. 2004 highlights the importance of combining behavioural observations of social contact patterns with epidemiological expertise. For instance, it remains a challenge to find suitable criteria for establishing when contact can result in disease transmission between individuals. This concerns the type of interaction that is required, its duration and frequency to name but a few factors.

Similar arguments to the ones used above apply to the transmission of information via social learning in animal populations. However, even if we use the same population, the interactions that are relevant for the transmission of information can (but do not have to) be very different from those that result in the transmission of disease. An additional complexity of information transmission over networks is that social interactions (such as winning and losing in contests) are often witnessed by other members of the group or population. This can result in important information being acquired by the observer and in a change of future interactions (see McGregor 2005 for communication networks).

Network models have been used to describe the process by which ideas, opinions, information and innovations spread through human societies. Such models provide a means to estimate at what rate the diffusion will occur. Emphasis has been placed on identifying the key individ-uals in a community that may influence information diffusion (Valente 1995; Rogers 1995) .

The traditional starting point for studying information transmission in animal populations is to assume random interactions between the individuals in the system. However, all populations that have been studied so far clearly show strongly non-random elements in their interaction structure (Table 2) with individuals often forming preferential associations with others resulting in social assortativity (Krause et al. 2000; Krause and Ruxton 2002) . Individuals also show marked differences in their ability to learn from others and in their effectiveness to transmit such information within a population (Brown et al. 2006) .

With the help of the network theory, we can therefore try to predict the pathway that socially learnt information takes through a group or population (Valente 1995) . We can also make predictions about the speed of such processes. Furthermore, we can investigate to what degree the transmission of information through a population is influenced by the attributes of individuals (e.g. age, experience etc.) and their network position (e.g. central or peripheral to the network; Fig. 4 ) provided of course that the two (attributes and network position) are not correlated in the first place. We may predict that information is most likely to reach individuals via strong links (network connections that are based on interactions that occur frequently and have a long duration). The frequency and duration of strong links should ensure that the probability of information transfer is maximised between its participants. Sociological research has shown, however, that this is only partially true in human communities. Often, individuals that are strongly linked also share similar experiences (because they live in the same area, have similar work patterns etc.) and are therefore not likely to provide very novel pieces of information for each other. In contrast, weak links with individuals outside one's normal social environment were much more likely to provide such information (Granovetter 1974) .

An area of great interest in behavioural ecology is the issue of how ecological conditions shaped the behaviour of individuals and thereby the social organisation of populations/species (Harvey and Pagel 1991) . Usually, closely related species (or different populations of the same species) are compared to investigate how differences in ecological conditions could have led to the evolution of differences in behaviour and morphology. Pioneering studies by Crook (1964) on weaver birds and Jarman (1974) on African ungulates have demonstrated the power of this approach. For instance, Brashares et al. (2000) in a re-analysis of Jarman's data set of 75 species of African ungulates showed that species that live in open habitats formed larger groups than those that live in bush-or woodland. Furthermore, species with more selective diets were found to live in smaller groups than ones that were less selective in their diet. Therefore, what can social networks do for us in this context? The strength of the social network approach is that it gives us a wealth of new statistical descriptors that characterise the social fine structure of an entire population ranging from measures that focus on individual connectedness in the network, community structures that Corr (2001) Changes in social networks over the lifespan of an individual Berman et al. (1997) Infant social networks Deputte and Quris (1997) Infant gender and socialisation process Ring-tailed lemurs (Lemur catta)

(2004) Preferential associations a Indicates that the network approach is central to the paper form the building blocks of a network and global descriptors of the entire network (see Croft et al. 2007 , chapter 4, for details). If we stick with our example of the African ungulates a moment longer, we could use the network theory to go beyond simple measures of group size and try to identify how the individuals in the population are connected to each other and relate the position of individuals in the network to their attributes. For instance, we could look at whether females take up more central network positions than males and/or we could test whether females are more likely to interconnect the network than males-a measure that is known as betweenness in network lingo (see Fig. 1 ). Alternatively or additionally, we could look at whether individuals tend to form strong repeated ties with others or many weak (unrepeated) ties. These kinds of descriptors of social networks could form the basis of comparisons between species. Basically, all of the individual-and population-level measures that we introduced in the sections above lend themselves to this approach. Thus, it should be possible to investigate the implications of ecological conditions for various network patterns and processes. For instance, we should be able to determine whether populations that live in different habitats differ in their network structure and whether these differences have implications for processes such as information transfer or disease transmission throughout the networks. An interesting paper in this context is the one by Sundaresan et al. (2007) who have used the networks approach to compare populations of Grevy's zebra (Equus grevyi) and onager (Equus hemionus) (Asian wild ass). An alternative method of comparing networks was introduced by Faust and Skvoretz (2002) who characterised each network largely in terms of a census of structural elements often referred to as 'motifs.' Motifs describe the interactions between a small number of nodes (individuals), which are usually restricted to dyadic or triadic interactions (Fig. 5) . Faust and Skvoretz (2002) used the motif census as the basis for a comparison of a number of human and nonhuman social networks. However, Faust (2006) has pointed out that only networks of similar density (with a similar proportion of actual connections out of the total possible ones) should be compared because density will influence the motif census.

We can also look at a specific group or population and their social structure in different contexts (e.g. presence or absence of a predator; differences in resource distribution) to understand how context-dependent social structures are (Fig. 6) . This could be a very powerful approach when thinking about human social networks. For example, Wilson (1975) argues that we might expect a human communication network to show highly inter-connected components to maximise information flow. In contrast, a military chain of command would be strictly hierarchical with information flow occurring only in one direction. Such a comparative approach has been applied to animal populations. Wittemyer et al. (2005) studied the social network of an elephant population over a 4-year period and reported that certain aspects of the social structure (such as family units) were relatively unaffected by seasonal variation, whereas higher-order social units were strongly affected by ecological variables such as resource competition. One example of how the link might be made between network structure and processes on network is given by Cross et al. (2004) who investigated the spread of bovine tuberculosis in African buffaloes. A comparison between two years suggested changes in the social network structure (which appears to have been driven by changes in environmental conditions) may have facilitated the faster spread of bovine tuberculosis in the population. Future work examining how network structure is influenced by different ecological conditions and the implications of this structure for population level process such as information and disease transmission is eagerly anticipated.

The social network theory is clearly not independent of spatial structure, but it can go beyond it. Individuals that are often close in space may not necessarily interact much, and conversely, individuals that are rarely close in space may have a strong link (through mating or disease transmission). It is precisely this supra-spatial element that makes network theory such a useful tool for the study of animal groups and populations.

One way of finding out whether individuals that are connected in our network just happen to have a similar routine or speed of locomotion or whether their association is based on social preference is to carry out choice or preference tests in which the individuals have to pick each other out from others that are matched for size, sex and other characteristics. Croft et al. (2006) for instance showed that guppies that frequently co-occurred in the wild also preferentially shoal with each other when size-and sexmatched control individuals are introduced to the same tank. Similar choice experiments have been carried out using sheep (Michelena et al. 2005 ). An alternative to using choice experiments is the use of playback experiments, which may allow us to make inference about social recognition (i.e. identification of individuals or familiars) in our study species (Janik et al. 2006) .

In the above section, we discussed the use of networks to identify social connections of particular importance, which can then be tested in preference tests or by using playback experiments. Another way of testing network predictions is to use manipulation experiments. We can address questions like the ones raised in the section on network communities. To which degree would disease transmission or information transfer follow community structures? Which types of interactions do we need to record to make such predictions? What is the role of individuals in inter-connecting different communities?

Individuals can be removed from networks, trained (to learn new behaviours) or infected with a disease and reintroduced (provided we have adequate controls for such procedures). In the form of a replicated experimental design, such approaches are urgently needed to address some of the above questions. For instance, Croft et al. (2006) recorded the social network of guppies before, during and after predator inspection to find out whether inspection events changed social structure. Furthermore, they simulated defection events to investigate whether this would result in 'avoidance' of defectors and weaken the social ties between pairs of fish that had previously cooperated in the network (Thomas et al. 2007) .

Another example of a manipulation experiment is the elegant work by Flack et al. (2006) who studied the social organisation of pigtailed macaques (Macaca nemestrina). Flack et al. (2006) employed the network approach to characterise the social organisation of a group of monkeys making full use of several novel statistical descriptors that allow a detailed assessment of the social relationships between individuals. A removal experiment demonstrated that the presence of several high-ranking individuals was essential to retain group cohesion and that the social network fractured into several sub-units in their absence because of increased levels of conflict between individuals. The network tools provide sensitive measures of both individual-and group-level characteristics, which would be hard to measure and analyse without taking a network approach.

Such removal experiments can be conducted on real animal groups, but they can also be carried out on virtual populations on the computer to make predictions about how the removal of a single individual or groups of individuals could potentially affect network structure in terms of the degree, path length, betweenness and assortativity. Again, the strength of the network approach here is that it provides a whole new range of descriptive statistics that we can use to describe social systems.

Finally, we can investigate whether there are connections between the position that individuals occupy in their group or population (as characterised by novel network statistics such as betweenness) and more traditional measures of individual mating success or social status (position in a hierarchy). Thus, the network approach allows us to probe deeper into the social structure of animal

Military command Fig. 6 Differences in network structure between different contexts in fictitious human networks: information services network and military command. The number of individuals is the same, but the way in which they are linked differs (modified from Wilson 1975) groups and populations than before and to link this information to fitness-relevant variables, which could substantially increase our understanding of the social dynamics of animals.

Empirical network studies

In Table 2 , we have given an overview of some of the empirical work on animal social networks. This is by no means a complete list. We selected some of the more prominent studies for different taxonomic groups to provide a general overview. A complete list would be impossible because there are many studies which are at the borderline in the sense that they use the term social network but do not apply any of the network methodology. Other studies present sociograms but no statistical analysis of them. In the end, it remains a little subjective which studies to include and which not to. We added an ""a"" to those studies where the social network approach plays a central role in connection with detailed statistical tests. From the table, it becomes obvious that most of the network studies to date have been carried out on nonhuman primates (given the restriction on space, we have only named a few studies on humans, but there is of course a vast number of papers in the psychology and sociology literature and indeed even an entire journal specifically for this sort of work; for further details specifically on human networks, see Scott 2000) . This should not surprise us given that the social network theory was developed to investigate human relationships, and therefore this approach relatively easily transfers to other primates. At the same time, it is clear that many criteria that we expect from scientific research (such as standardisation, replication, manipulation etc.) are more easily reached with some of the other taxonomic groups because the animals are smaller, more numerous and more easily manipulated. Particularly, the social insects stand out as a system that should be highly promising for the network approach. The evolution of division of labour and the frequent interactions between workers belonging to different casts cries out for an approach in which system performance can be developed from social sub-units and ultimately dyadic social interactions. Fewell (2003) developed a process-oriented network to study division of labour in honey bees (Table 2) . However, this could be extended using individually marked colony members.

Domestic animals (such as cows, pigs and sheep) are another group with high potential for the network approach. The fact that these animals can be easily marked individually and observed continuously (often using automated systems) should provide us with a wealth of information on their social relationships that could help addressing some of the important and urgent welfare issues.

Finally, relatively little use has been made of the network approach in the context of inter-specific interactions (apart from the rich literature on food webs [i.e. who eats whom]) in ecosystems (Dunne et al. 2002; Sole and Montoya 2001) . The case of disease transmission where pathogens cross from animal hosts into humans (e.g. recent SARS outbreak) or from one animal species into another (e.g. badgers and bovine tuberculosis) should be highly promising systems for network studies. Another area of inter-specific interactions that lends itself to the network approach is pollination where insect-plant interactions are at the heart of the matter.

In general, we know relatively little about how animals are integrated into existing social structures or about how new social structures form or how long it takes for social systems to reach an equilibrium (and indeed if they do). What are the effects of removing or adding individuals on social structure, and what are the consequences of changes in social structure for processes on networks (such as disease transmission and information transfer)? Social networks could be a way into this sort of questioning. There are many research areas where this kind of approach could make a contribution such as release programmes of animals into the wild or holding conditions of domestic animals or captive animals in zoos where the effects of environmental enrichment could be measured by using a social networks approach.

In summary, there is an enormous potential benefit in adopting a networks approach to a very wide range of behavioural studies of animals in many diverse taxonomic groups. Although we have not discussed them in detail here, there are one or two methodological hurdles that we will need to jump before the analysis of relational data sets, in the form of networks, becomes as routine and robust as it is for attribute data ). Nonetheless, we believe that these issues are surmountable and that the ends will clearly justify the means.

Steps to a Sustainable Public Health Surveillance Enterprise Steps to a Sustainable Public Health Surveillance Enterprise A Commentary from the International Society for Disease Surveillance Steps to a Sustainable Public Health Surveillance Enterprise OJPHI,"At a time when populations are changing and disease outbreaks and other events of public health significance pose increasing risks to global health, economic stability, and national security, it is essential that, as a nation, we invest in the systems needed to promote and protect the public's health.","Online Journal of Public Health Informatics * ISSN 1947-2579 * http://ojphi.org * Vol. 5 

In 2002, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) reported that the public health system in the United States had a multitude of deficiencies that impact the ability to effectively conduct public health surveillance. These included outdated and vulnerable technologies; a public health workforce lacking training and reinforcements; lack of real-time surveillance and epidemiological systems; and ineffective and fragmented communications networks. 1 While considerable headway has been made since the IOM report was published, there is still evidence of a need for further improvements. A recent report by Trust for America's Health, for example, found that there are persistent gaps in the ability of state and local public health agencies to respond to events ranging from bioterrorist threats to natural disasters and disease outbreaks. 2 The question is-how can we reduce these gaps? Nationwide and globally, rapid changes in health information systems, cloud computing technologies, communications, and global connections are catalyzing a re-examination of disease surveillance as an enterprise that needs coordinated and integrated system elements. Sustainable surveillance, which we define as ongoing data collection, analysis, and application, coupled with a capability to respond to novel demands, is needed to ensure that public health agencies can perform reliably regardless of shifts in public health funding and priorities. The ISDS Sustainable Surveillance Workgroup identified the following steps to maintain and advance the public health surveillance enterprise:

1. Recognize systematic and ongoing public health surveillance as a core public health function that is essential for population health, economic stability, and national security. 2. Create and support funding mechanisms that reinforce enterprise (i.e., integrated systems), rather than categorical (i.e., disease or program specific) surveillance infrastructures and activities in order to reduce inefficient silos, leverage resources, and foster synergies. 3. Oppose further cuts to spending for surveillance activities. 4. Invest in surveillance workforce development to build competencies and improve organizational capacity to utilize technological advances in surveillance practice. 5. Advance a rigorous surveillance research and evaluation agenda that will deepen the understanding of community health, identify best practices, and provide evidence for decision-making. 

Public health surveillance is defined as, ""the systematic and ongoing collection, management, analysis, interpretation, and dissemination of information for the purpose of informing the actions of public health decision makers."" 3 In addition to providing information about the health status of our communities, surveillance is a foundation of emergency preparedness, food safety, infectious disease outbreak prevention and control, chronic disease assessments, and other key areas that protect the health, economy, and security of the public. While public health surveillance policy and practice have been indicated as priorities for policymakers at the national and global levels, [4] [5] [6] [7] questions remain about how to move forward from planning to implementation, especially in a time of critical cuts to federal funding.

Progress in health information technology (IT) and the increased use of electronic data and new data streams offer great potential for innovation in surveillance science and practice. For instance, the self-reporting of health information through social media (e.g., Twitter), as well as crowdsourcing projects such as Flu Near You (www.flunearyou.org) offer new options for collecting timely data. In addition, the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act, 8 legislated as part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) of 2009, is fueling the adoption of electronic health record (EHR) systems in the U.S. 9 In return for financial subsidies to implement EHR systems, hospitals and doctors are required to share data for public health purposes 9 with the intent to improve both population health outcomes and the quality of clinical practice. Sustainable surveillance systems have the potential to advance both of these goals. 10

The value of public health surveillance 1. Recognize systematic and ongoing public health surveillance as a core public health function that is essential for population health, economic stability, and national security.

Public health surveillance data is the foundation of public health programs and is required for a number of purposes, including: to demonstrate the size and impact of the public health problem being addressed by a program; to identify the population groups to which additional prevention efforts should be directed; to determine whether the problem is growing in size or abating; to provide feedback to data providers; and as part of an overall program evaluation strategy.

The significant health impacts and economic costs of disease outbreaks illustrate the critical importance of effective public health surveillance and rapid response, as well as the cost of inaction. 11 Table 1 provides examples of the health and financial burdens posed by some naturally occurring and intentional infectious disease outbreaks. The values reported in Table 1 do not fully reflect additional indirect costs of diseases and their potentially crippling effects on a community, nor do they address costs that are underreported/ unreported due to lack of data. Higher rates of illness, for example, can lead to lower worker productivity, 11 while premature mortality can reduce the size of the labor force, both of which have economic ramifications.

There is growing evidence that these economic and societal costs can be mitigated by surveillance systems that are stable; a stable system provides the best foundation for identifying whether the problem being addressed is getting bigger or smaller or disproportionately affecting a section of the population, etc., while still allowing flexibility to provide useful information quickly about emerging issues. The optimum mix of stability and flexibility will depend on the purpose(s) of surveillance and the particular health condition under surveillance. For example, in OJPHI the case of SARS, an effective surveillance system has the potential to decrease the size of an epidemic by one-third and the duration by 4 weeks, with significant cost savings. 25 Another study found that the early detection of an outbreak of highly infectious bacterial meningitis saved approximately $2 for every dollar invested in infectious disease surveillance. 26 Yet another evaluation of surveillance practice found that technological improvements in a sentinel influenza-like illness (ILI) surveillance system in Virginia saved over $9,500 (1,992 hours) in staff-time during the 2007-2008 influenza seasons. 27 Ongoing surveillance can also inform the design and evaluation of prevention and intervention programs in order to control the escalating costs associated with chronic diseases in the U.S. and abroad. 28 Some experts forecast that chronic disease prevention programs could save up to $48.9 billion per year by 2030, 29 while others predict applying electronic medical record implementation and networking to the prevention and management of chronic disease will exceed the currently projected $81 billion in annual savings. 30

Siloed surveillance systems are outdated, inefficient, and incapable of meeting today's demands for electronic data exchange and for the informatics capabilities needed to use the information for maximum benefit. Integrated programs and collaboration, on the other hand, facilitate the efficient management of the complex, varied, and proliferating issues and information sources that exist today. The nature of public health surveillance also lends itself to multiple-purpose approaches in that strategies for preventing and controlling diseases, such as West Nile virus, are to a great extent the same as for an influenza epidemic, a foodborne disease outbreak, or a bioterrorist attack. 31 Technology that enhances communication and data sharing across disease programs, surveillance systems, and even across jurisdictions increases the ease of obtaining and disseminating useful information to a broad audience, including public health agencies, healthcare providers, policymakers, and the general public. 6, 32 This rapid information exchange not only facilitates timely response, but can also reduce emergency room visits, hospital admissions, and even costs of care. 33 However, many health departments currently have systems that are not flexible enough to respond to changing health IT needs, which makes it difficult to deliver information when and where it is needed. 4 Disease or program-specific funding also exacerbates program vulnerability to funding and budgetary cuts. For example, when funding is earmarked for specific purposes (e.g., emergency preparedness and associated surveillance systems), and then is reduced, such as has occurred for public health emergency preparedness cooperative agreement funding through CDC in the past seven years, 34 it can undermine and reverse efforts to establish sustainable systems that serve multiple crosscutting purposes throughout public health. 

By contrast, an enterprise approach provides a cohesive framework that will better equip public health practitioners to address the challenges of processing large volumes of electronic data, and the concomitant analytical and visualization requirements. Specifically, enterprise funding supports a reliable, flexible infrastructure that can adapt to technological and information requirement changes, and allows for ongoing data collection and the integration of new data sources to advance all-hazard preparedness. A 2004 White House memo acknowledged how programmatic funding can lead to inefficiencies and redundancies in system acquisitions and usage and called for applying technological and human resources across programs. 35 By encouraging collaboration within and between departments, surveillance professionals can take advantage of shared platforms and resources to optimize data collection, analysis, storage, and dissemination, thus helping to reduce operational costs and improve efficiency. For example, collaboration could create opportunities for the effective integration of syndromic and reportable disease data for public health use. 36

A lack of consistent and sustainable funding is hampering the necessary expansion and improvement of public health surveillance systems at local, state, and national public health agencies. A 2010 survey of local health departments conducted by the National Association of City and County Health Officials (NACCHO) found that 72% of local health departments reported insufficient funding as one of their major barriers to modernizing their IT systems. 37 Health data collection systems that take advantage of recent technological advances have proven to be more cost effective and sustainable in the long-term. 38 Stable funding is essential to supporting the adoption of hardware and software systems as they become available, leading to a robust and sustainable public health surveillance infrastructure able to integrate, manage, and communicate the plethora of data necessary to generate actionable results. 39

The new age of disease surveillance requires a skilled public health workforce able to manage large volumes of increasingly complex electronic information, to understand the data flows, and to extract meaning from them. This calls for sophisticated and integrated competencies in public health informatics, epidemiology, statistics, and other areas, and the ability to present findings, draw conclusions, and make recommendations based on surveillance data. Furthermore, in addition to needing people who can effectively operate existing surveillance systems and carry out tasks (such as the onboarding process for collecting newly available EHR data) there is also demand for people who can identify and assess new opportunities for surveillance and design new systems that take advantage of these opportunities. 6 Online Journal of Public Health Informatics * ISSN 1947-2579 * http://ojphi.org * Vol. 5, No. 2, 2013

Attracting and retaining experts in these fields is especially challenging in light of the comparatively low base salaries allotted to public health workers compared to the salaries of technology-intensive positions in other sectors. 40 To align the surveillance workforce with new demands, the ISDS Sustainable Surveillance Workgroup suggests the following approaches:

• Provide training programs for existing and prospective public health workers to equip themselves with the necessary expertise and skills to work in rapidly evolving IT systems. • Promote public health careers at the primary, secondary, undergraduate, and graduate levels across disciplines. • Provide competitive salaries to recruit and retain a workforce skilled in public health surveillance and informatics.

5. Advance a rigorous research and evaluation agenda that will deepen the understanding of community health, identify best practices, and provide evidence to inform decision-making.

Research and evaluation play an important role in connecting the processes of information collection, information use for decision-making, and translation of decisions to actions and measurable outcomes. Research-based evidence and evaluation results can help to identify the limitations and benefits of different surveillance procedures for better decision-making and more effective resource allocation. Investing in research and applying the rigors of science to public health surveillance questions leads to informed decisions on how best to direct efforts and resources.

In addition, periodic evaluations of surveillance infrastructuresthe systems and people-are needed to assess return on investment and opportunities for quality improvement.

Effective and efficient surveillance systems are proven to save money and lives. The ability to detect and respond to known and emerging pathogens is central to protecting and maintaining population health. 41 The breakdown or absence of a stable public health surveillance infrastructure, on the other hand, can undermine efforts to mitigate disease outbreaks and other public health events. 31 Public health surveillance systems built on a strong infrastructure of core workforce competencies, information systems, and organizational capacity, 42 and supported by consistent and enterprise-based funding, are essential if we are to understand and respond to the real and growing threats to population health. By providing political commitment and financial support to this issue, decision makers can play an active role in advancing the health of individuals, communities, and nations.

Identifying Public Health Competencies Relevant to Family Medicine,"Public health situations faced by family physicians and other primary care practitioners, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and more recently H1N1, have resulted in an increased interest to identify the public health competencies relevant to family medicine. At present there is no agreed-on set of public health competencies delineating the knowledge and skills that family physicians should possess to effectively face diverse public health challenges.","Introduction E vents such as severe acute respiratory syndrome, and more recently H1N1, are examples of public health situations faced by family physicians and other primary care practitioners. 1 These events, in conjunction with other public health issues such as vaccinepreventable infections and rising rates of obesity and the associated health challenges, have resulted in an increased interest in the interface between primary care and public health (e.g., the IOM's consensus study 2 ) and in better identifying public health competencies relevant to family medicine so that family physicians and other primary care practitioners might better appreciate the population-wide perspectives of public health issues. However, at present there is no agreed-on set of public health competencies that family physicians and other primary care practitioners should attain to better ensure they possess the necessary knowledge, skills, and confıdence to effectively face diverse public health situations-from common to emergent. Using an iterative consultative process, the authors developed a set of public health competencies relevant to family medicine and primary care.

This process began with planning for a 1-day, pan-Canadian, family medicine-public health symposium that was held in March 2008. This symposium arose out of discussions at the pan-Canadian Public Health Human Resources Task Force concerning the role of primary care practitioners in Canada's public health workforce. The primary goals of the symposium were to identify: (1) the public health competencies that family medicine residents should possess at graduation; and (2) the primary care competencies that community medicine residents should possess at graduation. To help address these goals, a presymposium discussion document was prepared by reviewing existing documents to develop an initial competency draft using a ""multi-level competency model"" developed by the University of Toronto's Department of Family and Community Medicine. The resources accessed and reviewed to inform the preparation of the presymposium discussion document included: cation (ACGME) statement regarding the community medicine objectives required in family medicine residency programs 7 ; • the ACGME statement regarding the requirements for residency programs in public health and general preventive medicine. 8 A search of the literature, coupled with suggestions from individuals consulted, identifıed several other relevant and informative Canadian, 9, 10 American, [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] British, 16 -18 and Australian 19 -21 publications. These were also reviewed and assisted the development of a draft set of public health competencies relevant to family medicine and primary care.

Four levels of competencies were drafted, following the model developed in Toronto's Department of Family & Community Medicine, which spans resident-readiness (expected of all MD graduates), essential (expected of all family medicine graduates), enriched (achievable by most residents during family medicine residency training), and enhanced (achievable only through additional training after the family medicine residency).

Following the review of existing documents and preparation of the presymposium discussion document, the authors identifıed and used eight themes to guide the development of the draft set of competencies. These eight themes were:

• disease prevention and health promotion; • infectious disease prevention and control; • emergency preparedness and response; • environmental health;

• systems thinking, public health leadership, and management; • population health assessment; • policy, planning, communication, collaboration, and advocacy; • scholar and educator.

A variety of family medicine and public health educatorpractitioner colleagues reviewed and provided feedback concerning the proposed draft set of competencies. The fırst group of reviewers was the 24 program directors and residents who participated in the March 2008 pan-Canadian Family Medicine-Public Health 1-day symposium. This group included 12 residency directors (six family medicine, six community medicine) and 12 residents (six family medicine, six community medicine) from across Canada. The presymposium discussion document, which included a proposed set of draft competencies, was distributed to the participants for their review prior to the symposium. The draft competencies served as the major item for discussion by the participants during the symposium's plenary and small group discussions. Symposium discussions enabled the authors to further revise the discussion document and proposed set of competencies. This revised draft was then sent to all symposium participants for additional review and feedback, which resulted in the proposal of a detailed set of public health competencies relevant to family medicine and primary care (Appendix B, available online at www.ajpmonline.org).

This detailed set of competencies was presented at the October 2009 Family Medicine Forum, Canada's annual family medicine conference. Feedback received from conference participants suggested further revisions to the competency draft, particularly the need for a more limited, feasible set of ""priority"" areas to be focused on during residency training, especially because of the limited duration of family medicine residency training programs-being only 2 years in Canada and 3 years in the U.S.

As a result, the authors sought further feedback from interested family medicine and public health practitionereducators and residents from across Canada to identify a more focused set of priority areas to be emphasized during residency training. These colleagues were asked to rankorder the public health competencies that they considered essential for any graduating family medicine resident. With this advice, the authors identifıed a priority list of eight competency areas:

• the basic fundamentals of outbreak/emergency preparedness and management; • offıce infection control;

• infectious disease reporting and management; • environmental health exposure reporting; • public health aspects of immunization; • public health programs applicable to primary care (e.g., maternal-child health); • addressing and managing one's practice as a population (e.g., developing practice health profıles and using quality assurance to increase the delivery of preventive services); • the principles and practices of screening (i.e., early detection and treatment) of diseases.

Public health is only one of 14 competency domains in the University of Toronto's Family Medicine Residency Program's recently developed competency-based curriculum (other domains include child health, women's health, and mental health). To ensure the overall coherence of the 14 proposed sets of competencies, a full review was completed by a diverse group of 35 family medicine leader-educators at a departmental retreat in April 2010. A key fınding arising from this review was that only focused, essential competencies could be realistically identifıed within each of these 14 domains. This resulted in fıve public health competencies being identifıed and approved for inclusion in the competency-based residency curriculum, each accompanied by one or more enabling subcompetencies. These fıve overarching public health competencies are:

• demonstrate an effective approach to disease prevention and health promotion; • demonstrate an effective approach to infectious disease prevention and control, including outbreaks; • demonstrate an effective approach to environmental health issues; • develop and apply the knowledge and skills necessary to assess a population's health; • demonstrate an effective approach to public communication, collaboration, and advocacy. This more focused set, with the accompanying enabling competencies and a listing of suggested relevant topics for each, is included in Appendix A. It should be noted, however, that the more extensive complete set of public health competencies relevant to family medicine (Appendix B, available online at www.ajpmonline.org) is expected to continue to serve as the comprehensive listing to complement the more focused set of essential competencies and as the primary listing of the enriched and/or enhanced public health competencies relevant to family medicine and primary care.

The focused set of public health competencies approved by the University of Toronto for family medicine (Ap-pendix A) has begun to guide its Family Medicine Residency Program curriculum, including resident seminars; family medicine clinical experiences, especially identifying teachable moments that occur during patient encounters; elective public health agency placements; and topics selected for the required resident research project (e.g., the prevalence of chlamydia, a profıle of those infected with H1N1 influenza). These competencies will also be used to guide the development of a Family Medicine public health primer that would complement the Association of Faculties of Medicine of Canada's Primer on Population Health developed for medical students, 22 and faculty development sessions to support the family medicine faculty facilitating residents in their achievement of these competencies.

Once it is more fully implemented, an evaluation will be initiated to determine the degree to which these public health competencies are being achieved by family medicine graduates, especially whether they attained the knowledge, skills, and confıdence necessary to effectively face diverse public health situations-from common to emergent. It is anticipated that the experience gained through the implementation of the proposed set of competencies (and their evaluation), at the University of Toronto and other family medicine residency programs where they are implemented, will provide evidence of the utility and suitability of the proposed competencies and of further revisions that might be warranted.

Vaccinology in the third millennium: scientific and social challenges HHS Public Access Author manuscript,"The epidemiology of deaths due to vaccine-preventable diseases has been significantly and positively altered through the use of vaccines. Despite this, significant challenges remain in vaccine development and use in the third millennium. Both new (Ebola, Chikungunya, West Nile) and re-emerging diseases (measles, mumps, influenza) require the development of new or nextgeneration vaccines. The global aging of the population, and accumulating numbers of immunocompromised persons, will require new vaccine and adjuvant development to protect large segments of the population. After vaccine development, significant challenges remain globally in the cost and efficient use and acceptance of vaccines by the public. This article raises issues in these two areas and suggests a way forward that will benefit current and future generations.","The prevention of infectious diseases by the widespread use of vaccines has demonstrably changed the types and incidence of morbidity and mortality due to vaccine-preventable diseases. In fact, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has ranked vaccines and widespread sanitation as being responsible for the significant decrease in vaccinepreventable disease incidence and deaths [1] . This has been accomplished in two major ways: first, by the development of safe and effective vaccines; and second, by the widespread utilization of these vaccines among the populace. Both these conditions face threats and new challenges in the third millennium. The first challenge is the need to develop new technologies that enable faster and directed vaccine development for hyper-variable and complex disease-causing organisms, and the need for safe and effective adjuvants that can be used to direct and amplify protective immune responses. The second major challenge is the necessity for the populace, as a whole, to voluntarily accept these vaccines as important determinants of their wellbeing and health. In this review, we outline these challenges (see Figure 1 ) and suggest how they can be met (see Figure 2 ) in the third millennium.

Despite the immense progress in combating infectious diseases through vaccines, formidable foes remain. HIV, tuberculosis, malaria, and hepatitis C are epidemiologic giants that continue to contribute significantly to global mortality and lack effective vaccines (Table 1) . Fortunately, progress has been made on the malaria vaccine front [2] .. Some may argue that since we now have highly effective, tolerable treatments for curing hepatitis C, the quest for a hepatitis C vaccine is a moot point; however, the cost and availability of curative therapies is still limited to a select few. HIV and tuberculosis remain the most deadly infectious diseases worldwide. [3] .

The recent Ebola outbreaks have resulted in 28,639 reported cases with 11,316 deaths as of January 2016 [4] and have raised the spotlight on the need for readily available and effective vaccines against lethal emerging pathogens. Over the past year, significant progress has been rapidly made on vaccines for prevention of Ebola virus disease [5] [6] [7] [8] . The design of clinical vaccine trials in the midst of ongoing outbreaks using novel cluster randomized controlled trial designs with ring vaccination is a notable early third-millennium achievement [9] . However, as important as this study design is, would it not have been better if an effective vaccine had already been developed and available?

As the authors of a recent New England Journal of Medicine perspective article point out, prior to the Ebola outbreaks of 2013-2015, at least seven Ebola vaccine candidates had been tested in primates with promising results; however, only one had been tested in healthy humans, and no vaccine had reached later phase clinical trials that would lead to licensure. The authors propose that vaccine development is currently facing a crisis due to several factors: 1) the pathogens for which we lack vaccines are complex and require significant investment; 2) there are fewer vaccine manufacturers that are able to contribute the required resources for development of new vaccines; 3) and the current business model prioritizes the development of vaccines with large market potential [10] . Vaccine development for other emerging infections (e.g., Middle East respiratory syndrome, or MERS; severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS; Chikungunya; West Nile; Dengue; and Lyme) face these same roadblocks (Table 2) .

These challenging pathogens for which we lack promising vaccines, along with the newly emerging pathogens that pose pandemic potential, are not the only reasons we need more vaccine research and development. The pathogens for which we currently have licensed vaccines remain adversaries that continue to challenge vaccine development.

Although remarkably effective, currently licensed vaccines have some limitations. In fact, vaccine failure (i.e., the failure for the recipient to either develop or maintain protective immunity) takes place despite the receipt of a single dose, and/or several doses of vaccines, such as measles-mumps-rubella (MMR), hepatitis A and B [11] , influenza [12] , varicella [13] , Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) containing acellular pertussis (DTaP-Hib) [14] , and other vaccines. Antigenic changes in influenza viruses require us to reformulate and administer the vaccines every year. We and others have demonstrated that host genetics (SNPs in HLA and other immune response genes) and other host factors may play a significant role in variations in adaptive immune response to vaccination, including vaccine failure [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] .

However, there are some limitations with vaccines containing live attenuated (MMR, varicella, smallpox, zoster, yellow fever) or killed whole/inactivated (polio, influenza, Hepatitis A) microbial organisms, antigenic subunits of these pathogens (pertussis, pneumococcus, anthrax), or genetically engineered (hepatitis B, cholera, HPV) vaccines. The main deficits in these vaccines are the requirement for a cold chain, the induction of low seroconversion rates in some subpopulations, interference from pre-existing maternal antibodies, the requirement for multiple doses, and, for vaccines containing live organisms, the incapability to use the vaccine in immunocompromised individuals. Recently, there has also been a resurgence in pertussis (whooping cough) incidence in many countries around the world with many cases occurring in previously vaccinated children and adolescents [20, 21] New viral vaccine candidates have recently been introduced for varicella-zoster, influenza, dengue and other viruses; however, much remains to be done. For example, the short-term efficacy of the live virus herpes zoster vaccine was demonstrated to be 69.8% in a randomized study of over 22,500 vaccine recipients [22] . Zoster vaccine efficacy was shown to decrease with increasing age at vaccination [23] . An AS01-adjuvanted varicella-zoster virus glycoprotein E (gE) subunit vaccine has undergone clinical trials where it demonstrated acceptable safety and enhanced immunogenicity; the vaccine is under review by the FDA with likely approval in 2017 [24, 25] . The world's first tetravalent dengue vaccine has been recently approved for the prevention of dengue infection that is caused by all four dengue virus serotypes in children and adults 9 to 45 years of age [26] . Two seasonal influenza vaccines, the MF59-adjuvanted influenza vaccine and the high-dose influenza vaccine, are now licensed for use in older adults (≥ 65 years of age). It has been shown that the MF59 adjuvant increases humoral immune response to various influenza strains, including cross-reactive strains [27, 28] . A large influenza vaccine study in 7,082 individuals demonstrated significantly higher immunogenicity of MF59-adjuvanted vaccine compared to a conventional non-adjuvanted influenza vaccine for both homologous and heterologous influenza A strains [29] . The immunogenicity and efficacy of high-dose influenza vaccine (60 ug hemagglutinin per strain), compared to standard-dose vaccine (15 ug hemagglutinin per strain), was assessed in a large vaccine study in 31,989 older individuals, which demonstrated the higher immunogenicity of high-dose influenza vaccine compared to conventional vaccine and the improved protection against influenza [30] . However, there is some evidence that AS03 adjuvants used in pandemic influenza vaccines may be associated with the development of autoimmune and neurological disorders, like narcolepsy [31] . Thus, we need a better understanding of determinants of vaccine immunogenicity -both markers that correlate with protection (innate and adaptive antibody and T-cell-mediated cellular) and those that control vaccine failure [32] .

As an example, rates of primary (i.e., lack of antibody following vaccination) and secondary (i.e., waning or inadequate antibody following vaccination) measles vaccine failure are projected to be 2-10% and <0.25%, respectively [33, 34] . Similarly, after three or more doses of hepatitis B vaccine, 5%-10% of persons fail to mount protective titers (≥10 mIU/ml) of hepatitis B surface antigen antibodies [35, 36] . Furthermore, the current inactivated influenza vaccine is deficient in its ability to mount an effective immune response in many aging and older individuals. In fact, it protects, on average, only 30-40% of adults ≥ 65 years old versus 70-90% of younger adults from contracting influenza viral infection [37] .

Although vaccines are one of the most effective public health means for preventing disease and death, they are not perfect and can cause side effects, unforeseen reactions, or vaccine adverse events (AEs). Fortunately, most reactions associated with vaccines are mild, such as redness, soreness, swelling, rash or fever, and transient. Serious AEs after vaccination are uncommon, but they may involve Guillain-Barré syndrome (after swine flu vaccine, under one case per 100,000 vaccinated) [38] [39] [40] , narcolepsy (following a AS03-adjuvanted influenza vaccine, one case per ~16,000 vaccinated) [41, 42] , severe rash and allergic reaction (after influenza, MMR and yellow fever vaccines, one case per ~100,000) [43] [44] [45] , seizures and acute encephalopathy (after whole-cell pertussis vaccine, the estimated risk is 6 to 9 cases per 100,000 vaccinated) [46, 47] , and paralytic polio (after live attenuated oral polio vaccine, 1 case per 2-3 million vaccinated) [48] . Clinical and laboratory research is critical for determining the causal mechanisms of such AEs. Rapid advances in the field of ""adversomics,"" which our group defined as being ""the application of immunogenomics and systems biology to understand the genetic and non-genetic drivers of vaccine AEs at the molecular level,"" are informing the development of new vaccines [49, 50] .

The ultimate goal of vaccine research is to develop better vaccines and new adjuvants against major infectious diseases, including safe and effective vaccines for tuberculosis, rotavirus, malaria, HIV and other emerging and reemerging pathogens. Advancements in healthcare have contributed to the aging of the global population and the growing number of persons with immunocompromising medical conditions. Along the same lines, the population of many developed nations is aging rapidly and so the impact of immunosenescence, or the age-related decline in immune function, must be considered. This is especially important for diseases, such as influenza, with a disproportionate public health impact on older individuals. Additional vaccine strategies are needed to overcome the immunosenescence and immunodeficiencies of these populations. Further efforts are also needed to better understand age-and gender-related changes and defects in the regulation and function of innate and adaptive immune responses to vaccines. This will be essential to the development of vaccines or treatments that overcome immunosenescence [51] [52] [53] .

The continued, widespread acceptance of vaccines remains a critical component to the overall effectiveness of those vaccines in maintaining individual and herd immunity, and therefore public health strategy. While a large percentage of the population still readily accepts vaccines as safe and reliable, a growing subset of the population believes that vaccines are unsafe or potentially even deadly. Generally speaking, this subset believes that vaccines have a higher potential to be dangerous than actually contracting the disease, leading them to make choices against vaccination. Therefore, it is critical that those in the healthcare profession are able to help individuals choose to accept vaccines. However, numerous issues and determinants play out to create hesitancy or refusal to accept vaccines.

In an article by Poland and Bronson [54] , the authors discussed the importance of examining the layers of closely linked factors (proximate determinants) and external factors (nonproximate determinants) affecting vaccine decision making, to address vaccine acceptance or hesitancy. This critical, and often overlooked, point was summarized by saying:

""The reality of childhood vaccination uptake…is much more complex. Proximate determinants don't exist in vacuums. They can and do interact with each other and they can vary from person to person, from group to group and over time in complex, non-intuitive ways. Additionally, non-proximate determinants can also affect how vaccine uptake plays out for both individuals and groups. Psychological, ethical, social, cultural, political, economic, ecological and historical factors, not to mention interpersonal, institutional and state power structures can also influence whether or not children receive vaccines [54] .""

In the third millennium, people are now more ""connected"" than ever before due to ease in global travel, the increase in technology availability and internet access, and the globalization of our society; this in turn complicates the issue of vaccine hesitancy or acceptance. As humans don't exist in a vacuum, neither do the decisions they make. In this millennium, it is critical to address these issues by understanding the various lenses through which individuals make decisions: their personal beliefs, their individual preferred cognitive styles, and the proximate and non-proximate determinants that impact their lives.

In a recent editorial, two of us (CMP, GAP) [55] outlined six preferred cognitive styles an individual may employ in decision making regarding one's health. A cognitive style is simply a preferred way of thinking that helps an individual understand and process the world. When healthcare workers (HCWs) seek to understand an individual's preferred cognitive style and communicate with them based on that style, they can help address vaccine hesitancy in a way that the patient best understands. As a result, the patient may choose to engage in healthy behaviors and choices. The task of processing vaccine hesitancy or rejection with a patient is extremely important, and to do so in such a way that the patient has the best chance of making a wise decision. The Preferred Cognitive Styles and Decision-Making model emphasizes that medicine is increasingly moving to a more individualized style of care, and using a patient's preferred cognitive style (thus employing psychology and mental health within the medical office) allows patients to engage with an even more personalized style of care, while increasing the probability that through health education patients make better informed vaccine decisions. [54] [55] [56] 

As described in the previous sections, new vaccine products have multiple obstacles to overcome: 1) the current set of pathogens for which we desperately need new vaccines are considerably more complex than previous vaccine targets; 2) empirical approaches to vaccine development (Isolate, Inactivate, and Inject) do not work for current pathogens; 3) regulatory hurdles are greater now than they have been in the past; and 4) an increasingly risk-averse culture demands significantly higher safety standards for vaccines. These challengesare counterbalanced by the tremendous advances that have been made in the fields of immunology and vaccinologythat provide exciting tools to overcome these challenges.

Despite the phenomenal success of early vaccines, we still do not fully understand, at a mechanistic level, the rules governing immunogenicity and the development of protective immunity. A collective endeavor to address this knowledge gap, entitled the ""Human Vaccine Project,"" [57] is bringing together researchers, academic institutions, public health agencies, industry, philanthropic foundations, and non-governmental agencies to define the underlying rules of immunogenicity in order to develop safer and more effective vaccines [58, 59] .

We have learned an incredible amount about the immune system in the last decade, including the characterization of new T helper subsets, regulatory T cells, dendritic cells, and macrophages; [60] [61] [62] [63] [64] the recognition of the role of the microbiome and innate immunity in the development and maintenance of robust adaptive immunity; [65] the development and use of novel adjuvants;; [66, 67] and a growing body of research aimed at developing a comprehensive understanding the immune response as an interconnected, networked, complex system. [68] [69] [70] .

Advances in the tools, technologies, and research reagents available for the study of biological systems have also seen recent dramatic changes (Table 3 ). Next-generation sequencing technologies now allow investigators to rapidly sequence pathogen genomes, conduct global gene expression studies with increased sensitivity, identify rare mRNA transcripts, perform alternate splicing, conduct genome-wide DNA methylation analysis, perform ChIP-Seq, and numerous other applications [71] . These technologies are now being adapted to the study of single cells [72] . Advances in multiparameter flow cytometry and the integration of mass spectrometry (CyTOF) enable researchers to simultaneously study 40+ parameters of cellular phenotype and function at an individual cell basis [73] [74] [75] . Cutting-edge bioinformatics algorithms and routines capable of handling ""Big Data"" are providing sophisticated methodologies to integrate, visualize, and interpret these datasets [76] [77] [78] [79] [80] .

We have coined the term ""Vaccinomics"" for systems biology approaches that include immunogenetics and immunogenomics to studying immune responses to vaccines, and applying this knowledge to directed vaccine development. Similar approaches such as ""Systems Vaccinology"" or ""Computational Immunology"" [32, 68, 70, [81] [82] [83] [84] [85] [86] [87] [88] [89] [90] [91] have also been coined. Vaccinomics is a collaborative approach that brings together biology, computer science, statistics, and bioinformatics. Together, these multidisciplinary teams perturb the immune system in carefully controlled ways and collect high-dimensional datasets characterizing the immune response at multiple levels (the transcriptome, the epigenome, the proteome, the metabolome, the lipidome-including individual molecules, cell populations and surface/functional phenotypes, and tissues/organs). The data is then organized, integrated, and mined using sophisticated computer algorithms and bioinformatics approaches in order to develop predictive and/or mechanistic models of immune function [76] . These models are then tested in a new round of experimentation that, in turn, yields additional insights and raises more biological questions.

We believe that this work will be crucial toward understanding the complex interplay between human beings and the pathogens of high public health interest [92] . These types of studies will allow a rationale, logical, and directed approach to developing novel vaccines and improving current ones.

More effective vaccines are also needed for certain population groups. Successful vaccination of older individuals is often complicated by pre-existing medical conditions and medicine usage.. Similarly, infants and young children have immune systems that have not yet fully developed and respond to infection/vaccination differently than adults [93, 94] . The development of more effective vaccines and treatment options for the very young and for older individuals will require a more comprehensive understanding of how the various components of the immune response collectively respond to immunization or infection [95] [96] [97] [98] [99] . Vaccinomics approaches integrating high-dimensional datasets and predictive modeling will likely play a central role in these efforts.

The above brief review highlights the challenges facing the field of vaccinology in the third millennium. There are a few ""foundational pillars"" around which teams of scientists must collaborate: issues of emerging diseases that threaten health of humans and animals; the need for novel vaccine adjuvants; the challenges of vaccine research and development financing; and the science that is developing around the critical need to communicate, educate-and convince-the populace to endorse and accept vaccines.

We also call attention to the growing need for bioinformatics in 21 st century vaccine development. Currently, however, few bioinformaticians are involved in vaccine research; given the early growth of the field, the tools and analytic routines needed for assisting new vaccine development are at an early stage of development. Such tools are needed if we are to take advantage of the economies of ""big data"" [76] .

To the above mix, it is apparent that the costs associated with new vaccine development continue to increase, often requiring $1 billion to get to licensure. This, in turn, requires stable and sustained investment, and a more seamless integration of vaccine financing from basic research, to preclinical development, to clinical development, to population utilization. Currently, this route is expensive, fragmented, discordant, disconnected, and uncertain. This state of affairs leads to more expense, delays in bringing new vaccine candidates into clinical trials, and results in continuing unmet public health needs. A recent editorial reviewed some of these issues and suggested the development of a global vaccine development fund [10] . We find this novel concept to be compelling, as it is highly likely to galvanize the necessary teams of scientists and financial and regulatory infrastructure needed in order to make achievable progress and meet the needs of a diverse and changing global public health need.

• Vaccines have eradicated smallpox, nearly eradicated polio, and resulted in > 99.9% reduction in incidence rates for many diseases • There are significant challenges facing vaccine development for current and emerging diseases (Ebola, HIV, Zika, Malaria).

• New vaccine and adjuvant development is necessary to improve immunogenicity and safety profiles of vaccines.

• New educational methods and outreach programs are needed to combat misinformation and vaccine hesitancy 

A) Pathogens for which we currently lack vaccines (HIV, M. tuberculosis, Ebola, SARS, MERS…). These are completely new pathogens that have not been studied, or are more complex pathogens with immunomodulatory traits or hypervariable genomes for which conventional vaccine development approaches have failed. B) Re-emerging pathogens that current vaccines: have been unable to control or eradicate, elicit marginally protective immunity, have unwanted side effects (rotavirus), require multiple booster immunizations (hepatitis B), or require yearly vaccine reformulation (influenza). C) funding and regulatory issues can be formidable obstacles to the successful research, development, clinical testing, and licensure of new vaccines. These factors may also act as disincentives to even consider vaccine development. D) Anti-vaccination groups are increasingly vocal in their opposition to vaccination. Current communication technologies allow them to rapidly and widely spread their messages against vaccines. As a result safety standards are considerably higher now and public opinion towards a new vaccine must now accurately gauged and considered to an extent never seen before. All images are public domain or are owned by their respective agency/foundation. 

A,B) Cutting edge technologies allow investigators to study the immune system with unprecedented detail and scope. These technologies, along with novel analytical routines designed to handle the massive datasets, will provide greater insights into immune function and vaccine response. Studies targeting adjuvants and innate immune pathways will also be incorporated into the design of more effective vaccines, perhaps involving novel delivery systems such as the intradermal or intranasal routes pictured. B) International partnerships that bring together scientific leaders from academia, product development expertise from industry, public health officials, and funding/support from private foundations and governmental agencies will be necessary to provide the stable, long-term support and resources necessary to create safe and effective vaccines. C) Coordinated educational efforts that encompass multiple traditional and novel communication platforms will allow widespread delivery of scientific knowledge and data-driven findings. Physicians, healthcare providers, and patients will have open dialogues that acknowledge concerns and provide information tailored to the patient's preferred learning styles.

Emotional and Behavioral Consequences of Bioterrorism: Planning a Public Health Response,"Millions of dollars have been spent improving the public health system's bioterrorism response capabilities. Yet relatively little attention has been paid to precisely how the public will respond to bioterrorism and how emotional and behavioral responses might complicate an otherwise successful response. This article synthesizes the available evidence about the likely emotional and behavioral consequences of bioterrorism to suggest what decision makers can do now to improve that response. It examines the emotional and behavioral impact of previous ""bioterrorism-like"" events and summarizes interviews with experts who have responded to such events or conducted research on the effects of communitywide disasters. The article concludes by reflecting on the evidence and experts' perspectives to suggest actions to be taken now and future policy and research priorities.","T he importance of preparing our nation to counter and respond effectively to terrorist threats has been evident since the attacks of September 11, 2001. Of particular concern is the possibility of terrorist attacks involving chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear weapons (CBRN) (Gilmore Commission 2002) . Organized terrorist groups (such as al-Qaeda) have tried to obtain or develop CBRN weapons and have publicly proclaimed that they consider obtaining them to be a religious duty (Lumpkin 2001 ), but they have not yet demonstrated the capability to effectively acquire, create, or use them. Nonetheless, CBRN weapons remain a substantial concern because of their potential to cause widespread death and destruction.

Terrorism using biological weapons is of particular concern because small quantities of biological agents can kill or seriously injure large numbers of people. However, even if there are few casualties, these weapons can have serious and extensive psychological, economic, and political consequences (Gilmore Commission 2002) . Recognizing the threat posed by bioterrorism, the federal government has allocated more than $4 billion to states and communities to improve the public health response to a bioterrorist attack (Gilmore Commission 2002) .

Biological terrorism is likely to differ from conventional terrorism, such as a bombing or hijacking, on a number of dimensions, as illustrated in Table 1 . Given these differences, we might also expect differences in the emotional and behavioral impact of bioterrorism compared with that of other types of terrorist events. For example, the unfamiliarity of biological weapons, the uncertainty in determining whether an attack has occurred and the scope of that attack, and the possibility of contagion and of being an unknowing victim of the attack may heighten the level of fear and anxiety associated with a bioterrorist attack (Alexander and Klein 2003; Demartino 2002; Holloway et al. 1997) .

But precisely how the public will respond to a bioterrorist event is unclear. Some people are concerned that the demand for health care services by the ""worried well""-individuals without an organic etiology of their symptoms (Bartholomew and Wessely 2002) -will overwhelm health resources, even in the event of a very small bioterrorist attack. Based on prior terrorist events such as the sarin gas attacks in Tokyo in 1995, the U.S. Department of Defense estimates that an attack from a CBRN weapon would produce five psychological casualties for every one physical casualty (Warwick 2001) ; other estimates of the ratio of psychological casualties to physical casualties range from 4 to 1 to as high as 50 to 1 (Demartino 2002) . Some experts recommend planning for widespread public panic, whereas others believe that such expectations are misguided (Glass and Schoch-Spana 2002; Pastel 2001; Schoch-Spana 2000) . We do not understand under what circumstances people's emotional reactions will differ. These emotional reactions can range from common distress responses such as fear and anxiety to full-blown psychiatric disorders (Institute of Medicine 2003) . Nor can we now confidently predict how individuals' behavioral reactions to a bioterrorist attack (e.g., seeking health care services) may complicate planned public health responses. This article synthesizes the available evidence about the psychological consequences associated with a bioterrorist event to suggest steps that decision makers can take now to improve their response and to identify the research questions that must be addressed to better prepare the nation to cope with such events. We begin by examining a range of psychological consequences of previous bioterrorist-like events for various populations. We categorized these psychological consequences as emotional consequences and behavioral consequences. Emotional consequences include clinical psychiatric disorders like posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), in which individuals display the full constellation of symptoms and impairment required by clinicians to make a diagnosis. Emotional consequences also include less severe generalized distress and anxiety as well as symptoms of psychiatric disorders that may not meet clinical diagnostic criteria. Behavioral consequences cover such actions as seeking medical services; increasing one's use of tobacco, alcohol, or illicit drugs; avoiding an area; or evacuating a community. Next, we summarize our interviews with experts who have conducted research on communitywide trauma and disaster victims or have designed and implemented psychological response strategies for such events. We conclude by reflecting on the evidence and the experts' perspectives to suggest actions to be taken now and to recommend future research and policy priorities.

We conducted a literature and Web site review from November 2001 to July 2002 to collect information about the psychological consequences of communitywide trauma from manmade, technological, or other terrorist disasters or incidents, such as large-scale terrorist events (e.g., the World Trade Center bombing, 1993; the Oklahoma City federal building bombing, 1995; and the September 11 attacks on the Pentagon and the World Trade Center, 2001). We also looked for information about feared and actual chemical attacks (e.g., Israel SCUD missile, 1994; Tokyo sarin gas, 1995) . The intentional nature of many of these events is comparable to bioterrorism, although many are different in other respects, such as uncertainty of exposure, as highlighted in Table 1 . Our key word search terms included psychological consequences of trauma, terrorism, bioterrorism, biological warfare, and disasters. We also list relevant references that have come to our attention since the original review.

We searched for studies of known events with one or more of the aspects of bioterrorism identified in Table 1 that were not associated with terrorism, such as outbreaks of infectious disease (e.g., the severe acute respiratory syndrome [SARS] epidemic in 2003 and the early days of HIV/AIDS) and industrial events (e.g., the nuclear meltdown at Three Mile Island, Pennsylvania, in 1979). These events differ from bioterrorism in that they were unintentional, but they are better analogues of bioterrorism in regard to their uncertainty of exposure than are many communitywide disasters. Our team members also read articles and books from conference proceedings and reference lists. We reviewed the titles and abstracts of all relevant sources for articles, book chapters, and reports.

To complement the literature review, we interviewed (1) experts with clinical and research experience assessing and responding to the emotional and behavioral consequences of terrorism and disasters and (2) senior policy and operational decision makers with expertise and experience in devising and implementing disaster and terrorism response plans and strategies. We found the interviewees through the literature (e.g., if they had published widely on the topic) or on the basis of their position (e.g., if they were in a position charged with responding to a disaster). The RAND Human Subject Protection Committee reviewed and approved all our study procedures.

These semistructured interviews were designed to explore the challenges of managing emotional and behavioral issues resulting from bioterrorism and to examine how these might differ systematically from those of other types of terrorist events. We also asked about additional resources, tools, and strategies that might be needed at local and state levels to prepare for and respond adequately to bioterrorism.

We asked those interviewees with clinical and research experience to comment on (1) whether the psychological effects of bioterrorism might differ from the effects of other terrorist events, and what these differences might be; (2) to what extent the available data and earlier studies might allow experts to predict the emotional and behavioral consequences of a bioterrorist attack; (3) whether they believed the emotional or behavioral consequences of a bioterrorist attack might be different for populations not in close geographic proximity to the attack and what these differences might be; (4) whether preparedness strategies for bioterrorism needed to be different from strategies for other traumatic or terrorist events and, if so, how; and (5) what the most important advice they could give to senior operational decision makers would be regarding the capacities, preparation, acute response, and long-term response for managing the psychological aspects of bioterrorism.

We asked senior policy and operational decision makers to discuss (1) the current status of federal, state, and local plans to address the emotional and behavioral effects of terrorism; (2) any critical gaps in bioterrorism preparedness; (3) differences between the responses to terrorism and those to bioterrorism; and (4) the information that they would need to respond adequately to bioterrorism, as well as the information most needed by the public.

Our literature review yielded little empirical information about the emotional and behavioral consequences of bioterrorism. We found no empirical studies examining the emotional and behavioral consequences of actual bioterrorism events for directly exposed individuals, and few empirical studies of the emotional and behavioral consequences of bioterrorism for other populations.

Given the lack of terrorism-specific empirical data, we then looked at empirical studies of other events to help us understand and predict the emotional and behavioral consequences of bioterrorism. We organized our findings according to the different populations commonly identified in the trauma field (Norris 2001 ):

• Direct victims, who have suffered an injury, trauma, or other destructive result from an event (Frederick 1987 ). • The general public, whose exposure to an event is most commonly through the media-TV, radio, newspapers, and the Internet-as well as through conversations with family and friends. • First responders, such as police, firefighters, or emergency medical technicians, whose occupations require them to respond to the needs of those exposed to a disaster. • Vulnerable populations, who may be more susceptible to the emotional and behavioral consequences of a disaster as a result of predisposing personal characteristics, such as children (Flynn and Nelson 1998) , those with preexisting psychological problems (Kessler et al. 1999; North et al. 1999) , and those with physical disabilities (Orr and Pitman 1999) .

Some characteristics of bioterrorism may influence the composition of these groups. Uncertainty about exposure to a biological agent and whether one was directly exposed is likely to increase fear and anxiety among the general public. Similar to what may happen in some chemical events, this uncertainty may occur even in situations with low levels of exposure and not only in the early phases of an attack but even for months or years after an attack (Hyams, Murphy, and Wessely 2002) . The risk of emotional and behavioral consequences for these individuals may mirror those of victims for whom exposure is documented. Similarly, the first responders to a bioterrorist event are likely to encompass more than the traditional emergency response community (fire, emergency medical service [EMS] personnel, police, search and rescue), to include hospital emergency department personnel, primary care physicians, and others working in the public health care system (Benedek, Holloway, and Becker 2002) . In fact, if a covert release of a biological agent does not immediately result in symptoms, the traditional first responders may not be called, and the first responders would be mainly health care workers (Gilmore Commission 1999 . In a covert bioterrorist attack during which the first indication of the event is the increased presentation of affected individuals at health care facilities, health care workers may initially have the highest morbidity rates, as was observed in health care workers in China and other countries in Asia following the outbreak of SARS (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2003) .

Much of the literature we reviewed provides a theoretical or conceptual discussion of the psychological consequences of disasters and terrorism, comments on the resources and strategies needed to prepare for the emotional and behavioral consequences of terrorism and disasters, or describes the emotional and behavioral sequelae in victim populations, with a heavy emphasis on assessing symptoms of PTSD in various victim populations. The assessment of disorders such as PTSD offers useful information for predicting the early and longer-term clinical mental health needs of affected populations. This literature does not, however, offer much information about other emotional and behavioral responses and their effect on functioning. Such information would be useful for planning early large-scale intervention strategies and predicting how the majority of people, who are unlikely to develop clinical psychiatric disorders such as PTSD, would respond to a bioterrorist event.

The following tables highlight our findings from empirical studies of the major emotional and behavioral consequences for each victim group associated with three types of large-scale trauma: mass violence/conventional terrorism, industrial events/chemical terrorism, and infectious disease outbreaks. The tables are organized by victim population and type of event. Table 2 lists examples of studies that examined emotional and behavioral consequences for direct victims; Tables 3 and 4 describe these issues in the general population and first responders, respectively; and Table 5 focuses on two large vulnerable populations, children and individuals with drug and alcohol problems.

Emotional and Behavioral Consequences for Direct Victims. Research on disasters has found that mass violence is the most psychologically disturbing type of disaster. One review suggested that as many as two-thirds of those directly exposed are psychologically impaired to some degree (Beaton and Murphy 2002) . As Table 2 explains, those directly exposed to mass violence and conventional terrorism experience a wide range of emotional and behavioral consequences, such as clinical PTSD, posttraumatic stress symptoms that do not meet the criteria for PTSD, other anxiety disorders, depression, and substance use problems. The documented prevalence of such problems varies widely for different events and may be attributed to differences in study methodologies (including screening methods and timing), as well as to differences in the populations studied and the traumatic events. Most studies screen victims to identify symptoms of posttraumatic stress and to determine whether the victims meet the criteria for PTSD. The severity of symptoms may not meet the criteria for some victims at the first screening, but if left untreated, these symptoms may become more severe in the following months and thus meet the criteria later.

Technological and industrial events and terrorism using chemical agents may also be important analogues of a bioterrorist event, but they differ from bioterrorism in important ways. Because these events are not intentional, they are likely to generate less fear and anxiety. Terrorist attacks using chemical agents do not present the same risk of contagion as many bioterrorist events do. In many cases, individuals in close geographic proximity to the event may also depend on the source of the disaster for jobs and for economic support of the region. Despite these differences, studies show that even several years after these events, many people continue to have emotional distress and physical (e.g., somatic) symptoms unrelated to the amount of exposure.

Reports of the emotional and behavioral reactions by persons affected by SARS and botulism may also inform expectations for likely reactions to bioterrorism, including the need for psychosocial interventions to relieve anxiety and depression. Before much is known about a novel infection, such as SARS or HIV/AIDS, those victims directly exposed and those thought to be potential vectors may also be stigmatized (Blendon Terrorist attacks in France between 1982 and 1987. Of 254 survivors of terrorist attacks assessed one to five years after the attack, 18% continued to have posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Uninjured victims were least likely to have PTSD; the most severely injured individuals were the most likely to have PTSD. Abenhaim, Dab, and Salmi 1992 Bombing in Enniskillen, Northern Ireland, November 1987. Of 26 victims referred for medicolegal assessment six months after the event, 13 met criteria for PTSD. At 12 months, 12 of the 13 met criteria for PTSD. Females were more likely to have PTSD. Curran et al. 1990 Cafeteria shooting spree in Killeen, Texas, 24 killed, October 1991. Among the civilian population exposed to the shooting spree, the most common postdisaster reactions were alcohol abuse in men and major depression for women. Six to eight weeks after the disaster, 26% of survivors met diagnostic criteria for PTSD; at one year, 14%; and at a three-year follow-up, 18%. One-third of the women with PTSD also met diagnostic criteria for major depression, as did one-fourth of the men who had PTSD. North, McCutcheon, et al. 2002 Forty-five percent of survivors experienced a postevent psychiatric disorder. Up to three years later, one-third of survivors reported anxiety and depression.

Terrorist attacks on World Trade Center and Pentagon, September 2001. Seven months following the attack, 14% of respondents in one of the Pentagon commands displayed symptoms consistent with probable PTSD, and 13% reported using more alcohol than intended. Grieger et al. 2003 Industrial Events/Chemical Terrorism Radiation event in Goiania, Brazil, with unintentional exposure to radioactive cesium isotope, September 1987. More than three years after the event, individuals in the affected community with anticipatory stress about radiation exposure had performance decrements and neuroendocrine alterations indicative of stress-related concentration deficit comparable to that of individuals with exposure to radioactive cesium isotope. Both groups were significantly different from community controls.

Unintentional release of hazardous chemicals, Texas

City, Texas, October-November 1987. Two years after the unintentional release, 20% to 30% of people highly exposed to the unintentional release had somatic complaints, including dizziness, chest pain, nausea, and weakness, numbness, or tingling of body parts. Those with the highest level of exposure had a high dose-response relationship between exposure and severe individual symptoms for organ/function systems that were more likely to be directly related to exposure (e.g., throat, skin, inhalation). In the highly exposed group, those with emotional distress were significantly more likely to have physical symptoms that did not appear to be caused by exposure to the chemical. Emotional distress was also significantly related to all somatic symptoms in individuals who had only intermediate levels of exposure to the chemical. Dayal et al. 1994 Sarin gas attack in Tokyo subway, March 1995. More than 1,000 individuals experienced some degree of acute or chronic gas exposure, and 13 people died. Approximately 4,500 individuals who sought medical services but could not be determined to suffer from nerve gas exposure were considered psychological casualties. Many of those involved in this attack suffered some physical symptoms or emotional reactions for at least one year following the attack. Okumura et al. 1998 Approximately 60% of individuals who presented at St. Luke's International Hospital following the sarin attack suffered from posttraumatic stress symptoms that persisted longer than six months. Ohbu et al. 1997 Victims of the sarin attack continued to suffer from physical symptoms and emotional reactions five years after the terrorist incidents, most commonly eye problems and depressed mood.

Kawana, Ishimatsu, and Kanda 2001 following the outbreak, family members of patients expressed several emotional reactions, including concern, worry, fear, and pressure to be with the patient at all times. Data on affective responses were gathered from the patient and family members during week 1 and week 2 of the illness outbreak (before and after the initial informational group meetings for families). Participants rated, on a 10-point scale, their level of anxiety, fear, helplessness, depression, and anger. Levels of anxiety, fear, helplessness, and depression decreased over the two-week period for family members. Levels of anger remained the same in both patients and family members. For patients, while levels of anxiety, fear, and helplessness decreased over the two weeks, the level of self-reported depression significantly increased.

SARS outbreak in Toronto, March-April 2003. Patients deprived of family visits experienced insomnia, anxiety, and interpersonal friction with staff. Pharmacological and behavioral interventions to treat insomnia were used extensively.

Biological Terrorism Suspected anthrax package in South Wales, 13 people exposed, October 2002. Using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression (HAD) scale one week following the event, the authors documented anxiety (HAD anxiety score > 10) in 45% of those exposed. Anxiety score was significantly higher in persons exposed to the hoax anthrax package compared with unexposed matched controls. Depression scores were not different between the groups. Mason and Lyons 2003 and Donelan 1988; Gostin, Bayer, and Fairchild 2003) , which in turn may intensify the emotional consequences of the disorder.

To date, there have been few bioterrorist events, and no empirically based articles documenting the emotional and behavioral reactions of direct victims of bioterrorist events, including the populations exposed and treated during the anthrax attacks in the fall of 2001 in the United States. One study did report on emotional reactions following a hoax event in South Wales and found that individuals had significantly more symptoms of anxiety immediately following the hoax (Mason and Lyons 2003) .

Emotional and Behavioral Consequences for the General Population. Table 3 shows how large catastrophic events, similar to a bioterrorist event, affect the general population.

Before September 11, 2001, the only study of how intentional mass violence or conventional terrorism affected the public examined the effects of the bombing of the federal building in Oklahoma City in April 1995. It documented posttraumatic stress symptoms among residents who did not hear, see, or feel the explosion.

Studies conducted in the immediate aftermath of the September 11 terrorist attacks discovered a range of emotional and behavioral reactions, both in the cities where the attacks occurred and across the country. Subsequent surveys found a decrease in the prevalence of more severe emotional distress reactions in the general public (Silver et al. 2002; Stein et al. 2004 ) but also noted changes in health-related behaviors, such as a persistent increase in the use of cigarettes, alcohol, and marijuana in New York (Vlahov et al. 2004 ) and an increase in missed doses and suboptimal doses of antiretroviral therapies in HIV-positive men in New York City (Halkitis et al. 2003) .

Several studies have followed community members in surrounding areas after industrial events (e.g., unintentional releases of hazardous chemical or radioactive substances) and could be helpful in understanding the emotional and behavioral consequences for persons geographically distant from an event. These studies found that at the time of an event, many individuals may be fearful, anxious, and present for screening related to the noxious agent. In at least one event (e.g., the Chernobyl nuclear disaster in the Soviet Union in 1986), the emotional impact may persist for years, manifested as a higher rate of depression and mood disorders (Havenaar et al. 1997) . substantial emotional stress three to five days following the attacks. Individuals experiencing substantial emotional stress engaged in coping strategies (e.g., talking to others, turning to religion, checking on family members and friends) more often than did those without such reactions. Schuster et al. 2001 One to two months after the attacks, estimates of probable PTSD in areas close to the attack ranged from 3% (for the Washington, D.C., metro area) to 11% (for the NYC metro area). Estimate of probable PTSD in rest of country was 4%. Schlenger et al. 2002 One to two months following the attacks, 8% of Manhattan residents reported symptoms consistent with PTSD and 10% consistent with depression. Among Manhattan residents in closest geographic proximity (south of Canal Street near the WTC), the prevalence was as high as 20%. Galea et al. 2002 Seventeen percent of the U.S. population outside New York City had posttraumatic stress symptoms two months after the attack; 6% at six months. Prior depression or anxiety was associated with higher levels of posttraumatic stress symptoms. Silver et al. 2002 Five to eight weeks after the attacks, increased use of cigarettes, alcohol, and marijuana was found among New York City residents living closest to the affected area and was associated with higher prevalence of current PTSD or current depression. Vlahov et al. 2002 Three to six months after the attacks, 18% of 1,009 individuals interviewed in Manhattan had symptoms severe enough to put them at risk for PTSD. Only 27% of these individuals were receiving counseling or psychiatric treatment. DeLisi et al. 2003 One to three months following the attacks, the three states in closest proximity to the WTC (N.Y., N.J., and Conn.) added a terrorism module to their ongoing Behavioral Risk Factors Surveillance System. In this survey of noninstitutionalized U.S. adults, they found that 3% reported being direct victims of the attack (7% had relatives and 14% had friends who were victims), and 75% reported having problems that they attributed to the attack.

Industrial Events/Chemical Terrorism Unintentional release of radiation at Three Mile Island, Pennsylvania, March 1979. More individuals in the surrounding community evacuated than were actually advised to do so. Houts, Cleary, and Hu 1988 Almost 18 months after the event, chronic stress syndromes, anxiety, somatic complaints, feelings of alienation, and physiological markers of stress were higher in the surrounding community than in comparison communities. Baum, Fleming, and Singer 1983; Baum, Gatchel, and Schaeffer 1983 . In a small study of the long-term effects of the Chernobyl disaster, higher rates of mood disorder were found in local residents ten years after the nuclear catastrophe; mothers with children under the age of 18 had the highest levels of psychopathology. Children in the affected area had higher rates of thyroid cancer, which may have contributed to the mothers' psychopathology. This study highlighted the long-term emotional consequences associated with a radiological disaster that produced major health consequences for the individuals exposed. Havenaar et al. 1997 Radiological incident in Goiania, Brazil, September 1987. Only 250 persons were actually exposed to the radioactive substance: 125,000 people (13% of population) requested screening. Five thousand (8%) of the first 60,000 seeking medical care when the incident became public had physical symptoms that mimicked actual symptoms of exposure.

Unintentional release of 19,000 gallons of metam sodium, northern California, July 1991. Residents living near an unintentional release of 19,000 gallons of metam sodium, a toxic pesticide, experienced significant emotional and physical complications three to four months after the event. They had more depression, anxiety, and adverse health symptoms than did matched control subjects. Bowler et al. 1994 SCUD missile attacks in Israel during Gulf War, 1992. At the time of the attacks, 773 civilians were taken to 12 different hospitals: 43% were identified as ""psychological casualties,"" and 27% had mistakenly used the antidote for chemical exposure. Bleich et al. 1992 During the period of the attacks, a 250% increase was reported in the risk of clinical depression among the Israeli population. Lomranz et al. 1994 Sarin gas attack in Tokyo subway, March 1995. More than 4,500 individuals from the Tokyo population were labeled ""psychological casualties"" because they presented with physical symptoms unrelated to direct exposure to the sarin gas. It is not known how many were at the subway at the time of the attack, how many were responders, and how many were in general population. Two months following the first confirmed case, more than 75% of Americans surveyed believed they would survive if they contracted inhalational anthrax. Blendon et al. 2001 Less than 25% of Americans surveyed within two to four weeks of the anthrax attacks reported taking emergency precautions because of concerns of bioterrorism; there was no difference between areas with and without anthrax cases. Less than 10%

of Americans reported avoiding public events owing to concerns of bioterrorism; there was no difference between areas with and without anthrax cases. Blendon et al. 2001 There was no large-scale increase in the demand on the health care system following the anthrax attacks. ""His/her own doctor"" was viewed as most trustworthy source of reliable information in the event of bioterrorism in a community. residents surveyed during the SARS outbreak reported they would agree to be quarantined if exposed to SARS. Twenty-four percent of Toronto residents who were quarantined or had a family member or friend quarantined for SARS reported it was a major problem; 51% said it was a minor problem. Emotional difficulty from being confined was the most common major problem.

Several studies examined the impact on the general population of the SARS outbreak in 2003. These studies found higher levels of anxiety in much of the general population. This anxiety was often related to the increased use of precautionary measures against SARS but was not associated with a greater use of health services (Blendon et al. 2004; Leung et al. 2003; Quah and Hin-Peng 2004) .

Until the anthrax attacks, our nation had not yet experienced a deadly bioterrorist event. Several years ago, some salad bars in Oregon were intentionally poisoned in order to influence a local election, but no empirical data were collected on the emotional and behavioral consequences of this event. At the time of our literature review, no studies had been published that assessed the emotional reactions of those people exposed to anthrax in the fall of 2001. Reports of the public health response and surveys of attitudes toward and opinions about the anthrax attacks and the risk of bioterrorism are informative, however. Despite the relatively narrow scope of the attack, more than 30,000 individuals were offered prophylactic antibiotics by public health officials (Gerberding, Hughes, and Koplan 2002) , and many more appear to have sought antibiotics on their own (Shaffer et al. 2003) . But the majority of Americans reported that they did not take emergency precautions or visit their doctor, with no difference in behavior in those living in areas either with or without anthrax cases (Blendon et al. 2001) .

Emotional and Behavioral Consequences for First Responders. First responders-those who respond to disasters and terrorist events and care for both survivors and those lost-must enter dangerous environments where their own health and well-being may be harmed and where they may witness mass carnage and destruction. A fair amount of literature discusses the emotional repercussions of such experiences in the first responder communities, traditionally thought of as police, fire, and EMS personnel, particularly in those who responded to the Oklahoma City bombing and the World Trade Center attacks (Table 4 ). These studies suggest that the experience of responding to these events placed these individuals at a significantly higher risk for symptoms of PTSD.

The emotional and behavioral reactions of health care workers responding to the SARS epidemic were examined in medical personnel in Hong Kong and Toronto. Their emotional distress was higher than that of the general population, and while most continued to care for their patients, a number of hospital staff were reported to have refused work 2001. In reports discussing the mental health response to the Pentagon attacks, authors cited anecdotal reports of the emotional consequences of recovering bodies, pulling victims from the scene, and going through the rubble and remains. The authors also noted that workers reported sleeping difficulty, stress, and anxiety during their mission as well as in the aftermath. Although these symptoms were not clinically assessed and empirically documented, they were widely cited in reports and articles.

In a mental health needs assessment for New York State conducted one month following the attacks, researchers estimated that approximately 24% of rescue workers would meet criteria for PTSD and require treatment.

Herman, Felton, and Susser 2002 Richardson et al. 1987 HIV/AIDS, Chicago, 1987. Nearly 90% of the nurses and more than half of the physicians surveyed reported worries about treating persons with AIDS. Seventy-two percent of nurses and 57% of physicians worried about their own health; 56% of nurses and 41% of physicians worried about being infected by treating these patients; and 37% of nurses and 25% of physicians worried about infecting their families. Nurses were also less likely than physicians or social workers to report always being comfortable talking with AIDS patients. Dworkin, Albrecht, and Cooksey 1991 SARS outbreak in Toronto, 2003 . One month following the first SARS case, retrospective analyses indicated that the prominent reactions among hospital staff were fear, anxiety, anger, frustration, fatigue, insomnia, irritability, and decreased appetite. Anxiety worsened when isolation procedures changed, staff entered quarantine/ treatment, staff developed fevers, or staff were admitted with an unclear source of infection. Many staff were conflicted between their professional responsibility as health care providers and feeling fearful and guilty about potentially transmitting illness to their loved ones. Nurses on the SARS unit did not refuse work Maunder et al. 2003 assignments, but some professional and nonprofessional staff on general medical floors refused to care for patients with SARS. Twenty-nine percent of respondents in a hospital survey during the SARS outbreak experienced emotional distress, more than double that seen in a general population survey. Nurses and allied health care professionals had significantly greater emotional distress than did doctors and staff not working in patient care. Part-time employees were also more likely to have significant emotional distress. Nickell et al. 2004 SARS outbreak in Hong Kong, 2003 . Sixteen percent of family physicians surveyed during and immediately after the SARS outbreak reported spending less time with patients; 7% avoided physical examinations. Physicians in private clinics were more likely than those in public clinics to quarantine themselves for a ten-day period after contacting a SARS patient (58% versus 31%). Physicians in private clinics were less likely than those in public clinics to report staying away from home to protect their family (5% versus 19%).

Industrial Events/Chemical Terrorism Sarin gas attack in Tokyo subway, March 1995. Secondary contamination was found in 10% of firefighters and emergency medical service workers, and 20% of hospital staff because of lack of decontamination procedures. Okumura et al. 1998 Eighty-seven hazardous materials incidents in Washington State, December 1997-October 1999. Somatization was the only psychological score statistically elevated above the normative population within 40 days of exposure;

prior treatment for a psychological condition was associated with an increased risk of somatization. Kovalchick et al. 2002 assignments, and a few family physicians avoided physically examining patients or stayed away from home to protect their family (Maunder et al. 2003; Nickell et al. 2004; Wong et al. 2004 ). Many of the emotional and behavioral reactions and fears of contagion reported by health care workers in response to SARS are similar to those documented more than a decade ago in the early phases of the HIV/AIDS epidemic (Dworkin, Albrecht, and Cooksey 1991; Gallop et al. 1992; Richardson et al. 1987; Searle 1987; Treiber, Shaw, and Malcolm 1987) .

Less has been written about first responders, emergency workers, and health care professionals responding to industrial events or chemical exposures, but what is available indicates that these groups are at risk for secondary contamination as well as primary contamination and are also at a higher risk of emotional distress.

Emotional and Behavioral Consequences for Vulnerable Populations. Many studies have identified factors that put individuals at risk for more serious emotional and behavioral consequences following a disaster; fewer studies have specifically examined the emotional and behavioral impact of mass violence and terrorism in vulnerable populations. Table 5 focuses on two particularly vulnerable populations: children and those with a history of psychiatric disorders or psychological problems.

Studies of children suggest that they may warrant special attention and may be at greater risk than adults are of developing emotional distress and other adverse behavioral consequences of terrorism. The data on individuals with current and previous psychiatric disorders are mixed. Many studies found that individuals with a previous psychiatric illness were more likely to develop posttraumatic stress symptoms. However, studies that specifically looked at persons who currently had clinical disorders (substance abuse, PTSD, etc.) had differing results regarding how the disaster affected health care service use, increase in illness severity, or return to substance use.

General Lessons from the Literature Review. The studies just summarized defined the populations of interest in slightly different ways and used different methods to assess emotional and behavioral reactions. Therefore, comparisons across studies must be made with care. Nevertheless, our literature review of the emotional and behavioral consequences of earlier terrorist events, communitywide disasters, and potentially analogous events offered several lessons that can help us prepare for future bioterrorist events. Clinical needs assessment conducted with sixth-to-twelfth-grade students seven weeks after the bombing found that posttraumatic stress symptoms were significantly higher in females, children who knew someone injured or killed, and children who reported watching more bombing-related television news coverage. Pfefferbaum et al. 1999 Seven weeks following the attack, a majority of children in the Oklahoma City area reported fear that a friend or someone in their family would be hurt and reported being nervous or afraid; 40% felt helpless. Fear, arousal, and dissociation at the time of the bombing was the strongest predictor of posttraumatic stress symptoms, more important than physical exposure, relationship to direct victims, bomb-related television viewing, and continued safety concerns. Pfefferbaum et al. 2002 Terrorist attacks on World Trade Center (WTC) and Pentagon, September 2001. Three to five days after the attack, almost one-third of children ages five to 18 in households in a national survey had emotional stress symptoms, and 42% discussed safety fears with their parents. Schuster et al. 2001 One to two months after the attacks, parents in 48% of households with children reported that at least one child in the household was upset by the attacks on Sept. 11. Twenty percent of these children had trouble sleeping; 30% were irritable, grouchy, or easily upset; and 27% were described as fearing separation from their parents. Schlenger et al. 2002 Twenty-two percent of parents living in lower Manhattan surveyed five to eight weeks after the attacks reported that their children had received some form of counseling related to their experiences after the WTC attack. More than half of the counseling was delivered in schools. Stuber et al. 2002 Within two months following the attacks, an increased demand for drug and alcohol treatment was found among individuals with preexisting psychological problems in 13 states and four major cities.

Significant increase was reported in children's visits to behavioral health clinics for acute and posttraumatic stress reactions and other anxiety disorders at military treatment facilities within 50 miles of Washington, D.C., for five months after Sept. 11, compared with same period in the previous two years. Hoge, Pavlin, and Milliken 2002 Survey of drug users conducted between one and four months following the attacks found significant anxiety, anger, and sadness; increase in drug use was as common as reductions in drug use. Weiss et al. 2002 • A broad range of emotional and behavioral reactions are likely after an event. • Widespread emotional reactions such as fear and anxiety are the most common. Less common is the development of clinical disorders such as PTSD. Many reports, however, do not clearly differentiate the level of emotional reactions (e.g., clinical levels of PTSD versus subclinical levels of symptoms of posttraumatic stress versus more general anxiety), thereby making a comparison of the studies difficult. • Events in which the perceived threat is greater than the tangible exposure (e.g., biological events, radiological exposure, many chemical events) are likely to stimulate more sustained emotional and behavioral consequences. • When the perceived threat is greater than the tangible exposure, a relatively large number of people in the nearby population may change their behavior with respect to seeking medical care. This effect should not be equated with panic. Rather, these people often present with physical (e.g., somatic) complaints or for screening. Little empirical research, however, has systematically examined the relationship between emotional reactions and behavioral reactions after such events.

The experts we interviewed generally agreed on the important differences between bioterrorism and other events, but they offered a variety of opinions about what these differences implied for planning and research. Several interviewees noted that the plans and preparation for bioterrorism must go well beyond what is currently in place for other types of communitywide disasters. For example, uncertainty about exposure means that individuals across broad geographic areas are likely to perceive themselves as being at risk following a bioterrorist event, even if all confirmed cases are confined to a single state or geographic region. Accordingly, a response plan should extend beyond those areas in which there have been documented infections. Commenting on the experience of the anthrax attacks, one expert observed that a bioterrorist attack anywhere in the country would require public health officials in all 50 states to activate some components (e.g., heightened surveillance) of their response plan. As was noted, ""A new model [will be needed] for responding in a situation with cross-jurisdictional issues.""

All the experts agreed that effective communication will be critical to addressing the public's fear and anxiety in the event of a bioterrorist attack and reducing the likelihood that unaffected individuals will flood the public health triage system. Several experts emphasized the importance of local risk communication strategies to complement the information likely to be provided by national authorities. As one interviewee remarked, ""National messages just aren't very personal."" But several experts maintained that we lacked empirical data to modify the communication strategies necessary for bioterrorism. According to one expert, ""We really don't understand the psychological context in which we are delivering our messages, nor whether they are really addressing the needs of the community. We need to better understand [it] so we can modify our messages and target our outreach.""

Another interviewee added, ""Communities are not made up of homogenous groups. In order to respond effectively, we must strive to understand how different subgroups will respond differently."" According to several others, ""We need a new model of how to deliver mental health support and services for bioterrorism."" Many felt that organizations like schools, churches, employee assistance programs, and employers who already have relationships with large and specific segments of the community would be an important part of such a response. Such organizations can help educate the public, offering basic knowledge of biological agents and likely public health response plans and thereby enhancing the public's understanding and preparedness. These organizations are also well positioned to give information and support to individuals with particular concerns or needs, thus greatly increasing the effectiveness of the overall response. But several interviewees observed that ""we probably need organized efforts to train ministers, teachers, and others about their potential roles in psychological management"" after a bioterrorist attack. An additional benefit of a broad-based community response noted by several experts is that it would concentrate more on individual and community resiliency and less on emotional reactions and clinical psychiatric disorders.

Many interviewees pointed out that while we have effective treatment for individuals with PTSD from a variety of traumatic events, we currently know little about what helps those traumatized by mass violence, in which many in a community are traumatized by a single event. Many echoed the consensus panel of the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), which called for a larger base of evidence regarding effective early interventions for specific populations across different settings. The interviewees also recognized the importance of determining how to treat effectively those persons who do develop psychiatric disorders, such as PTSD and major depression, as a result of bioterrorism. However, the experts also felt that relatively few would develop psychiatric disorders such as PTSD and major depression solely as a result of a bioterrorist attack and suggested that efforts to improve services to such individuals should not distract policymakers from the more global issues of managing changes in behavior (e.g., staying home, becoming hypervigilant, demanding more health care information, avoiding community involvement) that could be associated with bioterrorism. Several experts also noted that bioterrorism presents the additional challenge of devising plans to support health care workers, first responders, and others important to an effective public health response to a bioterrorist event, a response that is likely to be characterized by greater uncertainty about the level of risk for longer periods than in most other disasters.

As highlighted in our review of the literature and interviews with experts, policymakers making bioterrorism prevention and response plans face many critical gaps in knowledge, such as the following:

1. What are the range and severity of the expected emotional and behavioral consequences? 2. To what extent will these emotional and behavioral consequences affect the public health response? 3. How can our preparation and response to bioterrorism capitalize on and enhance the effectiveness of natural supports in our society? 4. What aspects of risk communication are most useful for and appropriate to a response to bioterrorism? 5. What interventions should be used to reduce the emotional and behavioral consequences of a bioterrorism event?

The Uncertain Nature of the Threat

The increased psychological effect that results from uncertain exposure to an invisible agent has previously been recognized (Holloway et al. 1997) . Many experts noted that this uncertainty requires the modification of many existing disaster response plans. These concerns also were supported by our literature review, which found high rates of emotional distress and behavioral changes stemming from those events that included uncertainty about exposure. Furthermore, in a bioterrorist event, the lag between exposure and the development of symptoms may exacerbate this uncertainty. Inaccurate knowledge about the organism involved may also hamper response plans and should be addressed by public health education programs. For example, for months after the anthrax attacks, many Americans were still not sure whether anthrax was contagious, despite media announcements that it was not (Blendon et al. 2002; Lisa Meredith, personal communication, February 13, 2003) . The public and the health care community should be given basic knowledge of the organisms likely to be used in a bioterrorist event and the planned public health response (Ferguson et al. 2003) . Such efforts would remove some of the uncertainty among the public and first responders and would begin to define some of the risk/benefit issues with regard to a response. One component of response plans about which we know very little is how the behavior of those responsible for coordinating and conducting an effective public health response would be affected by uncertainty about exposure. Not only could these persons be at risk as a result of their professional activities, but in a number of scenarios their families also might be at risk. The actions of the first responders and health care professionals cannot be taken for granted. One survey of physicians reported that more than half would not be willing to put themselves at risk of contracting a deadly illness in order to save the lives of others in the event of a bioterrorist attack (Alexander and Wynla 2003) , and fewer than half of emergency department physicians surveyed were willing to get the smallpox vaccine (Kwon et al. 2003) . Such attitudes and behaviors on the part of health care professionals are not unique to bioterrorism and were expressed during both the SARS outbreak of 2003 and the early years of the HIV/AIDS epidemic.

Providing rapid and accurate information to the public in the event of a bioterrorist event is, therefore, critical to reducing uncertainty (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services 2002) and should be joined by the efforts of local, state, and federal governments to enhance surveillance for a bioterrorist attack and increase lab capacity to rapidly identify a bioterrorist agent. By its very nature, however, bioterrorism will always carry with it a high level of uncertainty, particularly during the early stages of an attack. Accordingly, response and mitigation plans must be designed with this inherent uncertainty in mind. Robust strategies are needed to address the needs of communities that are unsure of their level of risk and recognize that this uncertainty may also affect the behavior of first responders and health care professionals.

Currently, however, we have little empirical information about how uncertainty regarding the threat or level of risk affects an individual's emotional and behavioral reaction. Studies of those persons exposed to anthrax will increase our understanding of these reactions related to bioterrorism. In addition, we should study events that, while not bioterrorism, are sufficiently similar that they can help us understand the public's emotional and behavioral reactions when facing an event with an unknown level of risk. Recent examples include the spread of West Nile virus and the SARS infection, as well as the HIV/AIDS epidemic (Nicholas, Tredoux, and Daniels 1994) . In such cases, in which exposure to the threat is not apparent, how do people determine their own risk of exposure (and that of their families), and how does this perceived risk affect behavior of the general public, first responders, and health care workers?

In the past, planners and policymakers were often able to assume that the duration of the actual disaster would be relatively brief. Therefore, their plans to address the psychological impact of disasters often relied on the deployment of mental health professionals after the event. A bioterrorist attack, however, may require the public to shelter-in-place for an extended period or to observe social distance practice and contact management (e.g., isolation, quarantine, and other restrictions on movement) in order to control the risk of contagion, thus needing emotional and behavioral supports during the event and perhaps complicating the deployment of mental health professionals.

One way to address these issues is to include natural support systems, such as schools, family physicians, and clergy and other faith-based organizations, in communitywide emotional and behavioral response preparation and planning. These natural supports are often not formally integrated into a community's disaster response plan, even though their importance in helping individuals deal with disasters and other traumatic events has been widely demonstrated Silver et al. 2002; Stein et al. 2004) . Support systems also provide a natural avenue through which to educate the public as part of preparing for and responding to a bioterrorist event.

The extent to which people can draw on natural support systems over time is limited (Pennebaker and Harber 1993) , and little is known about how more formal mental health response systems will function under conditions of continuing and uncertain risk. We therefore should look at how people use the natural emotional supports in their community to help them cope over time when a threat does not pass quickly (e.g., SARS; the Washington, D.C., snipers; West Nile virus). There is little doubt that the support of family, friends, the clergy, and others to whom people naturally turn will be vital after a bioterrorist event. Policymakers and planners will be able to make better-informed decisions about the best use of such resources in preparing for and responding to a bioterrorist event by examining the following issues:

• How should schools, faith-based organizations, and the health care system prepare for such events, particularly with respect to educating the public and first responders? • How should schools, faith-based organizations, and the health care system mitigate and manage the emotional and behavioral issues associated with such events? • How can we best use natural support systems to provide emotional support following a bioterrorist event? • How can the educational materials commonly distributed by professional organizations and experts to help people cope be more useful during these more sustained events, or how can they be improved?

Numerous efforts are now under way to help local, state, and national public officials refine their risk communication strategies, particularly those involving the media (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services 2002). These efforts are based on well-developed theories and their application after events such as exposure to industrial hazards and contaminated drinking supplies (Commission on Risk Perception and Communication 1989; Fischhoff 1995; Johnson and Slovic 1995; Rowan 1994; Sandman 1991 Sandman , 1993 . The applicability of such events to bioterrorism, however, may be limited because of bioterrorism's intentional nature and the relative unfamiliarity of both the public and medical community with the likely agents. It is important to understand how risk communication strategies can best address sociocultural differences. As was apparent in the aftermath of both the anthrax attacks and the smallpox inoculation efforts, different groups in our society have very different life experiences and beliefs through which they view official communications regarding bioterrorism and related health behaviors. The collaborative and multigroup approach that the Institute of Medicine recommends is essential to a public health approach to these issues (Institute of Medicine 2003). Better understanding these issues must be a priority, especially considering the importance of risk communication to mediating, mitigating, or promulgating emotional and behavioral responses in the event of a bioterrorist attack, and given the reality that an effective public health response will likely require communitywide action.

Events other than bioterrorism, in which the certainty about the level of risk to a community is not known, may provide an opportunity to evaluate the impact of different risk communication strategies. Collaboration among researchers, decision makers, and funding agencies before such an event would allow the development of a research design that could be used to test the effectiveness of different risk communication strategies. This planning would allow an investigation to be fielded quite rapidly, thus beginning to build an evidence base on which future risk communication strategies could be built.

The NIMH's consensus report on early intervention after mass trauma acknowledges that the current evidence from randomized, well-controlled trials cannot definitively confirm or refute the effectiveness of such early interventions. But even this limited evidence does permit several conclusions: (1) any early intervention should consider the hierarchy of a victim's needs, including safety, food, and shelter; and (2) the important elements of early intervention activities are an assessment of needs, the dissemination of information and the education of directly affected individuals and the general public, and the facilitation of natural support networks (National Institute of Mental Health 2002).

We do have effective treatments for adults and children with clinical disorders such as PTSD and depression that commonly occur after trauma. Several experts underscored the importance of ensuring that individuals with such disorders have access to these evidence-based treatments in both traditional mental health treatment settings and other less traditional settings, such as primary care for adults and schools for children. Few studies, however, have examined the effectiveness of such interventions delivered in such settings (Stein et al. 2003) . Treating these disorders after a bioterrorist event may also be complicated by reminders of the trauma, as well as the continuing stress associated with the possibility of future attacks and any related economic disruption.

Additional research on the emotional and behavioral consequences of terrorism and terrorist-like events will also lead to the continued development and evaluation of interventions. We still need to understand how interventions and response strategies might differ according to the type of event or agent (chemical versus biological, etc.). We need to know whether different populations would require different types of interventions, how interventions should be modified to be culturally relevant and responsive to local conditions, and whether these interventions need to change over time to meet different demands. In addition, we must determine to what extent interventions are appropriate and effective in the different settings (e.g., primary care clinics, schools) in which they are likely to be delivered.

Faced with continued threats from weapons of mass destruction and mounting concerns about bioterrorism, our nation urgently needs to consider how best to meet the challenges associated with managing the emotional and behavioral consequences of these acts of violence. If the anthrax attacks and the sniper attacks in Washington, D.C., taught us anything, it is that events like bioterrorism, in which the level of risk is uncertain for a prolonged period, create emotional distress responses and behavioral changes in far more individuals than are physically at risk. Substantial efforts and funding are still needed to understand and prepare for the emotional and behavioral consequences likely to be associated with bioterrorism. At the same time, many of those efforts directed at improving our response to bioterrorism will allow us to be better prepared to face a range of current public health problems.

We already know about the emotional and behavioral effects of terrorism and of nonterrorist events that contain some of the components of bioterrorism. Our preparations and response planning must draw from all these sources. But only by examining how people respond to such events and by learning how these responses can be modified by communitywide responses can we develop evidence-based assumptions about how people within and across communities will react to bioterrorist events. This new knowledge will be essential to improving our response strategies, including the use of natural support systems, risk communication techniques, and effective treatment interventions.

Basic public health services delivered in an urban community: a qualitative study,China s u m m a r y Objectives: To understand the advancements in and barriers to the implementation of measures to improve basic public health services in an urban Chinese community.,"Supplying free basic public health services (individual-based clinical preventive services and population-based public health services) in community settings is of great significance in improving quality of life and promoting social harmony. Since 2005, the Chinese Government has promulgated a series of documents for developing basic public health services. 1e3 These reports mandated that basic public health services would be funded at all levels of governments and be delivered by the nationwide community health services (CHS) organizations. 4 On 10 April 2009, the Chinese Government released a policy statement which enhanced the reforms of the medical and health systems, and which re-emphasized that governmental bodies will offer equitable access to basic public health services for both urban and rural residents. 3 As the centre of politics, economy and culture of China, Beijing Municipal Government attaches extreme importance to and promotes advances in the development of basic public health services delivered in the community.

Over the past two decades, China has been undergoing a process of economic reform and has been relatively successful. The healthcare system, which had been reformed to suit the market economy, 5 faced multiple challenges: limited financial support from governments; high rates of catastrophic out-of-pocket spending and impoverishment through health expenses; inequalities in health and healthcare utilization; and limited financial protection even among those with insurance (a small minority of the population). 6 Due to the above challenges, the old 'three-tiered' hospital system, which involved local neighbourhood hospitals, district-wide secondary hospitals and city-wide tertiary hospitals, was forced to rely on the sales of new drugs and technologies to boost income, which resulted in expensive and inefficient care and strained patientedoctor relationships. 7 The old public health system was the responsibility of dozens of disparate institutes, centres, agencies, bureaus and departments, which resulted in overlapping and sometimes conflicting mission statements and agency mandates. 8 With an increase in life expectancy, increased burden due to chronic diseases, and the challenges of emerging infectious diseases (e.g. severe acute respiratory syndrome in 2003), the Chinese Government re-examined the public health infrastructure and saw the need for a new public health system to address the many health issues associated with these changes. 5 To minimize overlapping of functions and to increase efficiency, the Chinese Government consolidated existing institutions into a new agency: the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The goal of the CDC is to provide a central public health organization with responsibility for both community and individual health needs. The development of the CDC strengthened the Government's role in public health. 5 As public health and primary care share the common goal of improving the overall health of specific populations, it was decided to integrate the two systems by strengthening public health functions in primary healthcare settings. This approach could improve local public health surveillance and reinforce disease prevention and health promotion. 9 In order to resolve the problems of the increasing burden of healthcare expenses and limited access to health services, the Chinese Government initiated its CHS programme in 1997. 4 The 'threetiered' hospital system was replaced by the current 'twotiered' CHS centre system. The new system consists of ambulatory care in CHS centres and inpatient care in referral hospitals. 7 The main roles of the CHS centres are to provide high-quality, affordable, accessible primary health care and public health services to community residents.

The scope of services of the CHS centres is described symbolically by the Chinese Government as 'one body, six aspects'. The body is the CHS centre. The six aspects consist of basic clinical services, prevention, health education, women and children's care, elderly care, immunizations and physical rehabilitation. 7 The centres integrate Western and traditional Chinese medicine. In the population-based public health services, there is collaboration between the community health centres and the local CDC. 7 Local governments are the main sources of funding for the local CDC and CHS centres. The core providers in the CHS centres are general practitioners (family doctors), 10, 11 public health specialists and community nurses. These practitioners are responsible for the provision of basic clinical services and for maintaining the wellness of the residents, of all ages, in their communities. 4 In China, a general practitioner is a medical practitioner with recognized general training, experience and skills, who provides and co-ordinates comprehensive medical care for individuals, families and communities. 10, 11 Two models are currently being used to train general practitioners in China. The first model is a 3-year general practice postgraduate residency training programme. The second model of education involves retraining the majority of the less-educated doctors currently working in local community health centres, and transforming them into general practitioners. Completion certificates are awarded by different organizations, including the Central Ministry of Health, provincial ministries of health and city-level health bureaus. 10, 11 General practitioners typically work in the clinics of CHS organizations. When delivering population-based public health services, general practitioners often work in teams with public health specialists, community nurses and other providers. 10, 11 In 2007, in order to implement the CHS more effectively, Beijing Management Centre for Community Health Services (MCCHS) was established. It is affiliated administratively with Beijing Municipal Health Bureau. Similarly, a district office of the MCCHS is attached to each of the city's 18 district health bureaus. 12 The main responsibilities of Beijing MCCHS include writing regulations, establishing assessment standards, and organizing practices for the CHS while, at the same time, supervising the work of the district MCCHSs. The district MCCHSs are responsible for planning, managing and assessing the work performed by all CHS organizations in their respective districts. Each director of a district MCCHS must be familiar with the activities of the CHS in his/her district. 12 Fifteen types of free basic public health services have been delivered by the CHS in Beijing since 2006 13 (Appendix 1). To date, no research has investigated the implementation of these services in Beijing. Due to an interest in understanding the status of and barriers to basic public health services in the Beijing communities, the authors chose to design a study that would investigate the conceptual frameworks of these services. To that end, all 18 MCCHS district directors were approached in order to ascertain their opinions of the quality of the delivery of basic public health services by providers in the CHS.

Sampling consisted of all 18 directors from the 18 MCCHS distributed in the 18 districts in Beijing. After obtaining their numbers from the telephone book, initial contact was made with them. One director was away on business, one was too busy and declined to be interviewed, and one was unable to be reached, despite multiple calls. Semi-structured, in-depth interviews were conducted with the remaining 15 MCCHS district directors who were familiar with the work in the CHS. Interviews were usually carried out in the respondent's work offices.

All participants were informed about the purpose of the study and were made aware that they could stop the interview at any point without giving a reason. Written informed consent and an agreement for the use of anonymised quotes from the interviews were obtained from all participants.

Semi-structured, face-to-face, tape-recorded, qualitative interviews, lasting 60e90 mins, were conducted by trained professional interviewers from December 2008 to February 2009. Interviewers took extensive notes, in addition to tape recording and transcribing the interviews. The transcripts were reviewed by the research team. Analysis and interpretation were reached by consensus, using an iterative process in the research team meetings. The research team was a multidisciplinary group including two community-based medical researchers with qualitative and social research experience, one health administrator from a health bureau familiar with health policy, one family doctor familiar with the CHS, two epidemiologists and one Masters degree candidate with a family medicine degree. The variety of perspectives of the team ensured a depth of understanding critical to the design of the study and the validity of the results.

An interview guide was developed on the basis of references and relevant government documents. The interview questions were open-ended and covered issues about basic public health services, the content of specific services being delivered, funding, types of providers, and general insights of the respondents.

Qualitative content analysis 14, 15 was used to analyse the data between March 2009 and May 2009. The data consisted of rich text files containing transcripts of the tape-recorded interviews. The team members read all the material through several times to obtain a sense of the whole, and then independently coded transcripts to identify themes by condensing and summarizing the contents. Coding differences were resolved after thorough discussion in order to ensure that all perspectives on the themes were represented in the written results. The themes that emerged for the purposes of this report included the content of basic public health services, funding support, providers and recommendations. All of the interviews were included in the analysis; there were no disconfirming cases.

The findings relate to three main themes: the content of basic public health services, funding support for basic public health services, and the providers who deliver basic public health services.

Fifteen types of basic public health services, including 78 specific services (Appendix 1), were delivered at different levels in the various districts. Among these services, most of the directors considered the establishment of health records, chronic disease management, childhood immunizations and care, maternal care, elderly care, disability and rehabilitation services, and health education to be supplied at high levels. However, the provision of mental health, ophthalmologic, oral health, pest control and endemic disease services were low and sporadic in some communities due to the low level of staff competency for these tasks.

In community health information management, community needs assessments were one of the important jobs in the community. The 15 directors agreed that it was often necessary for community needs assessments to be undertaken with the assistance of a special research group due to practitioners' limited research skills in this area. The rates of creation of paper health records for all inhabitants were estimated to be high. At present, the governments have attached importance to the development of electronic health records, and the transformation from paper to electronic records is a slow, stepwise process in the communities:

""Paper health records have been established for 70% of people in our district, and we plan to complete this work for all our residents by 2010.""

""The Municipal Government required CHS organizations to establish paper health records for all residents in Beijing. A centre provides services to about 30,000e100,000 residents according to the size of a region. In fact, due to health workforce shortages and a small number of revisiting patients, only 30% of established paper records can be followed up and used continuously."" ""How to continuously and dynamically use these health records, especially those of healthy people, is a 'Gordian knot'. A feasible method to resolve this problem may be by using an electronic health record information systems to reduce the time spent on paperwork. The first thing that the governments need to do is to establish the standards of electronic record systems and to make experiments in some districts.""

Regarding the management of communicable diseases, most of the CHS organizations' roles are limited to assisting the local CDCs with the completion of tasks such as finding, reporting and follow-up of cases: ""However, for responses to emergent public health hazards, CHS organizations are playing more and more important roles.""

The management of chronic, non-communicable diseases is an important job for CHS organizations because of the high incidence and deleterious effects of these illnesses. Providing optimal health care for persons with chronic conditions is a major concern in the community. Beijing Municipal Health Bureau has established a set of guidelines for the management of chronic diseases in community p u b l i c h e a l t h 1 2 5 ( 2 0 1 1 ) 3 7 e4 5 settings e including hypertension, diabetes, stroke and heart disease e and requires general practitioners to use these guidelines when managing chronic diseases. However, deficiencies in continuous professional development and a lack of evidence-based guidelines have created further problems in delivering cost-effective interventions for chronic disease prevention:

""The rate of adherence to these guidelines is low due to poor understanding and co-operation. It is necessary to make recommendations for these diseases by means of a process of critical appraisal and consensus building.""

Regarding maternal and child care, the interviewees said that CHS organizations assisted local women's and children's health organizations in carrying out related programmes, such as health education and counselling, screening, followup and referral:

""Childhood immunizations were implemented at the highest rate. It is estimated to be 98e100%.""

""Now, cost-free screenings for breast cancer and cervical cancer for adult women are delivered in some districts according to local government's regulations.""

When asked about geriatric care and care of persons with disabilities, all 15 directors replied that the instruction of self-care and the management of chronic diseases were emphasized for the elderly, and that exercise sites have been gradually upgraded by supplying physical rehabilitation equipment for disabled people.

Health education is delivered regularly in the context of supplying other health services. Most of the respondents agreed that illness-oriented visits were the most important opportunities to deliver health habit counselling and education to patients, but that this was done less frequently during health maintenance visits. The directors agreed that tobacco cessation counselling and exercise advice were the most common health education topics covered by doctors and patients during illness visits.

An average of £2.38 (at a conversion rate of 10.49 RMB to £1) per person per year was provided for basic public health services in Beijing since 2008, and each district government supplied different amounts of money for basic public health services in its communities according to its economic level and population. However, basic public health services were often perceived as not being reimbursed proportionately to the amount of time expended, particularly when they were opportunistically added to illness visits. The 15 directors conveyed the opinion that funding for basic public health services was insufficient, and that most of the funds were spent on correlative public equipment and expendable items:

""Few financial incentives are paid to the individual health services.This may be an important reason why we can't motivate providers to deliver more and higher-quality basic public health services."" ""There is a higher percentage of migrants in some districts such as Chaoyang, Fengtai and Haidian, but no exact budget support from Beijing Municipal Government for migrants except immunizations. Part of public health services, such as health education, communicable diseases management are delivered for migrants in some districts, financed only by local government. The Municipal Government needs to think over the problems brought by migrants.""

Providers who deliver basic public health services Teams consisting mainly of general practitioners, community nurses and public health specialists deliver basic public health services in the community. In addition to supplying medical care, general practitioners are required to delivery cost-free clinical preventive services for individuals and families, and population-based public health services (Appendix 1). Their roles include being exemplars for health; providing assessments; serving as educators, counsellors and evaluators; and making referrals when necessary. Public health specialists, who serve as recorders of health data as well as health educators, are responsible for public health services for populations in their communities. Community nurses mainly assist general practitioners and public health specialists.

""Basic public health services often were actually delivered by allied health professionals who may be more effective than physicians in initiating and carrying out many public interventions.""

Due to the broad scope of basic public health services and limited financial incentives, providers felt that they were under great stress and harried by many competing demands for their time. It is unrealistic to expect that basic public health services would be improved by placing additional burdens on providers without removing other demands: ""Time constraints and the short supply of public health service providers are barriers to the delivery of prevention. Furthermore, there are considerable gaps in knowledge and experience about public health among community providers. Most of them don't realize the importance of delivering public health services for residents in community. Individuals charged with making policy recommendations and increasing the delivery of basic public health services must acknowledge this fact.""

Medical staff in community settings often complained that community members for whom they were responsible did not trust them as these clinicians had lower levels of knowledge and skill than specialists. As a result, community members are often reluctant to accept basic public health services:

""Young people especially, who seldom see general practitioners, do not know clearly which basic public health services are supplied by CHS organizations. As a result, they often do not trust and refuse these community-based services, so patient noncompliance is one of the chief constraints to the improvement of basic public health services.""

The directors complained that some public health services, such as aspects of mental health care, pest control and endemic disease management, should have been supplied by other organizations but were passed off on the CHS. As staff competency for these tasks is low, the quality of these services is low as a consequence. Basic public health services delivered in the community should be creative, adaptive and responsive to local needs and expectations, including those of patients, community, local healthcare institutions, staff and doctors. 16 It is necessary for Beijing Municipal Government to further elucidate the content of basic public health services and define the priorities in which services need to be delivered according to the needs of local practices, their patients and their communities: ""Certainly, it is difficult for medical staff in the community to deliver so many public health services with high levels of quality . The governments should prioritize the delivery of services according to patients' risk factors and preferences, practical considerations and financial budget.""

Beijing Municipal Government is planning to increase funding for basic public health services to £4 per person in 2010. The 15 directors considered that this was still insufficient and advised that the Municipal Government should increase providers' salaries and subsidies. For example, an additional duty hour allowance scheme should be brought forward, under which health workers would be allowed to work extra hours and receive pay to augment their salaries: 17 ""Besides payment, of course, some changes in the process and organization of the providers' work are also part of the solution to the problem of the under-provision of basic public health services.A useful solution to attract more community residents to see general practitioners would be to increase the proportion of medical reimbursement for CHS services.""

Recruiting more competent medical staff There were 16.33 million residents and 5.55 million migrants in Beijing in 2007. In 2008, the total number of medical staff in the entire Beijing community was 24,740 (source: Beijing Statistical Bureau, 2008). 33 Of these, 3451 were general practitioners, 2299 were public health workers (including 765 public health specialists) and 4667 were nurses. Staffing patterns differed from district to district. However, there was consensus among the directors that more medical staff need to be allocated to CHS organizations.

There is a large disparity between general practitioners and specialists in salary and opportunities for promotion. Many doctors and nurses with better educational backgrounds or higher professional titles prefer to work in hospitals. 4 It is difficult to recruit competent medical staff in the community. The directors advised that the governments can attempt to attract better qualified doctors to work in the CHS by raising salaries, providing more opportunities to participate in continuing medical education programmes and academic conferences, and shortening tenure periods for promotion to higher professional titles. In addition, emphasis was placed on the need to increase team work among CHS workers or between CHS providers and hospital-based specialists.

China has made great efforts to improve the health of its huge population, and has had considerable success in this endeavour. For example, longevity has increased. Compared with 35 years in 1949, life expectancy had increased to 73 years in both sexes in 2006 (source: Ministry of Health of China, World Health Organization, 2008). 34,35 However, excessive healthcare costs and inconvenient access to health care are still major healthcare problems in China. 4 In order to resolve these problems, China has initiated a new approach 3 which includes improving primary healthcare facilities and offering equitable access to basic public health services across the country. Many provinces and cities have followed these regulations and are devoted to developing core communitybased public health services. Accordingly, Beijing Municipal Government has drawn up a series of protocols 18À20 to support basic public health services for its residents.

As the tie that links district governments and CHS organizations, the 18 district MCCHSs are at the front line of implementation of the plan to deliver basic public health services in community settings. This study found much valuable information by interviewing the directors of the MCCHSs.

The Chinese Government is supplying nine types of basic public health services, including 21 specific services, at no cost for all people since 2009 according to its announcement. 3 Since 2006, CHS organizations in Beijing have supplied more basic public health services for residents than those required by the national plan, and basic public health services are regarded as part of a core mission in general practice. However, the delivery of some of these basic public health services was at lower levels of quality than is desirable. This finding is consistent with the reports of other researchers about preventive services delivery in other countries. 16, 21 In general, locally tailored interventions are more likely to be adopted into the usual routines of practice than interventional approaches that are dependent on outside stimuli (such as financial incentives), 22 or which impose practice tools and approaches developed elsewhere. 23 It is imperative to undertake more research to find ways to make these improvements. 24 According to a 2009 policy statement, 3 the Chinese Government and local governments at all levels will provide financial outlays that are not less than £1.43 per person per year for basic public health services for all Chinese people in 2009, and increase subsidies to achieve universal insurance coverage and to assure every citizen equal access to affordable basic health care. 25 year. The budget in Beijing is £2.38 per person per year since 2008; however, Beijing CHS centres are required to deliver more basic public health services than their counterparts in other provinces. The deficiency in funding has become such a problem that some basic public health services cannot be implemented effectively in Beijing. The Municipal Government is now assessing how much money should be devoted to basic public health services on the basis of its funding capability and the demands of stakeholders. In addition, migrants need to be recognized as a specific target group for health promotion, prevention and health care, 27 and the governments should provide additional funding for them.

These findings are consistent with research 28 which points out that multidisciplinary practice teams are key to delivering basic public health services in community settings. Successful teams are created through formulating inter-related goals, identifying measurable outcomes, systematizing routine tasks of care, defining provider tasks and roles explicitly, and providing appropriate training. 27 A document published by the State Council of China in 2006 29 mandated that the allocation rate for medical staff working in the CHS should reach the level of two to three general practitioners and nurses per 10,000 residents, and one public health specialist per 10,000 residents by 2010. In Beijing, the allocation is one general practitioner per 3000 residents, one nurse per 25,000 residents and one public health specialist per 2000 residents. 20 In fact, the above allocation rates have not yet been met, especially since the demand for much of the scope and quality of public health services has increased. In addition, the low levels of CHS providers' knowledge and skills 4 is a major problem. As a result, basic public health services are often only provided in response to patient requests or obvious needs in Beijing; services thus tend to be reactive rather than proactive. It may simply be unrealistic to expect community providers to deliver a comprehensive package of basic public health services along with the many competing demands of providing direct clinical care. 21 In view of the reasons mentioned above, Beijing Municipal Government is planning several programmes to improve the service capabilities of the CHS providers. These include partial changes in the structure, roles and functions of the teams; incentives to attract more medical graduates to work in community settings; redistribution of tertiary hospital doctors to CHS organizations; reemployment of retired doctors in the CHS; and the provision of financial support and opportunities for younger doctors to get better continuing medical education. 4 The roles and experiences of both medical staff and their patients also impact on health promotion activities. The community resident/patient is not a passive participant in the process of receiving basic public health services, and many residents look to providers for guidance and direction in the prevention of diseases. 30 Favourable interaction between providers and patients is critical to the effectiveness and efficiency of the delivery of basic public health services, because in some types of preventive services, the patient's contribution may ultimately be more significant than the provider's role (e.g. weight loss, smoking cessation, reduction of alcohol use, adherence to medical regimen). 30 People with insurance can access other services which are not free of charge in CHS organizations. In fact, people with insurance prefer to visit doctors in hospitals to CHS organizations. In order to attract more people to visit the CHS, CHS organizations are required to supply acceptable services by decreasing drug prices and increasing the proportion of medical reimbursement. 31 Beijing Municipal Government is currently devoting significant funding to publicizing basic public health services in the community by means of various media, and is encouraging residents with common diseases to see general practitioners.

This exploratory study provides in-depth examinations of the status and barriers of basic public health services provided in community practices. Interviews were carried out and analyzed by a multidisciplinary group in order to maintain the validity and meaningfulness of the results. Purposeful sampling was used to enhance external validity or transferability. 32 However, the findings must be interpreted in the context of the study's limitations. The data were crosssectional in nature. The possibility that the non-responding directors were different from the 15 interviewed directors can not be excluded. The study examined basic public health services from the perspective of supervisors, who do not themselves provide direct primary medical care. It did not examine the broader frame of basic public health services in the community and overall population levels. The fact that all the data for this study were collected in one city may call into question its generalizability to other locales. However, the choice of Beijing as the site for data collection has particular significance to healthcare service delivery in China because the nation's capital was one of the first cities to comprehensively implement the CHS reforms of 2006, and thus has had the longest experience with them. In addition, Beijing has traditionally served as a national test site for reforms of the CHS. Accordingly, the authors recommend that further research should be undertaken on the delivery of basic public health services with larger sampling from community providers from other cities in China.

This qualitative study suggests that the emphasis of Beijing Municipal Government on the delivery of basic public health services in community settings is an important effort, but the specific parameters for these services should be clarified, the quantity and quality of staffing must be addressed, sufficient time for provision of services must be allowed, and sufficient funding must be provided. The authors believe that major reforms of the healthcare system in Beijing and China are needed to address these problems.

Social Media and Internet-Based Data in Global Systems for Public Health Surveillance: A Systematic Review,"The exchange of health information on the Internet has been heralded as an opportunity to improve public health surveillance. In a field that has traditionally relied on an established system of mandatory and voluntary reporting of known infectious diseases by doctors and laboratories to governmental agencies, innovations in social media and so-called user-generated information could lead to faster recognition of cases of infectious disease. More direct access to such data could enable surveillance epidemiologists to detect potential public health threats such as rare, new diseases or early-level warnings for epidemics. But how useful are data from social media and the Internet, and what is the potential to enhance surveillance? The challenges of using these emerging surveillance systems for infectious disease epidemiology, including the specific resources needed, technical requirements, and acceptability to public health practitioners and policymakers, have wide-reaching implications for public health surveillance in the 21st century.","to develop event-based surveillance, the existing systems have limitations. Accordingly, there is a need for further development of automated technologies that monitor health-related information on the Internet, especially to handle large amounts of data and to prevent information overload. The dissemination to health authorities of new information about health events is not always efficient and could be improved. No comprehensive evaluations show whether eventbased surveillance systems have been integrated into actual epidemiological work during real-time health events.

The acceptability of data from the Internet and social media as a regular part of public health surveillance programs varies and is related to a circular challenge: the willingness to integrate is rooted in a lack of effectiveness studies, yet such effectiveness can be proved only through a structured evaluation of integrated systems. Issues related to changing technical and social paradigms in both individual perceptions of and interactions with personal health data, as well as social media and other data from the Internet, must be further addressed before such information can be integrated into official surveillance systems.

Keywords: surveillance, health information, Internet, social media. R ecent major health events such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in Asia (2002) (2003) , pandemic H1N1/09 influenza virus worldwide (2009), and the large outbreak of Escherichia coli O104:H4 in Germany (2011) have prompted infectious disease scientists at government agencies, university centers, and international health agencies to invest in improving methods for conducting infectious disease surveillance. 1, 2 Opportunities for improvement, however, vary and are based on the distinctive features of existing types of infectious disease surveillance, which have been developed over time to address the various critical components in public health efforts against disease. Standard infectious disease surveillance methodologies have been derived from indicator-based surveillance and event-based surveillance.

Indicator-based surveillance systems are the oldest, most common, and most widely used form of infectious disease surveillance by regional, national, and international public health agencies. These systems are designed to collect and analyze structured data based on established surveillance and monitoring protocols tailored to each disease (ie, used for calculating the incidence, seasonality, and burden of disease), in order to gather relevant information about populations of interest to detect changes in trends or distributions in the population. Data on such indicators are reported by health care providers and diagnostic laboratories, by legal mandate or voluntary agreement, and are collected by surveillance specialists in governmental health agencies. This information then can be verified through communication between the governmental health agencies and the persons collecting the data in health care settings.

Indicator-based surveillance systems often contain reliable statistical methods that have been established to compare the observed number of cases of pathogens with an expected rate. The goal is to find increased numbers or clusters at a specific time, period, and/or location that might indicate a threat. Statistical methods set against thresholds of increased cases or clusters are crucial to finding potential health events. They are based on the relevant attributes of each infectious disease, such as epidemiological parameters like regional incidence, seasonality, and the known burden of disease. Thresholds can also be adjusted using statistical algorithms to vary sensitivity and specificity so that the detection procedure is refined to better suit the needs of the epidemiological situation for a disease or a specific area. This helps epidemiologists by giving them a greater capacity to monitor additional information that might signal threats to public health.

The ability of indicator-based surveillance systems to detect potential threats more quickly is lacking, however. Although generating signals based on statistical thresholds can provide an aggregation that will speed up a threat assessment, the data itself may not be the most recent. First, there is often a time lag between the occurrence of an event and the indicator-based surveillance. That is, data input and retrieval for indicator-based surveillance often rely on specific case definitions and reporting requirements that differ for physicians in hospital and community care and for laboratories, thereby causing delays in reporting to health agencies. Delays also may be caused by time lags between reporting procedures from the reporting bodies and the authorities who receive, store, and process the data, that is, by the structure of notification systems in official public health agencies that often trickle up from the local, state, and federal levels. Second, indicator-based systems are sometimes poorly equipped to detect new or unexpected occurrences of disease, owing to the predefined epidemiological attributes assigned to each infectious disease for which information is collected. This was true during the first cases of SARS-CoV in 2002 and pandemic H1N1/09 influenza in 2009, which at first were not detected because the existing systems could track only the clinical and epidemiological attributes for corona or influenza infections that had already been discovered and defined, but not new strains of viral infections. Incidentally, such shortfalls provided the impetus for the systemic improvement of indicator-based systems. By demonstrating the importance of detecting unknown but similar diseases, it became evident that new data sources and methods for monitoring such data were critical. 3 As a result of the SARS-CoV epidemic, for example, health agencies began to seriously consider ways to monitor symptoms and syndromes (ie, clusters of symptoms for particular diseases) in order to provide appropriate and fast detection with the most efficient use of required human resources.

Similar to indicator-based surveillance, event-based surveillance is based on the organized and rapid capture of information about events that can be a risk to public health. But rather than relying on official reports, this information is obtained directly from witnesses of real-time events or indirectly from reports transmitted through various communication channels (eg, social media or established routine alert systems) and information channels (the news media, public health networks, and nongovernmental organizations) ( Table 1 ). Monitoring that relies on data from these Internet sources can be used to detect threats not specifically found by indicator-based surveillance, since this information relies less on data structured and filtered through the aforementioned preestablished structures for surveillance. Event-based surveillance can identify events faster than indicator-based reporting procedures can, and it can detect events that occur in populations not able to access formal channels for reporting. In addition, event-based surveillance can be used with other established indicator-based methods, thereby enhancing the combined arsenal for combatting critically prevalent pathogens with a high threat potential, such as influenza virus or Escherichia coli. The scientific literature recently referred to this comprehensive framework of combined activities from both indicator-based surveillance and eventbased surveillance systems as ""epidemic intelligence,"" a contemporary understanding of the 1950s term with roots in public health innovation for surveillance systems at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the establishment of the Epidemic Intelligence Service (EIS). [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] Event-based surveillance continues to offer innovation for public health surveillance, for example, by capturing information about events that may not otherwise be detected in the routine collection of data from indicator-based surveillance. Events that may be detected in event-based surveillance include the following:

r Events, such as SARS, that are emerging or rarely occur and thus are not specifically part of the purview of standard indicator-based surveillance.

r Events that occur in real time but have not been detected by indicator-based surveillance, such as those events delayed by the required reporting procedures of notifying the designated health authority.

r Events that occur in populations that do not access health care through formal channels or in which formal, indicator-based systems do not exist, such as events that occur in populations in rural areas or countries with a less established infrastructure for surveillance.

Health information monitored via the Internet and social media is an important part of event-based surveillance and is most often the source on which many existing event-based surveillance systems focus. Existing systems for such event-based monitoring contain useful retrieval features that give epidemiologists and public health scientists involved in surveillance quick access to information compiled from many media and news sources. 9, 10 Other new health information technologies using new data sources from the Internet are important drivers of innovation in global surveillance, speeding up the collection and transmission of information to allow for better emergency preparedness or responses. 11 In research, event-based surveillance using data from the Internet, especially emails and online news sources, has been shown to identify surveillance trends comparable to those found using established indicator-based surveillance methods. [12] [13] [14] In practice, however, such systems have not yet been widely accepted and integrated into the mainstream for use by national and international health authorities.

We reviewed event-based surveillance systems that have actually been used, in order to examine the usefulness of event-based surveillance to existing surveillance efforts and its potential to improve future comprehensive infectious disease surveillance systems.

We conducted a systematic review to identify all currently established event-based surveillance systems used in infectious disease surveillance and to look at the type of data collected, the mode of data acquisition used by the system, and the overall purpose and function of each system. As members of a national scientific institute, our aim was to help health policy decision makers decide whether to incorporate new methods into comprehensive programs of surveillance that already contain established indicator-based surveillance.

The previous work in this area includes a systematic review, by Bravata and colleagues, of 17,510 peer-reviewed articles and 8,088 websites on surveillance systems for the early detection of bioterrorism-related diseases, which evaluated the potential utility of existing surveillance systems for illnesses and syndromes related to bioterrorism only. [15] [16] [17] Another review of peer-reviewed articles by Vrbova and colleagues synthesized surveillance systems for emerging zoonotic diseases with selected criteria used to evaluate those systems. 18 Corley and colleagues helped US federal government agencies compile aspects and attributes associated with operational considerations in the development, testing, and validation of event-based surveillance; and Hartley and colleagues drew up an outline of technical Internet biosurveillance processes. 19, 20 Although this work is important, these reviews do not provide systematically collected details of event-based systems used in practice.

We searched for peer-reviewed articles published in the indexes Pubmed, Scopus, and Scirus between 1990 and 2011 21-23 as well as Englishlanguage studies of infectious disease surveillance (and specifically event-based surveillance) and outbreak detection in human health and medicine. We excluded articles on bioterrorism (for which there is less possibility of pathogen threat), articles on solely technical aspects of system implementation or security (eg, video surveillance), those covering sentinel surveillance systems (ie, those set up randomly, periodically, or in another unsystematic way), any surveillance not based on infectious diseases, and articles without available abstracts. We used extraction criteria to collect comparable data on each system. Appendix 1 provides a detailed overview of the search strategy and methods, and the study's complete protocol also is available. 24 

Our systematic review yielded 13 event-based systems used in practice and for which complete information based on our extraction criteria was available (Tables 2 and 3) .

Event-based surveillance systems can be classified as news aggregators, automatic systems, or moderated systems. 25 News aggregators collect articles from several sources that are commonly filtered by language or country. Although their users have easy access to many sources through a common portal, they must examine each article individually. Automatic systems go beyond this by adding a series of steps for analysis but differ in the levels of analysis performed, in the range of information sources, in language coverage, in the speed of delivering information, and in methods for visualization. In moderated systems, information is processed entirely by human analysts or is first processed automatically and then 11 Automatic USA 2000 a GOARN is a WHO-coordinated network analyzed by people. Moderated systems offer a screening for epidemiological relevance of the data found within the information before it is presented to the user. Although each of the systems that we reviewed has different goals (mostly pertaining to various national, international, and regional audiences), they all foster the communication of health events or threats in the infectious disease community of scientists, physicians, epidemiologists, public health officials, policymakers, and politicians.

The systems overwhelmingly rely on media sources for data input, including local and national newspapers; news broadcasts; websites; news wires; or even short message service (SMS), the text messaging service component of phone, web, or mobile communication systems. 26 Some of the systems already have been incorporated into other larger systems. For example, GOARN links 110 existing networks, and GPHIN collects data already processed with ProMED-mail. 27 Surveillance scientists then review this information to assess its epidemiological significance and to support decision making. But because these data are not structured, epidemiologists must spend more time and energy determining their relevance to a particular situation of interest.

We identified three types of coordinating bodies for event-based systems: those based at or in cooperation with universities (Argus, BioCaster, GODSN, HealthMap, and Proteus-BIO), NGOs (GOARN, MedISys, MiTAP, and ProMED-mail) and governmental agencies (EWRS, EpiSPI-DER, GPHIN and InSTEDD).

Each of these systems has a different aim: (1) to improve early detection, (2) to enhance communication or collaboration, and (3) to supplement other existing systems. Ten of the systems are intended to improve early detection: Argus, BioCaster, GOARN, GODSN, GPHIN, HealthMap, InSTEDD, MedISys, MiTAP, and Proteus-BIO. Two of the systems are meant to enhance communication or collaboration (EWRS and ProMED-mail), and one system supplements another (EpiSPIDER for ProMED-mail).

All the systems cover 2 or more countries, but their jurisdictions could be classified as (1) 

All the event-based systems that we reviewed focused on outbreaks of different and multiple infectious diseases, with some systems, such as Argus (130), BioCaster (102), and HealthMap (170), collecting information on more than 100 diseases.

We observed 5 levels of access: (1) freely and publicly available (HealthMap, EpiSpider, GODSN, and Proteus-BIO), (2) available with a free subscription (ProMED-mail, BioCaster, and MiTAP), (3) available with a paid subscription (GPHIN, whose subscribers include governmental organizations, NGOs, and universities), (4) access restricted to certain public health officials (EWRS, Argus, GOARN, and InSTEDD), and (5) mixed-level access (MedISys, offering free but restricted access to the public and outside the European Commission [EC] and full access to officials in the EC). Accessibility varies from system to system, depending on both the scope of the system and the intended audience. While it is important to offer freely accessible information, some sensitive information (eg, personal data or other confidential data) is often filtered in specific ways among public health officials with specific restricted access. GPHIN has restricted access for organizations with an established public health mandate, with access varying according to factors like the organization's size and number of users. InSTEDD is one of the few systems using information to advise organizations like the UN, WHO, and CDC on strategic implementation. Such systems, like EWRS, provide, within a closed network, timely information for preparedness, early warning, and responses.

Each event-based system acquires data differently. Some collect information directly from sources on the Internet (eg, RSS feeds or electronic mailing lists); others collect both from formal members and informal sources; and still others collect from subscribers or members only. Ten systems collect from the Internet (Argus, BioCaster, EpiSPI-DER, GODSN, GPHIN, HealthMap, InSTEDD, MedISys, MiTAP, and Proteus-BIO), and 2 systems collect from both formal members and informal sources (EWRS and GOARN). ProMED-mail is the only system obtaining firsthand information from its subscribers.

Most of the systems we studied function as news aggregators. News aggregators (eg, Google News) use RSS to collect real-time news feeds from thousands of news sources from around the world, and many systems deal with a huge amount of information each day. MediSys, for example, monitors an average of 50,000 news articles per day from about 1,400 news portals in 43 languages. GPHIN processes from 2,000 to 3,000 news items per day, of which about a quarter are irrelevant or duplicates. 26 Many of the event-based systems utilize text-mining technology to extract only relevant data, and most have sophisticated processing systems of filtering and classifying relevant information to reduce the amount of data.

Source data (ie, event-based data retrieved from the Internet) should be reviewed for epidemiological relevance, either by human epidemiologists or automated systems. This is technologically simple but timeconsuming and expensive, with human moderation having a different role in each system. The information provided through ProMED-mail, for example, is validated and confirmed by humans. EWRS utilizes an informatics tool that filters and relays information to users via a webbased system that links contact members of the EWRS network.

Human input, hypothesis generation, and review are important components of systems. InSTEDD and GPHIN incorporate human input and review, allowing users to add comments, tags, and ranks during the data-processing phases and confirmation and feedback during the dissemination phases.

Systems without human moderation often focus on data sources that already have been validated. Many systems contain new data on outbreaks or diseases, but only some are relayed as firsthand, primary information. Other data are reported as secondary sources like newspaper articles. Although this information can be useful to surveillance epidemiologists who monitor data and conduct research on a known infectious disease area, because these events already have been reported, it does not help epidemiologists interested in the early warning and alert potential for unknown or new infectious disease areas. Because MedISys offers no human mediation in collating information sources and articles, all information must be examined in order to learn more about the outbreak or event in question. Accordingly, how the information is presented is less easily adapted for use in daily practice.

Almost all the systems not relying on human moderation are automated with thresholds used to reduce noise and to present only the most relevant data. MediSys uses a scraper software, for example, that automatically generates an RSS feed from webpages and applies a textextraction process, which then enables content analysis using analytical technology. 28 The text-extraction process uses document heuristics, an experience-based technique for computer learning that is applied to the information to enable an intelligent decision about its relevance. The heuristics learn as their output is verified against a set threshold for the epidemiological attributes of health events that have been extracted, thus improving monitoring over time. The system aggregates the extracted events into outbreaks, across multiple documents and sources, before returning the extracted information to the system. Users of the system often prefer a more structured approach, but it may present too much information (in some cases up to 1,000 events per day). The large amount of ""information noise"" also may be a hindrance, since users are then required to sift through it manually. HealthMap alleviates noise by integrating data from a variety of electronic sources that already have been moderated (ProMED-mail, WHO-validated official alerts, and the Eurosurveillance RSS multinational outbreak news site), all of which are fed into a classification engine (ie, a parser), which uses the information to produce disease and location output codes. Once classified, articles are filtered into a category and stored in a database.

Three systems are disseminated on a geographic map: BioCaster, EpiSPI-DER, and HealthMap; and 4 systems are disseminated through a website or news aggregator: MedISys, MiTAP, ProMED-mail, and Proteus-BIO. We found 6 systems that were disseminated through a secured or restricted portal: Argus, EWRS, GOARN, GODSN, GPHIN, and In-STEDD.

Our systematic literature review demonstrates the diverse attributes in current, established, event-based surveillance systems. Our review also articulates the factors that might influence the integration of such surveillance activities into official systems. The usefulness of new information sources via event-based surveillance depends on whether the information can enhance the data collection from existing surveillance methods and also on several factors related to the challenges for all systems' acquisition of data on infectious disease surveillance. 29, 30 For most epidemiologists, the process of gathering data from the Internet is complex, as it includes text mining (searching for health-related content from websites or social media), preparation (extracting and filtering relevant health-related information), and presentation of only the most relevant content (disseminating the information). In general, data are acquired and processed either automatically or by people, often relying on individual technologies for users' interaction with the data to tag (mark or catalog) the information for future use, and to comment on the information (for sharing and collaboration with other scientists), which can also be used to inform machine-learning algorithms (eg, statistical filters for data retrieval, such as Bayesian models). Systems often use automatic programming interfaces (APIs), a type of filter through which the data are passed in order to extract specific information. This is a good way of managing large sources of data from the Internet, which can be cumbersome and contain much content not related to health. These APIs process, extract, augment, and compile the epidemiological attributes in the data (ie, metadata) from multiple sources. For example, healthrelated attributes could include the data source, a relevant health term, the location, and the time of transmission. Natural language-processing systems extract from the feeds such relevant concepts as disease names and references to a geographic location. The information is then often assigned a dissemination format based on the information type (ie, epidemiological attribute) retrieved, through a network (eg, GPHIN), the Internet, email (ProMED-mail), or SMS (EWRS), or it is plotted on a geographic information system (GIS) published on the web (eg, HealthMap). The time needed to get from a potential data source to extracting and presenting epidemiological information that can be used as quickly as possible for preparedness or responses is critical. The results vary widely, depending on the combination of technologies used and whether or not human mediation is involved.

Even though event-based surveillance systems have been much improved, they still have limitations:

Information is not always moderated by professionals or interpreted for relevance before it is disseminated to interested surveillance epidemiologists. Information retrieved from event-based systems can originate from either official sources who can be seen as trusted health specialists or unofficial sources, such as the public, who may or may not be health specialists. Information from unofficial sources is often not prescreened by professionals, so it can cause reliability issues and necessitate moderation. Thus, moderation affects the quality of event-based information, compared with information from indicator-based systems, which almost always is provided by official sources.

There is no standardized system for the frequency of updates, often resulting in too much information. Information from event-based information components that use news aggregators often is incomplete and may not be timely. Data may be obsolete by the time it is picked up by epidemiologists because some information may have been published by news agencies after health organizations knew about an event or problem. In existing event-based surveillance systems, the frequency of updates varies from approximately several to hundreds of notifications per day, depending on the system.

Algorithms and statistical baselines are not well developed. Until now, event-based systems have not applied algorithms and statistical baselines to information before it is presented to users, which is a standard feature of most established indicator-based systems. Event-based systems often receive a high volume of information per day, which can overwhelm epidemiologists at public health agencies who perform surveillance and may be seen as a hindrance, since users are then required to spend time moderating the retrieved information.

New information about health events or probable cases is not always disseminated efficiently. Event-based systems filter and organize information about potential events of interest before it is presented to users. Information indexed by topic or subject enables users to decide whether they need to do more research. Some systems use online watch boards offering lists or tables of information on events; others rely on SMS; and still others provide options for other notification, like the ability to subscribe to an RSS-feed or through other web capabilities, like Twitter.

Some studies have shown that automated methods and technologies like those used in event-based surveillance can rapidly signal the detection of infectious diseases. 31, 34 In addition to speeding up detection by bypassing traditional indicator-based surveillance structures, event-based surveillance can also provide innovation in settings with weak or underdeveloped surveillance systems. In developing countries with a large disease burden, surveillance infrastructures that can use health information in the absence of traditional surveillance institutions can be critical to prevent an outbreak or reduce its impact. 35 Recent work has begun in this area to seek out information on health threats using mobile phone technology, Internet-scanning tools, email distribution lists, or networks that complement the early warning function of routine surveillance systems. [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] Our research showed that the majority of event-based surveillance systems are based in North America and Europe, with fewer local, event-based systems monitoring epidemic threats in Africa, Asia, the South Pacific, and South America. Guidance and training to create such systems on the ground should be considered, as this can lead to a faster assessment of health threats and a more rapid response by local authorities.

Previous evaluations of event-based surveillance systems have been limited, so we have very few examples to draw from. 41, 42 Although explored since the mid-2000s, largely in response to the SARS-CoV epidemic, event-based surveillance has yet to be fully integrated into public health surveillance systems. Evidence showing the added value to traditional infectious disease surveillance methods is sparse. 43 The development of appropriate metrics for monitoring and evaluating the quality of the data in event-based surveillance systems has become a priority but has just begun. Standard guidelines for the evaluation of surveillance systems offer much information about the attributes needed for measuring the appropriateness and effectiveness of specific systems. Most guidelines, however, rely on attribute descriptions taken from traditional or indicator-based surveillance. These have seldom been adapted to address specific concerns about the new information from event-based surveillance systems and may be inadequate.

Those standard operating procedures, tools, and guidance for eventbased surveillance that do exist-as is often the case with indicator-based surveillance as well-are not universally applicable, since different regions, countries, and smaller jurisdictions must adapt the surveillance systems to their particular needs. In 2005, the WHO established international health regulations (IHR) for surveillance activities that offer the WHO's 193 member states a multilateral legal framework for surveillance, notification, and responses to disease outbreaks and other emergencies with potential international public health implications. [44] [45] [46] The new IHR require the WHO and its members to develop real-time event management systems for addressing public health risks and emergencies of international concern along with the usual epidemiological tools.

Regulating the identification of disease outbreaks and other emergencies with potential international public health implications also requires technical advice to develop adequate surveillance activities. Innovative methods for screening information will no doubt become a priority as definitions of event-based surveillance, recommendations for implementing activities, and evaluations of surveillance systems are established and grow. Event-based surveillance utilizing the fast electronic communication and news sources on the Internet have been widely successful and will likely continue to help improve event-based surveillance. 32, 33, 47 The Challenges of Integrating Event-Based Surveillance

Our literature review uncovered no systems that are currently part of national programs for surveillance. Instead, they are used intermittently as complementary sources of information. We also have little information about whether or not these systems have been integrated into actual work during real-time health events. The current literature does indicate that event-based surveillance could improve official surveillance activities, but systematic evaluation within a public health agency is needed before it can be realized. 48 This is a circular dilemma, since the willingness to integrate is rooted in the lack of effectiveness studies, yet such effectiveness can be proved only by the structured evaluation of integrated systems.

The number of factors necessary for integrating such services should not be underestimated. These include time-consuming and costly collaboration with statisticians, Internet and media experts, and computer scientists to work on components of data acquisition, data processing and filtering, personalization of results, and automation for dissemination to epidemiologists. Once developed, these technical services will require staff to train and support scientific users (eg, epidemiologists) in monitoring infectious diseases, since such activities are not yet part of regular training programs for epidemiology or public health.

Another challenge is the creation of a strategy to compare and crossverify indicator-based and event-based data, since they can differ, especially in regard to syndromes and locations, which makes it difficult to make conclusions based on specific epidemiologic attributes. 49 Nonetheless, solutions must be found, perhaps newly elaborated epidemiologic ontologies for text mining and a related process of continuous improvement. Can all this be done, and is it worth it?

The benefits to epidemiologists clearly are the data retrieved for analysis and potential public health warnings and intervention. In particular, the data's value to the early warning and detection of outbreaks needs to be demonstrated by evaluating the content found in social media and other Internet data sources. Primary content (ie, firsthand observations) provided by the users themselves is valuable, as it would likely signal a potential health threat more quickly. Here again, a usability study over time is needed to help show how useful primary content would be. Online media, weblogs, scientific and nonscientific discussion forums, and direct electronic communication could help expand event-based surveillance activities, although they may have unforeseen social aspects affecting both the data and the development of a health threat. Learning of the existence of disease through firsthand observations, for example, besides signaling health events can also influence people's perception of what they are observing. If the perceived risk of an outbreak is increased, more firsthand reporting could overinflate the health event. Studies of human behavior and Internet interaction may also help clarify social and behavioral effects (eg, age, gender, education level, income, and personality traits like extraversion, openness, and emotional stability) on content generated by social media and the Internet.

Health authorities who intend to use content from social media and other Internet data also need to consider protection and privacy, such as legal and ethical implications related to using Internet and social media data for public health surveillance. For example, it remains unclear what data may be freely accessed and used and whether or not privacy laws and related issues will prevent the structured analysis of new data. These issues are relevant to any surveillance tool that processes Internet or social media data, especially at governmental institutions. 50 

Even though the importance of social media and Internet-based data to epidemiological surveillance is clear, health agencies have been reluctant to incorporate these data sources into their systems because many technical issues have not yet been addressed. The technologies used in event-based systems must be adapted to the individual perceptions of and interactions with their own epidemiological data and to social media and other data from the Internet. Future work in this field will have wide-reaching implications for investments in systems for early warnings of and responses to health threats across the globe and for optimal public health surveillance in the 21st century.

relevant. Of 827 articles, 584 remained after eliminating 243 duplicates. We carefully reviewed abstracts of the 584 remaining articles and eliminated others based on the full content of each article. The categories for classification were (1) background (ie, articles not directly describing an event-based surveillance system but rather surveillance systems in general) or (2) system (ie, articles describing at least one event-based surveillance system). Those articles categorized as system were further distinguished between those covering only one-off monitoring activities (ie, one-time collection, analysis, and interpretation of health-related data for a defined period only) vs wider surveillance (ie, continuous monitoring, systematic collection, analysis and interpretation of healthrelated data), and, finally, those covering either indicator-based or eventbased data ( Figure A1 ).

Search Results. The combined search terms retrieved 39,000 articles, and after applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria, including a rigorously defined synthesis and extraction methodology, 123 articles were identified as providing ""Background"" information only; 6 articles were identified as describing ""Monitoring Systems""; 166 articles were identified as describing an ""Indicator-Based System""; and 44 articles were identified as describing an ""Event-Based Surveillance"" system. Of those 44 articles, 18 event-based surveillance systems were identified based on reading only the abstracts. After reviewing the full texts of all 44 articles, 5 of the 18 systems that had been classified as ""Event-Based Surveillance"" did not contain sufficient information for assessment and thus were eliminated. A final result of 32 articles enabled us to provide full descriptions based on our rigorous categorical data extraction criteria, which resulted in full descriptions for 13 event-based surveillance systems used in practice.

"Cross-sectional survey on public health informatics workforce in China: issues, developments and the future Public Health","Objective: To explore the current situation and issues related to the development of the public health informatics (PHI) workforce in provincial and prefectural centers for disease control and prevention (CDCs) in China, and to describe the corresponding strategies to address these issues for the future. Study design: National cross-sectional study.","Public health informatics (PHI) was defined in 1995 as systematic application of information and computer science and technology to public health practice, research and learning. 1, 2 The knowledge domain of PHI includes public health, informatics, engineering, social science, management, etc. This concept is better known in the USA, where a number of PHI training programmes have been established, such as the twoyear public health informatics fellowship programme at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 3 and academic training programmes at Johns Hopkins University, University of Utah and University of Washington. 4 However, barriers to the widespread application of PHI exist worldwide, including a lack of public health practitioners who have received formal training in PHI. 5 A survey using information from 74 universities and colleges across Canada showed that of the 74 institutions searched, only eight institutions offered full health informatics-related programmes, and of these eight programmes, only one had content relevant to PHI. 6 In Australia, there was no clear definition and categorization of PHI, and PHI first appeared in the Australia's Health Informatics Conference in 2012. 2 The technology necessary for effective, innovative application of health information to public health practice is available today at very reasonable cost. 7 Following the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome in China in 2003, there were widespread applications for information technology (IT) in public health, such as the national webbased notifiable infectious disease surveillance system, emergency event reporting system, immunization management system, risk factor surveillance system, death and birth registry system, etc. Data centres with requisite hardware and software were also constructed at various CDC levels in China (four levels of CDCs in China cover most public health work, including one national CDC, 32 provincial CDCs, 354 prefectural CDCs and 3096 county CDCs). IT applications to support health reform and accelerate healthcare development will play an important role in the Twelfth five-year Plan period.

PHI is an interdisciplinary field and is relatively new in China, although some IT projects have been implemented in the public health domain. China is in great need of qualified public health informaticians to systematically perform increasingly complex tasks. 8 As the first national survey on PHI workforce development in China, this paper focuses on the current situation and development of a PHI workforce in CDCs in China based on a national cross-sectional study, with the aim of identifying issues and gaps, and describing a strategic direction for sustainable PHI workforce development in the future. The strategy for selection of respondents in the survey was based on a 2010 survey that covered nearly all CDCs in China, and investigated PHI workforce number, IT investments, network, hardware and systems development. 9 The 2010 survey showed an average of 10 informaticians in each provincial CDC, five in each prefectural CDC and four in each county CDC. Considering the lack of PHI workforce in most county CDCs, the 2012 survey was restricted to the informaticians at provincial CDCs, prefectural CDCs and county CDCs in municipalities directly under the Central Government.

The national PHI workforce online survey in CDCs in China was launched in July 2012 and completed in December 2012. Respondents were defined as CDC staff whose work was related to PHI, including statistics, information science, computer science, engineering and IT project management. They worked in information centres in CDCs, which were departments responsible for IT technical support. The supportive scope of the information centres covered all aspects of public health, including communicable diseases, noncommunicable diseases, environmental hygiene, etc. The routine work of the respondents involved system design, system requirements analysis, data analysis, data mining, data sharing, and network and system maintenance. In total, 1281 respondents were selected at random (five per provincial CDC and three per prefectural CDC) based on the 2010 survey results (approximately 1800 PHI staff at provincial and prefectural CDCs). These respondents had been involved in work related to PHI in the CDCs for more than one year. The Director of the Information Centre in each CDC was responsible for the random selection of respondents. The survey was conducted through a self-administered, structured questionnaire, which was validated by human resources consultants and health professionals. It consisted of seven parts including: (1) demographic information (i.e. age, sex, education); (2) knowledge of PHI development in CDCs, including the goal of PHI development and the strategic plans for PHI in CDCs; (3) selfassessment of personal work (i.e. satisfaction with workload, fitness, salary, job role, clear job description) and CDC support (i.e. clear competency-based certification and workforce promotion pathways); (4) personnel training on PHI, including p u b l i c h e a l t h 1 2 9 ( 2 0 1 5 ) 1 4 5 9 e1 4 6 4 satisfaction with training content and frequency; (5) recruitment and employment of new staff; (6) work evaluation from CDC; and (7) outflow of the workforce. Online training regarding how to complete the survey was conducted before the survey. An online data collection tool ['Epidemiological Dynamic Data Collection' (EDDC)] was used. 10, 11 This was developed by the Chinese CDC with support from the World Health Organization (WHO). It was formerly known as Web 'Epidata' 12 as it integrated most functions of Epidata and was web based, more powerful and flexible. Data quality was controlled by the EDDC system. All the logical error checks in the questionnaire were integrated into the system. Each CDC had its own username and password for the system. The system recorded each user's name and reporting date automatically after the user submitted the data. The authors followed-up each CDC to ensure an adequate response.

Parts 2e4 in the questionnaire contained cognitive and satisfaction questions, and five-point Likert scales were used to indicate the degree of agreement or disagreement with statements. 13 The average score percentage for each part represented a comprehensive evaluation for each aspect, which was calculated as actual score sum divided by maximum score for all questions in each part, multiplied by 100%. For Parts 5e7, the options were unordered categories and proportion was used as the analysis indicator.

The data were downloaded directly from the EDDC system and analysed using SAS Version 9.2. KruskaleWallis H test (a non-parametric test) was used to test for significance of the differences in score percentages, as the scores were not normally distributed. 14 Multiple comparisons of the score percentages were implemented using Bonferroni's correction method, 15 which took type I error into account. Pearson's Chisquared test was used to compare proportions. P < 0.05 was considered to indicate significance.

Thirty-two provincial CDCs (including Production and Construction Corps of Xinjiang) and 445 prefectural CDCs were divided into three regions (east, central and west) based on the basic coding manual of the Chinese Disease Control and Prevention Information System (Table 1 ). Only 7.4% (33/445) of prefectural CDCs were not involved in this survey. The main reason for non-participation was the lack of an information centre, which made it difficult to identify PHI practitioners. One hundred and sixty staff from provincial CDCs and 1121 staff from prefectural CDCs were contacted and completed the online questionnaire. Table 2 presents the demographic characteristics of the respondents by region. There were significant differences in age, educational level and academic major between the regions. A large proportion of staff in the eastern region staff (39.5%) were aged 30e39 years, which was much younger compared with the other regions (P ¼ 0.0012). Most staff with a Master's degree or a higher level of education were in the eastern region (18.7%) (P < 0.0001). There were more staff with IT-related academic majors in the eastern region (31.8%) compared with the other regions (P < 0.0001). Only 34 respondents (2.7%) had academic majors in both health and IT. Table 3 shows the respondents' score percentages in Parts 2e4. In Part 2, there were significant differences between regions, job roles and educational levels of the respondents. In the eastern region, staff in leadership positions and with a higher level of education were more knowledgeable about PHI strategy compared with other staff. In Parts 3 and 4, in the eastern region, staff in leadership positions and with a higher level of education were more inclined to report satisfaction with their personal work and training compared with other staff. Prefectural CDC staff reported a higher level of satisfaction with their work and training than staff in provincial CDCs. Overall, comparing Parts 2e4 of the questionnaire, the average satisfaction score was lowest for training (51.6%) followed by personal work (57.4%).

Parts 5e7 of the questionnaire focused on recruitment, job role, evaluation standard and outflow of the workforce. Table 4 presents the differences between the three regions. In the eastern region, 34.9% of staff were hired competitively, which was significantly higher compared with the other regions (P < 0.0001). Regarding description of their current job role, 57.8% of respondents reported they had detailed information about their responsibilities, particularly in the eastern region (62.1%, P ¼ 0.004). When asked about the type of evaluation standard that CDC used to assess their work, most respondents reported that evaluations were based on quantity (70.7%) and quality (75.6%) of work. In addition, CDCs in the eastern region were most satisfied with services (45.1%, P ¼ 0.0005), and CDCs in the western region were most satisfied with economic benefit (11.4%, P ¼ 0.013). Regarding outflow of the workforce, staff in CDCs in the western region were most likely to leave if a better job became available (37.7%, P ¼ 0.0116).

The main goals of this study were to explore the development of the PHI workforce in China, to identify potential opportunities for improvement, and to describe a strategic plan for workforce development for the future. This study found that human resources for PHI in provincial and prefectural CDCs in China had already reached a certain level. The majority (92.4%) of respondents had worked in CDCs for more than three years and accumulated some experience on PHI. The PHI strategy was established in the CDCs, and most staff were knowledgeable about it.

However, in this study, the authors also found several issues related to the PHI workforce. Firstly, there was disparity in PHI development among regions. Staff in the eastern region were younger, had a higher level of education, were more knowledgable about the PHI strategy, and were more satisfied with their work and training. CDCs in the eastern region had better systems in place for recruitment and attraction of the workforce. This may be attributed to c 2 test, P-values reported for regional differences in each category. a P < 0.05. b Public health informatics management role at a centre for disease control and prevention, including director, deputy director or branch (office) chief.

p u b l i c h e a l t h 1 2 9 ( 2 0 1 5 ) 1 4 5 9 e1 4 6 4 disparities in regional development, such as the level of gross domestic product, local government investment, and local policy on talent development. Secondly, there was a shortage of staff with a background in PHI able to address the complexity of PHI tasks. Thirdly, the score for satisfaction with training was extremely low. Coverage, frequency and content of training need to be improved. Fourthly, there is a need for a clearly articulated occupational development path for workforce development, including education, definition of job role, promotion, assessment standard and in-job training. Components of the occupational development path should be closely linked. In this study, only 39.3% of respondents reported they had a clear occupational development path. Finally, the score for job satisfaction showed significant differences between levels of CDC, job role and educational level, which indicates that the concerns of provincial CDC staff, general staff and staff in lower positions need to be addressed. These issues should be addressed using a hierarchical model. Organization and individual are the main factors that influence these issues. As such, all the indicators based on the need for organization development and skilled workforce development were extracted. In the PHI domain, skilled workforce development can be divided into national strategic support and local skills support. The conceptual framework for developing the PHI workforce was described considering p u b l i c h e a l t h 1 2 9 ( 2 0 1 5 ) 1 4 5 9 e1 4 6 4 disparities in regional development and diverse levels of CDCs (Fig. 1) . The following three strategies will promote development of the current workforce. First, for organization development, policy and funding support must target the central and western regions in order to attract and retain more talented personnel. Optimizing organizational structure can help provide top priority to the PHI. Communication and collaboration between the eastern, central and western regions and international organizations may lead to common progress. Culture building, such as leisure-time activity organization, will play an important role in work satisfaction.

Second, national or regional strategic support must be more macro-level, comprehensive and instructional, and include policy making, standard making, framework, method or technique innovation and improvement, project evaluation, work inspection and monitoring, and overall training.

Third, local skills development must be more specific and targeted. The skills must be requirement driven instead of pursuing the most advanced techniques. PHI activity could be community based and technique based.

Based on the findings from this study, the authors suggested three main strategies for achieving PHI workforce development objectives in China. The short-term strategy is to establish Chinese competency schema of PHI and standardize the objective, competency, education course and job descriptions of PHI according to the current situation and framework in developed countries; promote collaborative relationships with international PHI organizations; and encourage the PHI workforce to take an active part in international training programmes. The medium-term strategy is to establish the PHI education, training and examination schema with support from the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology and the Ministry of Education; keep close contact with the government and university, and improve the system of occupational training; and increase investment in PHI organization improvement and workforce training. The long-term strategy is to establish the PHI labour code and PHI occupational development paths; explore the evaluation system of the PHI workforce; and solve the problems in PHI workforce development completely.

Determinants of emergency response responsibility perceptions in the local public health workforce after China's health sector restructuring,"Background: Local health departments are the backbone of public health emergency (PHE) response plans. The front line of emergency response preparedness is people. Role perceptions of individual staff members of a given organization strongly affect response probability and performance. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine local public health employees' perceptions of emergency response responsibilities, identify factors that influence their perception, and indicate the challenges and bottlenecks of PHE response in the Health Inspection Institution (HII) after its separation from China's multiple Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Methods: We used a stratified randomized sample survey to examine HII workers' knowledge of their own duties concerning PHE response in 17 facilities in Heilongjiang, a province in northeastern China. Data were collected from May to July 2010 using a 9-item combined question inquiring about the workers' statutory duties. Results: Of 348 administered surveys, 309 were returned for an overall response rate of 88.8 %. Overall, the correct recognition rate of PHE responsibilities was low. Some HII workers were confused about their responsibilities required by law, regulations, and emergency response plans. A quarter of all the respondents had the lowest knowledge for PHE responsibilities. Factors influencing their perceptions of responsibilities were department, work experience in a CDC, and PHE response experience. Conclusions: To improve preparedness for a PHE, efforts are needed to train, support, and monitor the workers' knowledge and competencies in PHEs as part of an organizational change; the worker's knowledge of their responsibilities should be measured and used as an indicator of preparedness for a PHE, and training should be undertaken where there are deficiencies. Management should also encourage workers in the departments of food hygiene/school health surveillance to be more involved in PHE preparedness and response issues.","Recent years have witnessed a number of microbial threats that have greatly jeopardized public health in many areas of the world. One of the most publicized cases is severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), whose outbreak and rapid spread in more than 25 countries in early 2003 claimed numerous lives and caused tremendous economic losses. It is predicted that new pathogens-originating naturally or from bioterrorism-will continue to emerge and cause new public health emergencies (PHEs) [1] [2] [3] [4] . Response to PHEs should be regarded as a global issue and particular attention should be paid to developing countries that have relatively fewer resources to deal with PHEs [1] .

The outbreak of SARS exposed a fundamental shortcoming not only in China's public health system but also in China's limited ability to detect and respond to emergencies in a timely and effective manner [1, 5] .

Realizing the weakness of its public health systems, China is undertaking extensive efforts to improve its public health system by establishing and strengthening its ""one mechanism and three systems"" approach: the PHE response mechanism, disease control and prevention, medical treatment, and the health inspection and health law enforcement system. As one of the newest responsibilities assigned to public health agencies after SARS, PHE response is at the forefront of public attention and involves numerous players; the major providers are in healthcare sectors such as health bureaus, hospitals, multiple Centers for Disease control and Prevention (CDCs), and Health Inspection Institutions (HIIs).

Local health departments are considered the backbone of public health response plans for any and all PHEs [6] . The PHE response during the Ebola epidemic that occurred in West Africa in 2014 reiterated this position. The HII has been established as a new branch of China's public health system after separation from the CDCs under China's health sector reform and subsequent organizational transformation in 2010. Increasing HII preparedness for disasters-especially local preparedness-is a significant concern of public health planners because several studies suggest that the initial response to a PHE would generally begin at the local level [7] [8] [9] .

The front line of emergency response preparedness is people [10] . Role perceptions of individual staff members of a given organization will factor strongly into response probability and performance [11, 12] . Job responsibility awareness has always been imperative for people to perform tasks effectively [13] . We define job responsibility as a state in which the individual perceives an obligation for a situation or event [14] .

The shortage of job knowledge and job responsibility might decrease job performance, because job knowledge predicts job performance [15] . Daniel and his colleagues at the Johns Hopkins Center for Public Health Preparedness identified specific barriers to adopting an emergency response culture in local health departments. These barriers include public health employees' fear for their personal and family safety in emergencies, coupled with a lack of insight into how valuable they are to crisis response efforts [16, 17] . Differences in perceptions of responsibilities in PHE preparedness across administrative levels is another barrier, because different public health information, programs, and distribution channels may be required to increase preparedness among different subgroups. Thus, understanding each individual's role in response to a PHE is considered key for competent response [18] .

However, with the separation from the CDC and the addition of PHE response as a new function came many challenges for the HIIs in terms of implementing the work: the current health supervision system model is not uniform and personnel status is not clear, among other issues. The most critical challenge is the absence of clearly defined duties and responsibilities. The assignment of responsibility and the response procedures have not been specified in detail [19] . Several overlapping roles and responsibilities between the CDC system and the HII system have hindered their interagency cooperation. The CDC possesses techniques for public health surveillance, while the HIIs have the authority to conduct surveillance. In practice, some staff complain that they always feel embarrassed because they cannot decide how, where, when, or how frequently to conduct surveillance. Many projects have to be delayed owing to poor cooperation [3, 14] .

Previous studies have shown that during extreme scenarios, a majority of healthcare workers may be unable or unwilling to report to duty [16] . This may be true even for local health departments. Little is known about administrative differences in HII preparedness-especially after the separation of the HII from the CDC [18] . Few studies, however, have focused on the preparedness and competent response of local HIIs in China for policy makers. One reason might be that HII only recently became a separate agency from the CDCs.

As the major provider in dealing with PHEs after the 2003 SARS crisis, do HII workers clearly know their duties related to the PHE? What factors influence their perception? What are the challenges and bottleneck problems? The solution to these essential questions will be effective in generating a competent PHE response. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess local public health employees' perceptions of emergency response responsibilities after China's health sector restructuring, and to uncover the variables that affect these outcomes, thus providing much needed evidence for health departments' training efforts. In this study, we demonstrate that the CDCs and HIIs have not yet formed a closely coordinated relationship after the sector restructuring. Further, HII workers still do not clearly understand their PHE responsibilities and this lack of understanding could also occur during reforms of health sectors in other countries.

The present study used a quantitative approach, analyzing HII workers' perception of responsibilities associated with a PHE and the determinants to indirectly assess the development and status of HII emergency preparedness capacity at the individual level in Heilongjiang. We developed the study objectives and questionnaire in collaboration with representatives of the Heilongjiang Public Health System (Health Bureau, CDC, HII, and public hospital) and piloted it in Harbin, the capital city of Heilongjiang province.

The study protocol was reviewed and approved by the Research Ethics Committee of Harbin Medical University. All participants indicated their willingness to take part, both verbally and in consent forms signed before the commencement of interviews.

This study was undertaken in Heilongjiang province, northeast China. Heilongjiang has 13 cities. The questionnaire survey was conducted with the stratified-cluster sampling method. Considering the geographical and jurisdictional diversity, we first divided Heilongjiang's 13 cities into three subgroups according to 4 indicators: [20, 21] . Then, three cities-Harbin, Mudanjiang, and Yichun (and their counties or districts)-were selected from these three subgroups on the basis of the other two indicators, which was the number of PHEs per 10,000 population (≥0.75, national average level) and the coverage rate of health supervision (≥80 %, national average level) [22] . These three cities have a total of 48 agencies for HIIs. After providing a detailed description of the purpose of the survey, 17 facilities expressed an interest to participate in the survey (1 provincial, 3 municipal, and 13 county and district HIIs).

Subsequently, the researchers visited these 17 agencies to conduct the face-to-face interviews. All the staff at each agency participated in the survey except those on leave. Finally, we obtained 309 completed questionnaires (response rate: 88.8 %) from health inspectors (with inspector licenses granted by China's Ministry of Health); data collection occurred during May to July 2010.

Dependent variables indicated the outcome of staff perceptions of their job responsibilities associated with a PHE. The response duties of staff from healthcare sectors (health bureaus, hospitals, CDCs, and HIIs) have been summarized in 4 clauses [1, 5] , which are further classified into 9 categories (Table 1) . We assessed the perception of job responsibility among HII practitioners using a 9-item combined question inquiring about these statutory duties (SD; items 1, 3, 5, 7, and 8): ""Among these 9 items, which are the SDs of your health inspection institution? (1) Under the direction of local health administrations, conduct an inspection of the PHE response measures of hospitals, (2) Conduct epidemiologic investigations, (3) Conduct an inspection of the PHE response measures of CDCs, (4) Public information release, (5) Supervise the PHE response process; (6) Organize/conduct a mass vaccination campaign, (7) Conduct an inspection of the enforcement of laws and regulations related to PHE, (8) Assist the local health administration to carry out investigations into irregularities of the PHE response, (9) Supervise the PHE response process at health administrations."" Allowed responses were ""yes,"" ""no,"" or ""don't know."" Item 2, 4, 6, 9 are the responsibilities of other health sectors: CDCs or health bureaus; the correct answer for these items was ""no.""

We selected independent variables based on discussions with representatives of the Heilongjiang Public Health System. The variables included gender, age, educational level and background, job content, work experience in a CDC, PHE training/drills experience, PHE response experience, and administrative levels: provincial, municipal, or county/district HIIs. PHE training/drills experience was defined as a positive response to the following question: ""Have you participated in any PHE training, exercise, or drill?"" Allowed responses were ""yes,"" ""no,"" or ""don't know."" Work experience in a CDC was defined as a positive response to the following question: ""Have you ever worked in a CDC?"" Allowed responses were ""yes,"" ""no,"" or ""don't know."" PHE response experience was defined as a positive response to: ""How many times have you participated in PHE responses?"" Allowed responses were ""0 = never participated"" or the number of times they had participated.

Finally, the variable job content was defined as whether the respondents engaged in the following 6 items: (1) medical institutions inspection, infectious disease supervision, and mother and baby care surveillance; (2) food hygiene and school health surveillance; (3) health inspection of public facilities, cosmetics, and drinking water; (4) occupational health and radioactive surveillance; (5) health law enforcement and supervision; (6) health inspection and enforcement information management. Allowed responses were ""yes"" or ""no.""

Data were analyzed using SAS version 9.1. We analyzed the responses of 309 participants after excluding 39 participants with responses of ""don't know"" or who refused to answer any of the questions. Descriptive statistics were calculated to describe the demographic characteristics. Differences among the provincial, municipal, county/ district groups were determined using chi-square and two-tailed t-tests for categorical and continuous variables, respectively. Fisher's exact test was used if subgroups included less than 10 subjects.

The staff 's correct recognition of SDs and the proportion of ways to recognize their own job responsibilities related to PHE response were detected using chi square tests (χ 2 ). Univariate analysis was performed to characterize the sample, followed by bivariate analysis to determine the relationship between dependent and independent variables.

Finally, multiple variable logistic regression analyses were performed with the correct recognition of PHE responsibilities as the dependent variable. We derived a dichotomous indicator for the dependent variables: coded ""1"" if the responses to all 5 SDs were ""yes,"" and coded ""0"" if otherwise. All regression models generated adjusted odds ratios (AORs) and 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) that measured the independent relationship of each covariate to the outcome variables, after we adjusted for confounding by the other covariates. Statistical significance was defined as P < 0.05.

Characteristics of the sample by provincial, municipal, and county/district levels are shown in Table 2 . Of the total sample (n = 309), most participants (74.76 %) were 30 to 50 years of age; most of the respondents (45.95 %) reported having a college or graduate degree, but with notable differences between the groups: 74.14 % of the provincial group, 61.11 % of the municipal group, and 27.33 % of the district/county group (P < 0.0001). Overall, approximately a quarter of the respondents' job content involved food hygiene/school health surveillance (26.86 %) and health inspection for public facilities/cosmetics/drinking water (24.27 %).

In the county/district HIIs, more people had undergone PHE training or drills, and more people had work experience in a CDC (all P < 0.001; Table 2 ). Overall, 50.49 % of respondents underwent PHE training/drills, with the county/district group having the highest reported frequency (72.05 %), followed by the municipal group (58.89 %) and the provincial group (31.03 %). When asked whether they had work experience in a CDC, over half of the respondents (53.72 %) reported they had worked in a CDC before the separation of the HII from a CDC; the county/district group had the highest reported proportion of participants with work experience in a CDC (65.22 %) compared to the provincial group (55.17 %) and municipal group (32.22 %). Furthermore, 50.49 % of the respondents reported that they had participated in some kind of PHE response; there were no significant group differences.

Overall, 54.37 % (n = 309) of respondents picked out 5 SDs from the 9-item combined question. Among the three groups, the municipal group had the highest correct recognition rate (57.78 %), followed by the county/district group (55.28 %) and provincial group (46.55 %); the differences were significant (P <0.05).

Different correct recognitions of SDs by level are shown in Table 3 . SD 3 (supervise the PHE response process) had the highest correct recognition rate (94.50 %) and SD 2 (conduct an inspection of the PHE response measures of the CDC) had the lowest recognition rate (69.90 %).

There were notable differences among the three levels in the correct recognition rate of SDs 1, 3, and 5; the responses showed a similar trend: the correct recognition rates of the municipal and county/district groups were better than those of the provincial group. Table 4 shows the observed frequency of responses to the question, ""How do you recognize your job responsibilities related to a public health emergency?"" Overall, the job description was the main method through which the workers recognized their PHE responsibilities: it had the highest percentage of ""yes"" responses (58.90 %), followed by the emergency plan (57.93 %), and the official written assignment (54.05 %). However, the assignment had the highest ""yes"" responses in the provincial group: more than half of the respondents (53.45 %) reported that they knew their responsibilities through the assignment; in the municipal and county/district groups, the predominant ways to recognize one's responsibilities were the emergency plan (75.56 %) and job description (58.39 %). There was no group difference with respect to the assignment (P = 0.8925) or job description (P = 0.3021). Conversely, there was a group difference with respect to the emergency plan and self-learning: these had the greatest effect on the municipal group (75.56 % vs. 41.38 % on the provincial group and 54.04 % on the county/district group, P < 0.0001), followed by the provincial group (22.41 % vs. 9.32 % on the county/district group and 7.78 % on the municipal group, P <0.05) and county/district group (4.97 %, P <0.05).

Multivariate logistic regression revealed that job content, work experience in a CDC, and PHE response experience factors were independently related to an increased correct recognition rate of job responsibilities associated with PHE responses (Table 5 ). Respondents whose job content involved supervision of medical institutions/infectious disease/mother & baby care (AOR = 5.031, 95 % CI = 2.235-11.323), public facilities/cosmetics/drinking water (AOR = 2.255, 95 % CI = 1.129-4.505), occupational/radiation (AOR = 3.450, 95 % CI = 1.542-7.716), or administrative enforcement (AOR = 4.413, 95 % CI = 1.711-11.378) were more likely than those with a job content involving food hygiene/school health surveillance or information management/other to exhibit correct knowledge of their PHE responsibilities. Respondents with work experience in a CDC were more likely to know their PHE responsibilities better than persons without CDC work experience (AOR = 1.886, 95 % CI = 1.094-3.249); respondents who reported PHE response experience exhibited knowledge of their PHE responsibilities more 

Although a decade and a year has passed since the 2003 SARS outbreak and subsequent separation of the HII from the CDC with the Chinese public health system rebuilding and restructuring, HII staff members still do not clearly understand their job responsibilities associated with PHE response. Our data showed that almost 55 % of respondents identified the 5 SDs from the 9-item combined question. Among them were respondents who chose more responsibilities from the 9-item question (items 2, 4, 7, 9 are the responsibilities of other health sectors: CDCs or health bureaus) as SDs. Thus, only 10.03 % answered the question accurately; namely, after the separation of the HII from the CDC, only one-tenth of respondents not only knew what their functional role requirements were in a PHE response as required by regulations, laws, and China's National Public Health Emergency Planning, but they also knew what were not their duties (some of them are duties of the CDC). Furthermore, the item ""Conduct an inspection of the PHE response measures of the CDC"" had the lowest correct recognition rate (69.90 %, Table 3 ) among the 5 SDs. This result is consistent with those of one study showing that the relationship between the CDC and HII had not yet been coordinated since the Chinese public health system was divided into the multiple CDCs and the HII. The CDCs possess techniques for public health surveillance, while the HII possesses the authority to conduct surveillance [19] . However, many HII workers still confuse the HII's responsibilities with the CDC's. Combined with the actual situation in China, in theory, when a PHE occurs, according to the needs of the event itself, the Ministry of Health will set up an emergency squad composed of health professionals from the CDCs, HIIs, and other emergency agencies [20] . For example, the HII and cosmetics and drinking water departments may be temporarily called to participate in emergency work and would be required to fulfill the emergency duties planned. However, in reality, if a large-scale PHE does occur in China, special department personnel are not enough. These situations, for example, a large-scale drinking water contamination, call for increased manpower; whenever possible, staff from the food sector will be transferred to offer temporary support. When the emergency squad needs a health supervisor, the department's most experienced employees may take precedence, but this selection of department staff may not strictly depend on the nature of the epidemic. Therefore, the duties prescribed in the plan are macroregulations for an overall HII. In China, the PHE responsibilities do not involve correspondence with other departments [21] . Therefore, staff from each healthcare sector do not have specific responsibilities, which results in overlapping responsibilities between the HII and CDC and other healthcare sectors as well as between the departments in the HII. This in turn causes delays in PHE response and reduced response efficiency when the HII has to conduct an inspection of the PHE response measures of the CDC or assist the local health administration to investigate irregularities in PHE responses. The existence of poor communication between these departments was observed in the present survey conducted: SD 2 and SD 5 were associated with the poorest responses.

In comparison, health sectors in Canada and the United States have clearly outlined roles, with no cross-functional associations and relatively independent work [22] . In Australia, the existing health supervision and management systems were adopted from the British. Here, health supervision and other regulations have implementation details, and are founded by strong operational regulations, system, and hierarchy. We can learn and implement much from the Federal Emergency Management Agency in the United States: increase tasks not agencies, but feel free to adjust the goals, focus, and department in accordance with the actual situation to improve emergency response capabilities in China [23] [24] [25] [26] .

We initially thought that the provincial group would have had the highest correct recognition rate because it had the highest educational level of the three groups [27, 28] . However, in the present study, the respondents' educational level was higher than that of the general educational status of China's HIIs: 45.95 % of participants reported college or above education levels compared to the 27.1 % reported across the nation [29] [30] [31] . Our results also demonstrated that educational levels do not explain the difference between PHE responsibility recognition rates in these groups. Overall, the PHE responsibility recognition in municipal and county/district groups was better than the provincial group's-this was unexpected because the provincial group had higher educational levels than the other 2 groups, and, because the provincial HII was located in the capital city, the workers were theoretically more likely to access PHE response information and be exposed to high-end technology [32] [33] [34] [35] .

Also important is the notable difference in PHE training/ drills; lower-level HIIs reported a higher frequency of training/drills. That might explain the higher PHE recognition in the lower HIIs. That fact also highlights the necessity of organizing multisector response drills. The other reason may be that lower-level HIIs have fewer workers and have to play multifaceted roles. There are about 10 workers in each county/district HII and their jobs will vary with needs; thus, they had some general knowledge in different areas.

Low PHE responsibility-recognition levels among food hygiene/school health surveillance workers As previously suggested by Benatar (1997 Benatar ( , 1998 [36, 37] , the duty to care must be placed in a wider context to include considerations that transcend individual obligations. As Bensimon's study illustrates, the broader institutional and societal context must be taken into account.

This finding suggests that interventions need to target workers in the departments of food hygiene/school health surveillance. At the same time, since the job content of over a quarter of the respondents in our study was food hygiene/school health surveillance, such interventions might be the most effective way to enhance the levels of PHE responsibility recognition. Job content, having work experience in a CDC, and having experience with previous PHE response factors influence the correct recognition rate of job responsibilities associated with a PHE.

More than a quarter of the total respondents were food hygiene/school health surveillance workers, but their PHE responsibility recognition level was the worst. Increasing the food hygiene/school health surveillance workers' recognition of PHE responsibilities is significant for improving PHE preparedness and response, especially since China's Ministry of Health announced that the top two major PHE causes are food poisoning, with the high-risk location being schools-especially primary and middle schools in rural areas [38] .

Most food hygiene/school health surveillance workers used to be food hygiene supervisors before HII became an independent agency of the public health system. At that time, their job responsibility focused on inspection of food hygiene, and they adhered to outdated working practices: the job content did not require inspection of hospitals and CDCs. The workers were, therefore, not familiar with the new requirements such as supervising PHE response measures of hospitals regarding the PHE response process or assisting local health administrations investigate irregularities in the PHE response. If left unresolved, this situation might pose a weak link in China's PHE response chain.

Finally, multivariate logistic regressions revealed a strong association between responses involving correct recognition rates for the 5 SDs and job contents, work experience in a CDC, and having PHE experience. Workers in the department of food hygiene/school health surveillance and information management/other had decreased recognition of their correct PHE responsibilities. They had the lowest correct recognition rate of the 5 SDs. Having work experience in a CDC and having personal experience in disaster response, however, were associated with increased recognition of PHE responsibilities. This result was consistent with that in a study wherein personal experience with disasters was associated with increased adoption of protective behaviors [39] .

This may require innovative training, severe punishment, and organizational development methods, such as those in place in Canada and Australia, to enhance preparedness skills and create a culture of organizational readiness among public health workers through a process of ""syntonic"" organizational change [40] . In the syntonic model, organizational change is a nonthreatening, natural growth process that is more likely to be embraced by employees than resisted; key factors in syntonic change include anticipatory guidance and experiential learning [40] . Although the assignment of responsibility and response procedures have not been specified in detail, overall, the job description (58.90 %) was the most powerful way to help HII workers to recognize their duties associated with a PHE response, followed by the emergency plan (57.93 %) and the assignment (54.05 %). The emergency plan is the fundamental structure in municipal HIIs; three-fourth of municipal respondents reported that they recognized their PHE responsibilities through the emergency plan, compared to 4 of 10 provincial HII workers and half of the county/district workers. The assignment also played a critical role, and there was no difference between the 3 groups; over 50 % of the workers perceived their responsibilities through the assignment.

This study has several limitations. First, data were collected using self-assessment tools, and therefore, the general level of emergency preparedness may be overestimated. Second, the study's time and resource restrictions confined the investigation to 17 agencies in one province, the data for which may not be generalizable to other geographic areas. However, the findings of this research could be used in emergency response procedures in the future. Through the examination of HII workers' knowledge of their own duties, it may be possible to improve the efficiency of the workforce in the HII during PHE response.

The circumstances surrounding the SARS crisis made it both possible and desirable to explicitly address the question of duty to care. Our study demonstrates that after the sector restructuring in China, the CDCs and HIIs have not yet formed a closely coordinated relationship. Our study reveals that HII workers still do not clearly understand their PHE responsibilities and that this lack of understanding could also occur during reforms of health sectors in other countries.

The outcome of our study also highlights the complexities of organizational restructuring, which may decrease PHE preparedness and response capacity. A lack of standard and basic requirements for PHE response-such as general tasks, functions, and responsibilities in routine job descriptions-will ultimately hinder efficient behaviors during the PHE response process. To improve preparedness for a PHE, perceptions of responsibilities should be used as an additional indicator of preparedness. Furthermore, from the perspective of globalization significance, China is facing the same problems, including delayed initiation and slow development of the PHE response, such as many other developing countries. These results may be useful to guide preparedness interventions in developing countries and future research.

Communciation Channels to Help Build an International Community of Education and Practice,"Two-way communication is required if nurses are to build knowledge networks of international communities of nursing education and practice. Are expensive new technologies feasible or preferred for effective communication and productive outcomes? In this report from a longstanding partnership between schools of nursing at Peking University and the University of Michigan, case study methodology is used to evaluate more than a decade of experience with communication modalities: in person, postal mail, express mail, e-mail, fax, telephone, hand delivery by other travelers, and Web sites. Although each education and practice community develops unique ways to build its shared knowledge, a communications plan is suggested, with use of multiple communication techniques, especially those that are low cost and the most dependable. High-cost technologies are not always feasible or preferred. For the project described, they were not necessary to the major outcome, a nursing education and practice network that resulted in the first nurse-managed community-based clinic in China. (","A S NURSING FACUILTY do more collaborative education programs and research projects with colleagues in nations around the world, many find that in-depth collaboration is easier said than done (Meleis, 2002; Wright, Godue, Manfredi, & Korniewicz, 1998) . The amount of time and money can easily extend beyond expectations; therefore, cost must be considered as well as feasibility, participants' preferences, and goal achievement.

The project examined here is an example of a dynamic knowledge network that built a community of education and practice (Allee, 1997; Wenger, 1996) across schools of nursing on opposite sides of the globe. The purpose of this report is to describe and evaluate the full array of communication techniques used in the 6-year preparatory period and 7-year funded period of this relationship.

A program of collaboration between schools of nursing at Peking University (Beida) in Beijing, China and the University of Michigan (UM) in Ann Arbor, Michigan was possible because of a series of formal and informal visits to China by UM nursing faculty in the early 1990s. Funded by small grants from the W.K. Kellogg Foundation, UM, and the individual visitors, these contacts had been facilitated by Sharon Woodcock, a retired foreign service nurse and wife of the first U.S. Ambassador to China, Leonard Woodcock.

As Meleis (2002) has remarked, international collaboration needs to be initiated by established scholars. Successful collaboration often requires early visits by school leaders, and this is certainly true for work with Chinese institutions. Accordingly, UM's Dean Hinshaw visited Beida's Dean Yao in 1996. The result was that the two deans signed a formal agreement (see Figure 1) of collaboration between their schools. This agreement assured recognition by higher university officials because the signing ceremony was held in the office of the president of Beida, with formal arrangements and approval by the university's Office of International Affairs. This type of symbolic support can be required, or at least facilitative. In both universities, the schools of nursing have received more visibility and recognition for their collaboration because they can cite this agreement in annual reports and funding proposals. As shown in Figure 1 , the language of this agreement is general, not restrictive or binding.

In 1997, with this agreement signed, UM's university-wide International Partnerships Program provided funds for a formal visit by Beida's Dean Yao and then Associate Dean Zheng (now dean) to UM. As a result of this visit, both sides believed that there could be mutually beneficial activities. In Ann Arbor, we decided together to focus first on community-based nursing care because it was an emphasis of the Chinese government and a historic interest of a nearby funding source, the W.K. Kellogg Foundation. Given the strong support of the deans of both schools, the spark provided by a person competent in both Chinese and U.S. academic cultures, and the interest of a senior UM faculty, our proposal was successful. With funding of approximately $50,000 per year total for both sides, we have built a long-lived, substantive partnership with its primary focus on curriculum and clinical teaching and a secondary focus on research. The first stage of this collaboration was short-term training for Beida faculty (Zheng, Hinshaw, Yu, Guo, & Oakley, 2000) ; the second stage was expansion of Beida's undergraduate community health curriculum, including the first nurse-managed clinic in China to provide community health clinical experiences for undergraduate and graduate students (Lu, Shang & Liu, in press; Yu & Shang, Figure 1 . Two universities' formal agreement to work together. 2004). Throughout, each side's expenditures were accounted for separately. In the second phase, the amount budgeted for Beida expenses required a subcontract with UM, the primary grant recipient.

Realistically, the deeper sharing and mutuality of in-person communication has to be supplemented by a number of distance communication techniques. Casestudy methodology (Gilliham, 2000; McNamee, 1988 ) is used to evaluate each of these techniques. The case experiences are described and then evaluated for generalizability to other long-term international collaborations using the criteria of feasibility, cost (time, money), and collaborators' preferences. Outcomes are also described.

During each year of our funded project (except 2002, during the severe acute respiratory syndrome [SARS] crisis), the UM faculty team made site visits in Beijing. Together with Beida faculty, regional or national 2-to-3-day workshops were provided, with topics such as developing community health nursing curricula, community health clinical models, and business plans for nursing clinics. During the annual site visits, the collaborative project team also spent time developing and reviewing work plans, discussing evaluation designs and instruments, and planning new proposals. Each year, visiting scholars from the Beida faculty also came to UM for short-term training of one week to one semester. Short-term learning at UM was selected because Beida could not spare faculty for longer-term training due to faculty shortages; also, both sides wanted to assure that visitors would return to their own university.

While at UM, the visiting scholars observed classes and/or clinical work, collaborated on research about Chinese or Chinese-Americans, and exchanged information with individual faculty. Beida expanded its undergraduate community health nursing curriculum after the visiting scholars shared ideas about what U.S. students learn in a community course and what community nurses do in their work. A China-appropriate vision of clinicals in community health nursing could also be discussed as the visiting scholars brought back information about what UM's community nursing clinic was like. Beida faculty used pictures, booklets, texts, and small equipment obtained at UM in their own teaching. At UM, the visiting scholars also pro-vided courses or schoolwide seminars about health and nursing in China; and as their community health nursing program grew, the Beida faculty could share their own educational and clinical materials with UM faculty and students.

Productivity of the project depended largely on distance communications via postal and express mail services, e-mail, fax, telephone, hand delivery by other travelers, and the Internet. Each of the distance communication channels has its advantages and disadvantages, and each should be used in the most productive ways. Illustrations are shown in Table 1 .

Sending invoices, receipts, payments, and other documents between China and the United States via the post office takes 10 to 14 days for delivery but may be necessary for original documentation at prices that are lower than express mail service. While the tracking systems used by the express mail services are useful, they require specification of content. In one case, a check was returned because the receiving nation's customs service rejected such a large amount without further documentation. We learned that regular mail suffices for the official checks between universities.

Our most frequent means of communication has been e-mail, for team discussion of substantive and monetary issues, transmission of helpful materials in both directions, and for a curriculum project called the Undergraduate Connection, an online link between undergraduate nursing classes. Each month the project team at Beida met to discuss issues and progress. The next day/night the project directors at the two universities discussed these issues, UM questions, and progress reports, in Mandarin, over the telephone in order to provide interactive opportunities for questions and thoughtful discussion. Within 24 hours, the UM project team met to receive the update, to provide consultative ideas, and to formulate further questions and appropriate suggestions. The minutes of these meetings were transmitted to the entire team via e-mail. We also exchanged manuscripts, project reports, and other substantive material as e-mail attachments. Great resources can be shared by forwarding from worldwide learning materials such as the Health Programs Trainers' News (tnorton@JHPIEGO.net) and the health promotion lecture archive Supercourses (www.pitt. edu/ϳsuper1).

We have also used in-person transport of physical materials required for collaborative projects. Two research projects related to our main project have in- volved packages (e.g., bulky videotapes, research instrumentation) carried to or from China by other travelers. Hand-carrying allowed the items to be included as regular luggage, and customs explanations were prepared. Fortunately, the travelers were not stopped. Web sites or shared Internet spaces are often used to assist collaborations within the United States or with colleagues in westernized nations. The only attempt to use a shared Internet space was the Undergraduate Connection, a link between undergraduate nursing classes. Students exchanged information about their health systems, nursing roles, professional issues, and personal goals. The shared Internet space did not work because early trials showed that UM's shared space for courses could not be made accessible to nonenrolled students at that time. A Web site was then developed, but all UM websites were later inaccessible inside China, for reasons about which we can only speculate. Because e-mails were not blocked, the students succeeded by exchanging e-mail messages.

In-person visits require money, so if our collaboration is to be generalized, other programs need to be able to find financial support. The feasibility of financial support is probably growing. A number of universities have curricular interests in international nursing or international health (Ekstrom & Sigurdsson, 2002; Iwasiw et al., 2000; Wright et al., 1998) , and universities seem to be making some real or in-kind resources available for international collaborations to build communities of nursing education and practice. The large number of experiences yet to be reported in peer-reviewed publications suggests that site-visit exchanges are feasible for many schools of nursing. Our experience suggests strongly that these be institutionally based, with early visits by the appropriate leaders.

Feasibility can be enhanced by using site-visit time wisely and minimizing dollar costs, familiar issues to nursing faculty. As with any personal or professional visit, both hosts and visitors must join in planning the timing of visits. Our experience has also made us particularly aware that it is helpful to have a clear understanding about the time commitment of the hosting institution. Especially in major cities like Beijing, leading universities are visited by many important Chinese and international experts, and teaching schedules are extraordinarily demanding. When visiting scholars come to UM, we find that the American faculty members, particularly those who are not on the project team, can also easily feel overburdened by one more visitor. Visits on both sides are more productive when there is agreement in advance about objectives and schedules of scheduled visits (Franklin, 2001) , a practice commonly adopted by nursing faculty. However, we found that it takes reminders from both sides to prepare-by e-mailing PowerPoint presentations well in advance, for example-to allow time for translation. The host site also needs adequate time to schedule in-depth meetings with experts and issue invitations to workshops or seminars. Preparing for site visits using distance communication can make precious professional time productive.

Feasibility of distance communication technologies varies when considering United States-China collaboration. E-mail access can be restricted when the only computer is in a single office that is usually locked to avoid theft in a resource-short society or when the whole system fails (as in the East-Midwest power outage of 2003) or is blocked. When people do not have their own home computers or e-mail accounts, the speed of e-mail responses can be slower and more formalized. In our experience, e-mail is less likely to be affected than Web sites, chat groups, bulletin boards, and other Internet mechanisms. But whenever there are exchanges of information and ideas, it is best to save negative input for one-to-one exchanges and use more group-oriented interchange for positive support (Gamonal, 2003) . Telephone communications are excellent for people speaking the same language but too cumbersome for the busy people at both ends when translations are required. Speakerphones facilitate group interactions but may not be available at both sites. Time differences can also demand awkward accommodations at one site, or both. Fax machines may have to be turned off at night, or they may be located in a central university office, requiring extra delivery time and expense.

Cost of site visits can be minimized by economizing on living arrangements. Extravagant hotels send a clear message that project funds can be spent for luxurious comfort of the visitors, not for the project's productivity. While it may not be possible for Americans to stay within a foreign visitors' section of the host university because of severe lack of amenities, U.S. visitors should prepare for basic accommodations. They should feel safe and have access to hotel staff who speak some English to help make sightseeing and other arrangements. (Nowadays there are so many nursing visitors to the major eastern cities in China, and students and young faculty are so busy that it is burdensome for them to repeatedly act as tour guides, especially outside of regular work hours. In Western China, in contrast, students and faculty may cherish opportunities to practice English and make personalized relationships). Similarly, Chinese visitors can be housed in modest settings and enjoy home stays as long as they have privacy and access to familiar foods. Most academic nurses in both countries are accustomed to sharing nonluxurious accommodations, making the type of budget for our project feasible for others.

For many cultures, and definitely for Chinese and Americans, when visits are made in either direction, the cost of gifts and banquets should be considered a substantive part of site visits. The cost of gifts can be contained by presenting university symbols (e.g., plates, calendars, pen sets) to high officials and more modest items (e.g., lapel pins, bookmarks, small photo albums of project participants) to others. Welcoming and farewell banquets are expected. They are not luxuries, but rather settings during which background and off-the-record conversations bring important issues to light. These and other informal settings such as lunches and taxi rides can be useful ways to bring up unplanned agenda items, gain deeper understanding, and gain advice about sensitive topics. Nurses in both cultures are well practiced in maximizing use of informal times with colleagues. Costs of banquets can be contained by asking Chinese colleagues to help select appropriate nearby restaurants in China and using Chinese restaurants in the United States because this would be culturally sensitive to the visitors' tastes.

Monetary expenditures ease matters on both sides. Our project budget included $1,000 for hosting expenses (payments to students as translators and guides, for van rentals, group meals, etc.) for each site visit to Beida in addition to Beida's subcontract for establishing the clinic, $1,000 in consultation fees for UM's nonproject content experts traveling to Beijing for workshops, and payments of $100 to $200 for nonproject faculty mentoring visitors for short-term training at UM. These payments markedly facilitated expansion of our community of nursing education and practice because they were tangible marks of respect for expertise and valuable professional time. If small grants such as our are not available, other institutional and personal incentives can be used. Institutional incentives could include released time or a student assistant and at least making participation in the collaborative arrangement a matter of distinction to be considered in annual merit review and promotion applications. Personal incentives could include recognition for pursuing professional growth, nomination for awards, and recognition during a faculty meeting.

Using distance communication in the way that we did and emphasizing e-mail (including attachments), with judicious use of telephone, express mail, and fax, means that collaborative community building for nursing education and practice can be done economically. Our project added to Beida's computer capacity and helped justify additional university support for Internet connections, but beyond that, annual distance communications costs never exceeded $1,000. Many schools are able to fold these minimal expenses into regular budgets, especially during start-up phases.

Fortunately, the biculturally competent member of our project team knew that collaborative projects with China required high-level initial exchanges followed by annual in-person site visits to Beijing and learning experiences by Beida faculty at UM. But all participants and administrators preferred limitations on the amount of in-person communication. Neither side could release faculty for an entire year. Although none were eager to return home after the short visits, none were ready to take on longer commitments on site because primary work commitments had to be fulfilled.

As for distance communications, collaborators' preferences also led to e-mail use as a natural way to communicate because e-mail is part of regular schedules and does not require transitioning to a specialized Web site, international postage, or actions outside the daily routine. Experience with customs also led us to use regular mail for reimbursement checks; however, all of us preferred spending extra money for traceable express mail of official documents such as receipts.

Although other communication channels are the basis for important ongoing international collaborations (DeSanctis, Wright, & Jiang, 2001; Ekstrom & Sigurdsson, 2002; Iwasiw et al., 2000) , videoconferencing and distance learning were not necessary for our project. Our limited technology knowledge, combined with our limited financial resources and preferences, led us to use asynchronous means of communication.

Outcomes must be important to justify the time and money costs of international collaboration. The result of the entire project is an international community of nursing education and practice that will outlast the specific funding for this project. The two universities have agreed to jointly propose further projects, and existing curricular and research projects will continue.

But the most visible outcome is the first nursingmanaged community-based clinic in China. The clinic is assured longevity because, as described elsewhere (Yu & Shang, in press) , it has become a regular part of the community health nursing curriculum at Beida. Thus, it will be supported by the regular university budget for clinical practice. Before the clinic was established, community health nursing clinicals occurred in outpatient clinics of hospitals, under the aegis of physicians. Although our project was designed to achieve improvements for both universities, through our continuous and frequent communications, we came to share a sense of community in community health nursing education and practice. Nurse-managed clinics at UM increased cultural competence in caring for the numerous Chinese-ethnicity families in their service areas. Each of the communication channels contributed to these successful outcomes.

The primary outcome of our continuing in-person visits has been trust, an essential element for efficient progress toward project goals (Henderson, 2002) . For instance, because the deans met four times over a 7-year period, they knew about the project personally and shared trust in one another as well as in the individual faculty participants. Beida's dean could also use each visit by UM's dean to increase central administrators' understanding of nursing's autonomous role. It was also extremely important that the project director in China could come to Ann Arbor on two occasions. Mutual trust was established by daily sharing because she stayed with the director of UM's nurse-managed, community-based clinic. Because they were together much of the time, questions and clarifications about community-based wellness definitions and projects could be exchanged easily. Through their informal conversations, it was possible to develop a shared understanding about conceptual, role, and practice differences in the two countries. Because each knew something about the other's setting, the two specialists could talk through possible adaptations and nursing applications that might work in China's very different health care system. The sense of trust generated renewed enthusiasm for both the host and the visitor as they discussed difficulties and solutions even in an advanced practice setting that has been in existence for more than a decade (Ingersoll, McIntosh, & Williams, 2000; McIntosh et al., 2003) .

Another notable outcome of in-person visits has been enrichment of the teaching and clinical depth of faculty on both sides. As one participant wrote, ""Sometimes only after teachers improve themselves can they influence their students. So I think in-person visits also contributed to the reforms in education."" They also made both sides realize that sharing educational materials appropriate for Chinese families enhances clinical care.

Process outcomes were largely dependent on distance communications. These outcomes include the ability to agree on objectives and schedules for in-person visits, to resolve budget issues, to develop reports and manuscripts, and to support Beida's development of their clinic. Although one side or the other initiates each of the documents involved, questions are freely asked and changes made until everyone is satisfied. The combination of e-mail, fax, and express mail has been critical for fast resolution of some editing changes and budget expenditures. Written e-mail minutes of meeting minutes, shared with all team members, means that all parties know their responsibilities clearly so they can work together for the same goals at each stage of the project.

quire special attention by participants. Personal responsibilities include adequate and appropriate preparation and time for in-person visits, reading e-mail messages in a timely fashion, responding to all the points when requested, and discussions with the biculturally competent project member(s) to identify and resolve misunderstandings. Group responsibilities include flexibility, perseverance, and feedback about progress on the work plans.

The methodology used to examine this case study indicates that it is possible to build a community of nursing education and practice that can be generalized from two very different national traditions to other collaborations. Feasibility will depend on the amount of local support, particularly financial support for inperson visits and computer-based distance communications. As the example reported here shows, these costs can be modest if mechanisms within the daily life experience of project participants are used. Outcomes can include major innovations that enrich teaching and nursing practice in the collaborating universities. However, spreading these innovations elsewhere will no doubt take more than journal articles about the model clinic. Important steps in this direction were taken at the end of the project. During the team's last site visit, officials from other health agencies in Beijing, including the Chinese Nursing Association, were invited to participate. Further follow-up occurred when deans of two other leading schools of nursing in China and representatives from the Ministry of Health and the Chinese Nursing Association visited UM for another China-related project. All of the participants in these two meetings learned directly about Beida's nurse-managed community-based clinic, with both astonishment and great interest.

Although we did not start with a communications plan, our experience leads us to recommend that a communications plan be part of any collaborative project's business plan. Although the elements of a business plan were detailed in our grant proposal to the W.K. Kellogg Foundation, we developed our communications plan by trial and error. Given our knowledge today, we recommend that a communications plan have the following three elements: (1) frequency and general content of in-person visits, with explicit links to a month-by-month timetable that specifies work to be implemented by all project participants; (2) specified modalities, frequency, and general content of distance communications; and (3) timelines for evaluating and improving each aspect of the communications plan.

In addition, the communications plan should be consistent with the budget and should foster building an international community of nursing.

High-cost communication channels are not always necessary. In the case presented here, the higher-cost Web-based communications did not turn out to be feasible, and the more common e-mail and postal and express mail-supplemented with faxes and telephone calls-were preferred. Selecting the most appropriate channel for each communication need was more important than spending time and energy on a more elaborate and expensive means of in-person or distance communications. An international community of nursing education and practice can be created and sustained over time with reasonable and limited resources.

Identifying Personal Health Experience Tweets with Deep Neural Networks* HHS Public Access Author manuscript,"Twitter, as a social media platform, has become an increasingly useful data source for health surveillance studies, and personal health experiences shared on Twitter provide valuable information to the surveillance. Twitter data are known for their irregular usages of languages and informal short texts due to the 140 character limit, and for their noisiness such that majority of the posts are irrelevant to any particular health surveillance. These factors pose challenges in identifying personal health experience tweets from the Twitter data. In this study, we designed deep neural networks with 3 different architectural configurations, and after training them with a corpus of 8,770 annotated tweets, we used them to predict personal experience tweets from a set of 821 annotate tweets. Our results demonstrated a significant amount of improvement in predicting personal health experience tweets by deep neural networks over that by conventional classifiers: 37.5% in accuracy, 31.1% in precision, and 53.6% in recall. We believe that our method can be utilized in various health surveillance studies using Twitter as a data source.","Twitter, as a social media platform, has become an increasingly useful data source for a wide range of health surveillance studies. They include investigations of influenza pandemics [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] , Haitian cholera outbreak [11] , Ebola outbreak [12] , non-medical use of a psychostimulant drug (Ad-derall) [13] , drug abuse [14] , smoking [15] , suicide risks [16] , migraine headaches [17] , pharmaceutical product safety [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] , disease outbreaks during festivals [23] , detection of Schizophrenia [24] , food-borne illness [25, 26] , and even dental pains [27] .

In most of these studies, Twitter data were collected by keyword search, which can still leave a significant amount of irrelevant tweets in the study data. For example, Freifeld et al. [18] showed that only 4,401 (7.2%) tweets relevant to the study were discovered from a random sample of 61,402 tweets which were from the collected 6.9 million tweets for 23 medicine products from November 1, 2012 through May 31, 2013. This suggests that a large amount of noisy irrelevant tweets exists in the Twitter data collected.

Various manual and simple methods were used to select samples for research, making the research outcomes difficult to compare and to reproduce. With the sheer volume of Twitter posts, manual approaches will not work well and an automated method is needed. In addition, for the long term ongoing activities for health surveillance, an automatic method capable of correctly identifying study Twitter data is needed.

Personal health experiences shared on Twitter play an important role in health surveillance. Personal experience tweets (PETs) are tweets that describe a person's encounters, observations, and important events related to his or her life. In studying health related activities, such experiences pertain to changes of a person's health, due to an illness, a disease, or a treatment. Personal experience tweets contain patient generated information related to their health and such information is an important source of information for study of health related issues. Below are examples of personal health experience tweets:

Feeling dizzy every time I took pregabalin so I google-d the side effects of it Just starting lyrica, tho it reduced the pain, i cant sleep at the night Twitter data possess unique characteristics which are not found in many other sources of data. First, each tweet is limited to 140 characters, making users quite creative in coming up with various short texts which do not follow the spelling and grammar of the languages used in order to include the needed information within the limit. Furthermore, emotional expressions in the forms of emoticons and emoji's are commonly seen in the Twitter posts. Most challengingly to health surveillance, Twitter data are noisy and contain a significant amount of tweets irrelevant to the health issues being studied. The irrelevant, noisy tweets can be those for promoting products, news, and even spamming.

For health related studies, data collected from Twitter require human annotation to confirm and discover what was posted by the users. Annotation is a laborious, time consuming process requiring a significant amount of effort from domain experts, which can be attributed to the slow progress in scaling up the many developed methods to the continuous and ongoing process of health activity surveillance.

For health surveillance, it is important to have an effective and efficient method to identify personal health experience tweets. In this paper, we present our work of developing a deep neural network-based approach to identify such tweets, and compare and discuss the performance of our approach with that of the conventional methods.

Jiang and colleague introduced the concept of personal experience tweets in discovering drug effects by mining Twitter data [21] . Authors trained three conventional classifiers (naïve Bayes, SVM, and maximum entropy) with a corpus of 600 tweets (300 PETs and 300 non-PETs), and used the trained models to classify 285 tweets. Data sets used in their study seem to be small and the performance may not be generalized to the population of Twitter data.

Recently, in developing an efficient and effective method of constructing a corpus of personal experience tweets, Jiang and colleagues [28] iteratively trained three conventional classifiers (IB1 -nearest neighbors, J48 -decision tree, and MLP -multilayer perceptron) with annotated tweets to derive a corpus of 8,770 annotated tweets (2,067 PETs and 6,703 non-PETs). While their prediction performance on the training data looked strong, but in each iteration, the predictions on the unannotated data did not perform well as on the training data. This is because that authors wanted to reduce the annotation cost by only annotating the predicted positive tweets from which only the prediction precision could be measured, and it ranged from 0.28 to 0.49.

Identifying personal health experience tweets is a binary classification problem. Due to the uniqueness of Twitter data, commonly used linear classifiers do not perform well. Deep neural networks are known for their ability to perform well for situations where linear solutions fail. In this project, we designed deep neural networks with three different architectural configurations, and trained and tested them with annotated personal experience tweets related to the use of 4 dietary supplements.

From May 30, 2014 to December 8, 2014, we collected 108,528 number of tweets related to were randomly chosen from all four dietary supplements and across the timespan of the data collection.

The retrieved tweets not only include the textual data but also the metadata. Upon experimenting and observation, we identified 19 features that can be useful in this study.

Count of frequent terms. They are the textual terms (tokens) frequently appearing in one class but not in the opposite class. Four features related to frequent terms were extracted after scanning the training data, and they are for the positive class and negative class in the tweet text and the Twitter user name which can be phrases.

Count of URLs. Irrelevant tweets tend to include URLs in the tweet text, and a small number of relevant tweets contain URLs to provide additional information.

Count of emotion words. To some extent, the sentiment of an individual tweet expresses the type of a Twitter user's experience. For instance, a pleasant experience may be indicated by a happy expression.

Twitter client application. Commercial purpose and spam tweets tend to use client applications which can automatically post to Twitter -for instance, twitterfeed.com, whereas individual Twitter users tend to use a different set of Twitter clients such as Twitter mobile apps and the official Twitter Website [29] .

Counts of personal pronouns, first person pronouns and second person pronouns. To distinguish personal from non-personal tweets, the usage of personal pronouns can be valuable information because personal tweets tend to use personal pronouns more frequently than non-personal tweets as studied by Elgersma et al. on personal blogs [30] .

In addition, we also include in our features the counts of unique words and total number of words, as well as Twitter user id.

Neural networks with three different architectural configurations were chosen in this study as shown in Figure 1 . These configurations consisted of 1-hidden-layer neural network with 19 inputs mapped to 6-neuron hidden layer producing a 2-class output as positive (PET) or negative (non-PET). The second configuration consisted of 2-hidden layer neural network with 19 inputs connecting first hidden layer with 7 neurons followed by another with 3 neurons connecting to the 2-class output layer. And the 3 rd configuration is a 5-hidden layer neural network with 19-neuron input connecting to first hidden layer which consists of 64 neurons followed by second, third, fourth and fifth hidden layers consisting of 32, 16, 8 and 4 neurons respectively, passing final output to the 2-class output layer.

The neural networks were implemented using the Google's TensorFlow platform 2 along with scikit-learn libraries 3 . For each of the three configurations, a training set consisting of 8,770 annotated tweets were used and iterated over 2,000 epochs with a batch size of 128we chose a sufficiently large enough number of epochs to ensure that each individual configuration will reach to a stable state. All three models were tested with a test set of 821 annotated tweets. For calculating the cost, gradient descent optimizer with value 0.001 was used. Softmax with cross entropy with logit was used for loss calculation.

To benchmark the prediction performance of the deep neural networks, we chose the following commonly used classifiers: 1) IB1 -k nearest neighbor, 2) J48 -decision tree, 3) LR -logistic regression, and 4) SVM -support vector machine. The performance of these classifiers served as the baseline in comparison. Weka 4 , which includes the implementation of all these classifiers, was used to gather the performance data on the same data sets.

We used the same training data (8,770 tweets) to train all the classifiers and later used the trained models to classify the positive tweets (PETs) and negative tweets (non-PETs) on the same set of test data (821 tweets). Listed in Table I are the results of the classifiers we tested. In the table, precision, recall and F1 are only for the positive class (PET), and accuracy and ROC (which is the area under curve) are for both positive and negative classes. LR stands for logistic regression, and DNN1, DNN2, and DNN5 represent 1-hidden layer, 2-hidden layer and 5-hidden layer neural networks respectively. For each performance measure, the highest (best) value is in boldface.

As shown in Table I , all three DNN classifiers outperform all conventional classifiers tested (IB1, J48, LR, and SVM) by a noticeable margin, with DNN1 and DNN2 being the best for the deep neural networks and J48 for the conventional classifiers. Summarized in Table II are the significant performance improvements of predicting PETs with DNN classifiers over that with the best conventional classifier (J48). These significant improvements in performance can help with health surveillance tasks. The improved accuracy will help predict both true positive tweets (PETs) and true negative tweets (non-PETs) more accurately. The higher precision of predicting positive tweets (PETs) will help include more positive tweets (PETs) in the result, effectively reducing the number of irrelevant, noisy tweets and the annotation effort. The increased recall will help minimize the number of actual positive tweets (PETs) missed by the imperfect classifiersin other words, the result will miss fewer number of actual positive tweets (PETs).

Another observation of our results is that more number of hidden layers in the neural network does not seem to help improve the prediction performance significantly on the test dataset we used. The single hidden layer architecture performed the best in our study, and the 5-hidden layer neural network performed the worst among the 3 configurations tested. This may indicate that 1) the single hidden layer architecture could suffice for predicting positive tweets (PETs), or 2) a larger data size may be needed to train deep neural networks for more accurate performance measure.

Although the simplest neural network performed (nearly) best, the cost of training the model was higher than that of training the more sophisticated neural network models. This is because it takes longer time (more epochs) for the single hidden layer model to reach to a stable state -we observed that it took about 1,500 epochs for the single hidden layer model but roughly 100 epochs for the 5-hidden layer neural network to reach the stable state. This suggests that if the training time is essence and slightly poorer performance is acceptable, the 5-layer model can be the choice, but if the abundant computational power is available and a simple architecture is preferred, the single hidden layer architecture can be the choice.

In this study, a small set of annotated tweets were used to test the algorithms. As we realize, the data set, which was chosen randomly, may not be representative to the tweet population. In our future research, we plan to continue collecting and annotating personal health experience tweets and investigate if our method will be applicable to the larger sets of Twitter data.

In this research, we demonstrated that deep neural networks performed significantly better in classifying personal health experience tweets (PETs) from non-personal health experience tweets (non-PETs) than the conventional classifiers did, indicating the effectiveness of deep neural networks for health surveillance tasks. We believe that our method can be utilized to automate health surveillance activities that use Twitter as the data source.

The perceived effectiveness of MERS-CoV educational programs and knowledge transfer among primary healthcare workers: a cross-sectional survey,"Background: Knowledge transfer of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) involves the dissemination of created/acquired information on MERS-CoV in hospitals, making this information accessible to all healthcare workers (HCWs). This study evaluated the perceived effectiveness of MERS-CoV educational programs and knowledge transfer among primary care HCWs at a hospital in Saudi Arabia that witnessed the largest outbreak of confirmed MERS-CoV cases in this country. Methods: A survey was distributed among primary care HCWs at five clinics in Saudi Arabia in 2016. Those with nondirect patient care responsibilities were excluded. Their knowledge was evaluated against facts published by Mayo Clinic Foundation, and its percentage mean score (PMS) ± standard deviation was calculated. HCWs' perceived effectiveness of educational programs and knowledge transfer was classified as negative or positive. Results: Sample comprised of 404 HCWs, of which 64% were females and 36% were males. Almost 26% were ≤ 30 years old, and 42% had > 10 years of work experience. Almost 46.5% were nurses, 23.0% physicians, 18.1% were pharmacists, and 12.4% were technical staff. PMS for knowledge was 71.1 ± 19.4. The prevalence of negative perceptions towards educational programs was 22.5% and of knowledge transfer was 20.8%. Older(> 40 years of age) and more experienced(> 10 years) HCWs had the highest PMS for knowledge(73.4 ± 18.9,P = 0.005 and 76.9 ± 15.7,P < 0.001 respectively). Negative perceptions of educational programs (49.4 ± 20.7; P < 0.001) and knowledge transfer (46.0 ± 19.7; P = 0.001) were associated with a lower knowledge PMS. Males were 2.4[95% confidence interval 1.4-4.2] times and 2.0[1.1-3.5] times more likely to have negative perceptions of educational programs and knowledge transfer (adjusted (adj.)P = 0.001 and adj. P = 0.023, respectively). Physicians/pharmacists were 1.8[1.03-3.11] and 2.8[1.6-5.0] times more likely to have negative perceptions of both outcomes (adj. P = 0.038 and adj. P = 0.001, respectively). Less experienced HCWs were 2.1[1.3-3.5] times and 4.9[2.6-9.2] times more likely to exhibit negative perceptions of the two outcomes (adj. P < 0.001 each). Conclusions: A negative perception of the effectiveness of MERS-CoV knowledge transfer was associated with poorer knowledge and was more prevalent among male HCWs, physicians/pharmacists and less experienced HCWs. Hospitals should always refer to efficient knowledge sharing and educational strategies that render beneficial outcomes to patients, HCWs, and the public community.","Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) has created an epidemiological and clinical crisis within 27 countries in North Africa, Europe, Asia and the USA but mainly in the Middle East (Kingdom of Saudi Arabia) [1] . It is a viral respiratory illness, initially discovered in 2012 and speculated to have originated from camels or bats in Saudi Arabia, with subsequent spread to humans and across borders [2] . Since 2012, a minimum of 1415 laboratory-confirmed cases have been reported in Saudi Arabia, of which 610 patients have died, 833 have recovered and two were under treatment [3] . High-risk groups were those in close contact with camels, geriatric persons, pregnant women, healthcare workers (HCWs) and those with pre-existing comorbidities [1] . MERS-CoV infection ranged from asymptomatic or mild respiratory symptoms to severe acute respiratory disease and even death, which was reported in three to four out of every 10 reported MERS-CoV cases [4] . Biologic samples of subjects with a suspected MERS-CoV infection (based on clinical symptoms) and of those exposed to reported MERS-CoV cases are tested using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) assays. Serology, such as an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and immunofluorescence assay, is also used to confirm MERS-CoV by the presence of antibodies [5] .

In Saudi Arabia, a series of modifications was applied to the patient pathways while visiting the emergency departments or admitted as in-patients. This included segregating patients during triage based on prioritizing the inflow of patients by their chief complaints, bed availability and screening of flu symptoms/history of exposure. The infrastructure of the medical facility, particularly the ventilation system and isolation capacity of rooms, was subject to changes. Some hospital wards and staff (especially nurses) were dedicated specifically to confirmed MERS-CoV cases to limit the chance of cross-contamination across wards and HCWs. The Infection Prevention and Control Department (IPCD) at SMNG-HA, in particular, was on high alert for such MERS-CoV outbreaks, especially with the evident transmission of viral infections between patients and HCWs at SMNG-HA. Crisis management required a rapid implementation of adequate infection prevention, control procedures and case isolation, in addition to collaboration and coordination with local and international consultations.

Exceptional efforts have been made by the IPCD to apply the latest and most effective means of universal standard precautions throughout the MERS-CoV crisis. Rules and regulations pertinent to infection control and prevention have been revisited and environmental surveillance has been carried out regularly to ensure that all wards are equipped with suitable protection and precautionary gear. Numerous seminars, workshops and awareness campaigns have been launched for HCWs of all disciplines to boost their knowledge on MERS-CoV, as well as their morale, to maintain a high-quality, safe and dedicated service for the patients. The latest updates issued on MERS-CoV from the World Health Organization (WHO), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), collaborative task forces (local and regional) and researchers have been circulated regularly among all HCWs and across all managerial levels.

Numerous research studies have been conducted and published on the perception, knowledge and attitude of HCWs towards MERS-CoV. It is rare to find a HCW who has not attended an educational program on MERS-CoV in Saudi Arabia. Dissemination of MERS-CoV information/updates or knowledge transfer within a healthcare organization is a process in which this information is created, generated or acquired, and then organized and distributed within the system to ensure it is accessible to all HCWs. One of the mechanisms of knowledge transfer is personalization whereby knowledge is transferred from one individual to another, while the other is codification where knowledge is converted into products such as documents, images and videos [6] . The need to transfer efficiently the precautionary regulations and updates about MERS-CoV to large numbers of HCWs necessitates the mechanism of codification [7] . In addition, knowledge transfer or information sharing was found to be positively associated with job satisfaction [8] .

Authors hypothesized that although the dissemination of knowledge and updates on MERS-CoV among HCWs has been given full consideration, these HCWs might have reservations on the effectiveness and quality of MERS-CoV related educational offerings. Therefore, there was an emerging need to evaluate the perceived effectiveness of MERS-CoV educational programs and knowledge transfer from the HCW's perspective, in a setting that witnessed the largest outbreak of confirmed MERS-CoV cases in Saudi Arabia.

This was a cross-sectional study, based on an anonymous survey in English distributed among HCWs at the primary healthcare centers in SMNG-HA medical centers, in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, between October and December 2016. The SMNG-HA is the second-largest healthcare sector in the country, second only to the Saudi Ministry of Health, and provides healthcare services to the community of national guards, their dependents and employees [9] . The targeted primary healthcare centers were five randomly selected clinics out of 11 clinics that employ physicians, pharmacists, technicians and nurses. These clinics serve a population of 60,000 registrants, with a rate of four visits per registrant annually. Eligible primary care HCWs were targeted as being in frontline contact with potential confirmed cases of MERS-CoV. Those occupying positions of management, education or non-direct patient care were excluded. Medical and nursing students were also excluded. This study was ethically approved by the Institutional Review Board at King Abdullah International Medical Research Center, King Saud bin Abdul-Aziz University for Health Sciences, SP- 16/191 .

The provisioned sample size in this study was calculated based on a reported level of knowledge between 43.3 and 57.4% by Alkot et al. among HCWs in the Western region of Saudi Arabia. Assuming an expected level of knowledge of 57%, with a 95% confidence limit (z = 1.96), and a margin of error 5%, the estimated sample size for this study was 376. For convenience, all eligible HCWs at the targeted setting were invited to participate in this survey, to overcome a 25% nonresponse rate. The survey was provided in a sealed envelope with a cover letter that described the objectives of the study. The survey was in English language, as the targeted study participants were English literate and the educational offerings provided at the targeted setting were also in English. Participants who agreed to enroll in this study hand-signed an agreement statement at the end of an informed consent, with no need for any personal identifier. The data collection tool comprised the characteristics of the HCW, principally gender, age category (years), job position and experience (years) [10] . The knowledge of HCWs was measured using 16 statements based on undisputed facts published in the literature and issued by the Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research in 2018 [11] . Correct answers were scored ""1"", while wrong/don't know answers were scored ""0"". The percentage mean score (PMS) of knowledge was calculated by adding the correct responses of the 16 statements, dividing the score by 16 and multiplying it by 100 (range of score 0 to 100). The perceived effectiveness of the MERS-CoV educational programs was measured using one statement: ""Prevalence of MERS can be reduced by active participation of healthcare workers in the hospital infection control program"", while the perception of knowledge transfer was measured by one statement: ""Any related information about MERS should be disseminated among healthcare workers"". Both statements were rated on a four-point Likert scale (strongly disagree, disagree, agree and strongly agree). Those who responded by disagree or strongly disagree were classified as having a negative perception, while those who responded agree or strongly agree were classified as having a positive perception. The negative perception rate was calculated by dividing the number of participants who had negative responses over the total number of respondents. In addition, participants were asked about the source of MERS-CoV information. The survey was piloted on a group of five HCWs, and their subjective comments were considered. The internal consistency or reliability (Cronbach's alpha) of the knowledge domain measured 0.67 (Additional file 1).

Data were analyzed using the Statistical Package for Social Studies (SPSS 25; IBM Corp., New York, NY, USA). HCW characteristics, perceptions (negative vs positive) and incorrect knowledge response statements were presented in terms of frequencies and percentages, while the PMS of knowledge was presented as the mean ± standard deviation. Missing data were replaced by the average of the total, and outliers were dropped out. Pearson's chi-square test was used to test categorical outcomes across HCW characteristics, while a Mann-Whitney test and a Kruskal-Wallis test were used to test the non-normally distributed PMS of knowledge scores. Two binary logistic regression models were constructed to determine the factors significantly associated with negatively perceived effectiveness of MERS-CoV educational programs and knowledge transfer. Due to the small subgroup size of job positions, nurses were grouped with technicians, while pharmacists were grouped with physicians. These two subgroups had job positions comparable in terms of the educational levels, scope of practice and nature of patient care. The adjusted odds ratios [95% confidence interval] were calculated, and statistical significance was set at a value of P < 0.05.

Initially, 600 surveys were distributed among HCWs; 404 participants agreed to enroll and completed the survey (response rate 67.3%). Those who did not participate were mainly either off duty or busy with their workload. Females constituted 64.1% of the sample, while males comprised 35.9%. Almost 26% were ≤ 30 years old, 29% were 30-40 years old and 45% were > 40 years old. The majority (46.5%) were nurses, followed by physicians (23.0%), pharmacists (18.1%) and technical staff (12.4%). Most HCWs (42.1%) had accumulated > 10 years of work experience, with 29.2% having < 5 years of experience and 28.7% having 5-10 years (Table 1) . Overall, 36.1% of respondents claimed that their main source of information was the internet, while 47.8% reported more than one source, including research studies, books, media and others.

The PMS of knowledge score was 71.1 ± 19.4. The most common incorrect response to the statements (83.4%) was that for ""incubation time for virus"", followed by 43.6% with an incorrect response to the statement that ""antibiotics are the first-line treatment for the management of MERS-CoV"". Other incorrect responses to statements are listed in chronological order in Table 2 . Overall, 22.5% of participants reported a negative perceived effectiveness of MERS-CoV educational programs, while 20.8% had a negative perception of knowledge transfer.

With regard to the perceived effectiveness of MERS-CoV educational programs, male HCWs had significantly a more negative perception than female HCWs (n = 52, 35.9%, vs n = 39, 15.1%, respectively; P < 0.001). Pharmacists (n = 24, 32.9%) and physicians (n = 30, 32.3%) reported more negative perceptions than technical staff (n = 9, 18.0%) and nurses (n = 28, 14.9%) (P = 0.001). HCWs with work experience of < 5 years had the most negative perceptions in comparison with the other groups (P = 0.001). A number of factors were associated with a negative perception of knowledge transfer of MERS-CoV information. Male HCWs had a greater negative perception than females (n = 47, 32.4%, vs n = 37, 14.3%, respectively; P < 0.001). Physicians (n = 31, 33.3%) and pharmacists (n = 23, 31.5%) had more negative perceptions of knowledge transfer in comparison with technical staff (n = 9, 18.0%) and nurses (n = 21, 11.2%) (P < 0.001). Junior HCWs with work experience of < 5 years (35.4%) had the highest rate of negative perception of knowledge transfer (P < 0.001) ( Table 3) . HCWs > 40 years old (PMS 73.4 ± 18.9) had the highest knowledge scores in comparison with the other age groups (P = 0.005). More experienced HCWs (> 10 years) also had the highest knowledge scores (PMS 76.9 ± 15.7; P < 0.001). Those who had a negative perception of the effectiveness of MERS-CoV educational programs (PMS 49.4 ± 20.7) and of knowledge transfer of MERS-CoV updates (PMS 46.0 ± 19.7) both had lower knowledge scores in comparison with the positive-perception group (P < 0.001 and P = 0.001, respectively), Table 4 .

Logistic regression analyses showed that male HCWs Table 5 .

MERS-CoV educational programs at healthcare institutions are a formal and reliable channel to deliver essential knowledge to HCWs. For the sake of personal safety, job satisfaction and work morale, HCWs should not pass up any opportunity to increase their theoretical knowledge and practical skills. Hospital administrators do not necessarily face the challenge of producing new information, as an immense amount of valuable information already exists in the literature. The problem arises from the fact that current knowledge is either poorly structured or inaccessible to HCWs [12] . For example, advanced practice nurses are observed to be ""knowledge brokers"" in a sense that they act as disseminators of knowledge among the nursing body. Furthermore, health educators retrieve different types of evidence, synthesize it in different forms, translate it by evaluation, interpret it and then distribute it among nurses [13] . Health education can improve levels of awareness and perception among HCWs towards MERS-CoV infections [14] , and these higher levels of knowledge can aid in the control n frequency, % percentage of disease outbreaks [15] . However, published evidence in Saudi Arabia has shown that there is limited knowledge on MERS-CoV (both microbiological and virological aspects) among HCWs in southern Saudi Arabia [16] . Another study also claimed that knowledge about emerging infectious diseases was poor, and that infection control practices were suboptimal and also seemed to be overestimated [17] . The association between younger age and less experience on one hand and lower knowledge scores on the other was a reasonable finding. Similar to literature findings, the knowledge of HCWs in this setting was suboptimal and gaps remain that should direct the focus towards the mechanisms and quality of knowledge transfer. Dissemination of MERS-CoV updates using e-mail, the internet, institutional announcements, employee meetings, the media and even personal communications are all methods of knowledge transfer. HCWs can experience knowledge transfer both passively, absorbing information unconsciously, and actively. Investigators in this study were curious to know how HCWs perceived the transfer of knowledge about MERS-CoV and why this would be of concern to hospital administrators. For instance, knowledge transfer has been adopted with regard to smoking as a health hazard, HIV transmission as a sexual risk and seat belts in motor vehicles as a safety measure. People are exposed almost daily to precautionary advice by a variety of methods but unfortunately still undertake high-risk activities and are exposed to these hazards. This occurs regardless of the duration, frequency and quality of awareness campaigns. Therefore, it is an aggravating concern that the repetitive exposure of HCWs to MERS-CoV campaigns might have created some sort of ""tolerance"". HCWs might disremember or take lightly the acquisition of current or new updates about MERS-CoV precautions due to routine attendance of educational programs or repetitive circulation of e-mails.

Knowledge and skills must be passed on in a systematic way from expert to novice employees in a way that makes sense [18] . Managers who support work-empowering environments are actually boosting the engagement of participations in terms of knowledge transfer [19] . In fact, one of the key elements in seeking accreditation or managing crises such as MERS-CoV is knowledge communication, in the sense that effective communication ensures a purposeful exchange of information, thus allowing a more thorough understanding of the outbreak [20, 21] . Interactive workshops remain highly recommended for the sharing and transferring of knowledge among HCWs. However, one study noted that, although those who attended such workshops valued the expert input and discussions, after few months their sustainability of attendance was lost [22] . Some barriers to MERS-CoV knowledge transfer could be the inability of HCWs to recognize and articulate the instructions, personal opposition or resistance to change, the quality of the communication technologies, the absence of visual representations, language and cultural differences, deficiency in expertise, the work environment, a lack of job incentive/motivation, the organizational culture and others [23, 24] . Current efforts to manage the MERS-CoV crisis are directed towards developing educational programs that target both the community and HCWs [25] . A negative perception of MERS-CoV educational programs in this setting might result in outdated knowledge among HCWs, which jeopardizes their compliance with disease precautionary and control measures. A MERS-CoV task force committee pointed out that the Saudi Arabian Ministry of Health has posted updates on MERS-CoV through videos, posters, handouts, posters and an official website. Resilience against MERS-CoV increases with enriched education and awareness [25] . A Saudi Arabian study reported that HCWs were unaware of the availability of MERS-CoV information at their work areas; they did not feel they had sufficient training and were not confident about infection control guidelines. These factors may also contribute to having a negative perception of MERS-CoV-related educational programs [26] . One study reported that the interest in following disease updates among HCWs improved significantly after the implementation of a MERS-CoV educational program [14] . These programs improved the attitude of the HCWs towards governmental measures taken regarding the crisis [14] . HCWs often grasp their MERS-CoV educational information primarily from watching TV reports, or from the internet. A negative perception of knowledge transfer might be due to a pre-existing lack of trust in the media or in websites that might, to some degree, lack scientific credibility in comparison with educational programs provided in healthcare centers [27] .

Knowledge itself is complex, and its transfer process within healthcare institutions carries many challenges [28] . One way to overcome these challenges is to determine the characteristics of HCWs who might be more likely to exhibit negative perceptions of knowledge transfer for significant MERS-CoV updates. In the literature, knowledge transfer has been investigated more frequently in manufacturing industries and firms, or among the public community. It has been seldom evaluated among HCWS [29] , and never in a Middle Eastern setting or related to a MERS-CoV outbreak. A crossnational study suggested that organizational culture was a significant influence on the capacity of HCWs to engage in knowledge transfer [30] . A systematic review paper study stated that knowledge transfer could streamline productivity and coordinate the use of resources more efficiently [29] . This review paper claimed to be the first to review published research focused on the perceptions of HCWs about knowledge management [29] . Knowledge management was defined as having an efficient idea or new practice accepted and adopted by an individual or a group through communication channels (successful diffusion of ideas) [31] . This definition also applies to the dissemination of updated regulations on the outbreak of MERS-CoV. This information, once absorbed by people, should be sustained for as long as it is useful, and not decay over time [32] . Accordingly, a negative perception of the importance of knowledge transfer could be a warning sign of an interruption in this sustainability of retained information about MERS-CoV. Signs of information decay were evident among HCWs in this study, as those who had negative perceptions had lower knowledge scores about MERS-CoV in comparison with those who had positive perceptions.

One of the key goals of knowledge transfer is to educate and train the less experienced and/or the newly hired HCWs [33] . This phase of staff development is crucial yet stressful for novice HCWs, who are expected to acquire skills and competencies rapidly to ensure that a safe and quality service flow is maintained at the institution. This explains why HCWs with less work experience (< 5 years) had significantly more negative perceptions of knowledge transfer and the perceived effectiveness of MERS-CoV educational programs. As they gain more work experience, this perception improves as they realize the importance of education not only for their patients but also for their career advancement.

The level of knowledge on MERS-CoV among HCWs in primary healthcare clinics in this setting was found to be less than optimal. As the frontline in the battle of disease prevention and control, HCWs are expected to be equipped with the relevant theoretical updates about MERS-CoV. Special consideration should be paid to younger and less experienced HCWs whose knowledge on MERS-CoV was moderately low. A negative perception of the knowledge transfer of MERS-CoV information and educational programs was associated with poorer knowledge. This negative perception was more prevalent among male HCWs, physicians/pharmacists and less experienced HCWs.

This study has been conducted at one setting, yet the struggle against MERS-CoV has not ended and will continue against future emerging strains of viruses and bacteria causing communicable diseases in other settings too. Knowledge is a valuable asset, and its holders within any healthcare institution should be retained and motivated so that they continue to spread their benefit among other HCWs. All healthcare institutions should always identify and refer to reliable sources of knowledge. For instance, the center for disease control and prevention is a leading national public health institute and accountable for disseminating up-to-dates on various infectious topics. In Saudi Arabia, the ministry for public health has designated communication channels to release updates on MERS-CoV on their websites, through scientific arenas, memorandums and helpdesks.

Knowledge sharing and management strategies in the healthcare sector can render beneficial outcomes to patients, HCWs, the organization and the public community [29] . In addition to the attendance of seminars or workshops, other methods of knowledge dissemination might involve launching of journal clubs among HCWs to discuss updates on MERS CoV. Audiovisuals at hospitals, such as educational videos on TV screens in lobbies or corridors, constantly enlighten HCWs. Deeper understanding of the negativity in the perception towards the quality or method of knowledge transfer necessitates a qualitative methodological approach, as face to face interviews with HCWs aid in determining the underlying reasons and at a more personal level. Furthermore, the execution of these strategies needs to be routinely monitored and evaluated so that the transfer of knowledge is time efficient and effective. Optimal theoretical knowledge and practical competence are two main indicators of successful knowledge transfer among HCWs. Last but not least, a number of key points can be noted: as well as their morale, to maintain a high-quality, safe and dedicated service for patients. -The perceived effectiveness of MERS-CoV educational programs and knowledge transfer among health workers in this high risk setting was evaluated. -Primary health workers were expected to be aware of the most recent updates on MERS-CoV, yet younger and less experienced HCWs had moderate knowledge. -A negative perception of the effectiveness of MERS-CoV knowledge transfer was associated with poorer knowledge, and was more prevalent among male HCWs, physicians/pharmacists and less experienced HCWs.

Policy & practice Risk and outbreak communication: lessons from alternative paradigms,"Risk communication guidelines widely used in public health are based on the psychometric paradigm of risk, which focuses on risk perception at the level of individuals. However, infectious disease outbreaks and other public health emergencies are more than public health events and occur in a highly charged political, social and economic environment. This study examines other sociological and cultural approaches from scholars such as Ulrich Beck and Mary Douglas for insights on how to communicate in such environments. It recommends developing supplemental tools for outbreak communication to deal with issues such as questions of blame and fairness in risk distribution and audiences who do not accept biomedical explanations of disease.","WHO's guidelines on outbreak communication were developed in response to the communication challenges posed by the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic of 2003. 1 The guidelines consist of five principles to guide communication during outbreaks and other emergencies: building trust, announcing early, being transparent, respecting public concerns and planning in advance. On the face of it, these guidelines are simple and straightforward. But, as the experience of SARS and the recent H1N1 outbreak has shown, outbreak control and outbreak communication is rarely a pure, clean process of winning public trust and transmitting information objectively and openly. It is more often than not a messy business requiring political decisions with winners and losers.

Communicating during an influenza pandemic is no different. Decisions on distribution of scarce antivirals, quarantines and travel and trade restrictions all have a significant political component, and so communication has to deal with opposition from those who feel that they have been deprived of drugs or unfairly quarantined or excluded. Opposing political forces often criticize decisions made on public health grounds to score political points. Successful communication in such a charged environment requires an understanding of the broader political, social and cultural environment in which communication occurs.

Risk communication experts and practitioners are well aware of this. Following the experience of the anthrax attacks in the United States of America, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) developed principles and practices to address communication in times of political and social stress under the title of Crisis and Emergency Risk Communication. 2 WHO's outbreak communication guidelines also point to the political and social challenges of communicating during times of crisis. But tools are still needed to address the challenges of communicating in these difficult circumstances. These tools can be developed by looking at alternate paradigms of risk that exist within the social sciences.

Risk communication principles are based on the psychometric paradigm of risk pioneered by Paul Slovic et al. in the late 1970s. 3 This paradigm focuses on individual perceptions of risk, rather than the social and cultural environment in which risk perceptions are formed. Other sociological and cultural approaches to risk take a broader approach. This paper surveys existing approaches and extracts useful lessons for outbreak communication.

The psychometric paradigm is the dominant paradigm in health risk communication. WHO's outbreak communication guidelines, as well as the national communication plans of many countries, are based on this view of how risk is perceived and communicated.

This paradigm grew out of attempts to explain the disparity between the way scientists and technologists measured risks, attributable to technological processes, and the way the lay public perceived these risks. Based on psychometric studies of risk perception, Paul Slovic et al. evolved a basic model of risk perception, listing several factors that caused people to perceive events as high risk, even when experts judged them to be low risk. Hazards that were new, uncontrollable and catastrophic in consequences were perceived as high risk, even when experts judged a low statistical probability of these risks occurring. In contrast, hazards or dangers that were familiar and controllable were perceived as low risk, even though statistically they had a high probability. In contrast to lay perceptions, expert perceptions of risk were based on expected annual mortality from a hazard or danger. 4 Risk communication consultants such as Vincent Covello et al. and Peter Sandman used the findings of Slovic and others to develop strategies that helped experts and managers to communicate to the public in a way so that their perceptions of risk more closely approximated those of experts. 5, 6 Communication tool kits were devised to help communicators to either calm public anxieties, if experts felt that these anxieties were inappropriate, or to increase risk perceptions if experts Special theme -Public health communication Risk and outbreak communication Thomas Abraham felt that the public was insufficiently concerned about grave risks. Thus Peter Sandman's tool kits for precaution advocacy and outrage management are designed to help communicators to raise or lower public risk perceptions to match the level of the experts. Precaution advocacy is used to alert people who are insufficiently concerned by hazards that experts feel to be serious, and outrage management is used to calm down people who are judged to be over-concerned about minor risks. In the event of a social crisis, crisis communication is designed to help people resist their emotions and act wisely in difficult situations. 7

While the psychometric paradigm tries to explain the difference between ""expert"" and ""lay"" perceptions of risk in individuals, sociological and cultural approaches look at the impact of the social, cultural and political factors on the perception of risk. In the following sections, we look at insights offered from the sociological work of Ulrich Beck, Philip Strong's model of the psychosocial epidemics that accompany disease epidemics, and the work of Mary Douglas and others on the impact of culture on risk perception.

The work of the German sociologist Ulrich Beck offers insights into the social and political basis of the notion of risk. In his pioneering work Risk society, Beck described the distribution of technological and other risks produced through the process of modernization as a major preoccupation of modern governments and societies. 8 This distribution of risk is never equitable but follows the unequal distribution of power in national societies as well as globally. Struggles over the distribution of risks are major reasons for differences in the scientific or expert views of risk and the views of other sections of society.

The main aim of health risk communicators is to transmit health information clearly to stakeholders in ways that encourage behavioural changes to reduce the risk. An enquiry into the social and political foundations on which risk is distributed in society may seem far removed from these aims but the way audiences respond to messages is dependent on their perceptions of risk distribution. From a public health perspective, a farmer with an outbreak of avian influenza on his farm needs to take on board a straightforward message to cull his chickens and ducks to curtail the outbreak. From the farmer's point of view however, he is being asked to bear the cost of destroying his livelihood to reduce the risk to other members of society. He could well see himself as bearing a disproportionate level of risk and his compliance with health messages would depend on the extent to which these messages also address larger issues such as compensation for bearing this risk to his livelihood.

While Beck's work does not focus on health risks or epidemics, the social psychologist Philip Strong has set out a compelling model of the social and psychological upheaval created by a major infectious disease epidemic. Strong describes the social and political impact of an epidemic as a ""medical version of the Hobbesian nightmarethe war of all against all"". He says that disease epidemics are accompanied by three kinds of psychosocial epidemics: epidemics of fear, of explanation and of action. 9 These three phases can occur simultaneously: ""Any society gripped by a florid form of epidemic psychology may, therefore simultaneously experience waves of individual and collective panic, outbursts of interpretation as to why the disease occurred, rashes of moral controversy, and plagues of competing control strategies, aimed at either containing the disease itself, or else at controlling the further epidemics of fear and social dissolution."" 9

The ""epidemic of fear"" is characterized by widespread suspicion of friends, neighbours, fellow citizens who might pass on the disease, suspicion of the very environment itself which might be potentially infectious. The ""epidemic of explanation"" results from society's attempts to find causes for the epidemic and to understand its scope and consequence. This is a period of great intellectual confusion when ""a hundred different theories may be produced about the origins of the disease and its potential effects"". 9 Many of these questions are moral in nature: how could God -or the government -have allowed it? Who is to blame? What does the impact of the epidemic reveal about our society?

The measures proposed to control an epidemic can in turn lead to further conflicts and debates over issues like disruption of trade and travel, infringement of personal liberties and even treatment options that might cross ethical barriers in a way that would not have been contemplated in more normal times. The consequences of these turbulent psychosocial states are clear for risk and outbreak communication efforts. In a climate, for example, when the public demand is to know the causes of an epidemic and whether government agencies are to blame, risk communicators will have difficulty avoiding these issues.

The issues of blame and morality are also central to the understanding of risk proposed by cultural anthropologist Mary Douglas. She describes notions of risk in modern societies as being part of a politicized ""blaming system"". ""Whose fault?"" is the first question. 10 She observes that responses to risk are often directed towards governments and organizations that are responsible for either causing or failing to prevent dangers. Risk thus ""becomes a stick for beating authority"".

If disease outbreaks are perceived as part of a blaming system and the question uppermost in people's minds is on attributing blame then, once again, this has consequences for the kind of risk and outbreak communication that will succeed in reaching and convincing the public.

Understanding differences in cultural practices and beliefs are of vital importance in evolving successful risk and outbreak communication practices. One of the weaknesses of the psychometric paradigm is that its evidence base is largely North American. The subjects for the experiments on which the paradigm was based were small, culturally specific groups of North Americans -e.g. members of the League of Women Voters in Oregon, college students or residents of towns in New Jersey. A question often asked, but rarely answered, is whether the psychobehavioural responses of these groups correspond to groups in completely different cultural environments. For example, would members of the League of Women Voters perceive and respond similarly to risk as poultry farmers in Viet Nam? Would the same techniques of communication be relevant for these widely differing groups? Different cultures ascribe different meanings to illness, sickness and disease and biomedical explanations of disease are not universally accepted. 11 A study of the understandings of acute respiratory illness among mothers and community health volunteers in Bangladesh, for example, found that, similar to other Asian countries, influenza and influenza-like illnesses were attributed to imbalances between ""hot and cold"" in the body. 12 Eating foods thought to be ""cold"" such as rice, bananas and beans were thought to aggravate or, in some cases, cause influenza. Remedies consisted of massaging the patient with ""warming"" substances such as a mixture of garlic and oil and cumin seeds. The way people respond to health communication messages is dependent on whether their cultural construction of the disease is similar to that of the communicator. Of particular interest to outbreak communication is the possibility that, in the case of new, previously unknown illnesses, people may well turn to culturally determined explanations of illness to help them understand and cope with the disease. 13

Communicating during an outbreak occurs in a complex environment in which a variety of players compete for attention. British sociologist Graham Murdoch et al. has used Bourdieu's concept of society as a field to describe risk communication as occurring in an arena in which at least six sets of players compete for public attention. 14 The players include political institutions and policy-makers, scientific and expert communities, campaigning groups and social movements, opposition parties and corporations, the media and the lay public.

Success in communication goes to those players in a competitive field who succeed in ensuring that their interpretation and framing of reality dominates the social and political agenda. It is important to note that, in this model, the lay public have two characteristics. On the one hand, they are the ""prize"" for whose attention different groups in society vie. On the other hand, they are active participants, not mere spectators, in political processes. Public perceptions and opinion are active forces influencing the positions of other important players. Outbreak communication clearly has to take account of this complex environment and include strategies to ensure that messages are not drowned out in the competition for media attention. In particular, communication strategists need to strive towards two goals: (i) visibility -the ability to get the message across clearly and prominently to the public and not be drowned by competing voices -and (ii) legitimacy -ensuring that information is seen as legitimate and authoritative.

These goals do not in any way contradict WHO's existing outbreak communication practices. In fact, the principles of early announcement and transparency and trust building help achieve visibility and legitimacy. There is a need, however, to develop tools and establish practices that explicitly ensure that communication based on these practices is not drowned out by myriad other voices that seek to be heard during a social crisis of the scale caused by a pandemic or other major infectious disease outbreak. If messages are drowned out, distorted or ignored by competing social voices, then outbreak communication will not achieve its public health goals of helping prevent and control outbreaks.

Based on the preceding discussion, it would be useful to develop tools and strategies to complement WHO's outbreak communication guidelines in three areas.

First, using the work of Bourdieu as developed by Murdoch, communicators need to explicitly develop tools to ensure the visibility and legitimacy of their message in a crowded political environment. 14 The existing WHO outbreak communication principles of early announcement, trust and trans-parency achieve this to a certain extent. However, additional work is required to develop practices and principles to ensure visibility and legitimacy remain a focus of communication so that messages are not drowned out during a crisis. Choosing the best channel of communication to ensure visibility, targeting the primary audiences and finding spokespeople who provide legitimacy are some of the issues that need to be explicitly addressed.

Second, the work of Ulrich Beck and Mary Douglas help to sensitize health communicators to the underlying political and social questions about blame and unfair distribution of risk that are on the public mind during outbreaks. These include questions such as whether the government is to blame for the outbreak and, if not, who is to blame, whether drugs and vaccines have been fairly distributed and whether quarantine and other measures such as travel restrictions have been fairly applied. Health communicators need to be able to handle these political issues skilfully and they need the training and tools to do so. Otherwise, their health messages run the risk of being ignored in a storm of political outrage.

Third, cultural and anthropological studies, as well as the experience of those who have worked to manage outbreaks in different cultural environments, show that biomedical explanations of disease are not universally accepted. However, compliance with disease control measures is necessary to prevent outbreaks from spreading. This is especially important since, in cases of unknown disease outbreaks or previously unforeseen catastrophes, people may turn to traditional explanations of disease. Communicators specializing in behaviour change communication and social mobilization have a variety of tools to deal with these issues and so they are often called on during outbreaks. It would be beneficial if these tools were incorporated into general outbreak communication principles. ■ Funding: This paper was funded by WHO. A longer version of this paper was presented to a WHO working group meeting on outbreak communication in Geneva, September 2007.

Communication au sujet des risques et des flambées épidémiques : enseignements fournis par des modèles non traditionnels Dans le domaine de la santé publique, la communication à propos des risques s'appuie sur des recommandations largement utilisées qui s'inspirent d'un modèle psychométrique des risques axé sur la perception de ces risques au niveau des individus. Cependant, les flambées de maladies infectieuses et autres urgences de santé publique sont plus que des événements de santé publique et interviennent dans des environnements très lourds sur les plans politique, social et économique. La présente étude examine d'autres approches sociologiques et culturelles, formulées par des experts comme Ulrich Beck et Mary Douglas, à la recherche d'idées sur la manière de communiquer dans de tels environnements. Elle recommande de développer des outils complémentaires pour communiquer en cas de flambée épidémique, qui aideraient à répondre à des questions telles que la culpabilité et l'équité dans la répartition des risques et à s'adresser à des publics n'acceptant pas les explications biomédicales de la maladie.

Comunicación sobre riesgos y brotes: enseñanzas extraídas de paradigmas alternativos Las directrices sobre comunicación de riesgos más ampliamente utilizadas en el campo de la salud pública se basan en el paradigma psicométrico del riesgo, centrado en la percepción del riesgo a nivel individual. Sin embargo, los brotes de enfermedades infecciosas y otras emergencias de salud pública son algo más que eventos de salud pública y surgen en un entorno político, social y económico muy cargado. En este estudio se analizan otros enfoques sociológicos y culturales de expertos como Ulrich Beck y Mary Douglas para identificar algunas claves respecto a la manera de comunicar la información en esos entornos. Se recomienda crear nuevos instrumentos para la comunicación sobre los brotes a fin de abordar cuestiones como la culpación y la justicia en lo que atañe a la distribución de los riesgos o la resistencia de parte de la población a aceptar las explicaciones biomédicas de la enfermedad.

"Globalization and Health Globalization, migration health, and educational preparation for transnational medical encounters","Unprecedented migration, a core dimension of contemporary globalization, challenges population health. In a world of increasing human mobility, many health outcomes are shaped by transnational interactions among care providers and care recipients who meet in settings where nationality/ ethnic match is not an option. This review article explores the value of transnational competence (TC) education as preparation for ethnically and socially discordant clinical encounters. The relevance of TC's five core skill domains (analytic, emotional, creative, communicative, and functional) for migration health and the medical-school curriculum is elaborated. A pedagogical approach that prepares for the transnational health-care consultation is presented, with a focus on clinical-clerkship learning experiences. Educational preparation for contemporary medical encounters needs to include a comprehensive set of patient-focused interpersonal skills, be adaptable to a wide variety of service users and global practice sites, and possess utility in addressing both the quality of patient care and socio-political constraints on migration health.","Migration, transmigration, [1] return migration, and remigration constitute defining elements of the current and future world order. More than 700 million people (including visitors on business or personal/family trips) traverse nation-state borders annually [2, 3] and one million per week move between the global South and the global North [4] . The enormity of contemporary transnational mobility is illustrated by the case of Australia. In the past half century, Australia's ""resident population has doubled, while the movement of people across its international boundaries (that is, into and out of Australia) has increased nearly one hundredfold"" [5] .

In a related development, cross-border migration for settlement in a new country increased more than twice as rap-idly as the world's population grew during the last third of the Twentieth Century [6] . By 2000, about 185 million migrants resided legally or without documentation outside of their country of origin [2] . More than 55 percent of all residents of New York City, the world's most globally resettled metropolis, and 40 per cent of the residents of the state of Massachusetts are recent newcomers or children of immigrants/refugees [7, 8] .

Twenty-first Century demographic dynamics present new health-care challenges. In many German hospitals, for instance, migrant patients and their offspring occupy a majority of the beds in maternity and pediatrics wards. Since 2000, six of every ten babies delivered in New York City had at least one foreign-born parent [7] . Increasingly, hospitals across the United States are challenged to provide emergency care for undocumented migrants [9] .

World-wide migration and the other interconnected transborder processes that constitute the heart of globalization [10] [11] [12] ""are mixing people and microorganisms on an unprecedented scale"" [ [13] , p.196, [12] ] at breakneck speed [2] . As a consequence of the historic underfunding of research focused on tropical diseases, [15] globalization means that unprepared health centers and laboratory facilities in the North confront increasing exposure to neglected pathogens and health problems that afflict the South. People on the move can either ""introduce new or previously eradicated diseases to the region of destination, or contract diseases unknown to the migrants' region of origin"" [ [16] , p. 85] . Recent examples include the rapid transcontinental transmission of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), the spread of the polio virus from northern Nigeria to Indonesia [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] , and the threat of an avian influenza pandemic [22] . Frequently, moving also adversely affects the migrant's mental well-being, adding to the burden of disease [16, 11] .

As more people in spatial transition compress the distance/time transmission of infectious and life-style-linked diseases, health protection, treatment, and promotion for migrants assume increasing consequence for individual patients, receiving societies and health-care systems, [23, 24, 2] and for global futures [25] . Downstream from many of the sources of infectious disease and the onset of chronic illness, [11] migrants and health professionals come together in medical-treatment and health-promotion encounters. In the context of contemporary population mobility, many health outcomes are shaped by transnational interactions among care providers and care recipients who meet in settings where nationality/ethnic match is not an option. In transnational consultations, clinicians and patients often deal with a wide variety of unfamiliar health threats and behaviors [26, 27] . Prospects for reaching individually and socially positive outcomes are complicated when incongruent perspectives regarding physical and/or mental health problems, objectives, means for resolving problems, and outcomes prevail among professionals and service users of diverse nationality [28, 29] .

The rise of issues surrounding the movement of populations and pathogens across porous borders signals a growing concern with ""migration health"" [16] . Most studies of human migration and health emphasize national security concerns, surveillance, and/or policy responses involving population containment and exclusion. This review article focuses on the need to reorient a different dimension of global health governance: physician education. Education for transnational care merits special attention for at least three reasons: (1) medical professionals (physicians, mental-health-care providers, nurses, public-health specialists, and their teachers) form the backbone of the health sector throughout the world; (2) preparing physicians for cross-national medical encounters offers a change strategy that is proactive and encompasses the creation of health gain in a world characterized by continued population exchanges rather than a strategy that is exclusively or primarily reactive and preoccupied with eliminating disease; [30] and (3) medical-school education holds out the promise of contributing to the reduction of health disparities in an immediate and observable fashion.

Throughout the global North and the global South, physicians are encountering patients in spatial transition from a multitude of dissimilar nation states [7] or ethnic communities. Contemporary medical-school curriculums and continuing education have not kept pace with the challenges that accompany an era of global mobility. In addition to multiple nationalities, physicians are challenged by bicultural, multicultural, and third-culture (different from both origin and host) [31] patients. Culture-competence education, initially intended for mastery of specific domestic two-culture interactions, [32] is of limited utility in today's diverse, hybrid, and rapidly changing patientcare environment [33, 28] . Leyla Cinibulak reports, for instance, that ""while health care providers [in the Netherlands] use a static notion of culture in their approach to migrant women, the Turkish migrant women's own approach towards the traditional values and taboos of their culture of origin and their religion is pragmatic and flexible"" [ [34] , also [35] ].

The multidimensional richness of human experience generates considerable intragroup variation [36, 37] . Thus, migrants from a common sending place rarely share the same socio-economic and political backgrounds and mobility experiences [38, 39] . Recipes of cultural characteristics miss the complexity of perspectives and behaviors that exist within ethnic groups due to varied social origins and behavioral inclinations, exposure to different experiences, mixed and emerging identities, and uneven transborder ties and involvements [40] . As Marjorie Kagawa-Singer and Shaheen Kassim-Lakha illustrate:

""What information does 'Chinese' convey? This man could have been born in Hong Kong, be a college professor who speaks five languages including English, and lives six months of the year in the United States and six months in Hong Kong. This man could also be a monolingual Chinese gentleman, born in the United States, unmarried, and living alone in Chinatown in New York, with little education and very poor [ [33] , p.579]."" Given the diverse, changing, and transgenerational nature of contemporary patient populations, [41] today's clinician must be skilled in identifying the special circumstances that surround and define each individual's health.

Educators increasingly appreciate that health is a global public good. The distribution of this good remains vastly unequal, however. Irrespective of ethnicity or culture, people who are poor ""tend to experience more health problems in general over the course of their lives than do their more socioeconomically advantaged counterparts"" [ [42] , p.504]. In large measure, disparities in health status reflect coping practices that are mediated by socio-economic position and ability to access and use health-care opportunities [28, 43, 12] In the global South, the most common social and economic determinants of medical problems and suffering are poverty, undernourishment, lack of access to safe water, absent or deficient sanitation, unhygienic housing conditions, [44, 45] and, increasingly, a critical shortage of trained health workers -many of whom have emigrated to rich countries [46] . Individuals and families on the move frequently confront additional health risks associated with ""health-compromising working and living conditions"" along with inequities in health-care access and medical treatment [[47], p.126, [48, 49] ]. Individual health-care abilities and opportunities are not independent of forces linked to globalization -including economic, political, and military incursions that result in displacement and migration [50] . A recent African war-zone study carried out by Physicians for Human Rights concluded that the ""first killer is flight"" for desperately poor persons driven by conflict from a fragile existence into a hostile and personally threatening environment where health services are nonexistent or not functioning [51] . Migrants who leave behind safe social settings often are obliged to congregate in vulnerable spatial surroundings. Mobility simultaneously facilitates cumulative social-change processes (including isolation, marginalization, segregation, and discrimination) and risk-taking behaviors that are associated with increased susceptibility to and spread of noncommunicable as well as communicable disease [47, 49, [52] [53] [54] ]. For this reason, HIV/AIDS researchers are devoting increased attention to the role of social disruption and migration to ""hot spot"" environments in fueling the epidemic [47, 12, 55] . To add insult to injury, the health problems of displaced and otherwise dislocated people tend to be officially ""invisible"" and are likely to be bypassed by potentially beneficial interventions [56] .

""Irregular"" and undocumented population movements pose special challenges of migration health. At all stages of migration (transportation, transit, and settlement), irregular migrants (including persons smuggled and traf-ficked) ""are particularly exposed to contracting or transmitting diseases, to injuries or even death"" [ [16] , pp.90-91, [57] ]. The vulnerability of irregular migrants is exacerbated by poverty, powerlessness, the absence of social and legal protection, and lack of access to reliable health-care services. This situation often obliges them to seek medical attention through unofficial and unsafe means [16] .

Although the reasons for disparities in health-care screening, medical procedures, morbidity, and mortality among persons who lack ""voice"" in biomedical institutions are multiple and complex, [58] the clinician/patient relationship constitutes an important contributing -and potentially mitigating -factor [59, 60, 48] . Carefully designed consultations enable public-health professionals to identify specific resources and support that will empower patients when addressing the challenges to positive health outcomes they face in the host society. Supportive actions on behalf of disadvantaged and underserved patients include facilitating access to social and health services provided by the host society; facilitating access to traditional healers and medicine as well as scarce (but, sometimes locally available) indigenous nutritional supplements; facilitating access to lay (community) health workers and intercultural mediators; assisting with the development of host-country language proficiency; promoting further education and credential (re-)certification; facilitating employment; help with moves into improved housing; [61] promoting the maintenance of children's healthy practices; [31, 62] encouraging legal/ policy coalition building with host-society institutions and transnational NGOs; and acting as the patient's advocate within the medical establishment and with government agencies and community associations.

In general, however, ""the possibility of physicians working to improve contextual sources of distress"" has been ""overlooked"" in medical education [ [63] , p.5, [64] ]. Addressing power blinders [65] as well as social and political barriers to greater equity in access to health care falls outside the scope of most medical-school curriculums [64] . Without redirection, then, advocacy on behalf of a diverse and shifting circle of patients will continue to be viewed as peripheral, optional, and/or beyond one's capacity by future generations of physicians [66] .

In our age of globalization and dislocation, health-care initiatives and interactions need to be informed and supported by enhanced educational capacity [67] . The transnational competence (TC) framework [68] provides a valuable skill foundation for curriculum reform. The comprehensive set of practical skills that comprise the core of a TC education offer a promising emerging avenue for redirecting medical-school curriculums in ways that specifically and effectively address the connection between migration and health disparities. TC approaches transnational clinical encounters as micro-level interpersonal interactions that occur in a social/power context and are directly and indirectly shaped by macrolevel (global, regional, national, and local) structural factors. Advocacy is a conceptually integral skill component in TC preparation. Medical students are expected to address the social and power context, and to promote the health rights, of patients undergoing spatial, social, and identity transitions through specific recommendations that are critiqued, refined, and evaluated by faculty, preceptors, and care receivers.

TC education is based on a set of key principles, addresses the framework's five core skill domains, and utilizes a reinforcing pedagogical approach. Given that population mixing is widespread in the South as well as the North and that foreign-trained health-care professionals play a growing role in the health sector of many nations, [69, 70] TC education needs to be available on a world-wide basis.

The first principle of TC education is patient-centered learning. The medical consultation is approached as a partnership, with the patient participating as teacher as well as learner and the student valuing the learning and mentoring dimensions of his/her role [58, 71] . The patient's voice is treated as an indispensable source of expertise and experiential insight [37, 72] . Rather than ignoring the perspectives of the least advantaged, [64] preparation for the TC encounter revolves around patientoriented inquiries that are designed to promote congruent perspectives among care seekers and care providers on health status and health promotion -regardless of differences in national origin, ethnicity, cultural identity(ies), and socio-economic (and political) status. Findings from clinical studies consistently show that, when treated as an interactive, partnership-based process, [73] the medical consultation directly and indirectly improves the outcome of health-care interventions [74, 59, 58, 71] . The TC approach anticipates, therefore, that health-care outcomes will be enhanced when patients also possess transnational competence [75] and demand and inspire corresponding skills on the part of the clinicians who consult with them.

TC's second core principle holds that patient advocacy is an indispensable physician activity. A TC education aims to move learners beyond patient sensitivity into responsiveness to patient needs. Across its five skill domains, the TC framework remains focused on two interconnected objectives: improved short-and long-term health outcomes for patients in spatial transition and reduced health inequities for dislocated populations and disadvantaged communities. Both objectives lie at the core of the People's Charter for Health that emerged from the People's Health Assembly held at Savar, Bangladesh, in 2000 [76] .

A third TC principle centers on the resilience of underserved patients and families. TC preparation starts from the premise that patients in spatial transition are resilient and searches for ways to reinforce and expand their capacity to tap into potentially rich reservoirs of family, community, and transnational health-care resources.

The TC framework explicitly encompasses five discrete, but mutually reinforcing, skill domains. Transnational competence involves mastery of analytic, emotional, creative/imaginative, communicative, and functional skills. Each skill domain encompasses multiple dimensions.

The analytic domain of TC preparation focuses on developing the ability to gather and analyze evidence related to the patient's health rather than on stored knowledge, while recognizing that a knowledge-based approach can be useful for specific and limited purposes [27, 48] . In particular, TC education recognizes the necessity to probe beyond ethnicity/culture. As Moustafa Bayoumi observes, ""by obsessively focusing on culture, we avoid talking about history, economics and politics"" [ [77] , p.A4]. In short, an exclusively ethnic/cultural observation ""obscures the social and structural basis of the need ..."" [ [37] , p.34]. The interweaving of ethnocultural, sociopolitical, and medical analyses is required for comprehensive assessment of each patient's health-care needs.

To avoid misinterpreting messages and explanations offered by patients in spatial transition, medical students must develop expanded receptors for discerning political and socio-economic determinants of individual health; [78] [79] [80] [81] [82] 62 ] that is, they must learn how to perceive health situations through what Mary Duffy refers to as the patient's ""global lens"" [ [36] , p.489]. In particular, it is important that medical practitioners elicit and explore the longitudinal dimensions of spatial transition given that established as well as recent migrants often are dealing with ""unfinished endings"" that preceded their arrival in the current locale [ [38] , p.89, [83] ] and continue to shape their lives [84, 85] . Physicians possessing transnational analytic skill are able to comprehend and critically appraise the internal and external forces that affect migration health [86, 87] by expanding the medical discourse to include linked macro-structural and micro ""origins of personal suffering"" [ [63] , p.276] -such as war, [48, 88, 89, 84] manipulations of national and subnational economies by powerful global institutions, [87, [90] [91] [92] 12] foreign policy, [86] powerlessness, [93] persecution, and the type, combination, and frequency of trauma experiences [94] .

Transnational analytic skill further involves unraveling existing linkages between migrant health and post-migration constraints and stressors associated with receivingcountry reception practices and new developments in the country of origin [95] [96] [97] . For instance, a patient's capacity for self-care can be limited by ongoing ""cultural and linguistic isolation, fragmentation of the family, deformation of social relationships, chronic absence of adequate support systems, poverty, prejudice, and unemployment"" [ [98] , p.32, [59] , [63, [99] [100] [101] [102] [103] ] -all rooted in migration and post-migration experiences. Furthermore, political and family events and conditions in the sending country often continue to affect the mental health and physical well-being of service users who possess transnational ties and identities [104, 84] .

Another critical transnational analytic skill in migration health is the ability to ascertain the role of ethnocultural and other nonstandard health-related beliefs, values, practices, and paradoxes. The ""transnational healing"" practices of some contemporary migrants even include return to the country of origin for medical attention and treatment [105, 106] . TC education prepares students to assess the role of nonbiomedical considerations in the pre-and post-migration explanatory model and decisionmaking processes of specific patients and/or families [107] [108] [109] [110] [111] [112] . Box 1 presents illustrative TC-preparation components in the analytic domain.

Illustrative TC-preparation components: Analytic domain 1. Develop the theoretical base for analyzing the particular socio-economic and political factors that mediate experience and influence health-care delivery for the individual patient.

a. Introduce useful concepts from waste and consumption studies [113, 114] i. notion of a chain, with individual decision nodes that tend to be severed from contextualized understanding of shaping and constraining upstream and downstream social forces and power relations that invoke hidden costs.

ii. process of distancing; that is, stretching the chain (geographically, culturally, and mentally). Mental distance includes gulfs of information, awareness, and responsibility.

iii. possible applications when analyzing transnational health care 1. recognize the need to move upstream and downstream along the health chain in the effort to uncover specific case-relevant contextual social forces and power relations. Raise consciousness that individual medical care alone cannot be sufficient to sustain practices that will maximize the patient's health potential.

2. recognize that moving upstream and downstream intergenerationally is likely to yield divergent as well as overlapping insights.

b. Connect concepts (including class, identity, power, and distancing) to the ability to discern and analyze critically [64] the distant political/economic/social/environmental contributors to proximate health ""variability, vulnerability, and strength"" [ [33] , p.579, [115] ]; specifically, the interaction of dislocation and transit experiences (including types, extent, and duration of persecution and trauma) with:

i. different migration decisions and forms of migrationforced, planned and long-term, planned and short-term [2] ii. structural inequities embedded in conditioning institutions iii. linked macro and micro, local and global forces c. Connect concepts (including class, identity, power, and distancing) to the ability to discern post-migration conditions affecting the patient's current health-related beliefs and practices and physical and mental health in the receiving society. Potentially influential post-migration conditions include:

i. social/political experiences and stressors ii. simultaneous and potentially conflicting home-and host-country expectations and medical treatments iii. differential access to health-care system and treatment opportunities iv. altered nutrition practices x. extent, and positive and negative effects, of adaptation [31] d. Connect concepts to skill in discerning life-style and health consequences of the patient's changing class profile -often characterized by radical downward mobility in the case of involuntary (politically dislocated) migrants and upward mobility for voluntary (economic) migrants (accompanied by exposure to new risks and the adoption of detrimental health behaviors) 2. Develop ability to discern the patient's ethnocultural identification(s) and personal (including nonbiomedical) beliefs and practices regarding causes, treatment, and prevention of illness.

3. Develop understanding of how the degree of one's cultural, ethnic, and socio-economic match with the patient influences the therapeutic relationship [115] . Learn to avoid the ""cultural blind spot syndrome"" where the clinician assumes no distinctive health-care beliefs/practices exist because the patient looks and behaves much the same way as s/he does [116, 117, 28] b. by using general information about population-specific disease incidence/prevalence/outcomes, new and emerging diseases, and antimicrobile resistance [2] and the patient's places of origin and transit, ethnicity, cultural and spiritual practices, previous sources of health care, migration/trauma experiences, economic situation, degree of societal incorporation, and support systems as a starting point for physical/mental-health inquiry, confirmation/ disconfirmation, and recommended therapies/ referrals c. by accessing and assessing information regarding the pharmacological properties of the care recipient's ethnocultural preparations (ethnopharmacology) [48] d. by eliciting comprehensive patient narratives and explanatory frameworks that move beyond the prevalent ""brief and perfunctory social history"" [118] Transnational emotional skills Transnational emotional competence includes the ability to express interest in different cultural patterns -language, family life, dietary practices, [119] customs, etc [120] -and the ability to gain and maintain genuine respect for a multiplicity of values, beliefs, traditions, experiences, challenges, preferred communication styles, and feelings of satisfaction and emotional distress stemming from social circumstances [63, 34] . Among medical students preparing for encounters with patients of multiple nationalities and diverse identities, the emotional skill domain is developed through interest in interacting with ethnically, culturally, and economically diverse patients. The application of transnational emotional skills requires a ""willingness to try"" to decipher the patient's thoughts and perspectives [ [32] , p.1058, [121] ] -including his/her beliefs regarding the mediating effect of ""luck, chance, randomness and personal destiny"" on healthy lifestyles [ [122] , p.679] -and to respond empathically with an appropriate emotion of one's own [123] .

In the migrant-health interface, it is particularly important that care providers learn to respect rather than dismiss lay expertise [72, 37] as well as nonbiomedical practices that affect acceptance of and compliance with treatment protocols and, therefore, influence outcomes [124] [125] [126] [127] 112] . Emotionally skillful participants also appreciate that every clinical encounter is a multidimensional interaction among the cultures of the patient, the physician, the support professional(s), and the health-care contexts/systems that surround them [128, 107, 48, 62] .

The emotional-competence domain of a TC education further emphasizes appreciation for the ability of people in spatial transition to regain emotional strength and functional capacity following adversity [129] . Many ""refugee patients and their families bring to health consultation stories of incredible human resilience in the most extreme circumstances"" [ [130] , p.27, [110] ]. Studies show that a sense of personal, family, and/or group efficacy constitutes a powerful determinant of the adoption and maintenance of health-promoting actions and is associated with a host of health-enhancement and illness-prevention outcomes [131] [132] [133] 58] . Under the vulnerable and stressful environmental conditions that migrants face as the result of formidable language and cultural constraints, discrimination, the threat of long-term unem-ployment, and/or lack of social support, clinician appreciation for patient/family health-care assets, capabilities, and responsibilities reinforces individual and collective perceptions of transnational efficacy and strengthens confidence, perseverance, and power to sustain new and demanding psychological and physiological healthenhancing behaviors [132] . Capable self/family illness management is particularly valuable in treating many chronic diseases [134] . Among medical students, emotional competence also involves self-monitoring and reflection; that is, life-long openness to critical selfappraisal, to learning in place of stereotyping, [135] and to promoting emotional growth [136] . Box 2 presents illustrative TC-preparation components in the emotionalskill domain.

Illustrative TC-preparation components: Emotional domain 1. Develop abilities to realize health-care insights through transnational empathy, to be effective at deciphering the patient's perspective, to see and take seriously problems as the ethnoculturally discordant patient experiences them, [137, 138] and to deliver an appropriate and reassuring emotional response.

2. Develop ability to reinforce/restore efficacy among ethnically and socio-economically diverse patients a. by demonstrating appreciation for emotional resources (resilience) and achievements in surviving and overcoming dislocation and migration challenges and/or disparities in treatment [115, 139] b. by validating and protecting family-care and self-care practices that facilitate adaptation and well-being [140] c. by identifying what patients and their support network can do for themselves with some initial outside help [141] d. by conveying an optimistic outlook on prospects that the patient's health-care needs can be met [142, 143] 3. Develop ability to show respect for (acknowledge and validate) the patient's ethnocultural and other nonbiomedical health beliefs and practices -to treat them as distinctive rather than inferior or deviant. 4 . Develop ability to motivate health improvements through transnational sociophysiologic feedback [137] . This ability is important because many patients look for help in dealing with the emotional aspects of chronic or other illness and are shocked when clinicians approach their case only in terms of technical efficiency [144] .

The freeing up of imaginative capacities is a powerful force for positive health outcomes in the transnational medical encounter [145] . A key creative skill for medical students preparing for migrant-health care is the ability to initiate fruitful new connections among distant and proximate parts of the patient's experience [146] . Skillful transnational clinicians are ""creative synthesizers"" [ [147] , p.17, [148] ] who value collaboration with, and are able to inspire, participants of diverse identities (patients, family members, and transcultural mediators) in the co-design and nurturing of innovative and contextually appropriate health-action plans [149] .

A substantial proportion of all health care is provided ""outside the perimeter of the formal health care system"" [ [150] , p.251]. In the migrant-health arena, innovative approaches to managing demands for medical treatment and wellness promotion include complementary integrations of biomedical and ethnocultural explanatory frameworks and health-related practices [107, 124, 109, [151] [152] [153] 108, 96] and incorporate multilevel linkages of individual, socio-political, and ecological considerations [154, 155] . In the interest of preparing creative medical practitioners, TC education emphasizes flexibility and adaptability when confronted with unique and unfamiliar situations [37] .

Imagination ""makes empathy possible"" by lending ""credence to alternative realities"" [ [146] , p.3]. Medical practitioners must be prepared to relate physical and emotional experiences and perceptions that shaped the decision to leave the country of origin, as well as those that arise during migration and resettlement processes, both to approaches that effectively address the patient's current health-promotion needs [152, 155] and to promising social changes and policy alternatives [63] . Box 3 presents illustrative TC-preparation components in the creative/ innovative domain.

Illustrative TC-preparation components: Creative domain 1. Ability to account for the patient's current place-specific environment (housing, social dis/organization, transportation, employment, etc.) in the tailored health-action plan.

2. Ability to forge synergetic and congruent linkages between what the patient believes and what the clinician believes [28] .

3. Ability to co-create a health plan based on shared transnational synthesis -a complementary combination of biomedical and personal (ethnocultural/mixed-cultural) beliefs/practices that is neither clinically, culturally, nor economically contraindicated [115, 156, 81] . 4 . Ability to activate and incorporate the patient's own ideas, suggestions, resources, and ingenuity into the mutually agreed-upon health plan.

5. Ability to account for the ethnoculturally discordant patient's unique life context (physical and emotional experiences and institutional forces) in the tailored health-action plan.

6. Ability to construct a tailored health-promotion action plan that includes societal reinforcement for linked physical/mental-health interventions [115] .

Effective provider-patient communication is widely perceived as ""a core competency in the health care profession"" [ [59] , p.27, [58, 48] ]. While personal linguistic fluency in the patient's first language is an immense behavioral asset, [157] [158] [159] [160] [161] 48] achieving it is impractical in transnational health-care situations involving multiple first languages [32] . In New York City, for instance, patients might speak one of 150 different languages [162] Thus, TC education emphasizes skill in using an interpreter, the importance of employing trained medical interpreters, [163] [164] [165] [166] 153, 158, 160, 111, 157, 48] and host-language preparation and communication training for patients [134] .

Transnationally skillful actors also develop proficiency in nonverbal-communicative behavior. In medical encounters, ""nonverbal communication skills ... are as important as verbal skills, if not more so"" [ [167] , p.2445]. In transnational medical interactions, interview pace, speechsimplification strategies, and the use of ""continuers"" ensure that participants are not rushed, prematurely interrupted, ignored, or incompletely understood [168] [169] [170] 164] . In addition, communication-recovery skills, such as humor, apology, and admission that one does not know everything, ""reinforce confidence as well as competence because, when it is known that there is something to fall back on, one is less likely to avoid interactions that may prove difficult"" [ [96] , p.245, [135] ].

The capacity to engage in meaningful dialogue and to facilitate mutual self-disclosure via questioning is particularly important in transnational health-care situations characterized by vast social distance [168] . Similarly, a prerequisite for negotiating appropriate treatment plans and commitment to agreements is that participantsespecially migrant patients -are comfortable expressing serious doubts and constructive challenges [168, 63, 58] .

Illustrative TC-preparation components: Communicative domain 1. Ability to select the most helpful interpreter for each patient's specific cultural, linguistic, and social context 2. Ability to use best practices associated with the participation of interpreters in clinical consultations [156] 3. Proficiency in patient-appropriate non-verbal communication 4. Proficiency in active listening and taking the patient seriously [138] 5. Ability to use speech-simplification strategies 6. Communication-recovery skills 7. Ability to facilitate mutual self-disclosure [33] 8. Ability to convey health-care options and recommendations across language and cultural divides 9. Ability to elicit patient's questions and concerns

Functional competence involves the interpersonal as well as technical ability to accomplish tasks and achieve objectives. In transnational medical encounters, the functional skills of both patients and clinicians affect illness management and wellness promotion [171, 172] . In migranthealth-care consultations, effective functional interventions take into account both the individual's condition and the social context affecting health behavior [155] .

Skill in establishing positive interpersonal relations is particularly valuable for the functional domain of migranthealth care. Keys to success in building fruitful transnational relationships include demonstrating genuine and sustained personal as well as professional interest in the care recipient as an individual, commitment to the patient's cognitive and instrumental needs, [137] and support for his/her social inclusion [36] . TC preparation emphasizes that, in the case of migrants who lack voice in the socio-political context they find themselves in, concern for patient well-being can be demonstrated by actions that address factors responsible for personal suffering [63] . Valuable relationship-building TC-provider interventions include helping with transportation to medical appointments, facilitating access to traditional heal-ers, medicine, and nutrition, promoting ties to community support networks, identifying and enhancing the development of ""new roles that provide a sense of meaning and structure to daily life,"" [ [173] , p.294] and assisting with host-country language training, further education and credential (re-)certification, employment, and the maintenance of (children's) healthy practices.

The functional dimension of transnational competence also is promoted by establishing clinician/patient partnerships, or ""therapeutic alliances."" [135] In the transnational therapeutic alliance, ""the process of negotiation between practitioner and patient involves developing courses of action that are consistent with the patient's values and goals and that also satisfy the physician's values and goals ..."" [ [168] , p.13, [33] ]. For many migrants, transculturally sustainable agreements must include involvement by (extended) family members and/or migrantcommunity support networks [111, 150] .

In the interest of equitable health opportunities for migrant patients, transnational functional adroitness necessitates advocacy competence; that is, recommendations/actions that will generate upstream and downstream changes in domestic and international economic, social, institutional, and policy conditions that produce the systemic disparities that constrain individual health and preclude the realization of health gains [23, [174] [175] [176] [177] 92, 48, 76, 94] . It is likely to be particularly rewarding for functional skill development to focus students' advocacy attention on local ""hot spots"" where migrants tend to congregate. In this part of functional TC preparation, medical students can be guided to develop specific interventions that address context-and site-specific conditions that are conducive to elevated risk-taking behavior [47]. Box 5 presents illustrative TC-preparation components in the functional domain.

Illustrative TC-preparation components: Functional domain 1. Ability to establish and maintain meaningful transnational inter-personal relations [178] .

2. Ability to relate to ethnoculturally and socio-economically discordant patients in a way that builds mutual trust a. by showing that one genuinely is interested in, cares about, and is committed to helping with the patient's current situation and quality of life (beyond physical health) [179, 138] b. actions are regarded as appropriate and useful c. conflicts are resolved to mutual satisfaction 3. Ability to apply relevant insights from the other four TC domains.

4. Ability to integrate evidence-based insights regarding the influence of ethnocultural practices and disease predispositions, class, access, migration, and trauma into patient-specific health-status hypotheses and effective health-care responses.

5. Ability to engage the patient (and/or his/her family) in making joint health/illness assessments and in developing/modifying health-promotion plans [81, 180] . At times, this process requires the ability to overcome structural constraints that limit the amount of time available for consultations with patients [181] .

6. Advocacy and referral skills I. Ability to build and activate host-society and migrant-community resources that are likely to enhance the patient's health situation by mitigating the site-specific environmental constraints they confront.

7. Advocacy and referral skills II. Ability to build and activate societal resources that are likely to enhance the patient's health situation by mitigating the socio-economic inequities, power differentials, exclusion policies, and other institutionalized constraints they confront.

Along with introductions to challenging new material and helpful insights regarding contemporary medical practice, it is critical that future physicians be ""taught in a way that works better"" [182] . For maximum effect, the core elements of a TC education need to be longitudinally woven into required pre-clinical and clinical education through instructional approaches that encompass lectures, smallgroup discussions that include reference to the consequences of patient stereotyping, analysis of written and videotaped case studies, constant reference to clinical applications, interaction with community leaders, training in interviewing skills, as well as experiential approaches such as role plays, [27] encounters with simulated patients, overseas immersion, [8,36] involvement in community service-learning projects, and carefully designed clinical clerkships. The didactic components of the longitudinal and integrated TC approach would establish the need for adaptable skills in the contemporary context of globalization and health, would build a comprehensive foundation of five skill domains, would highlight the special value of experiential learning and reflective practice when attending to migrants, and would emphasize the centrality of collaborative efforts to promote social justice in health care through multi-dimensionally sensitive and individual-patient responsive transnational medical encounters. Resources from the humanities (e.g., art, literature, autobiographical accounts of migrant-patient experiences) can be especially useful in the initial effort to awaken the student's imagination [146] and to convey TC concepts that are inherently important in caring for migrant patients [183] . To facilitate stakeholder buy-in, the instructional and experiential dimensions of TC medical education also require attention to faculty-selection criteria, resources for faculty development in skill-deficit domains and in unfamiliar pedagogical approaches, and institutional as well as external support for materials development, contributions by specialists, assessment exercises, and logistical arrangements. Medical schools and teaching hospitals also will need to reinforce or establish linkages with often fragmented migrant-community associations and with community-health advocates.

In contrast to educational methods that center on mastery of ethnic patterns of disease or lists of cultural characteristics, the predominantly inductive TC approach focuses on the patient as the starting point for discovery and avoiding mistakes [27, 184] . When health-care providers work with diverse service seekers, skill development occurs through ""bottom-up"" information and evidence gathering that places primary emphasis on contextual insights derived from proximate and current sources -the patient himself/ herself and family, friends, and/or community members [185, 48] . In light of the existence of national subcultures and the presence of intracultural (and changing) variations that occur due to ""age, gender, income, education, acculturation, individual differences, and multiple other factors,"" general epidemiological evidence about the patient's country and its endemic diseases, ethnic group, or religious affiliation needs to be ""regarded as having some bearing but requires further validation to be considered immediately useful"" [ [185] , p.251-252, [186, 96, 27, 33] ]. As Melanie Tervalon and Jann Murray-Garcia point out, ""only the patient is uniquely qualified to help the physician understand the intersection of race, ethnicity, religion, class, and so on in forming his (the patient's) identity and to clarify the relevance and impact of this intersection on the present illness or wellness experience""; that is, ""how little or how much culture has to do with that particular clinical encounter"" [ [135] , p.121].

For TC preparation, therefore, skill development is expected to be especially robust during the student's clinical-clerkship experiences. In a TC-informed medical education, exposure to transnational medical encounters would constitute an integral part of all clinical clerkships. Clerkships that involve migrant patients present students with a variety of stimulating medical challenges framed by diverse cultural perspectives and social backgrounds [65] and, simultaneously, provide problem-solving opportunities for students to articulate helpful recommendations and rewarding interventions. When designing each TC clerkship experience, faculty would arrange for students to work closely with patients and family members from distinct and diverse cultural, ethnic, subcultural, generational, and socio-economic backgrounds. Gerrish, Husband, and Mackenzie warn that ""a de facto emphasis on cultural competence, with a resultant neglect of intercultural competence, must be resisted"" [37, 134, 135] ]. Thus, TC clinical placements and preceptor-supervised encounters with patients [121] would avoid focusing on a single local population. Clinical assignments also should proceed to levels of increasing complexity and be linked to reflective seminars that involve sharing and group discussion of case-specific and transnational issue-related insights gained from interviews with multiple patients of diverse backgrounds and from students' health-promotion and social-context (advocacy) recommendations. For educators working at institutions in the few rural areas or population centers that remain relatively untouched by migration, the experiential component might need to supplement a relatively homogeneous patient base through student participation in out-of-country immersion programs, cooperative arrangements with urban medical schools, and/or videoconferencing [187] .

TC clerkships would emphasize the validation and promotion of factors that facilitate health recovery/maintenance, transnational adaptation, and survival. When working with ethnoculturally discordant patients, ""the ability to identify assets in a family beset by overwhelming liabilities"" as well as vulnerabilities ""often produces the turning point toward successful interventions"" [ [188] , p.269]. The bases for resilience vary among patients and are subject to change over time [189] . Possibilities for students to explore include: hopeful vision for the future; religious faith; self-reliance; personal history of overcoming adversity; roots; finding meaning/purpose in life; [189] and community mutual assistance and support [190] . In TC clerkships, students would learn that unduly pathologizing the migrant's experience [118] exaggerates deficiencies, risks fostering dependency, [191] and ""removes the matter from the political and social context that produced ... [the] anguish and loss"" [139] . TC clinical education also aims to provide the future physician with a toolbox of ways of reinforcing and expanding resilience (especially preparing patients to take responsibility for self care and problem solving in a confident manner, which often involves family and nonbiomedical supplements and addressing resource needs), reversing devaluation and disempowerment by providing opportunities for patients to demonstrate and develop role competence and increased control over their life both in and beyond health-care situations, [192] and enabling migrants to resist the adoption of health-adverse behaviors practiced by members of the receiving society [193, 194] . Further-more, TC clerkships would demonstrate that the extra time spent on caring behavior (estimated at 5-7 minutes per encounter until the caring relationship is established) results in multiple benefits for both practitioner and patient [137, 181] . Increasingly, managed-care providers recognize that providing such quality attention more effectively contains health-care costs than does limiting services [115] .

A central component of inductive TC pedagogy and the TC clinical clerkship is a ""mini ethnography"" of health, illness, and migration/adaptation experiences [80, 195] . In the transnational medical encounter, the patient's narrative of lived experience -including the migrant's stressful social and environmental situations, network of transnational social relations, and emerging identities [95] -is particularly valuable [145, 96] . Genogram construction [178] constitutes another illuminating tool that can be built into the ethnographic interview. The ethnographiclearning experience should include observations in the patient's social territory; critical reflection on the medical impact of power relations, institutionalized constraints, and patient/family strengths; opportunities for the patient to comment upon the student's initial findings; preceptor feedback regarding the strengths and limitations of each student's interviews; and facilitated discussions with faculty in small-group settings of the students' findings as well as possible hidden social, economic, legal, and cultural contributors. The ethnographic approach reduces prospects that decisions will be based on stereotypic oversimplifications and/or insufficient information [196, 48, 128, 112] and helps medical practitioners avoid the overgeneralized tendency to perceive and treat migrants as traumatized victims [95] .

Ethnographic interviewing also needs to be linked to skills in documenting how patient/family perspectives and insights that bear upon the patient's physical and mental health as well as his/her current social, economic, and legal circumstances will be addressed in the recommended health plan. In her case study of Lia Lee's treatment by U.S. doctors, Anne Fadiman reports that Lia's medical chart ""grew longer and longer, until it contained more than 400,000 words. ... The TC approach involves explicit expectations that students act as the patient's advocate by forging partnerships with community organizations and advocacy groups and by making social-context recommendations that address both short-and long-term challenges to health [180, 197] . Preceptors would be expected to provide feedback to students about documented results that arise from their recommendations. TC's advocacy emphasis further suggests the value of integrating community-based [156, 64, 36] experiential or service learning into the medical student's education [198] .

Assessments of TC-learning outcomes would include student course and clerkship evaluations, student self-evaluations and instructor appraisals of pre-and postclassroom learning (e.g., the student's ability to explain why the unique migration history of a refugee from Afghanistan is important for the patient's health care [199] ) and humanistic-values enhancement, review of randomly videotaped/audiorecorded encounters with patients of diverse backgrounds, [27] preceptor evaluation of each student's applications of the five TC skills (e.g., the ability to delineate and document a comprehensive plan of action that connects the patient's socio-cultural background, perspectives, and context with his/her current health challenges and promising medical and nonmedical responses), and TC-relevant OSCEs [27, 184] . TC skill assessment would be incomplete without eliciting and incorporating patient reflections on the interview process, the accuracy of insights reported in the mini-ethnography, the efficacy of the student's proposed and initiated actions in terms of health-promoting interventions and personal health outcomes, [27] and the attending student's overall TC strengths and deficits.

Successful implementation of a TC educational initiative requires additional resources. The training and employment of medical interpreters, the conduct of ethnographic interviews, the professional development of medicalschool faculty who are qualified to offer TC-informed courses and to supervise TC-centered clerkships, and the construction and execution of systematic evaluation studies constitute critical components of the educational framework presented here that will be well-served by supplemental external funding. This is particularly the case for resource-scarce universities in Southern countries. In addition to internal reallocations, a variety of national and international funding sources can be mobilized for program support. Ideally, the World Health Organization would assume responsibility for driving, and coordinating funding for, the TC initiative. The faculty-development and evaluation components also would be promoted by national government incentive programs carried forward in partnership with higher-education institutions, including the United Nations University. Foundations and associations of medical professionals could usefully contribute to the global TC educational initiative, with some programs specifically devoted to the preparation of professional medical interpreters, transnational navigators, and patient advocates along with TC training for migrants. Grounding in TC, along with receptivity to continued mutual South-North learning, could be fruitfully incorporated into the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation-supported ""E-learning Certification Programme in Global Health"" initiated through Oxford University [200] and into the post-graduate educational programs offered by the Department of Global Health at The University of Washington that will be launched in 2006 thanks to another Gates Foundation grant.

As the diversity of patient populations continues to expand in both North and South, it is time for a proactive and mobility-relevant redirection of medical education on a global scale. In some cases, adopting the TC framework requires fundamental shifts in orientation and approach. Other medical schools are positioned to reinforce skills already covered (e.g., ethnographic interviewing, working with intercultural mediators) within the context of TC's encompassing and globally relevant framework. The advantages of TC-inspired redirection of medical education are manifold. TC preparation (1) provides an integrated and comprehensive set of practical and contemporary medical-consultation skills of value in an age of population mobility; (2) accepts that acquired mastery of the ""multiplicity of cultures that comprise the patient populations of today"" [ [185] , p.250] is neither feasible nor necessary for quality care and cost containment; instead, the TC approach focuses on discerning each patient's multiple and complex (rather than singlesource) identities and distinctive health perspectives and personal needs in ways that build trust, confidence, and humility; (3) places the physical-and mental-health consequences of economic disparities and underlying global/ local structural contributors front and center; (4) aims to equip both service users and service providers with parallel skills [75] ; (5) addresses both the quality of patient care and social constraints on migrant health; and (6) applies to and promises to resonate well with clinicians in all countries who work with ethnoculturally and socioeconomically discordant patients. Consequently, a TC education would equip learners for global and not just local practice -an important qualification given the scope of contemporary population and professional mixing.

In our mobility-upheaval era, transnational-competence preparation offers a promising avenue for providing clinicians and other public-health professionals with the full complement of interpersonal skills needed to be effective care providers in the global North and the global South. Exploratory research suggests that TC skills can improve health-care outcomes in ethnoculturally discordant medical encounters, [29, 97] although confirmation requires more elaborate and comparative investigations. Given that few medical schools have embarked on pilot TC programs to date, [201] that a full-blown TC curriculum would involve demanding expectations of currently stretched students and faculty, and that compelling evaluation results require additional outcome-based research studies, controls, and time, substantiating claims for the efficacy of TC education remains a future project. However, as the value of preparation in generic TC skills is further demonstrated through student assessment, modeling by clinician mentors, mistake avoidance, [184] patient satisfaction, quality assurance, and reduced health disparities, the future physician's intrinsic human and professional motivation [202] to interact ever more effectively on behalf of ethnoculturally and socioeconomically unfamiliar and disadvantaged patients will provide the foundation for, and facilitate openness to, the development of personal transnational competence in migrant-health care.

Public Opinion Polarization by Individual Revenue from the Social Preference Theory,"Social conflicts occur frequently during the social transition period and the polarization of public opinion happens occasionally. By introducing the social preference theory, the target of this paper is to reveal the micro-interaction mechanism of public opinion polarization. Firstly, we divide the social preferences of Internet users (network nodes) into three categories: egoistic, altruistic, and fair preferences, and adopt the revenue function to define the benefits obtained by individuals with different preferences among their interaction process so as to analyze their decision-making behaviors driven by the revenue. Secondly, the revenue function is used to judge the exit rules of nodes in a network, and then a dynamic network of spreading public opinion with the node (individual) exit mechanism is built based on a BA scale-free network. Subsequently, the influences of different social preferences, as well as individual revenue on the effect of public opinion polarization, are analyzed through simulation experiments. The simulation results show that (1) Different social preferences demonstrate different influences on the evolution of public opinions, (2) Individuals tend to interact with ones with different preferences, (3) The network with a single preference or a high aggregation is more likely to form public opinion polarization. Finally, the practicability and effectiveness of the proposed model are verified by a real case.","When hot events break out on the Internet, network forums and discussion groups related to the topic will be generated along with the propagation of these hot events. When people communicate in forums or discussion groups, fierce disputes or mutual affirmation of different views will lead to the popularity of public opinion and generate one or more extreme attitude values, which are called public opinion polarization. Generally speaking, the effective usage of public opinion polarization can improve the public's trust in government, and also increase customer loyalty to enterprises [1] . For example, in the Spring Festival of 2020, when China's novel coronavirus broke out, the Henan provincial government acted decisively and responded effectively. Soon afterwards, topics such as ""How to Steal the Governor of Henan Province"" and ""Henan Province hand over the full score answer sheet"" appeared in the network to occupy the top of the hot search list, which greatly enhanced the credibility of the Henan provincial government. However, since every coin has two sides, the phenomenon of public opinion polarization also easily results in network violence and even extends such behavior from online to offline, such as sit-downs, protest marches, and other social group behaviors that are not conducive to social stability. As a result, research on the emergence mechanism of public opinion polarization is of important theoretical and practical significance.

At present, there are relatively few studies on the public opinion polarization, and most of them mainly adopt methods such as macro statistics [2] or mathematical modeling [3, 4] to analyze the main characteristics of the formation and propagation of polarization phenomena at the macro level. However, these methods generally lack studies on the interaction mechanism of micro individuals. In fact, only by fully exploring the internal driving force for individuals to participate in the interaction of views in the network, as well as analyzing the direct reasons behind their decision-making behaviors, can the internal mechanism of polarization phenomenon be further understood. In the process of micro-individual interactions, every individual is different, which makes him/her have different social preferences. These differentiated social preferences will bring different revenues for individuals to participate in the interactions, thus prompting them to take different interactive behaviors driven by revenues, and ultimately affecting public opinion polarization on the whole network. Currently, the social preference theory [5, 6] has widely applied to individual behavioral decisions in the field of social and economic activities but is rarely used in the field of public opinion evolution. In this paper, we introduce the social preference theory and build a public opinion polarization model for analyzing individual interaction behavior from the perspective of gain for different individuals. As far as we know, it is the first time that the social preference theory has been adopted for public opinion polarization. Subsequently, the effects of different social preferences, network structure, and individual revenues on public opinion polarization are explored by simulation experiments and some observations are obtained through simulation experiments. Finally, the practicability and effectiveness of the proposed model are verified by a real case.

The structure of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 is a literature review and points out the innovations of this paper. Section 3 constructs the revenue model of individual interaction with different social preferences. Section 4 discusses the influences of various parameters on opinion polarization by simulation experiments. Subsequently, a real case is used to testify the practicability and effectiveness of our proposed model in Section 5. Section 6 is the conclusions and prospects of work in the future.

For research on group polarization, Professor Sunstein [1] proposed in 2002 that if there was some bias in the opinions of group members at the beginning, such bias would be strengthened after discussion, and finally, an extreme opinion would be formed, which is the public opinion polarization. Subsequently, many scholars have also studied the phenomenon of public opinion polarization and have made some achievements. For example, Liu et al. [7] studied the overconfidence problem in viewpoint interactions among different individuals in 2019 and proposed that overconfidence would have a negative impact on large-scale group decision-making and reduce the consistency of decision-making. In 2017, Dong et al. [8] explored the issue of consensus under the guidance of multiple leaders and found that the dynamic change process of leaders could promote public opinion polarization. Dandekar et al. [9] proposed in 2013 that if individuals in the network had enough prejudice at the initial moment, such prejudice would lead to public opinion polarization after a lot of interactions. Etesami and Basar [10] studied the public opinion polarization phenomenon in high dimensions in 2014 and found that whether it forms single polarization, bi-polarization, or multi-polarization depended on the openness of the mind. In 2013, Li et al. [11] discussed the internal characteristics of the gradual shift of public opinion from bi-polarization to single polarization by analyzing its convergence characteristics. Leon-Medini [12] established a new multi-agent model to study the final trend of public opinion evolution in 2019. In 2017, by comparing networks with different structures, Li and Xiao [13] found that the increase of average network would raise the polarization degree, and the viewpoints of different dimensions would affect each other in the network evolution, thus reducing the polarization phenomenon. In 2019, Chen et al. [14] considered the influence of heterogeneous individuals in the network on the public opinion polarization, and also introduced the concept of dynamic conformity to discuss the influence of ""silent spiral"" phenomenon on the polarization of public opinion. However, the driving force for individuals to participate in the interaction was not considered in the above paper.

All in all, the literature mentioned above is focused on the analysis of the general propagation rule of opinion polarization phenomenon at the macro level, or the simulation of the evolution process of the entire public opinion polarization by establishing the model of public opinion propagation so as to explore the complex behaviors of the macro system as a whole. However, studies are rarely related to individual interaction mechanisms at the micro level. Due to the complexity of netizens, there are many influence factors involved in their interactions, so quantitative analysis is difficult to deal with in this issue. Considering that every individual is driven by revenue during interactions, individuals are only willing to engage in perspective interactions when they can obtain certain benefits. Individuals with different social preferences have diverse benefits from each interaction. Based on this, the benefits brought by different preferences can explain the essential motivations of the different behavior choices of individuals in public opinion communication. Therefore, it is of great practical significance to use the social preference theory to study the public opinion polarization phenomenon so as to better explain the interrelationships among various factors that affect the public opinion polarization phenomenon.

There are also many existing studies on the social interaction, social conflict, and social impact of public opinion analysis. For example, in 2019, Zhou [15] used a structural equation model to explore the impact of social interaction on users' social and commercial willingness. In 2019, Kim et al. [16] studied the relationship between offline social interaction and online shopping. In 2016, Szczecinska-Musielak [17] discussed the usefulness of social conflict theory as a theoretical framework for analyzing the conflict in Northern Ireland. In 2018, Cuppen [18] emphasized the value of social conflict in energy policy and planning and discussed several basic characteristics of social conflict. Zhou [19] proposed in 2019 that social support, including information support and emotional support, had a significant impact on social influence. Peng et al. [20] presented an evaluation model to measure both direct and indirect influence based on the social relationship graph, by introducing friend entropy and interaction frequency entropy to describe the complexity and uncertainty of social influence. All the above literature study network public opinion from macro perspectives and mainly use qualitative methods to analyze opinion evolution. However, micro individual interactions can determine the macro emergence of group behavior. As a result, it is necessary to explore public opinion polarization from micro individual interactions. That is why we introduce social preference theory to measure individual revenues in interactions.

In addition, some scholars have attempted to explain the evolution mechanism of public opinion through the preference theory. For instance, in 2015, Alizadeh et al. [21] investigated the interplay of homophily, rejection, and in-group cooperation drivers on the formation of opinion clusters and the emergence of extremist, radical opinions. Their model was to explicitly explore the effect of in-group favoritism on the macro-level, collective behavior of opinions. In 2019, Banisch and Olbrich [22] analytically characterized sufficient conditions for the stability of bi-polarization with the consideration of the social feedback process. Comparing with previous models, their model highlighted an effective experience-based route to polarization. In 2019, Dong et al. [23] believed that while interacting with their views, interlocutors often hid their real preferences and expressed different preferences to different persons. Furthermore, by dividing the individual preferences into real preference, communication preference, and public preference, they studied the deceptive interaction and the preference evolution of heterogeneous trust in the network. In 2018, Navarro-Martinez et al. [24] incorporated the expected utility theory to build a model of the dynamic preference where the preferences selected by the decision-makers for each interaction were recorded and compared with the previous preferences. In 2018, Guevara et al. [25] measured the dynamic change of individual preference values during interaction by establishing a continuous opinion space. In 2010 and 2014, Cabrerizo et al. [26, 27] described a concept of a granular fuzzy preference relation and gave the influence of individual preference on decision results in a fuzzy group. In 2007, Herrera-Viedma et al. [28] studied the impact of information shortage for incomplete fuzzy preference relations. Pérez et al. [29] presented a novel model in 2016 that gathered the experts' initial opinions and provided a framework to represent the influence of a given expert over the other(s). With this proposal, it was feasible to estimate both the evolution of the group decision-making process and the final solution before carrying out the group discussion process and consequently foreseeing possible actions. In 2018, Gayle and Khorunzhina [30] put forward an extended model based on fuzzy consensus while evaluating resources. By this model, rational decisions could be made so as to reduce the impact of individual preference on evaluation accuracy. Barseghyan et al. [31] studied the family risk preferences through expectation utility theory in 2016. All these studies mentioned above are of great significance to the field of public opinion, but they mainly focus on qualitative analysis and lack quantitative modeling and analysis process, leading to shortages of intuitiveness and validity of the characterization of complex and changeable public opinion evolution.

To sum up, current research on the public opinion polarization mostly analyzes the causes of polarization by simulating the macro rule of the public opinion evolution, but rarely conducts more in-depth studies on the benefits of individual interaction and the social preferences held by individuals at the micro level. Actually, the interaction of micro individuals determines the emergence of macro groups. At present, studies on the applications of social preference theory to the phenomenon of public opinion polarization are still rare. During the public opinion evolution, individuals with different preferences will get different benefits, which will drive them to make different decisions while interacting with each other. However, the diverse interaction behaviors of these individuals ultimately lead to different public opinion polarization effects. In addition, in terms of individual interaction, the intimacy and friendliness of the participants must be considered. In general, individuals tend to interact with ones with similar views or close friendships, and their interaction yields will be higher. Therefore, this paper firstly introduces the concept of the intimacy as well as friendliness and then establishes individual revenue function. Subsequently, a new public opinion polarization model to explore opinion propagation rule is set up. In addition, according to the individual revenue function, a network structure considering node exit mechanism is built on the basis of a BA scale-free network [32] , which expands the static network in previous studies [33, 34] into the dynamic one, making it more realistic. Finally, the influences of different social preferences and individual revenue functions on the public opinion polarization effects are analyzed through simulation experiments, and a real case is also given to verify the practicability and effectiveness of the proposed model.

Based on the multi-agent method of Monte Carlo, we take individuals participating in interactions as agents [35] . Also, the network scale is set as N, meaning there are N Internet users (network nodes) in the network. Each individual's attitude value in the network is represented by a number in the continuous interval [−1,1], and his/her initial attitude value obeys the random value of a uniform distribution. The specific research framework is shown in Figure 1 :

For agent i, he/she will generate certain contentment if his/her view is affirmed when he/she interacts with other individuals in the network. The benefits brought by such contentment will prompt agent i to keep interacting with others. However, when agent i has a significantly different view with others, he/she will feel frustrated and create negative rewards due to being questioned. Based on this, the revenue generated by each interaction of agent i will vary with the views of its interlocutors. Assuming that at any moment, the total revenue generated by each interaction of agent i is U(i), which is composed of three parts, i.e., social mainstream revenue U s (i), viewpoint expression revenue U o (i), and individual interaction revenue U f (i). The corresponding equation can be expressed as follows.

where α, β, and γ are influence parameters, which represent the influence degree for agent i's social preference, neighboring preference, and self preference, respectively.

Although public opinion polarization usually evolves into the form of bi-polarization or single polarization, this paper mainly studies the bi-polarization phenomenon, that is, the emergence of two extreme views. When the bi-polarization phenomenon occurs, two opposite attitudes appear in the network, and they are totally against each other. Based on this, when measuring the social mainstream revenue of the network polarization phenomenon, it is not accurate to calculate the average attitude value of all individuals in the network. In this paper, the attitude values of the groups with positive and negative attitudes are firstly distinguished, and then the average attitude values of two different groups are calculated, respectively, namely, the average attitude value of individuals with negative attitude tendency XN and the average attitude value of individuals with positive attitude tendency XP.

If the individual attitude value xi in the network is uniformly distributed, then all xi∈[−1,1], individuals belonging to the interval [−1,0] are negative, while ones belonging to the interval (0,1] are positive. The calculation processes of the mean value of negative attitude X N and the mean

The calculation processes of the mean value of negative attitude X N and the mean value of positive attitude X P are as follows:

Individuals often want to be recognized by other individuals through interaction behaviors due to their sociality. When the attitude value of agent i is x i ∈ [−1,0], agent i feels a negative attitude and he/she is more likely to be recognized by individuals with the same negative attitudes, while ones with positive attitudes will repel his/her view. The specific calculation is shown in Figure 2 and described by Equation (4).

where ε is an influence parameter, referring to the degree of individual aversion to deviation from the mainstream view of the society. We can see from Figure 2 , when individual i takes a negative attitude, the attitude distance |X N − x i | between i and the mean negative attitude X N is within the interval [0,1], while the attitude distance |X P− x i | between i and the mean positive attitude X P is within the interval [1, 2] . At this point, the closer the attitude value of agent i and X N is, the more likely he/she will be affirmed by the individuals in the negative team. In other words, the smaller the value |X N -x i | is, the larger the revenue is and all are positive, representing that the growth trend of agent i is similar to that of the cosine function within the interval [0, π 2 ]. Also, the greater the difference between the attitude value of agent i and X P is, the more likely he/she will be opposed by individuals in the positive attitude group. That is, the larger the value |X P − x i | is, the smaller the revenue is and all are negative, representing that the growth trend is similar to that of the cosine function within [ π 2 , π].

When xi∈[0,1], agent i has a positive attitude, which is more likely to be recognized by individuals with positive attitudes and repelled by ones with negative attitudes, as shown in Figure  3 . The concrete calculation process is represented by Equation (5) .

Considering the only difference of the Equations (4) and (5) is the position of the parameter ε, we combine these two equations into one and add the conditions indicating which one will be used, as shown in Equation (6).

When individuals come into contact with some hot information, they desire to express their own opinions, which will promote interaction among individuals. The revenue is acquired due to the successful expression of individual opinions after interactions, which is defined as the viewpoint expression revenue U o in this paper. For individuals, if their attitudes are closer to an extreme value, their expression willingness will be stronger, and the benefits will also be higher. In this paper, the range of attitude value is defined as a number in the interval [−1,1]. Since the function y = |x| is a line with the Y-axis as the symmetry axis and grows on both sides of the X-axis, and it is similar to the revenue function of viewpoint expression defined in this paper;here we use Equation (7) to

While agent i is interacting with agent j, U f will be produced. On the one side, individual i gains more when interacting with familiar individuals than when interacting with unknown ones. On the other hand, individuals will benefit more from interacting with those who share similar opinions than those who do not. Based on this, the benefits obtained from the interaction between two individuals are related to the intimacy degree h ij as well as friendliness degree g ij , and the corresponding equation is as follows.

The detailed calculation processes of h ij , as well as g ij , are illustrated below.

The intimacy among individuals is used to represent the interconnections in a network. As shown in Figure 4 , humanoid nodes represent interactive individuals in a network and edges denote the connections among individuals.

The detailed calculation processes of hij, as well as gij, are illustrated below.

The intimacy among individuals is used to represent the interconnections in a network. As shown in Figure 4 , humanoid nodes represent interactive individuals in a network and edges denote the connections among individuals. Figure 4b ), indicating that these two individuals have interactions with agent i and agent j at the same time; that is, these two individuals are the mutual friends of agent i and agent j. In a social network, the phenomenon that ""friends of friends are your friends"" often occurs, and two individuals with more common friends tend to be closer than two ones with fewer common friends. Therefore, we assume that the intimacy between two individuals is positively correlated with the number of mutual friends. However, as shown in Figure 4c , since the number of individuals connected with agent j (see blue lines in Figure 4c ) is larger than that connected with agent i (green line), agent i and agent j have different intimacy degrees in spite of the same number of common friends between them. Assuming that the number of individuals connected to agent i in a network is Ni, and also, the number connected to agent j is Nij in Ni(Nij = Nji), then the intimacy degree of agent i and agent j, hij, is expressed as follows:

Notice that due to Ni ≠ N, we can find hij ≠ hj. In addition, for the sake of simple calculation, we also assume that all connections among individuals in a network are bidirectional ones. Only two individuals with direct connection need to calculate intimacy. If there is no direct connection, the intimacy is 0.

Due to the difference of attitude values between agent i and agent j, the revenues obtained from the interactions are also different. Individuals usually show more friendliness to people with similar opinions. It is close to the descending trend of cosine function in [0,π]; that is, the larger the attitude difference |xi-xj| is, the lower the degree of friendliness is. When the attitude difference value falls into a certain threshold, the friendliness degree is positive; when it reaches a threshold, the friendliness degree is negative, and it continues to decrease with the increase of attitude difference. We assume that the attitude value is within the interval [−1,1], so the attitude difference |xi − xj| is within the interval [0,2]. As a result, the multiplication coefficient 2 is introduced to restrict the range of the friendliness. In doing so, gij is defined as follows. Figure 4b ), indicating that these two individuals have interactions with agent i and agent j at the same time; that is, these two individuals are the mutual friends of agent i and agent j. In a social network, the phenomenon that ""friends of friends are your friends"" often occurs, and two individuals with more common friends tend to be closer than two ones with fewer common friends. Therefore, we assume that the intimacy between two individuals is positively correlated with the number of mutual friends. However, as shown in Figure 4c , since the number of individuals connected with agent j (see blue lines in Figure 4c ) is larger than that connected with agent i (green line), agent i and agent j have different intimacy degrees in spite of the same number of common friends between them. Assuming that the number of individuals connected to agent i in a network is N i , and also, the number connected to agent j is N ij in N i (N ij = N ji ), then the intimacy degree of agent i and agent j, h ij , is expressed as follows:

Notice that due to N i N, we can find h ij h j . In addition, for the sake of simple calculation, we also assume that all connections among individuals in a network are bidirectional ones. Only two individuals with direct connection need to calculate intimacy. If there is no direct connection, the intimacy is 0.

Due to the difference of attitude values between agent i and agent j, the revenues obtained from the interactions are also different. Individuals usually show more friendliness to people with similar opinions. It is close to the descending trend of cosine function in [0,π]; that is, the larger the attitude difference |x i − x j | is, the lower the degree of friendliness is. When the attitude difference value falls into a certain threshold, the friendliness degree is positive; when it reaches a threshold, the friendliness degree is negative, and it continues to decrease with the increase of attitude difference. We assume that the attitude value is within the interval [−1,1], so the attitude difference |x i − x j | is within the interval [0,2]. As a result, the multiplication coefficient π 2 is introduced to restrict the range of the friendliness. In doing so, g ij is defined as follows.

According to the above analysis, the total interaction revenue of agent i, U(i), can be expressed as follows:

Since each individual does not exist lonely in society, the revenues of individuals are related not only to themselves but also to others in many cases. When the total interaction revenue of individual i is a fixed value U(i), if he/she finds that the revenue of other individuals in the network is much lower or higher than U(i), recognition of individual i in the network are different in these two kinds of situations. Hence, there exists a weak correlation between the final revenue of individual i, U(i), and the revenue of interactive object, U(j). Nevertheless, individuals with different preferences have different recognition degrees. Social preference theory holds the view that individuals in the network can be roughly divided into three classes: individuals with an egoistic preference, who only care about their own income; individuals with an altruistic preference, who more concerned about other's gains; and individuals with a fair preference, who only focus on allocation fairness. Based on the social preference theory, the calculations of the individual interaction revenue and the intimacy degree are modified in the following subsections.

Based on social preference theory proposed by Fehr and Schmidt [5] , the revenue function of individuals with above three preferences is modified as follows:

(1) When individual i is with egoistic preference, he/she will care more about his/her own profit. Therefore, when the profit of individual i is less than that of individual j who interacts with him/her, he/she will reduce part of the revenue due to jealousy, and the influence degree related to their revenue difference |(U(j) − U(i))| is shown as follows:

(2) When individual i is with altruistic preference, he/she will care more about an interlocutor's benefit. Therefore, when the benefit of individual i is more than that of individual j who interacts with him/her, he/she will reduce part of the revenue due to sympathy. The equation is illustrated as

(3) When individual i is with fair preference, he/she will care more about allocation fairness. Therefore, when the benefit of individual i is more than that of individual j who interacts with him/her, he/she will reduce part of the revenue due to sympathy, and vice verse. The detailed calculation is shown in Equation (14)

where ϕ, ω are influence parameters, respectively, indicating the degrees of reduced revenue of individual i affected by individual j.

In a network, netizens form connections through mutual attention, and thus build a virtual network. However, there are significant differences between online and offline social methods. First of all, the connections among individuals in a network are extremely unstable and the degree of intimacy between two individuals will be related to the benefits of their interaction. When an individual i interacts with j in a network, if the revenue he/she obtains is very small, then at the next moment, individual i will not want to interact with j anymore. Specifically, if the interaction intention of i to j is reduced, the intimacy of i to j will also be reduced. We believe that there exists a positive correlation between willingness to interact and intimacy. Secondly, due to the existence of heterogeneous preference individuals in a network, these individuals will present different manifestations when interacting shown in Figure 5 . individual i interacts with j in a network, if the revenue he/she obtains is very small, then at the next moment, individual i will not want to interact with j anymore. Specifically, if the interaction intention of i to j is reduced, the intimacy of i to j will also be reduced. We believe that there exists a positive correlation between willingness to interact and intimacy. Secondly, due to the existence of heterogeneous preference individuals in a network, these individuals will present different manifestations when interacting shown in Figure 5 . In Figure 5 , humanoid nodes represent interactive individuals in a network, where the gray nodes represent individuals with fair preference, the blue represent ones with egoistic preference, and the orange represent those with altruistic preference. In addition, serial numbers are used to represent different preferences, where ""①"" indicates interactions among individuals with fair preference, ""④""describes interactions among individuals with egoistic preference, ""⑨""represents interactions among individuals with altruistic preference, ""②"" and ""⑥"" represent interactions between individuals with fair preference and ones with altruistic preference, ""③"" and ""⑤""denote interactions between individuals with fair preference and ones with egoistic preference, ""⑦"" and "" ⑧"" indicate interactions between the individuals with egoistic preference and ones with altruistic preference. The red flag next to the humanoid node in Figure 5 indicates that the individual gains more by interacting than interlocutor. For example, in the interaction between agent a and agent b, there is a red flag on the side of agent a, denoting that the revenue of agent a is greater than that of agent b. Therefore, Figure 5 indicates that the quantitative relationships derived by comparing revenue with respect to individual interactions are as follows:

In addition, as shown in Figures 6 and 7 , agents a and b with fair preferences reduce their interaction intentions only when a big revenue gap is found between them, so their intimacy degrees are not easily changed. Whereas, when agent c interacts agent d with egoistic preference, since the benefit of agent c is greater than that of d, he/she will increase the willingness to interact with agent d again, and the intimacy degree hcd will be also improved. Conversely, agent d will reduce its willingness to interact with agent c again because his/her revenue is not as large as agent c, resulting in a decrement of intimacy degree hdc. Furthermore, the changes of intimacy degree between agent e and agent f with altruistic preferences are completely opposite to individuals with egoistic preferences. When the revenue of agent e with altruistic preference is less than that of interactive object f, the interaction intention of agent e with agent f will increase, rising intimacy degree hef.

However, agent f with altruistic preference reduces its intimacy degree with agent e because his/her own revenue is greater than agent e. After several interactions, if the intimacy degrees drop to 0 between the two interactive agents, the connection between them will be disconnected and no interaction will be conducted. In Figure 6 , the icons of crying face, smiling face and expressionless face indicate the increment, decrease and invariability of interaction intention, respectively. In In Figure 5 , humanoid nodes represent interactive individuals in a network, where the gray nodes represent individuals with fair preference, the blue represent ones with egoistic preference, and the orange represent those with altruistic preference. In addition, serial numbers are used to represent different preferences, where "" 1 "" indicates interactions among individuals with fair preference, "" 4 ""describes interactions among individuals with egoistic preference, "" 9 ""represents interactions among individuals with altruistic preference, "" 2 "" and "" 6 "" represent interactions between individuals with fair preference and ones with altruistic preference, "" 3 "" and "" 5 ""denote interactions between individuals with fair preference and ones with egoistic preference, "" 7 "" and "" 8 "" indicate interactions between the individuals with egoistic preference and ones with altruistic preference. The red flag next to the humanoid node in Figure 5 indicates that the individual gains more by interacting than interlocutor. For example, in the interaction between agent a and agent b, there is a red flag on the side of agent a, denoting that the revenue of agent a is greater than that of agent b. Therefore, Figure 5 indicates that the quantitative relationships derived by comparing revenue with respect to individual interactions are as follows:

In addition, as shown in Figures 6 and 7 , agents a and b with fair preferences reduce their interaction intentions only when a big revenue gap is found between them, so their intimacy degrees are not easily changed. Whereas, when agent c interacts agent d with egoistic preference, since the benefit of agent c is greater than that of d, he/she will increase the willingness to interact with agent d again, and the intimacy degree h cd will be also improved. Conversely, agent d will reduce its willingness to interact with agent c again because his/her revenue is not as large as agent c, resulting in a decrement of intimacy degree h dc . Furthermore, the changes of intimacy degree between agent e and agent f with altruistic preferences are completely opposite to individuals with egoistic preferences. When the revenue of agent e with altruistic preference is less than that of interactive object f, the interaction intention of agent e with agent f will increase, rising intimacy degree h ef . However, agent f with altruistic preference reduces its intimacy degree with agent e because his/her own revenue is greater than agent e. After several interactions, if the intimacy degrees drop to 0 between the two interactive agents, the connection between them will be disconnected and no interaction will be conducted. In Figure 6 , the icons of crying face, smiling face and expressionless face indicate the increment, decrease and invariability of interaction intention, respectively. In Figure 7 , the solid red arrow, the dotted green arrow and the solid black arrow indicate the increment, decrease, and invariability of intimacy increases, respectively. Figure 7 , the solid red arrow, the dotted green arrow and the solid black arrow indicate the increment, decrease, and invariability of intimacy increases, respectively. Through the above analysis, the intimacy function is modified as follows.

(1) Case 1, agent i with egoistic preference: the intimacy degree of agent i to agent j at time t + 1 is related to their previous intimacy degree and the revenue difference |(U(j) − U(i))| at time t. If the revenue of agent i at time t is less than agent j, the intimacy degree of agent i to agent j will be reduced due to jealousy, and vice versa, as shown below:

(2) Case 2, agent i with altruistic preference: the intimacy degree of agent i to agent j at time t + 1 is related to their previous intimacy degree and the revenue difference |(U(j) − U(i))| at time t. If the revenue of agent i at time t is more than agent j, the intimacy degree of agent i to agent j will be increased due to sympathy, and vice versa, as shown below:

(3) Case 3, agent i with fair preference: the intimacy degree of agent i to agent j at time t + 1 is related to allocation fairness. If revenue difference |(U(j)− U(i))| at time t is large, intimacy degree of agent i to agent j will be reduced, as shown below: Through the above analysis, the intimacy function is modified as follows.

where m is a threshold, indicating the maximum acceptable revenue difference of agent i with an interlocutor. In a sudden hot event diffusion process, individuals judge whether they can obtain certain revenue through interactive behaviors at the initial moment, so as to promote the continuation of interactive behaviors. With the changes in public opinion in the network, the interactive benefit of individuals will also change. When the individual revenue is negative, there will no longer be the driving force for interaction, and thus he/she will not focus on the hot event. Specifically, at the next moment, the individual will not interact with other individuals and become an isolated one in a network. The specific evolution steps of the whole interaction process are as follows:

Step 1: Build the initial network. The number of the initial network nodes is m 0 , and the nodes are connected randomly.

Step 2: Determine the growth mode of network nodes. m nodes are added to the network each time, connecting m 0 nodes in the initial network. In other words, m edges are added each time, and the connection probability of the nodes in the initial network is positively correlated with the original node degree.

Step 3: Repeat the above operations until the number of nodes in the network increases to N, and the network diagram is undirected.

Step 4: Randomly select agent i and agent j to interact.

Step 5: Calculate U i and U j according to Equation (11) .

Step 6: Compute revenue of agent i with different social preferences based on Equations (12)-(14).

Step 7: Renew intimacy function h ij of agent i to agent j.

Step 8: Judge whether the cumulative revenue of agent i in the network is greater than 0. If the revenue is greater than 0, the interaction will continue. If not, all connections of agent i in the network will be disconnected, making him/her be an isolated node.

Step 9: Repeat Steps 4-8 until the end of evolution. The specific simulation process of this paper is shown in Figure 8 :

Step 5: Calculate Ui and Uj according to Equation (11) .

Step 6: Compute revenue of agent i with different social preferences based on Equations (12)- (14) .

Step 7: Renew intimacy function hij of agent i to agent j.

Step 8: Judge whether the cumulative revenue of agent i in the network is greater than 0. If the revenue is greater than 0, the interaction will continue. If not, all connections of agent i in the network will be disconnected, making him/her be an isolated node.

This section analyzes the influences of different social preferences and individual benefits on public opinion polarization effects.

This section conducts numerical simulation experiments to study the influences of individuals with three different preferences on the public opinion polarization effects. The network is constructed by extended BA scale-free network [32] , and other simulation parameters are as follows: N = 500, ϕ = 0.5, ω = 0.5, α = 0.32, β = 0.6, γ = 0.05. The specific network characteristic structure is shown in Table 1 . Figure 9 is a mottled diagram of the intimacy of all nodes in the network at the initial moment according to Equation (9) , and the specific calculation results are shown in Equation (18) . Figures 10  and 11 respectively represent attitudes of individuals and distributions of intimacy degree after the occurrence of opinion polarization phenomenon, when considering four different situations, i.e., all individuals with the same fair preferences, individuals with the same egoistic preferences, individuals with the same altruistic preferences, and individuals with mixed preferences where each preference accounts for 1/3. In Figure 10 , a three-dimensional bar chart is shown, where the xand y-axes represent the distributions of interaction time and attitude values, respectively, and the z-axis represents the proportion of individuals in different attitude intervals at different times. In Figure 11 , the concrete intimacy degree values are also shown in the right color bar of this figure. In this simulation, when time is 6, the public opinion polarization phenomenon appears. This is because attitudes of all individuals in the network do not change at time = 6, and the vast majority of individual attitudes are in extreme values (i.e., |x i | > 0.9). 

From Figure 9 and Equation (18), in the network with the number of nodes N setting as 10, there are at most (10−1) 2 = 81 edges except for himself/herself, and each edge corresponds to an intimacy value. For example, in Equation (18), the intimacy value at the matrix element h(1,2) is 0.5, indicating that the intimacy degree between agent 1 and agent 2, h 12 , is 0.5. In Figure 9 , the color in the grid of the first row and the second column represents 0.5. If the value at element (i, j) in the matrix is 0, it means that agent i and agent j are not connected. At this point, the color of the grid in Figure 9 appears dark blue. Notice that all h(i,i) in the matrix's diagonal line are meaningless and thus are represented by 0.

In addition, from the intimacy distributions in Figure 11 , when time = 6, there are great differences in the intimacy degrees among these three preference networks, wherein the altruistic preference network, the intimacy degrees are greater than those in the fair preference network, and the intimacy degrees in the fair preference network are greater than those in the egoistic preference network. Based on this, individuals with altruistic preferences have a greater willingness to interact in the network, and this willingness will be further increased after multiple interactions, which manifests the improvement of intimacy degrees. In contrast, individuals with egoistic preferences tend to reduce their willingness to interact after multiple interactions, which shows the reduction of intimacy degrees. Moreover, individuals with fair preferences fall somewhere in between. However, it can be seen from Figures 10 and 12 that the polarization percentage (i.e., the proportion of the number of individuals of |x i | > 0.9 to all individuals) in the network composed of individuals with fair preference is the highest, followed by altruistic preference, mixed preference, and egoistic preference in descending order. preferences where each preference accounts for 1/3. In Figure 10 , a three-dimensional bar chart is shown, where the x-and y-axes represent the distributions of interaction time and attitude values, respectively, and the z-axis represents the proportion of individuals in different attitude intervals at different times. In Figure 11 , the concrete intimacy degree values are also shown in the right color bar of this figure. In this simulation, when time is 6, the public opinion polarization phenomenon appears. This is because attitudes of all individuals in the network do not change at time = 6, and the vast majority of individual attitudes are in extreme values (i.e., |xi| > 0.9). From Figure 9 and Equation (18), in the network with the number of nodes N setting as 10, there are at most (10−1) 2 = 81 edges except for himself/herself, and each edge corresponds to an intimacy value. For example, in Equation (18), the intimacy value at the matrix element h(1,2) is 0.5, indicating that the intimacy degree between agent 1 and agent 2, h12, is 0.5. In Figure 9 , the color in the grid of the first row and the second column represents 0.5. If the value at element (i, j) in the matrix is 0, it means that agent i and agent j are not connected. At this point, the color of the grid in Figure 9 In addition, from the intimacy distributions in Figure 11 , when time = 6, there are great differences in the intimacy degrees among these three preference networks, wherein the altruistic preference network, the intimacy degrees are greater than those in the fair preference network, and the intimacy degrees in the fair preference network are greater than those in the egoistic preference network. Based on this, individuals with altruistic preferences have a greater willingness to interact in the network, and this willingness will be further increased after multiple interactions, which manifests the improvement of intimacy degrees. In contrast, individuals with egoistic preferences tend to reduce their willingness to interact after multiple interactions, which shows the reduction of intimacy degrees. Moreover, individuals with fair preferences fall somewhere in between. However, it can be seen from Figures 10 and 12 that the polarization percentage (i.e., the proportion of the number of individuals of |xi| > 0.9 to all individuals) in the network composed of individuals with fair preference is the highest, followed by altruistic preference, mixed preference, and egoistic preference in descending order. Besides, in order to further study the influences of different social preferences on the effects of In addition, from the intimacy distributions in Figure 11 , when time = 6, there are great differences in the intimacy degrees among these three preference networks, wherein the altruistic preference network, the intimacy degrees are greater than those in the fair preference network, and the intimacy degrees in the fair preference network are greater than those in the egoistic preference network. Based on this, individuals with altruistic preferences have a greater willingness to interact in the network, and this willingness will be further increased after multiple interactions, which manifests the improvement of intimacy degrees. In contrast, individuals with egoistic preferences tend to reduce their willingness to interact after multiple interactions, which shows the reduction of intimacy degrees. Moreover, individuals with fair preferences fall somewhere in between. However, it can be seen from Figures 10 and 12 that the polarization percentage (i.e., the proportion of the number of individuals of |xi| > 0.9 to all individuals) in the network composed of individuals with fair preference is the highest, followed by altruistic preference, mixed preference, and egoistic preference in descending order. Besides, in order to further study the influences of different social preferences on the effects of public opinion polarization, the proportions of individuals with three different preferences were set to 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 100% (the rest of the individuals are assumed to be without any preference). Analysis and discussion are focused on the setting of other parameters unchanged. The results are shown in Figure 13 . Besides, in order to further study the influences of different social preferences on the effects of public opinion polarization, the proportions of individuals with three different preferences were set to 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 100% (the rest of the individuals are assumed to be without any preference). Analysis and discussion are focused on the setting of other parameters unchanged. The results are shown in Figure 13 .

As shown in Figure 13 , as the proportion of individuals with egoistic preference and altruistic preference in the network increases, the polarization percentage in the network decreases. In contrast, with the increase of the proportion of individuals with fair preference, the polarization percentage hardly changed. As shown in Figure 13 , as the proportion of individuals with egoistic preference and altruistic preference in the network increases, the polarization percentage in the network decreases. In contrast, with the increase of the proportion of individuals with fair preference, the polarization percentage hardly changed.

In order to understand the influences of different preference proportions on the polarization, the BA network is simulated for 100 times, and each test randomly generates different individual preference ratio and combines into different social networks (for example, setting egoistic preference accounting for 31%, altruistic preferences accounting for 33%, fair preference for 36% is one of the experiments) to calculate the polarization shown in Figure 14 . Each scatter plot in this figure represents one simulation result, where the x-, y-, and z-axes denote the proportion of fair, egoistic, and altruistic preferences, respectively. The color of the scatter represents the polarizability, where the lighter the color is, the higher the polarizability, and vice verse. The results are shown in the color bar on the right in Figure 14 . In order to understand the influences of different preference proportions on the polarization, the BA network is simulated for 100 times, and each test randomly generates different individual preference ratio and combines into different social networks (for example, setting egoistic preference accounting for 31%, altruistic preferences accounting for 33%, fair preference for 36% is one of the experiments) to calculate the polarization shown in Figure 14 .

The color of the scatter represents the polarizability, where the lighter the color is, the higher the polarizability, and vice verse. The results are shown in the color bar on the right in Figure 14 . Also, from Figure 14 , since the sum of the proportions of three different preferences in the network equals to 1, the scattered points in this figure are all distributed in the same triangular section. The three vertices of the triangle represent the network polarization effects when only one social preference in the network exists. These three vertices show dark color, representing low polarizability, while the light color in the middle points indicates high polarizability. Simulation results show that opinion polarization is low when there is only one social preference in the network. In addition, the change trend of polarizability shown in Figure 14 is slightly different from that in Figure 13 . This is because, in Figure 13 , when analyzing the influences of the proportion of individuals with different preferences on the public opinion polarization effects, other individuals are treated as ones without preferences, that is, revenue is not adjusted according to their preferences. In the three-dimensional diagram shown in Figure 14 , if the proportion of individuals with one preference increases, the proportion of individuals with other preferences decreases accordingly so that the sum of the three equals to 1.

For example, in real life, the main distributor of household goods ""IKEA Group Corporate"" stores often witnesses people who sit or lie down in the store exhibition area, which has been criticized by netizens. On 22 August 2019, these uncivilized behaviors caused heated discussions on the Sina blog. According to the statistics, until 25 August 2019, a total of 422,000 netizens participated in the event to vote, and the results were shown in Figure 15 .

On 22 August 2019, these uncivilized behaviors caused heated discussions on the Sina blog. According to the statistics, until 25 August 2019, a total of 422,000 netizens participated in the event to vote, and the results were shown in Figure 15 . Figure 15 demonstrates that although most netizens who participated in the voting thought that they should not have too much rest in IKEA, they preferred to view problems from their own perspectives. However, 15% of netizens still thought this kind of behavior was not a problem, and they preferred to view the problem from the perspective of customers,while 32% of netizens were concerned about whether IKEA's owner would lose money, preferring to view from the seller's perspective. Others were worried that more people would lie down later. Thus,we can see that there are heterogeneous individuals in the network whose preferences are different. However, these individuals with different preferences widely exist in the network, and they may have different views on the same thing, which has a significant influence on the network polarization phenomenon.

The different preferences of individuals can affect the interaction revenue between individuals in the network, thus indirectly influencing the intention of the next interaction between them. Firstly, when the benefit of the interaction between individual i and j is always negative, then after several interactions, individual i will no longer be willing to interact with j. At this moment, the connection between individuals i and j is broken in the social network. Secondly, except for the individual j, individual i will also interact with other individuals in the network and obtain benefits from them. However, if the total gain obtained by individual i in interacting with these individuals is negative, then at the next moment, individual i will no longer be willing to participate in the interaction and express his/her own views. In the network, individual i is shown as i being Figure 15 demonstrates that although most netizens who participated in the voting thought that they should not have too much rest in IKEA, they preferred to view problems from their own perspectives. However, 15% of netizens still thought this kind of behavior was not a problem, and they preferred to view the problem from the perspective of customers, while 32% of netizens were concerned about whether IKEA's owner would lose money, preferring to view from the seller's perspective. Others were worried that more people would lie down later. Thus, we can see that there are heterogeneous individuals in the network whose preferences are different. However, these individuals with different preferences widely exist in the network, and they may have different views on the same thing, which has a significant influence on the network polarization phenomenon.

The different preferences of individuals can affect the interaction revenue between individuals in the network, thus indirectly influencing the intention of the next interaction between them. Firstly, when the benefit of the interaction between individual i and j is always negative, then after several interactions, individual i will no longer be willing to interact with j.

However, if the total gain obtained by individual i in interacting with these individuals is negative, then at the next moment, individual i will no longer be willing to participate in the interaction and express his/her own views. In the network, individual i is shown as i being completely disconnected from all nodes and becoming an isolated one, thus exiting the propagation process of the hot event. As a result, the different preferences of individuals can act on the network structure by influencing the benefits of individuals. Also, the network structure will also have an important impact on public opinion polarization, and the network with high aggregation will help increase the interaction frequency of individuals, thus affecting public opinion polarization. This section compares connections at the initial moment and the moment after the emergence of public opinion polarization (time = 10). The results are shown in Figures 16-19 , where Figure 16 is the histogram of attitude distribution frequency in the network at the initial moment as well as time = 10, respectively, and Figure 17 shows the connections of network nodes at the two different moments. In order to better illustrate the specific meaning of Figure 17 , a diagram of connections among nodes (N = 20) is drawn and shown in Figure 18 . The network used in the experiment is the BA network; the network aggregation is 0.320, N = 500, and the remaining parameters are ϕ = 0.1, ω = 0.1, α = 0.35, β = 0.35, γ = 0.2. Each of the three preferences contributes 1/3 and they are mixed in the network.

Each of the three preferences contributes 1/3 and they are mixed in the network. From Figure 16 , the attitude values of all individuals xi ~ U (−1,1) in the network at the initial moment are evenly distributed, while at time = 10, there is an obvious polarization, and the attitude values of most individuals are at the extremes of +1 and −1. Figure 17 shows the connections of network nodes at the initial time and time = 10. As shown in Figures 17 and 18 , three kinds of scatter points represent individuals with different preferences in the network: the grays catter points represent individuals with fair preference, the blue ones represent individuals with egoistic include five colors, i.e., green, yellow, orange, red, and purple. Since the attitude values are evenly distributed in the interval [−1,1] at the initial moment, the attitude distance between two individuals is relatively small, and |xi − xj| > 1.6 is less likely to occur. After the polarization phenomenon occurs, as shown in Figure 17b , the attitude values of all individuals in the network change significantly, and most individuals show green and purple lines, representing the two extremes of the attitude distances between adjacent individuals |xi − xj| < 0.4 or |xi − xj| > 2.0. In addition, Figure 19 shows the connections and distribution of three different preferences in the network after the occurrence of public opinion polarization phenomenon, in which the lines and scatter points are represented in the same way as shown in Figure 17 , that is, the scatter points of three different colors represent the individuals with different preferences, and the lines of different colors represent the different attitude distances among neighboring individuals. From the vertical comparisons in Figure 19 , we can see that the connections among individuals with fair preference and altruistic preference change little in the network, while the connections among individuals with egoistic preference almost completely break. The horizontal comparisons in Figure 19 show that individuals with different preferences are more likely to interact. Figure 19a ,d,g represents the interactions among individuals with the same preference, respectively. At this point, the attitude distance among individuals with the same preference almost only has two extreme values, |xi − xj| < 0.4 or |xi − xj| > 2.0. In contrast, the interactions among individuals with different preferences represented in Figure 19b ,e,h appear more connections of intermediate attitude distances, which illustrates that after the emergence of public opinion polarization, the existence of more differentiated individuals is easier to stabilize the network. Moreover, Figure 19c ,f,i shows the degree distribution of individuals with different preferences, in which the network degree distribution of egoistic individuals is significantly smaller than that of the other two preferences, while the difference between fair preference and altruistic preference is not obvious.

From Figure 16 , the attitude values of all individuals x i~U (−1,1) in the network at the initial moment are evenly distributed, while at time = 10, there is an obvious polarization, and the attitude values of most individuals are at the extremes of +1 and −1. Figure 17 shows the connections of network nodes at the initial time and time = 10. As shown in Figures 17 and 18 , three kinds of scatter points represent individuals with different preferences in the network: the grays catter points represent individuals with fair preference, the blue ones represent individuals with egoistic preference, and the orange ones represent individuals with altruistic preference. In these two figures, the lines represent the connection relationships among the scattered points. If there is a line between two scattered points, they are neighbors and can interact with each other, where the lines include five colors, i.e., green, yellow, orange, red, and purple. Since the attitude values are evenly distributed in the interval [−1,1] at the initial moment, the attitude distance between two individuals is relatively small, and |x i − x j | > 1.6 is less likely to occur. After the polarization phenomenon occurs, as shown in Figure 17b , the attitude values of all individuals in the network change significantly, and most individuals show green and purple lines, representing the two extremes of the attitude distances between adjacent individuals |x i − x j | < 0.4 or |x i − x j | > 2.0.

In addition, Figure 19 shows the connections and distribution of three different preferences in the network after the occurrence of public opinion polarization phenomenon, in which the lines and scatter points are represented in the same way as shown in Figure 17 , that is, the scatter points of three different colors represent the individuals with different preferences, and the lines of different colors represent the different attitude distances among neighboring individuals.

The horizontal comparisons in Figure 19 show that individuals with different preferences are more likely to interact. Figure 19a ,d,g represents the interactions among individuals with the same preference, respectively. At this point, the attitude distance among individuals with the same preference almost only has two extreme values, |x i − x j | < 0.4 or |x i − x j | > 2.0. In contrast, the interactions among individuals with different preferences represented in Figure 19b ,e,h appear more connections of intermediate attitude distances, which illustrates that after the emergence of public opinion polarization, the existence of more differentiated individuals is easier to stabilize the network. Moreover, Figure 19c ,f,i shows the degree distribution of individuals with different preferences, in which the network degree distribution of egoistic individuals is significantly smaller than that of the other two preferences, while the difference between fair preference and altruistic preference is not obvious.

In Section 3, the revenue of individuals is divided into three parts: social mainstream revenue U s , viewpoint expression revenue U o , and individual interaction revenue U f . At the initial moment, after perceiving the information, individual viewpoint expression revenue U o will lead to generating a willingness to communicate, which drives the individual to keep interaction at the next moment. However, depending on the attitude distance among the interlocutors, U f will encourage each other due to the similarity of views, or argue with each other due to the repulsion of views, thus producing both positive and negative benefits to the interlocutors. Similarly, when calculating the mainstream income, U s , individuals will also generate negative revenue because they deviate from the mainstream view of the society. Therefore, if the revenue of each interaction is negative, the individual will tend to adjust his/her attitude to change the revenue he/she obtained, or he/she may lose interest in the event due to the negative revenue after adjusting his/her attitude, thus completely leaving the network. Hence, to analyze the public opinion polarization phenomenon, it is necessary to consider the change of individual profit in the network and the number of exit network nodes.

This section uses a BA network consisting of 600 nodes, in which each of the three different preferences accounts for 1/3 (i.e., each is 200) and is evenly distributed. The revenue differences between the three preferences in the network are observed in the experiment. Figure 20a ,c,e shows the three-dimensional graph of individual revenue with changes over time, in which the x-axis represents the interaction time, the y-axis represents the number of the interaction individuals in the network, and the z-axis represents the revenue growths of individuals through interactive behaviors at different times. Figure 20b ,d,f describes that the number of individuals with three different preferences that exit the viewpoint interaction and become isolated ones due to negative revenue changes over time.

We can see from Figure 20 , individuals with altruistic preference gain the most through interactions. Individuals with fair preference becoming isolated ones are the least. In addition, the revenue of individuals with egoistic preference fluctuates greatly at the initial moment, and many individuals have negative revenue, so the probability of becoming isolated nodes is the highest. Through experiments, it is easy to find that individual revenue is continuously growing in the network. Most of the individuals in the network gain the benefits and also increase their revenue by adjusting their interactive strategies, which improves interaction willingness and leads to the emergence of several mainstream opinion groups. the three-dimensional graph of individual revenue with changes over time, in which the x-axis represents the interaction time, the y-axis represents the number of the interaction individuals in the network, and the z-axis represents the revenue growths of individuals through interactive behaviors at different times. Figure 20b ,d,f describes that the number of individuals with three different preferences that exit the viewpoint interaction and become isolated ones due to negative revenue changes over time. emergence of several mainstream opinion groups.

Since the total individual revenue is composed of Uo, Us, and Uf, in order to analyze the influences of revenue on the polarization effect, we assume that there only exists one part of revenue in the network and observe the evolution of public opinion. Figure 21a ,d,g represents changes in individual revenue only considering Uo, Us, or Uf in the network over time, respectively. Figure  21b ,e,h describes the growths of isolated individuals in the network over time. Figure 21c ,f,i denotes the growths of the polarizability in the network over time. From Figure 21a -c, when individuals only gain benefits through social recognition, the benefits are relatively large at the initial time. However, with the further evolution of public opinion, polarization gradually emerges, and the growth trend of revenue begins to slow down. Moreover, when the revenue decreases, the number of isolated individuals exiting interactive behaviors starts to increase.

In Figure 21d -f, when individuals can only benefit from the interaction, due to dispersion of views at the initial time, it is very difficult for them to find like-minded individuals to interact, so the profit is very low, making individuals unwilling to interact once again. Thus, the number of isolated individuals grows fast at the initial time.However, when time = 4, almost 85% of individuals are out of the communication of events, and at the same time, due to the weak interaction willingness, it is hard for the polarization phenomenonto appear. As can be seen from Figure 21g -i, when individuals can only get benefits by expressing their own opinions, they have strong desires to interact with each other, so the number of isolated individuals grows slowly. Most individuals are willing to express their own opinions in the network, so polarization is more likely to occur.

The social preferences of individuals discussed in Sections 4.1-4.3 are fixed, but in reality, they will change continuously with the interaction. Individuals with an egoistic preference at the beginning may hold the fair or altruistic preference in the later stage, while those who hold an altruistic preference may also change to the egoistic or fair preference later. Based on this, we assume that social preferences have dynamic variability and define rules as follows. When the revenue of the individual in the network is greater than the threshold d 1 , his/her preference will turn into altruistic preference. When the revenue of the individual in the network is less than the threshold d 2 , his/her preference will turn into egoistic preference. Similarly, when the revenue of the individual in the network is between the middle, his/her preference will convert into fair preference. The results are shown in Figures 22-24 . Figure 22 is three-dimensional histogram of individual attitude distributions. Figure 23 is line chart of polarization proportion with changes over time. Figure 24 is line chart of individual proportion with three different preferences changing over time.

Figure 22 is three-dimensional histogram of individual attitude distributions. Figure 23 is line chart of polarization proportion with changes over time. Figure 24 is line chart of individual proportion with three different preferences changing over time. It can be seen from Figures 22 and 23 that, compared with the situation of fixed preferences, when the social preferences change dynamically, the individual polarization proportion will be larger. However, in Figure 24 , at the initial moment of the public opinion evolution, almost all individuals with different preferences are converted into ones with fair preference, but this period is very short, and then individuals with fair preference gradually are changed into holding other preferences. When time = 6, the preferences of individuals in the network will no longer change and reach stability. At this point, compared with the initial moment, the number of individuals with egoistic preference increases sharply, the number of individuals with fair preference decreases significantly, and the number of individuals with altruistic preference does not decrease significantly.

In this section, the case of ""Internet red beating pregnant women"" is taken as an example to verify the model established in this paper. On 9 September 2018, a blogger with the microblog number of ""Baytt"" released a microblog as the victim, claiming that she had been pregnant for 32 weeks. When she went out, she met another Internet red named ""Saya"" walking with her dog. Because Saya's dog rushed at her, she was unilaterally beaten due to their quarrel. The microblog spread in the network after being forwarded by official media such as ""Headline News"" and ""pear video"", and quickly reached network opinion polarization. Almost everyone began to blame ""Saya"". But soon after, as ""Saya"" apologized and explained her actions, more truth emerged.

The microblog spread in the network after being forwarded by official media such as ""Headline News"" and ""pear video"", and quickly reached network opinion polarization. Almost everyone began to blame ""Saya"". But soon after, as ""Saya"" apologized and explained her actions, more truth emerged. Netizens found that the truth of the incident was that the pregnant woman and her husband beat ""Saya"" first after the quarrel, while ""Saya"" did not beat the pregnant woman. At this time, public opinion began to reverse. Many netizens turned to support ""Saya"" and accused the pregnant woman, but some netizens still supported the pregnant woman.

The incident of ""Internet red beating pregnant women"" attracted the attention of microblog bloggers ""Headline News"", which has 68 million fans. ""Headline news"" released three microblogs about the incident on 12 September 2018 08:26 h, (the data collected can be found in the following link: https://weibo.com/breakingnews?is_all=1&is_search=1&key_word=%E7%BD%91%E7%BA%A2% E6%AE%B4%E6%89%93%E5%AD%95%E5%A6%87#1579968622052), 15 October 2018 07:57 h (the data collected can be found in the following link: https://weibo.com/breakingnews?is_all=1&is_search= 1&key_word=%E7%BD%91%E7%BA%A2%E6%AE%B4%E6%89%93%E5%AD%95%E5%A6%87# 1579968662315), and 19 October 2018 09:33 h (the data collected can be found in the following link: https://weibo.com/breakingnews?is_all=1&is_search=1&key_word=%E7%BD%91%E7%BA%A2% E6%AE%B4%E6%89%93%E5%AD%95%E5%A6%87#1579968683067), respectively. These microblogs are widely focused, with more than 10,000 comments per microblog.Therefore, in order to accurately restore the public opinion development process of the ""Internet red beating pregnant women"" incident, we separated the comments under these three microblogs of ""headline news"" and analyze them. Through the emotional orientation [36] in the comments, we roughly divided the comments we have separated into three categories: those who support pregnant women, those who support the internet red, and those who maintain neutrality, as shown in Figure 25 : are widely focused, with more than 10,000 comments per microblog.Therefore, in order to accurately restore the public opinion development process of the ""Internet red beating pregnant women"" incident, we separated the comments under these three microblogs of ""headline news"" and analyze them. Through the emotional orientation [36] in the comments, we roughly divided the comments we have separated into three categories: those who support pregnant women, those who support the internet red, and those who maintain neutrality, as shown in Figure 25 : As can be seen from Figure 25 , in the first microblog, almost all netizens unilaterally supported the pregnant woman and criticized Internet red Saya's behavior. However, in the second microblog released on 15 October, some neutral individuals appeared, and even a small number of netizens turned to support ""Saya"". In the post published on 19 October, a large number of individuals supported ""Saya"" or remained neutral, while the proportion of individuals still supporting the pregnant women dropped to 11%. It can be seen that the hot event showed a reversal of public opinion.

However, it is worth noting that Internet users have obvious preferences in the public opinion communication of the network hot event. Because many netizens prefer to support the weak, when the information is not clear at the beginning, almost all of them supported pregnant women one way. However, with the truth gradually revealed, there were many individuals who still maintained their preferences and did not change their views. Therefore, we simulate the event using the public opinion polarization model which considers individual heterogeneity preference and compares the macro polarization model in [14] . The parameters we used in the simulation are as follows: α = 0.15, β = 0.8, γ = 0.05, the network is a BA scale-free network with clustering C = 0.324. The results are shown in Figure 26 . As can be seen from Figure 25 , in the first microblog, almost all netizens unilaterally supported the pregnant woman and criticized Internet red Saya's behavior. However, in the second microblog released on 15 October, some neutral individuals appeared, and even a small number of netizens turned to support ""Saya"". In the post published on 19 October, a large number of individuals supported ""Saya"" or remained neutral, while the proportion of individuals still supporting the pregnant women dropped to 11%.

The parameters we used in the simulation are as follows: α = 0.15, β = 0.8, γ = 0.05, the network is a BA scale-free network with clustering C = 0.324. The results are shown in Figure 26 . From Figure 26a , we can see that at the initial time, almost all individual attitudes are positive, that is, they support the pregnant woman's viewpoint, but with the evolution of public opinion, some individuals' attitudes begin to shift to neutrality. Finally, when time = 18, their attitudes change again, and most of the individual attitudes turn negative, that is, they support ""Saya"", which is roughly consistent with the trend shown in Figure 25 . At the same time, as shown in Figure 26b , we use the macro model proposed in [14] to simulate and get simulation results. Comparing these two figures, we can see that the evolutionary trends of these two are basically the same. Whereas, the model considering individual heterogeneity preference can polarize public opinion more quickly than the one proposed in [14] , the reason may be that, in such a typical case as ""Internet red beating pregnant women"", individuals have obvious preferences which make individuals with the same preference form similar viewpoints. For example, at the beginning of this incident, a very large percentage of people prefer to support the weak. After that, with the disclosure of information, most individuals hold fairness preference and supported Internet red. As the result, in the evolution of public opinion, the opinion polarization phenomenon can occur quickly, which is roughly consistent with the model proposed in this paper. However, the model proposed in [14] considers the dynamic conformity of individuals, which make individuals have a relatively low tendency to conform to the crowd. Therefore, more interactions are needed to eventually form opinion polarization.In fact, this paper focuses on the analysis of individual micro interactions. Through the model in this paper, we can accurately analyze the different performance of different preference individuals under the effect of heterogeneity revenue.

Subsequently, specific preference analysis of the real case is also discussed, as shown in Figure 27 . Figure 27a describes the proportion of individuals with three different preferences in the network. Figure 27b shows the number of isolated individuals with different initial preferences. We assume that at the initial moment, each of these three preferences accounts for one-third. In Figure 27 , at the initial moment, the individual preferences change greatly. Firstly, their preferences change to the fair preference, and then quickly change to the egoistic preference. From the perspective of isolated individuals, the number of individuals with an egoistic preference withdrawing from public opinion interactions is the largest. From the perspective of revenue, the individuals with an altruistic preference have the largest revenue in the network.

In this paper, social preference theory and revenue function are integrated into the model of public opinion polarization, and the influences of individuals with different preferences on public opinion polarization are also analyzed. The following conclusions can be made:

(1) Different social preferences held by individuals have different influences on public opinion In Figure 27 , at the initial moment, the individual preferences change greatly. Firstly, their preferences change to the fair preference, and then quickly change to the egoistic preference. From the perspective of isolated individuals, the number of individuals with an egoistic preference withdrawing from public opinion interactions is the largest. From the perspective of revenue, the individuals with an altruistic preference have the largest revenue in the network.

In this paper, social preference theory and revenue function are integrated into the model of public opinion polarization, and the influences of individuals with different preferences on public opinion polarization are also analyzed. The following conclusions can be made:

(1) Different social preferences held by individuals have different influences on public opinion polarization effects. Individuals with egoistic preference have fewer benefits through interaction in the network, so their interaction intention is low. The individuals with altruistic preference have the highest willingness to interact and the highest revenue, while ones with fair preference are in the middle.

(2) Through the simulation, we find that if there is only a single preference in the network, the degree of public opinion polarization is significantly lower than mixed preferences in the network. In addition, when the public opinion polarization phenomenon occurs, individuals will tend to interact with ones with different preferences.

(3) Generally, individuals' preference will alter with the change of interaction revenue. However, through simulation, we can see that at the initial moment, most individuals' preference will become an altruistic preference, but the period is very short. Then, individuals with an egoistic preference in the network will begin to increase and dominate, while ones with fair preferences account for the least.

However, the following limitations still need to be studied in the future.

(1) When constructing the network, only the node exit rule was considered, but the node increase rule accompanied by the hot event propagation at the initial time was not considered [37, 38] . In addition, the connections of all individuals were treated as bidirectional ones when the network was constructed, while in reality there are many unidirectional connections of nodes. Therefore, the node increase rule and unidirectional network structure should be explored in the future.

(2) Through the simulation of the real cases, there exists certain relevance between the change of an individual's social preference and the public opinion inversion phenomenon [39] . As a result, the relationships between them also need to be further discussed in future studies.

(3) There is still no theoretical basis for the variability of preferences held by individuals at different stages, and further research is needed on the underlying reasons for the change of preferences held by individuals.

Describing the Chinese HIV Surveillance System and the Influences of Political Structures and Social Stigma,"China's public health surveillance system for HIV was established in late 1980s and has evolved significantly during the past three decades. With the gradually changing mode of HIV transmission from sharing of intravenous injecting equipment to sexual exposure and the rapid spread of HIV infection among Chinese homosexual men in recent years, an efficient and comprehensive population-level surveillance system for describing epidemics trends and risk behaviours associated with HIV acquisition are essential for effective public health interventions for HIV. The current review describes the overall strength of the Chinese HIV surveillance system and its structural weaknesses from a political and social perspective. The HIV surveillance system in China has undergone substantial revamping leading to a comprehensive, timely and efficient reporting system. However, large data gaps and lack of quality control and sharing of information obstruct the full performance of the system. This is largely due to fragmented authoritarianism brought about by the underlying political structure. Social stigma and discrimination in health institutes are also key barriers for further improvements of HIV diagnosis and surveillance in China. © Zhang et al.; Licensee Bentham Open.

This estimate was obtained by using the Workbook Method recommended by UNAIDS based on the numbers of newly diagnosed HIV cases and applying related mortality rates reported by the current HIV sentinel surveillance system. The overall national HIV prevalence is estimated to be 0.057% (0.042-0.071%) among the Chinese population [2, 3] . However, data from the national sentinel surveillance for HIV/AIDS indicated magnitudes and trends in HIV prevalence vary substantially across different at-risk populations: e.g. 0.6% HIV prevalence among female sex workers (FSW) in 2009 [2] and increases from 1.4% in 2001 to 5.3% in 2009 among men who have sex with men (MSM) [4, 5] , and from 5.9% in 2002 to 9.3% in 2009 among injecting drug users (IDU) [2, 6] . The profile of HIV epidemics in China have also been gradually changing in mode of transmission. In the early 1990s, the main driver of HIV transmission was needle sharing among IDU [6] [7] [8] [9] ; however, sexual transmission has now become the primary mode of transmission in recent years [2, [10] [11] [12] . The proportion of newly diagnosed HIV cases due to sexual transmission increased from 49.8% in 2005 to 74.7% in 2009 and newly diagnosed cases attributed to homosexual contact has substantially increased from 12.2% in 2007 to 32.5% in 2009 [1, 10] .

Effective public health interventions for HIV rely on accurate and timely information on the extent and patterns of *Address correspondence to this author at the CFI Building, Corner of West and Boundary Streets, Darlinghurst, Sydney NSW 2010, Australia; Tel: +61 2 9385 0900; Fax: +61 2 9385 0920; E-mail: lzhang@nchecr.unsw.edu.au spread of infection. As such, an efficient and comprehensive population-level surveillance system for describing epidemics trends and risk behaviours associated with HIV acquisition are essential [13] . Previous studies have provided reviews of the current HIV surveillance system in China, mainly from a functional and epidemiological perspective [14] [15] [16] . In contrast, the current review aims to describe the overall strength of the Chinese HIV surveillance system and its structural weaknesses from a political and social perspective.

Prior to 2004, newly diagnosed HIV/AIDS cases were reported through the National Disease Reporting System (NDRS) (see Table 1 for a list of reportable items in China). The system consists of multiple level of reporting. Villages, being the lowest level of administrative, collected HIV epidemiological data in their allocated areas and reported to prevention units in township hospitals. From the prevention units, HIV data were further sent through county health and epidemic-prevention stations (EPS) to provincial centers and forwarded to the Chinese Academy of Preventive Medicine. With the support from the Ministry of Health and cooperation of provincial centers of health and epidemic prevention, a computerized system had worked effectively to network the monitoring of HIV epidemics at various levels in China and information transfer experienced no substantial changes for about 25 years. However, all communicable disease surveillance systems in China underwent significant upgrade in 2004.

The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003-2004 exposed the great deficiencies in both timeliness and completeness of infectious disease reporting in NDRS [17] . This substantially changed the landscape of infectious diseases surveillance in China. Just 6 months after the SARS epidemic subsided, the China Center for Disease Control (China CDC) launched the China Information System for Disease Control and Prevention (CISDCP) [18] . The system is an information platform constructed mainly with an infectious diseases orientation, aiming to improve timeliness of case reports, completeness and accuracy of surveillance data, ability for early detection of outbreaks and to provide direct information sharing among various levels of CDCs and health authorities, replacing the previous NDRS. The upgrade of overall infectious disease surveillance systems in China directly led to the construction of web-based HIV/AIDS case reporting system. Under this reporting system, grassroot hospitals remain the primary source of HIV epidemiological information. All diagnosed and confirmed HIV-infected cases admitted to hospitals are obliged to report through the web-based reporting system to China CDC.

Improving from the previous step-wise hierarchical reporting framework, the new web-based reporting system provided the ability for direct reporting of diagnosed HIV cases from the grassroot hospitals to the centralised database in Chinese MOH through CISDCP (Fig. 1) . That is, once disease cases are entered into the system, all levels of CDC can acquire the data 'live' according to their assigned access privileges [19] . This substantially reduced the average reporting period from 7-8 days to less than 2 days. In addition to their assumed responsibility for authenticating the HIV disease information in their administrative regions, municipal and provincial CDCs are required to report to their corresponding Department of Health (DOHs) and Bureau of Health (BOHs) and to form networks with local research bodies, universities and other health organisations. At the top of the hierarchy, the National Center for HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control (NCAIDS) of China CDC is the overseeing organisation for assembling and analysing all HIV disease information and then presenting a final report to China MOH. China MOH remains the only legitimate office to disseminate HIV/AIDS-related information to the public, but provincial and municipal CDCs are also authorised to release information under the supervision and approval of China MOH [20, 21] . China MOH enacts health policies, designs prevention guidelines and intervention strategies based on the surveillance reports provided by NCAIDS, once a consensus agreement is established between MOH and the Chinese government, feedback recommendations and policies are issued to all lower levels of MOH for execution. Since the feedback information does not go through the webbased information pool, hospitals at grassroots level may have to wait for a considerable period of time to receive recommendations and guidelines from China MOH.

By the year 2009, 8563 laboratories (8273 screening laboratories, 254 confirmatory laboratories, 35 confirmatory central laboratories and 1 National AIDS Reference Laboratory) and 84 laboratories hospitals are capable of carrying out CD4 and HIV viral load testing in China [22] . Confirmed diagnosed HIV cases were reported back to referring clinical sites then further integrated into the central database through CISDCP. The hospital-based surveillance in China has cumulatively diagnosed 326,000 people living AIDS and a total of 65,481 people are currently receiving ART in 2009 [23] , which accounted for 62.4% of the AIDS cases [2] .

The hospital-based surveillance relies on PLHIV to attend hospital to be diagnosed and cases subsequently reported. Complementing this passive reporting, active surveillance for HIV was adopted in 1995 and further expanded in 2003 to include second generation behavioral surveillance in China according to WHO recommendations [24, 25] . While the existing hospital-based diagnosis system provides HIV diagnosis and treatment data, sentinel surveillance collects information on HIV prevalence, incidence and the risk behaviours of at-risk populations. In China, HIV sentinel surveillance is collaboratively supervised by the Chinese MOH and WHO. In 2000, surveillance pilot sites targeting IDU, FSW, male clients and the general female population were established in Fujian, Xinjiang, Guangxi, Shanxi, Yunnan and Sichuan. The approach utilised 21 surveillance points in these provinces and from every surveillance point 400 people are sampled twice each year to estimate the prevalence, incidence rate and risk behaviours of the targeted population [26] . The sampling and reporting for each round is completed within 4 weeks. In 2002, China issued ""Standards for HIV Surveillance and HIV/AIDS"" and ""STD Comprehensive Surveillance Guideline"" to provide guidelines to standardise the practice of HIV surveillance. In 2009, the number of sentinel sites in China increased to 1318, covering 14 at-risk population groups [2, 14, 27] . Since the establishment of the web-based HIV reporting system in 2004, sentinel surveillance data is integrated with disease information reported from hospitals. This approach established a comprehensive database for data collection, analysis and sharing and enables high-level comparison and integration of epidemiological and behavioural surveillance data [14] . This further allows the conduct of evaluation and forecasting activities for guiding the formulation of public health intervention strategies.

HIV sentinel surveillance has detected the changing trends and patterns of HIV epidemics in China, from transmission related to injecting practices to sexual transmission, especially homosexual transmission. Further, surveillance data have revealed that the proportion of IDU among all drug users has increased from 42% in 1994 [28, 29] to 53% in 2001 [29, 30] and 69% in 2009 [31] . In addition, during 1997-2009, the proportion of IDU who report sharing needles increased from 25% to 38% [32] . Among FSW, consistent condom use in commercial sexual contacts in the last month increased from 10% in 1995 to 62% in 2009, and the proportion who reported never using condoms decreased from 70.6% to 2.0% during the same period [14, 33] .

The current HIV surveillance system in China appears to have improved in its timeliness and effectiveness for providing useful HIV disease information and regular behavioural monitoring of at-risk populations in China. However, under-utilisation and lack of transparency of information outside certain authorised channels are possibly the greatest hindrances to optimal use of the current system. Since accessibility to health data in China is largely limited to a small group of authorised personnel at the top of the administrative hierarchy, it often requires extensive bargaining and bureaucratic procedures to obtain epidemiological and behavioural indicators that are commonly accessibly in other countries. Hence, large amount of surveillance data remains in CISDCP and cannot be utilised widely for the purpose of HIV public health research, broader program evaluation and planning of control strategies. A transparent HIV surveillance system across all stakeholders, including policy makers, health officials, community health organisation leaders and HIV researchers, is beneficial for the entire HIV sector in the evaluation and implementation of HIV prevention and intervention strategies [34] . To understand barriers to optimal utilisation of available systems it is essential to first understand the political structure in China and its influences on surveillance. Although HIV surveillance is considered as a purely public health issue in many countries, issues related to HIV in China are highly sensitive and politically motivated [13, 35, 36] .

Authoritarianism describes any political structure in which overall authority is concentrated in the hands of a single leader or a small group of elite. Prior to economic reform in China, the ultimate political powers were mastered by the chairman of state, who is simultaneously the president of the party and chief commander of the army. Political   Fig. (1) . Schematic diagram of flow of information for HIV surveillance in China. decisions and national policies were implemented strictly ""from top to bottom"" through a pyramidal administrative structure (Fig. 2a) . During the process of political decentralisation initiated by the economic reform in China, provincial governments and ministerial institutions were given high degrees of autonomy to stimulate economic growth. Although the central government remains at the peak of the power hierarchy, opportunities for competition and bargaining between governments and institutions became possible. This phenomenon was coined ""fragmented authoritarianism"" by Lampton in 1987 [37] . As a result of fragmented authoritarianism, government authority below the very peak of the Beijing central government is fragmented and disjointed [37, 38] . As the highest administrative body, the central government does not generally dictate the execution of policies by provincial governments. Between equal level governments or governmental institutions, and even between local and central governments, there exists a large space for competition and cooperation, which leads to extensive bargaining concerning policy execution and project development of common interests (Fig. 2b) . Fragmented authoritarianism in China can be viewed as the mixed product of traditional authoritarianism and demands for increase in political freedom triggered by the economic reform.

The fragmented authoritarian political structure directly affects the HIV surveillance system in China. First, fragmented authoritarianism leads to the absence of accountability in vertical administration of CDCs and lack of cooperation among CDCs on the same level. In this structure, the central China MOH cannot exercise direct supervision over the provincial MOHs, which retain the authority of personnel appointment, organisation structure and budget distribution. Conversely, policy immobility in inferior governments can only be overcome by the intervention of a superior government with the authority to resolve conflicting interests. In other words, lower-level governments tend to shift their policy overload to the upper levels in order to avoid assuming accountabilities [38] . Consequently, a large number of responsibilities and agenda items accumulate at the upper end of the political hierarchy. Therefore, China CDC, as a subordinate organisation of China MOH, is caught in an uneasy position whereby it is unable to exercise its designated authority and simultaneously overloaded with responsibilities which it is not designated to bear. This is reflected by the large amount of collected but unanalysed HIV data accumulated in NCAIDS in central China CDC. As pointed out by Sun, et al., the amount of HIV surveillance data from diagnoses, treatment, laboratory tests and behavioural surveillance overflows the organizational capacity of NCAIDS [14] . Apart from key indicators that require to be distributed to MOH and the general public, most of the surveillance data is under-utilised [14] . Although the web-based HIV reporting system provides an advanced technology base for data reporting and collection, the dissemination of related summary and policy to direct HIV prevention and care strategies remain slow and inefficient. In addition, such a fragmented system makes it difficult to authenticate the quality of the data, as intermediate levels of CDCs do not assume accountability for the accuracy of reported data. An evaluation of HIV surveillance systems by Loo et al., indicated that although the Chinese HIV surveillance system obtained high scores for flexibility and timeliness across in its surveillance activities, representativeness and completeness of data are poor in its case reporting [34] . Discrepancies are found between the HIV laboratory testing algorithm stated in protocols and the actual procedures implemented, which results in gaps in the data and reductions in quality [39] .

Second, a fragmented authoritarian political structure inevitably leads to a fragmented information system with little openness and systematic mechanisms for synthesis. As   Fig. (2) . Change of political relationship between institutions at the same and different administrative levels in China prior to, and post, economic reform. previously analysed, lower-level CDCs can only access HIV information within its own jurisdiction, which represents only a subset of the information pool of the higher-level CDCs. As there is little information sharing, even between neighbour CDCs on the same level, these information subsets become isolated information islands which can only be integrated by their superiors. In this way, the central China CDC at the top of the administration pyramid has the ultimate authority of data collection, assembling, analysis and distribution. Hence, information openness is strongly and solely dependent on the decision of central China CDC and there exists little monitoring mechanisms to ensure the accuracy of both the reported and published information. In the current political structure, all levels of government are only accountable to their upper-level administrations, but not to the general public. The absence of genuine engagement of civil society groups, including the media and the scientific communities, and the expectations and pressures from higher-level authorities, often results in a results-oriented policy implementation, such that local officials tend to manipulate nonscientific and arbitrary results to satisfy their superiors perfunctorily [40] . In this view, ensuring the accuracy of reported disease information should be a high priority in the future development of HIV surveillance in China.

Social stigma against PLHIV is common in China. Misconceptions about HIV transmission and prejudice towards PLHIV are widespread among the general population. HIV-positive individuals are often denied employment, education and necessary medical services [41] and are thus more likely not to disclose their HIV status [42, 43] . A recent study by Zhou in 2008 shows that the healthcare expenses for HIV-positive individuals were greatly elevated by social discrimination, and their available social resources were substantially reduced in the presence of social stigma [44] . The study further indicated that PLHIV often perceive healthcare institutions as an indispensable source of social support and one of the few places where they may be willing to disclose their HIV-positive status [44] . However, a separate survey among health workers in hospitals demonstrated that HIV stigmatisation remains as the major health-seeking barriers for PLHIV in China [45] . According to a UNAIDS study in 2009, 15% of surveyed participants indicated that their HIV status was disclosed by health-care professionals to others without their consent [46] . According to the latest available statistics, there have been 326,000 cumulative HIV/AIDS cases in China, including 54,000 deaths, by the end of 2009 [23] . This accounts for only 44% of the estimated number of PLHIV at that time. The percentage of undiagnosed cases cannot be improved upon if the barrier of stigma against PLHIV from health institutions is not removed. In addition, PLHIV that belongs to at-risk groups, especially MSM, are subjected to greater social stigma due their identity and sexual orientation. Recent study indicated that only 14-45% of Chinese MSM underwent HIV testing in the past 12 months during 2007-2009 [2, [47] [48] [49] [50] [51] [52] [53] . Also, it is estimated that only 12-15% of HIV-positive MSM are diagnosed based on an estimate among MSM in Yunnan province in 2009 [54] . Due to the hidden nature of MSM, sentinel surveillance targeting MSM was also required to substantial scale-up. Although the number of sentinel surveillance sites targeting MSM has increased from 4 in 2006 to 25 sites in 2009 [1, 14] , both epidemic and behavioural surveillance for MSM remains insufficient and limited in many parts of China. Reducing social stigma and discrimination is necessary in improving HIV surveillance in China.

In summary, the HIV surveillance system in China has undergone substantial revamping that leading to a comprehensive, timely and efficient reporting system. However, large data gaps and lack of quality control and sharing of information obstruct the full performance of the system. This is largely due to fragmented authoritarianism brought about by the underlying political structure. Social stigma and discrimination in health institutes are also key barriers for further improvements of HIV diagnosis and surveillance in China. The insufficient biological and behavioural surveillance for Chinese MSM may result in underestimation of the actual prevalence and disease burden among this population.

How Is WHO Responding to Global Public Health Threats?,We surely need WHO more than ever.,"I t is a favored pastime of medical editors and journalists (including ourselves) to criticize the World Health Organization (WHO) for, among other things, its ""fossilized bureaucracy,"" its lack of clear direction and priorities, the dysfunctional relationship between its headquarters and regional offi ces, and its faltering steps towards building partnerships [1, 2] . But with the arrival of so many new players on the global health scene, and the subsequent fragmentation of global health governance, we surely need WHO more than ever [3] . It is the best placed of all health agencies to coordinate the disparate, often overlapping global health initiatives and to set global norms and standards in health care, and its convening power (its ability to bring together experts) is unparalleled. Two recent WHO initiatives on preparing for and responding to global public health threats show the organization at its best, although there are, as always, some important caveats.

The fi rst initiative, described by Holger Schünemann and colleagues in this issue of PLoS Medicine, is the development and pilot testing of the new WHO Rapid Advice Guidelines Group [4] . WHO's standard process for guideline development typically takes years of consultations and endless rounds of revisions, a process that is wholly inadequate for dealing with emergency health threats such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) or H5N1 avian infl uenza. In response to requests for advice from frontline clinicians and public health professionals on how to treat H5N1 infections, WHO convened a new type of panel to issue rapid, evidencebased advice. It took one month to convene an expert team, and fi ve weeks for the team to summarize the evidence and prepare draft guidelines. The guidelines were then discussed at a two-day meeting, after which a draft manuscript for publication was prepared within 10 days.

In WHO terms, this time scale was miraculously quick, but there is clearly room for improvement-an even quicker time frame is likely to be needed for future health emergencies. The process could be expedited, say the authors, by identifying or establishing collaborating centers skilled in producing evidence-based guidelines and by building in-house capacity to reduce the time needed to organize a review team. It will also be vital for this new rapid advice group to make its process of panel selection as transparent as possible if the group is to garner the trust of the public health community. WHO has previously come under fi re for allowing industry to unduly infl uence its expert committees, and for failing to ensure that committee members declare their competing interests [3] . The rapid advice group must not sacrifi ce transparency in the interests of urgency.

The second initiative is the long overdue 2005 revision of the International Health Regulations (IHR 2005), which comes into force next month [5] . These regulations are an international legal instrument designed to ensure maximum protection against the international spread of infectious disease while minimizing restrictions on travel and trade. Up until the 2005 revision, the regulations in force since 1969 (IHR 1969) required notifi cation of just three diseases: yellow fever, cholera, and plague. The instrument was therefore hopelessly outdated for dealing with the new infectious diseases that have emerged at a rate of about one per year over the last 20 years [6] , or indeed for dealing with established threats such as pandemic infl uenza. IHR 1969 had several other limitations-for example, surveillance relied totally upon individual governments notifying WHO and there were no specifi c strategies to help build the capacity of resource-poor countries to monitor or respond to outbreaks [7] . Compliance was poor, in part because countries feared that reporting of outbreaks would lead to unwarranted and damaging travel and trade restrictions [5] . China's initial reluctance to disclose the SARS pandemic was motivated by such fears [7] .

Under IHR 2005, WHO member states are now required to notify WHO of ""all events which may constitute a public health emergency of international concern,"" which can include noninfectious events (such as chemical or radiation hazards) [5] .

A new algorithm has been devised to aid states in determining what constitutes such an emergency. Criteria for reporting are whether the public health impact of the event is serious, whether it is unusual or unexpected, whether there is a risk of international spread, and whether there is a risk of international restrictions to trade and travel. The algorithm includes a long list of specifi c diseases that must always be notifi ed, such as viral hemorrhagic fevers, SARS, and human infl uenza caused by a new subtype.

IHR 2005 requires all states to develop ""core surveillance and response capacities"" and requires WHO to assist in this development process. Each country must now have a ""National IHR Focal Point"" to maintain communications between WHO and the member state. When an event is reported, WHO will guide the appropriate response by issuing time-limited recommendations to the member state tailored to the assessed risk of the event. An important new feature of IHR 2005 is that WHO can now use information about health emergencies not just from governments but from a range of sources, including nongovernmental organizations and the media. WHO can also raise the alarm itself about an emergency even when a country has not voluntarily notifi ed the organization.

IHR 2005 is undoubtedly ""a great step forward for international public health practice"" [8] . On paper at least, the radical revision to the IHR, which took ten years to fi nalize, gives WHO the teeth it needs to prepare for and respond to any global health threat. But WHO will have to address several important concerns if IHR 2005 is to become a real force for strengthening our collective defenses against public health threats.

The fi rst, and most obvious, concern is that many developing countries lack the fi nancial resources to build core surveillance and response capacity. These countries will be unable to comply with IHR 2005 through no fault of their own. Unless WHO helps to mobilize new funding, an upgraded global surveillance and response system will remain just an aspiration. Donors have taken an interest in preparing for at least one ""public health emergency of international concern""-pandemic infl uenza-but without a way of ensuring equitable distribution of funds, it is the donor countries themselves that will largely benefi t from these extra resources. For example, in December 2005 the United States congress allocated $US3.8 billion to help prepare for the next pandemic, of which $US3.3 billion went to the Department of Health and Human Services [9] .

Three-quarters of this departmental funding is allocated to the stockpiling of antiviral drugs and vaccines for use in the US, while only 3.8% is dedicated to ""international activities."" Poor countries are understandably concerned that the stockpiling of tools for pandemic infl uenza control will be the preserve of the rich world.

A related concern is that IHR 2005 appears to have no remit to help developing countries deal with national public health emergencies. The event must be ""of international concern"" for the IHR machinery to kick in. It would arguably be better for a country to adopt a precautionary principle rather than to wait until a disease has crossed its borders to become an ""international"" epidemic. The woolly language of IHR 2005 also leaves the regulations open to the criticism that they are there simply to prevent infectious diseases of the poor world from encroaching upon rich countries.

There are other potential barriers to the success of IHR 2005. The division of power within federations may make it diffi cult for them to meet the surveillance and reporting requirements of IHR 2005 [10] . It is unclear whether the instrument will have any power to assist states that are not members of WHO, such as Taiwan, which suffered a major SARS outbreak in 2003 and which is at risk of pandemic infl uenza. It is too soon to tell how IHR 2005 will interact with other guidelines on public health emergencies. The European Union, for example, already has its own network for reporting unusual events that may constitute a public health emergency [11] -does this network supersede the IHR 2005? And it is too soon to tell whether IHR 2005 gives countries enough of an incentive to report epidemics or whether compliance will be just as poor as with IHR 1969.

IHR 2005 has been hailed as ""a governance regime unlike anything in the history of international law on public health"" [7] . Margaret Chan, WHO's Director-General, believes that the new regulations give the organization the preemptive powers it needs to detect an outbreak early and stop it at its source [12] . IHR 2005 certainly gives the health community a new tool that could promote collective action against global health threats, but the tool will be weakened unless the technical, logistical, and, most crucially, fi nancial hurdles are overcome.

China-Africa Health Development Initiatives: Benefits and Implications for Shaping Innovative and Evidence-informed National Health Policies and Programs in Sub-saharan African Countries,"This review paper examines the growing implications of China's engagement in shaping innovative national initiatives against infectious diseases and poverty control and elimination in African countries. It seeks to understand the factors and enhancers that can promote mutual and innovative health development initiatives, and those that are necessary in generating reliable and quality data for evidence-based contextual policy, priorities and programs.","In a rapidly globalizing world with increasing health and epidemiologic transitions, the international community and multilateralism have become highly active, coordinated and robust. The effectiveness of these initiatives depends on the effectiveness of regional and international cooperation on health challenges and issues. [1] There are, however, little substantive information and knowledge gaps on how international cooperation and activities can best be used as tools for the management of global health and attainment of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). [1, 2] China-Africa heath development initiatives is timely to address public health and health research gaps, South-South health development platforms and cooperation in shaping innovative national health evidence policies, priorities, programs and benefits in developing countries. International bilateral or multilateral cooperation on health development has been evolving rapidly since the late twentieth century to meet the increasing needs of vulnerable populations, moving forward effective Universal Health Coverage (UHC) and SDGs. [2, 3] In addition, to face the challenges of health and epidemiologic transitions, ageing and globalization challenges, collaborative diplomacy on health security have become more vital than ever in not only saving lives and improving public health but also in improving and providing long lasting benefits to both world's poorest and developed countries. At the same time, however, the rising concern on response and funding from international health actors (WHO, World Bank, UN/UNDP, etc.) remains challenging and requires more efforts and collaboration in harmonizing multilateral efforts and timely actions in emergencies situations. [4, 5] While the news have often reported on the growth of Chinese involvement in Africa, there has been very little literature on its effects on public health. There is a need for deeper analysis on China's cooperation and efforts at improving public health large-scale development in Africa. There are no statistics showing declines in mortality or disease burden. Furthermore, it's still unclear exactly how the Chinese approach differs from the Western approach, as the difference between the ""horizontal"" and ""vertical"" approaches are never described practically or operationally. [3, 4, 6] Moreover, there is an urgent need to understand factors that can promote mutual and beneficial health development initiatives. [2, 3] The growing trend and quest for Chinese multilateral cooperation is increasingly paramount and imperative in tackling the persistent global financial crisis, reducing mass unemployment, and revamping the public burden of infectious diseases of poverty. [4, 5] Strategic and timely China-Africa health development cooperation is much needed in training and capacity development, exchanges, technical assistance and technology transfer. Also, strengthening health systems in scaling up health and medical skills transfer to achieve universal coverage, health equity and overall long-term benefits of improved quality healthcare delivery towards sustainable national development and growth. [2, 3, 6] Reciprocally, to support China in meeting up with the growing demand on natural resources and citizenry needs, international laws and declarations are critical areas for international cooperation. The current political environment and commitment to address health problems has created unprecedented opportunities for bilateral health cooperation. [4, 5] Furthermore, as China has become an increasingly important part of global health over the past decades, interest in China's international health cooperation has increased among public health professionals internationally and in China. [3, 5, 6] Thus, this systematic analysis of China-Africa cooperation is timely in leveraging on infectious diseases and poverty alleviation health experiences and lessons learned in reshaping strategic health diplomacy formulation and enhancing successful approaches in health programs and networks in Africa. [5, 7] The importance of international, multilateral cooperation for health and disease prevention and control has been recognized as a vital approach and instrument in global health agenda. However, there is a dearth of literature on the potential impact of China strategic diplomacy and policy approaches on the global health inter-dependence, focusing mainly on aspects of existing and emerging threats from disease prevention and control to elimination programs and strategies. [6, 8] Few scholarly publications have paid attention to the behavior and politics of global actors. Primarily, how China-Africa health development will shape the global health priorities cooperation and collaboration requires further investigation. [4] [5] [6] [7] In China, there exists a few articles regarding international cooperation on health concerns aspects of social science. [2, 6, 7] To address the operational and translation research to health policy and practice gaps, challenges and opportunities, more systematic analyses might be required in further understanding the importance of strategic and comprehensive engagement. [4, 7, 8] Jointly and mutually beneficial Africa-China heath development initiatives could be the turning point for collaborative support and research projects, resource sharing and analysis for new public health policy dimensions and strategic impact. Programmatic and robust partnerships are paramount in fostering context health and sustainable public health innovations for health information for all generations. It will, in turn, impact on communities and populations, fostering efficient and effective global health initiatives towards enhanced economic trade, growth and stability, promoting the course of human rights and equity, reinforcement of environmental and wildlife protection and regulations, access and use of health services and medical commodities in achieving UHC and mainstreaming of the SDGs. [8, 9] This review paper examines the implications of China engagement in global health initiatives in Africa particularly as it relates to the benefits in health systems strengthening and innovations, emerging epidemics and infectious diseases of poverty initiatives prevention, control and elimination. It seeks an understanding of the drivers and operational enhancers that can promote innovative health development initiatives necessary for reliable and quality data for evidencebased contextual policy, priorities and programs of global health impact.

A systematic literature review examined Chinese international health cooperation and global health agenda on infectious diseases prevention, control and elimination. In particular, challenges and opportunities related to Ebola and other emerging epidemics as well as health systems development issues, global health investment and support were reviewed. Referenced publications and extensive sources of data include books, PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar and webbased peers reviewed journal articles, government annual reports and conference proceedings, policy reports and conference papers. The books reviewed were related to health, public policy and international cooperation. The journal articles concern all of this paper's research areas since the first Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC) and the Third Ministerial conference from November, 2006 to December, 2015. Government documents came from the China-Africa partnership members, related countries' government agencies (e.g. Ministry of Health) and other international agencies and organizations, such as Global Fund, World Health Organization (WHO), The World Bank and The United Nations (UN). [10, 11] All review materials were published, and experts 'reports were assessed. Published papers on Chinese foreign diplomacy and policy reports and previous Chinese literature in relation to infectious diseases prevention and control and elimination programs, research and funding were reviewed to trace international health cooperation actions, information communication and strategies including Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC) declarations on health development in 2013 and 2015 in Beijing and Cape Town respectively. [12, 13] Furthermore, screened abstracts of the citations were identified for potentially relevant studies and full text documents were obtained for relevant publications. The articles were scrutinized to ensure that multiple publications from the same study related to trade and commerce, socio-economic, science and technology transfer were excluded. This systematic literature search which identified 334 unique records were reviewed and 277 records were excluded based on review of the title and abstract.

China-Africa engagement represents a comprehensive view of the relationship at maintaining the momentum of high-level exchanges, mutual trust and practical cooperation in acknowledging the efforts and contributions made by China to support Africa's peaceful and stable development. The year 2015 undoubtedly marked a milestone in Sino-African relations, maintaining China's tradition in diplomacy by promoting special consultation in support of the South-South cooperation, Sino-African Trade and Commerce bloc and Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD). The paradigm shift in the Chinese global health is one of the most important geopolitical cooperation of our time. China's initiative at promoting peace and social justice enhanced the pace of Chinese participation in helping African countries resolve conflicts. Hence, the Chinese government continues to work and support the international partnership and collaboration with African Union in safeguarding peace and stability in Africa, promoting the development of Africa, and advancing the integration process of Africa. The Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC), continues to deepen the new type of China-Africa strategic partnership by advancing economic and trade cooperation, and actively exploring a common path that reflects both China's and Africa's realities in reducing the major causes of emerging threats and diseases in these countries.

Our findings showed that in the last two decades (2006-2016), the FOCAC has been targeted at promoting win-win mutual aid under the multilateral framework, thus strengthening cooperation in health, agriculture and food security. FOCAC has also improved the level of investment and finance cooperation, by supporting Africa's infrastructure construction needs and capacity building in attaining UHC, from Millennium Development goals (MDGs) to attaining SDGs through China-Africa ""One Health"" strategy. For example, the West Africa's Ebola outbreak that affected Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea witnessed the importance of China partnership in fighting Ebola, and the needs for economic and social reconstruction in the post-Ebola period. The Chinese government worked with international community, humanitarian agencies and frontline non-governmental organizations including African countries to contain and control Ebola epidemics in West Africa. Compared to other developed countries, China provided a robust technical and non-technical assistance to 13 countries in and around the affected West Africa sub-region valued at about $120 million (USD), and pledged an extra $5 million (USD) to the UN Response Multi-partner Trust Fund to support recovery and rehabilitation process of the affected countries. In addition, China also provided logistics in major affected provinces, including the supply and free distribution of Ebola protection kits, mobile laboratory testing vehicles and building new national Ebola research laboratories. Also skills development of over 13,000 health workers and health professional were improved through training and capacity development. There was also post-Ebola recovery and reconstruction plans and assistance in social and economic development projects in the most affected countries namely Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone.

The China-Africa relations has grown into a new development era with major pillars such as political equality and mutual trust, promoting win-win collaboration, mutually enriching cultural exchanges, mutual joint health projects, public safety and security, coordinated China-Africa wider range solidarity for economic partnership, cooperative and Interestingly, the Second Ministerial Forum of China-Africa Health Development was held in Cape Town, South Africa in October 2015. Its theme was Promoting the Availability of Healthcare Service in Africa in improving China-Africa's Cooperation in Public Health in Post-Ebola Era. There were more than 200 participants, including the health ministers of China and over 40 African countries, as well as representatives from the AU and international organizations such as the World Health Organization and UNAIDS. The meeting adopted the Cape Town Declaration and its implementation framework to promote China-Africa collaboration in public health. It developed a roadmap for China and African countries to work together to address the key health problems affecting the African continent. The latter Johannesburg Summit was the second summit since the inception of FOCAC 20 years ago and the first held in Africa. The timely conference resulted in upgrading new type of China-Africa relationship into a comprehensive strategic and cooperative partnership. As a marked indication of this collaboration, China pledged to provide $60 billion (USD) funding support for 10 major China-Africa cooperation plans to be implemented in health-related challenges and issues. These ranged from addressing poor access and availability of quality and essential medicines and medical devices, weak health systems and capacity development, lack of entrepreneurship and technology transfer, unreliable and inexistent monitoring and evaluation (M&E) programs/projects. Noteworthy, weak regional approach and national sustained health policy reforms, inadequacies in skills and knowledge capabilities to tackle emerging epidemics and infectious diseases with limited resources were documented and should be addressed.

The new plans also cover industrialization, agricultural modernization, infrastructure, financial cooperation, green development, trade and investment facilitation, poverty reduction, public health, cultural and people-to-people exchanges, upholding regional peace and security. Ten (10) cooperation plans were based on the blueprints to guide the African Union (AU) Agenda 2063 on Africa's development in the coming 50 years towards meeting Africa's needs and citizenry benefits. Their aim will be to address the three bottlenecks holding back Africa's development that is: inadequate infrastructure, lack of professional and skilled personnel, and funding shortage. Each plan will have Chinese financial, technical or material support and will provide a strong development impetus to future China-Africa cooperation including Africa-China Young Leaders' Forum. Strengthening China-Africa cooperation in agricultural modernization, agricultural technology transfer and management requires investment in capacity building development at improving complete Africa's agricultural production, to food auto-sufficiency value chain and productivity. Building up capability is an important way to contribute to food security in Africa, and should be given priority in the context of China-Africa cooperation projects. The cooperation will enhance agricultural transformation upgrading, increase agricultural production and processing and safeguard food security in Africa bearing in mind the prevailing malnutrition and food shortages that directly impact population health.

Strengthening weak capacity development and health systems is a major priority to tackle the bottlenecks hindering independent and sustainable development of Africa. Proactive China-Africa concrete priorities and measures should be encouraged for Chinese and African entrepreneurs, businesses and financial institutions to expand investment through various means, such as Public-Private Partnership (PPP) and Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT), to support African flagship projects in African countries. These include, the Programme for Infrastructure Development and the Chinese Presidential Infrastructure Championing Initiatives in Africa, in addition to building railroad, highway, regional aviation, ports, electricity, water supply, information and communication and other infrastructure projects. Supporting African countries in establishing transportation facilitating infrastructure connectivity and economic integration in Africa. Furthermore, China plans to build transnational and trans-regional infrastructure www.mchandaids.org | © 2016 Global Health and Education Projects, Inc.

projects to achieve sub-regional connectivity and integration. Both parties can combine the national development needs and demand in fostering economically-beneficial projects and drive Africa's infrastructure construction in a balanced and orderly manner. Adequate planning and coordination of health development initiatives, construction and renovation, and research collaborative networks in particular promoting construction of transnational highway networks has commenced.

There is an urgent need to establish joint China-Africa bureau for health development initiatives that will enhance coordination and evaluation of projects. Likewise, establishing comprehensive human and infrastructure capacity building and transfer of technology is core. Furthermore, China-Africa businesses investment, construction and operation in Africa should be explored. Expansion in vaccine production and medical devices, agriculture and water resources, solar, wind and renewable energy, biomass power generation in power transmission and transformation and maintenance should be nurtured.

While advancing its own development, China tries to offer what assistance it can to Africa without setting any political conditions, and to benefit African people through developmental advances. In recent years, China has implemented measures adopted at the FOCAC ministerial conferences. China has actively developed cooperation with Africa in areas relating to public amenities, medical and health care, climate change and environmental protection, humanitarian aid, and other fields. China has also strengthened cultural and educational exchanges and scientific and technological cooperation in an effort to improve Africa's ability to develop independently. China has offered assistance to Africa in digging wells for water supplies, and in building affordable housing, broadcasting and telecommunications facilities, and cultural and educational sites in an effort to improve the productive and living conditions of local people. Since 2009, China has carried out dozens of welldigging projects in the Sudan, Malawi, Zimbabwe, Djibouti, Guinea and Togo, playing a positive role in easing water problems for local people. It has also provided support for the building of portable dwellings in South Sudan, schools in Benin, and rural schools in Malawi, and in doing so, improved local living conditions and educational facilities. China's largest aid project in the Central African Republic is the construction of the Boali No. 3 Hydropower Station, which, after it was completed 2010, greatly relieved electricity shortages in Bangui and surrounding areas with potential usefulness in improving data access and information sharing for public health benefits. Supporting cultural and educational exchanges make up an important part of the new type of strategic partnership between China and Africa. By supporting young Africans studying in China, sending young Chinese volunteers to Africa and developing joint research initiatives, China tries to promote mutual understanding between China and African countries and strengthening the social foundation of their friendship. Holding human resource training programs and courses are important components of capacity building. From 2010 to 2012, China held various training courses for 54 countries and regions in Africa; the courses involved a total of 27,318 officials and technicians, and covered topics relating to economics, foreign affairs, energy, industry, agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry and fishing, medicine and health care, inspection and quarantine, climate change, security, and some other fields. In addition, Chinese medical teams, agricultural experts and enterprises located in Africa have also trained local people in an effort to enhance local technological capabilities and upgrading China-Africa cooperation in science and technology. From 2010 to 2012, in advancing cooperation in medical and health care, China helped build 27 hospitals in Ghana, Zimbabwe and other African countries. China has also sent 43 medical teams to 42 African countries and regions, treating over 5.57 million patients. In recent years, in addition to building hospitals, donating drugs and organizing medical training programs, China has also launched an initiative called ""Brightness or ""Evidence"" Action,"" to treat cataract patients and provided mobile hospitals. China also built bilaterally-run eye centers, and helped build demonstration and training centers for diagnosis and treatment technologies, thereby effectively advancing Sino-African cooperation in medical and health care. China also gave 66 African researchers the chance to do post-doctoral research in China and donated 150,000 Yuan ($24,000) worth of research equipment to each of the 24 researchers who had returned to their home countries to work upon completing their joint research projects in China.

Chinese aid and investment in Africa health development have made substantial contributions to the continent's development over the last 15 years. China-Africa health development builds on the existing FOCAC platform to coordinate health research program that aims to advance capacity and technology transfer to cutting-edge research. In advancing access, uptake and utilization of health commodities in tackling China and Africa health needs and issues. Filling these important gaps and challenges requires collection and production of real-time evidence care development trajectory. Investing in priorities health needs, economic and political, scientific and technological development and empowerment inequalities should be addressed through this win-win mutual partnership with institutions and other international stakeholders in line with global health engagement in infectious and emerging diseases and epidemics especially in Africa and China. Further, this is necessary in strengthening international health commitment and investment towards new model of health bilateral development that is based on equality, accountability, mutual respect that is more balanced, stable, human rights, inclusive and harmonious society.

Industrialization, diversification of trade, infrastructure development, and regional economic integration are all the right ingredients for Africa's sound economic future. However, in the near term, in light of China's own economic slowdown, questions do exist about the implications of China's economic ties with Africa and the sustainability. China has implemented ""African Talents Program"" to train 30,000 African personnel in various sectors, offered 18,000 government scholarships, and build cultural and vocational skills training facilities in African countries. China and Africa will deepen their cooperation in the health sector, step up high-level exchanges in health-related fields and hold a China-Africa high-level health development programs and activities. China will continue to send medical workers to Africa, while continuing to run the ""Brightness Action"" campaign in Africa to provide free treatment for cataract patients. It will also help African countries enhance their capacity building in meteorological infrastructure and forest protection and management of potential threats and disasters.

The research capacity of local partners in China-Africa relations has reached a new historic level. Africa, a continent full of hope and thirst for development, has become one of the world's fastest growing regions, while China, the world's largest developing country, and has maintained forward momentum in its development. With increasing common interests and mutual needs, the two sides have great opportunities to accelerate their economic and trade cooperation. Currently, the Chinese people are working hard to realize the Chinese dream of national revival, while African people are committed to the African dream of gaining strength through unity and achieving development and renewal. With a spirit of mutual respect and win-win cooperation, China will continue to take concrete measures to build a Sino-African community of shared destinies featuring all-round, diversified and deep cooperation. It will work to advance China-Africa economic and www.mchandaids.org | © 2016 Global Health and Education Projects, Inc.

trade cooperation to help both sides make their respective dreams come true. China is also willing to enhance its cooperation with the rest of the world to promote Africa's prosperity and development.

China and Africa should work together to promote the development of the ""China-Africa Joint Research Centre"" project and cooperate in biodiversity protection, prevention and treatment of desertification, sustainable forest management and modern agriculture demonstration. The Chinese side will support Africa in implementing 100 clean energy and wild life protection projects, environment friendly agricultural projects and smart city construction projects. Strengthening China-Africa ""One Health"" strategy cooperation through wildlife and environment protection will help African countries to improve their protection and conservation capabilities. There should be more efforts in building environmental capacities in African countries with training opportunities on environmental and ecological conservation. The possibility of cooperating on joint wildlife protection projects against the illegal trade of fauna and flora products, especially by addressing endangered species poaching, deforestation and environment, degradation and climate change impact on the African continent, should be explored. 

In its first 10-years of China-Africa partnership implementation plans, China and Africa share the view that the current development strategies of China-Africa partnerships are highly compatible in fostering China centenary goals and Africa Union (AU) 2063 Agenda. The two sides shall make full use of their comparative advantages to transform and upgrade mutually beneficial cooperation focusing on better quality and higher efficiency to ensure the common prosperity of their peoples. [14, 15] Joint health research establishment is needed for a comprehensive strategic and cooperative partnership for China-Africa mutual trust, win-win results and sustained economic growth. [2, 7, 9, [16] [17] [18] Health and medical technology capacity building and transfer, exchanges and mutual learning is needed in enhancing Chinese and African citizenry, mutual assistance in public health security and safety. Promoting healthcare solidarity and cooperation can be very supportive in enhancing national health planning and interventions implementation between China and African countries in international affairs. [6, 7, 19, 20] Moreover, improving and encouraging care delivery strategic mechanisms such as bilateral joint and strategic dialogues, foreign ministries' political consultations, and joint/mixed commissions on economic and trade cooperation is imperative; through exchanges and cooperation between the National People's Congress of China and African national parliaments, regional parliaments, the Pan-African Parliament and the African Parliamentary Union, to consolidate the traditional medicines integration in China-Africa friendship and promoting mutually beneficial cooperation. [3, 6, 8, 11, 14, 21] Our findings documented that China's commitment to continuously support Africa in many areas include agriculture and health sector, trade and commerce, science and technology projects implementation. These included construction of regional and community hospitals and treatment centers, infrastructures and facilities to fight infectious diseases, support by Chinese medical care delivery teams and improve capacities to respond to public health and sanitary crises throughout Africa including DR Congo, Cameroon, Togo, Ivory Coast, Angola, Namibia, Mozambique, Sudan, Algeria, South Africa, Zambia, Egypt, Nigeria, Ghana, Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone. These equipped ultramodern infrastructure and facilities investment include emergency, resuscitation, pediatrics, surgery, obstetric and gynecology, medical imaging, and related technical units worth billions of US dollars (Figure 1 ). These joint efforts are positive milestones to strengthen intercontinental cooperation in view of attaining a sustainable impact in achieving universal health coverage and access to basic medicine. In particular, accelerating the fight against HIV/AIDS, TB, malaria, schistosomiasis, maternal-child health, reproductive health and improving universal immunization coverage against vaccine preventable diseases across Africa. [21] [22] [23] [24] 

Chinese comprehensive and pragmatic efforts was once again documented when the Chinese government immediately offered emergency relief to the three West African countries most affected by Ebola and to their 10 neighboring countries of Ghana, Mali, Togo, Benin, DRC, the Republic of Congo, Nigeria, Cote d'Ivoire, Senegal and Guinea-Bissau. With the situation turning more serious and based on the needs of epidemic regions, China later announced three consecutive rounds of assistance. China has also promised that in so far as Ebola persists in Africa, her assistance will not stop. [7, 8, 10, 11, 15] China stood shoulder-to-shoulder with the African people in fighting Ebola to the final victory of global disease free generations. West Africa Ebola epidemics 2014-2016 led to net losses of $6.2 billion US dollars in the three most affected countries (Liberia, Sierra Leone, Guinea) in terms of Gross Domestic Products (GDP). As these countries embark on recovery and reconstruction, China has promised assistance in health systems strengthening, capacity building, health infrastructures and equipment support, amongst others. [5, 8, 13, 23] The urgent need for data and information sharing, material and technical transfer cannot be over emphasized in improving public health and medical resources access through mutual commitments and support. Promoting health data and information sharing, educational exchanges and capacity development to support the establishment of robust infectious diseases surveillance-response systems in African countries and all remote provinces/cities is imperative in institutionalization of China-Africa forum on cooperation between provinces or local governments. [3, 17, 19, 22, 25] 

The China-Africa Development Fund ""CAD-Fund"" is one of new methods for China-African new strategic partnership, which was fully controlled by the Chinese government. CAD Fund is one of the eight measures which was announced by Chinese government at the Beijing Summit of the FOCAC in November 4 th , 2006 aimed to support Chinese companies to develop the cooperation with Africa and enter the African market. [1, 3, 5] Distinctive characteristics in the capital nature, the business area, and operation mode is continually following the investment philosophy: to build up ""bridge linking"" and ""connection"" of the economic and trade cooperation between China and Africa; to enhance self-develop capability of Africa; to strictly fulfill the investment environment and social responsibility; to promote mutually beneficial and win-win between China and Africa by market-oriented operation. [5, 7, 21] CAD-Fund is a pioneering move in the process of mutual and beneficial China-Africa cooperation. It remedied the gap under the traditional model of free aid and loans. With the increasing African countries double public health burden (chronic illnesses and infectious diseases), new investment models and market-oriented economic development and operation should be examined in achieving sustained and healthy dual or self-development. [9, 11, 18] the direct investment is essential. Improving people's livelihood for African regions by additional large scale (e.g.: network project) investment to African countries could be beneficial in long terms. [14, 20] For instance, the Chinese government officially approved the establishment of the CAD-Fund, with first-phase funding, USD 1 billion, provided by China Development Bank. CAD-Fund operated independently based on market economy principles under a standardized corporate governance structure. China Development Bank (CDB), the shareholder, has a great wealth of experience in project review and management and is backed up with sound expert resources. Having invested in five funds and three specialized fund management companies, the bank has developed sophisticated fund management and risk control systems. CDB has accumulated profound experience vis-à-vis investing in Africa through its ""Going Global"" initiative. [19] [20] [21] CDB, by virtue of its overall resources and advantages, will provide a high level of professional support. Again, on the investment side, the Ministry of Commerce revealed that China's direct investment in Africa stood at $1.19 billion (USD) in the first half of 2014, falling over 40 percent year on year. The downturn is attributed to the sluggish global economic recovery, international commodity fluctuations, and the Ebola outbreaks. [8, 17, 21] Globalization and global health initiatives on infectious diseases of poverty associated consequences have shown the world is closely linked as emerging threats and epidemics of infectious diseases can strike anywhere at any time irrespective of race, religion and financial capacity of the country. These have precipitated growing opportunities in internationalization of south-south and south-north health cooperation in changing outcomes. [8, 9] The advances in technological development and increases in global interconnections are increasingly being utilized inexpensive and prompt health information communication diffusion broadly and interdependence between different people, regions and continent benefits. [8, 9] Improvements in communication and information technologies has enabled international responses to health threats and disaster crisis more rapidly and in a coordinated fashion, [7] bringing about greater sharing of information and increasing international interactions and collaboration. [10] Globalization requires increasing cooperation among countries to ensure the stability and security of the global system, a reason why implementation of international agreements and joint declarations has become important. [10, 21] For instance, industrial demand and globalization coupled with intense urbanization have been generating new ecological, climate and environmental threats and associated consequences beyond local, regional boundaries and worldwide. These consequences and issues have raised the need for international cooperation and foreign assistance agreements either as direct delivery of services, capacity transfer or implementation of health interventions such as the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. [5, 8, 10, 22] In today's more interdependent world, international cooperation, which involves the interaction of countries, international organizations and non-government actors, shapes values, policies and rules. As globalization continues to widen the gaps, development and implementation of comprehensive health models between developing and developed nations, the interest in global health partnership and foreign assistance effectiveness has grown in importance at improving funding on health systems priorities including scaling up access to essential medicines and service delivery, universal health coverage and building new primary healthcare facilities. [11, 18, 20, 21] International mutual cooperation and aid is one of the most effective weapons in reshaping and transforming regional and national health capabilities which benefits through provision of global public goods, infectious disease control and alleviation of poverty. [12, 23] The widespread influence of globalization has increased the need for international cooperation to address emerging opportunities for and threats to global health in improving the health status of populations in developing nations. [7, 9] As of November 2015, the majority of African exports to China remains in natural resources. According to the statistics by Chinese customs, crude oil, iron ore, diamonds, and agricultural products together accounted for 56.5 percent of Chinese imports from Africa during the first three quarters of 2015. And this number is on the low end because China's demand for raw materials has been suppressed by its economic slowdown this year. In this sense, China's intention of downplaying the importance of natural resources in Sino-Africa trade in its policy manifestation is clear, given the mutually understandable winwin image associated with Sino-Africa economic relations aspirations. China's International health development cooperation initiatives since the 1980s, health privatization and reforms expectations and outcomes from international coalitions were formed to address the heavy global challenges, including national burden of infectious diseases, poverty and inequality. With the global funds support from early 2000, the vertical approach to funding and aid has been gradually shifting to a horizontal approach and from mere bilateral efforts to multilateral organizations, local and international NGOs, aimed at reshaping major funding, cooperation, new alliances and networks. [10, 13] Furthermore, boosting provision of aid or humanitarian assistance paradigm shift from a small-scale task plan to large multiple programs financial support projects and programs.

multifaceted nature and complexity of health and the multi-sectorial interactions that influence it have induced an increasing number of organizations to become active in the health field. [2, 14] Broad-ranging partnerships are increasingly being set up to target specific health problems. [6, 15] For example, to achieve Roll Back Malaria or polio eradication a global partnership was formed with, among others, ministries of health in polio-endemic countries, Rotary International, United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), the governments of Australia, Canada, Denmark, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States. Reciprocally, from 1994 to 2001, the EU contributed €4.5 million to HIV/AIDS prevention in China, setting up six provincial level regional training centers to provide technical assistance to medical personnel in HIV/AIDS prevention. [14, 15] This collaborative support is advantageous for capacity building, educational exchanges between institutions of all levels and dual technology transfer. Such efforts have been reported between China and the United Kingdom (UK), the US, and Australia in research and development and helpful in solving health issues and developmental challenges including climate changes and globalization of trade and travel. [8, 11, 16] Previously, the establishment of cooperation between China and other countries has been done through the signing of agreements and regular corporate communication. Contemporary advances in implementation mechanisms are performed by joint engagement and participation in mutual win-win partnership and joint health programs funding or investment seeking based on local and national priorities and real time field interventions. [17, 19] Furthermore, China has dispatched more than 50 medical teams and more than 1,000 medical personnel to 39 African countries. Chinese governments highly valued and appraised local people and the team's devotion, willingly and generosity in providing medical services, training and technical assistance, in strengthening health systems development through FOCAC partnership. [3, 6, 9] In contrast to previous international vertical health approach, Chinese horizontal approach and process (people-people approach and relations) has been appraised in responding to the need of the populations. There is an urgent need for reliable and effective evidence in strengthening health systems development including constructing health care facilities, providing medicines and medical equipment, improving more targeted care access and utilization require contextual and scalable community-based programs and activities beneficial to both Chinese and African citizenry. [1, 3, 7, 14, 15] China's importance in sustainable development and global health goals, is aimed not only in fighting poverty and health inequality among the world's people, but in enhancing opportunities to live a free, healthy and fulfilled life. [1, 2, 18] Achieving health for all remains an important component of SDG targets and requires reducing national public health burden of infectious diseases of poverty. Addressing knowledge gaps between the developing and developed countries require innovative international and multilateral cooperation with priorities on significant infectious diseases, emerging epidemics, the rise of obesity related cardiometabolic and other www.mchandaids.org | © 2016 Global Health and Education Projects, Inc. chronic diseases. The MDGs, adopted and supported after the Millennium Summit of the United Nations in September 2000, provided a substantial progress in the reduction of poverty and marked improvements in infectious diseases and some neglected tropical diseases in most endemic countries through the Global Funds. It also offered other bilateral aid to the poorest and vulnerable populations worldwide by improving maternal health, reducing child mortality, while combating HIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases. [5, 8, 12, [21] [22] [23] Attaining the SDGs and health for all by 2050 depends primarily on national efforts supported by domestic and regional public-private partnerships and global strategy of increasing access of the world's poor to essential health services. It also depends on support from international multilateral cooperation and collaboration within countries. [15, 17, 20] Further efforts should be devoted at reducing inequality and poverty in health aimed at accelerating progress towards the SDGs and should be a pubic priority. It is worth mentioning that there is still disproportionate health disparity between developing and developed countries. [19, 21] For example children life expectancy chances are dramatically different depending on where they are born. In China life expectancy is longer than in African countries due to premature mortality ratio associated with malaria, tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS as well as chronic infections, mainly maternal-child and elderly healthcare delivery. [13, 23, 27, 28] China's global solidarity and partnership support from national income and resources could be a role model on how to assist and work a win-win bilateral collaborative network, technical assistance during threats and epidemics disaster crisis for the safe of humanity, environment and ecosystem. China health expenditure increased more than 30fold and accounted for 5.1% of the gross domestic product (GDP) in 2011. [17, 20, 22] WHO supported by other governments continues to provide necessary technical and financial support to China through renewed strategic cooperation agenda on transfer of know-how and skills to Africa in tackling infectious diseases control towards elimination. [1, 9, 20, 29] Chinese cooperation is aimed at achieving global health responsibility, which entails strengthening health systems, improving universal health coverage and reducing morbidity and mortality from major infectious diseases of poverty. Such recent efforts in the field of public health include multiple partnerships between the National Institute for Parasitic Diseases (NIPD), Shanghai with several African institutions and universities in the areas of capacity development and training, technology transfer and exchanges coordination and leadership. [19, 23, 30] Most importantly, is the implementation of malaria and schistosomiasis elimination networks across Africa (e.g., Tanzania, Zanzibar, Sudan). [17, 33] Lessons learned and technical assistance from Chinese researchers, ongoing consultation on strategic partnership could be very important in strengthening joint malaria and schistosomiasis projects network with Sudan, Cameroon, Zimbabwe, South Africa and Mali are substantial opportunities.

In addition, provision of technical support and colossal solidarity supply of personal protective equipment (PPE) in Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea were of tremendous assistance both to humanitarian frontline organizations as well as Chinese teams and local community health benefits in West Africa Ebola containments and community rehabilitation. For example, China provides funding and technology, while WHO guides technical support and coordination. [18, 19, 31] Furthermore, in 2013, The Chinese government assisted in 2013, to develop and implement strategic plans on snail control and elimination of schistosomiasis. It should be recalled that Chinese experts have provide technical assistance to Pakistan, Nepal, Lao, Myanmar, Vietnam, Nigeria, Tanzania, Angola and Namibia to assist in global polio eradication and Global Fund for malaria and HIV/AIDS and Tuberculosis (GFMAT) efforts. [14, 18, 19] China is also reducing inequalities in health and contributing to strengthening global health through supporting collaboration in the global health arena. China is strengthening national and regional priorities in line with International Health Regulations (IHR) (2005), strengthening the Asia Pacific Strategy for Emerging Diseases (APSED) network, Global Schistosomiasis Alliance (GSA) to ArboviralNet. [2, [29] [30] [31] [32] This will enhance capacity in health security and diplomatic power to create maneuver space for international multi-polar geopolitics and financial systems. China has become a giant economic power and vital component of the international commodity chain, allowing for more effective broad-based consultation and participation on global health issues and international finance via different channels by active support of multilateral diplomacy and politics. [23, 25, 30, 31] The first World Bank Trust Fund to End Poverty was established in promoting growing China's interest and role in global health development, and China's health reforms leadership in reducing poverty and strengthening both health systems resource and infrastructure investment. [24] This is essential in embracing and upholding performance-based to outcome-based financing in partners countries.

Some good examples of Chinese initiatives in global health need further assessment including the use the new partnership in optimizing institutional governance, organizational structure, social and environmental benefits towards social cohesion, healthy life and living, wellbeing of all citizens and sustainable development at all levels. [9, 14, 18, 21, 24, 29, 33] Integration of China multilateral policies in projects and programs will be a tremendous boost with the increasingly geographic expansion and spread of emerging epidemics and climate changes impacts on global health concern. Proactive China-Africa leadership commitment and investment is needed in addressing in tie-bound manner evolving local or global threats and emergency situations in endangering collective health initiatives in upholding International Health Regulations (IHR). [23] [24] [25] The sudden emergence in 2003 of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in China was a vivid example of how international health cooperation in the future depends on a better appreciation of the meaning of modernization, as interpreted by each country, and recognition that modernization itself is a complexity of many factors. [24, 25] Future multilateral cooperation will be influenced by strategic innovative multi-sectoral partnerships, health programming and resource mobilization, bilateral to multilateral governance systems, creation of enabling institutional space, effectiveness and outcomes impact.

New and advanced health diplomacy, and foreign health policy in public health systems is an important point of entry and worth pursuing by the joint China and Africa interests and values. [23, 26, 30, 31] Health as an instrument of foreign diplomacy and policy presents several mutual gains both for community and its populations' protection. Safety and security are health priorities that can be improved through further public health development cooperation. International multilateralism in health development under China-Africa partnership holds great promise in increasing opportunities and businesses and diminishing traditional unilateralism over time. [27] [28] [29] Nurturing sustainable joint institutional projects that promote community-based programs could be vital for active engagement in policy discourse, participation and community empowerment. The UN's sustainable development policy functions and goals coordination will be overtaken by global partnerships or other agencies to develop new international health norms and standards. [27, 28, 30, 31, 34, 35] Ultimately, the quality and effectiveness of China-Africa health development initiatives and programs, when channeled through government and institutions partnerships, have the potential strengths in improving good governance and accountability in global health security. [29, [32] [33] [34] [35] 

China's economic importance in improving China-Africa health development initiatives in strengthening contextual health priorities and programs is imperative. Fostering China-Africa innovative evidence-based national health policies and health operational joint solutions and strategies is critical in advancing healthcare delivery access to, availability and effective implementation. Moreover, in shaping programs and interventions benefits in further improving UHC, SDGs in attaining global health and economic prosperity in Africa.

On the contrary, south-south cooperation refers to cooperative activities between newly industrialized southern countries and others in the south to find solutions to common development challenges including those related to health and health care. 1 For instance, health technology transfer has some unique characteristics, including discontinuous changes and multiplier effects, in that relatively low-tech or mid-level interventions such as immunization and drug treatment of selective conditions can have dramatic results in improvement of life expectancies initially. 2 Then a plateau","is reached when increasing risks of technology (eg, drug resistance, cost, and inadequate care) increase disease burdens and have a negative effect unless overall improvement in basic needs and infrastructure is ensured. High-end technology transfer without development in health infrastructures and basic social needs can be counterproductive without equity and distributional aspects of health policy. 3 In 1978, the Third World Non-Aligned Group of nearly 120 nations urged the United Nations (UN) to establish a Special Unit for South-South Cooperation (SSC) within the UN Development Program. Despite uneven progress, 3 decades later, the organization reviewed experiences, trends, and achievements at the SSC Developmental Expo. 4 Several commentaries emphasized the slow progress on issues of social justice and poverty reduction but identified some dramatic achievements related to some of the millennium development goals (MDGs) (ie, health improvement through overall development and provision of primary care services). Emerging south-south collaborations and the expanding role of countries like Brazil, South Africa, India, Malaysia, Korea, and China were highlighted. These emerging donor countries are also in transition following the pattern of Japan, which was both donor and recipient of aid in the 1960s, 5 and later became a major aid provider, a trend shown among Asia Pacific Academic Consortium for Public Health (APACPH) members from East and South Asia. The African-South American (ASA) collaboration had grown to 62 countries and, although primarily focusing on energy and trade, has begun to focus on issues of peace, security, and health needs such as in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/AIDS relief and poverty reduction. The level of assistance from emerging donors like China, India, Brazil, and others has grown to nearly 10% of overall development assistance. 6 The nonaligned summit observed that SSC has been relatively successful in reducing south dependence and in creating a shift in the international balance of power. 7 Brazil's form of south-south development aid, which is less conditional and more acceptable, has been called a ""global model in waiting."" 8 The emerging south in Asia shows 2 levels in transition: the East Asian Tigers (S1 countries) and the Southeast Asian countries (S2 countries) like Malaysia and Thailand, which have grown economically and moved up in overall human development indices. 9 The distinctions and locations of the geographic south, therefore, are now less categorical and definitions are more blurred. International technological dualism (unequal developments in the area of science and technology between rich and poor countries postulated in the 1970s 10 ) has also been challenged with the growing technological achievements and scientific publications in south countries like India, China, and Malaysia. Similarly, the digital divide, referring to the major gap in information and communication technology development, 11 does not seem to hold true in the emerging south, such as Korea, Malaysia, Hong Kong, Thailand, and Taiwan. Furthermore, the use of advanced medical technologies in these countries is as high or in some cases even higher and more cost-effective than in the north. 12 Despite this paradox, it was estimated that 88% of all Internet users are from industrialized countries that comprise only 15% of the world's population. 11, 13 In that sense, the Internet, hailed as a ""great equalizer,"" 14 a revolutionary technological tool to transfer information on a global scale, has not served the poorer countries and has effectively protected the richer nations in pandemics like severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and H1N1. 15 The dream ""for poorer villages and isolated communities to have a well-placed computer to serve like a communal well providing essential information about epidemics and medical services for villagers"" 16 is still a far cry for the poorer south. The transference of health technology in specific disease entities through vaccines and drugs (the medicalization model of health assistance) has been remarkably successful. On the other hand, the limited research resources for health problems in the south with emphasis on research interests of the north adds a barrier to enhancement of south-south academic partnerships and maintains the north-south gradient of expertise and dependence. 17 However, research of complex conditions such as HIV/AIDS, malaria, diabetes, heart disease, and cancers, which are deeply rooted in poverty, environment, lifestyles, and occupation require longterm commitment and a research strategy that promotes south universities' competency and leadership in examining conditions and contexts beyond medical constructs and solutions. The emerging interest in social determinants of health and noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) has the potential to promote south-south partnerships relevant to local conditions and needs. In addition, south-south collaboration between higher-education institutions often has more shared interest in research priority, capacity building, and problem-based research training. Under conditions requiring social participation and reform, south involvement and leadership in human resource development is essential. However well meaning and altruistic it may be, the steep north-south gradient in the medicalization model needs to be flattened in partnerships with leading universities in the south. This initiative of using the expertise of lead universities in the south to support more regional and national networks and private partners within countries is a strategic lesson that APACPH learnt in its early years. Similar to land grant universities in the United States and universities in Canada and South America, south universities have a strong orientation for service and a common bond of social responsibility. That tradition has a sound basis in creating a global nexus to promote south-south partnerships. Future educational reforms advocated for health professionals 18 and problem-solving research recommended in global health practice 19 have the potential to increase relevance and support for a multiple-level societal and policy involvement for health. In such endeavors north consortia support to south-south partnerships would be valuable.

Health as a human right and primary health care as a means of promoting health for all globally 20 are underlying values of APACPH. Most universities and agencies with wellestablished global health track records essentially contribute to the World Health Organization (WHO) ideal, but each institution interprets according to its own priorities, assets, and expertise, largely enhanced through consortia arrangements. 21 In the late 1970s, postcolonial national movements and underlying cultural values in voluntarism for health improvement such as the Sarvodaya Shramadana movement 22 served as a rallying point for university collaboration in Asia. The Cold War era that made health assistance a key strategy to influence foreign nations also attracted US universities to participate largely in family planning and maternal and child health (MCH) programs abroad. These trends in social responsibility, voluntarism, and health assistance to promote equity provided the context and climate for the founding of APACPH. The synergy and support of international organizations such as WHO, the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), and the World Bank, and financial support of the US Agency for International Development, shaped the early directions of APACPH. The peace dividends for health in the post-Cold-War period of the 1990s provided additional stimulus in child survival programs, including control of diarrheal disease and upper respiratory infection. 23, 24 Often priorities and issues that APACPH selected were those advocated by member institutions in the south. For example, activities and policy changes to improve the neglected female child although challenging were initiated by the Institute of Medicine of Nepal. 25, 26 Similarly, priority for the health of indigenous people was also strongly advocated by member institutions such as Stabilizing South-South Academic Collaboration Curtin University, Australia, Kalinga Institute of Industrial Technology (KIIT), India, and the University of Hawaii, all of which have a long-standing tradition in working with indigenous populations. 27 It was the inherent commitment and experience of members on issues of common concern that brought them together rather than the opportunity to access donor resources. Using seed grants these small groups have generated external resources and support from their own institutions to further common goals. The south member, KIIT, the largest educational complex globally for indigenous people, is planning in partnership with a select group of north and south members in APACPH to develop a unique training-oriented, service-oriented, and research-oriented global health graduate program for indigenous people. Successes in common but challenging problems such as these have brought cohesion and convergence among APACPH members. It has ensured expertise through joint efforts. The negative effects of such a model are many: waning motivation, delays in start-up, and breakdown in supplies and services as resources are diminished. Sub-regional networks of 3-5 members addressing common problems are adjusting to these challenges by: tapping partner resources for projects in advance, pacing implementation of projects, supporting local initiatives and providing reinforcement through other related activities (eg, agriculture, nutrition, family planning, urban and indigenous people's development). These sub-regional clusters through such mechanisms have been successful in seeking additional resources from national and global agencies.

Conflicts between intrinsic values and operational challenges often lead to compromises in global health practice. Health as integral to human development has been universally recognized from ancient times in the Asia Pacific region, as noted in the Asoka Edicts (269-231 BC), reflecting the notion of a benevolent monarch safeguarding health of the people. This personal individualistic approach has expanded across Asian societies largely through communal perspectives, religious concepts, and charitable practices of dhana (Hinduism-Buddhism), zakat (Islam), and tithe in Christianity. The establishment of hospitals and clinics, such as the world's oldest hospital in Mihintale, Sri Lanka, 28 evolved out of that perspective: the highest value in that culture is the physician-king, embodying the state's responsibility for health and well-being of people. During the colonial era, missionaries expanded the caring traditions beyond national borders, taking care of the sick and those stigmatized by diseases such as leprosy (Hansen disease). Remnants of leprosy hospitals and settlements can be seen dotted across the coastline of Asia, including the one established by Father Damien in Kalaupapa, Hawaii. 29 The work of Mother Teresa and her order in India and more than 120 other countries is a striking reminder of the evolution of missionary health care in Asia. 30 Missionary zeal and altruism remain underlying values among global health practitioners, carrying that imprimatur of charity without the overt intent to proselytize. In the poorer countries adequate care is the luxury afforded to the upper strata of society. This observation is also true to a certain extent even in affluent countries such as the United States, where there are nearly 45 million uninsured people. 31 The dilemma of balancing human rights and cost of care polarizes politics, making health care reform a constant challenge. 31 Hence, health as a universal human right, although acknowledged in the constitution of WHO (1946) and in numerous international treaties, has been mostly symbolic for the needy urban and rural populations. Ideologies, values, practices, and prejudices, not merely the lack of resources, still maintain the disparities in health for significant segments of the global population. 32 In this dilemma one realizes that health equity is the central challenge for universities in global health.

Medical voluntarism is prevalent in the United States and is often linked to religious organizations and universities with a long-standing tradition of providing development assistance for health (DAH). 33 The emergence of university consortia as a composite that is greater in the sum of its expertise and resources than individual members is a more recent phenomenon. It is estimated that less than 100 consortia are in the United States, of which about 20% to 30% are involved in global health. Several of them are well established and linked to prestigious universities with 5 to 10 institutional members. APACPH and the Global Health Education Consortium (GHEC) are the more established consortia, which have been functioning for nearly 25 and 20 years, respectively. Consortia are dynamic, even unstable at stages in their development, and are constantly challenged for resources. Leadership issues are not uncommon and are more linked to resources than policy, country, or affiliations. Economics of scale and complementarities of skills in organizations tend to form partnerships or mergers, providing resources and stability. The recently founded Consortium of Universities for Global Health (CUGH, 2008) is one of the larger university alliances in the United States. Besides the traditional fields of medicine, nursing, and public health, CUGH has the potential of accelerating advocacy for global health and involving several other disciplines such as engineering, law, agriculture, veterinary medicine, and social sciences. Responding to the increase in DAH funding in the United States, there has been a striking increase in the overall number of universities and their top leadership promoting university-wide involvement in global health (CUGH, 2009). 34 Global health training in universities across the United States has accelerated, and this trend is a giant step in bringing contentious professions to serve synergistically together in DAH. Some of these developments may be cosmetic and opportunistic but nevertheless they have provided stimulus and momentum to a field that was overwhelmed by global crises, burnout, and a growing paralysis because of lack of resources.

The size of DAH can support or overwhelm recipient countries and control the focus and direction of their health programs. Many south countries in Asia depended on DAH for basic health services. 35 The size of DAH for particular diseases can also distort the pattern of health development in terms of overall health needs and maintenance of health services. 36 Historical evidence of the failure of vertical eradication programs is easily forgotten with the growing potential and efficacy of vaccinerelated prevention and mass drug treatment models. Under such circumstances, collaborating south universities become compliant to north interests in the focus of research and selective short-term benefits. Long-term sustainable outcomes requiring investment in infrastructures are often sacrificed. 37 There are several ethical and strategic concerns that DAH needs to address. One obvious concern is that with the massive DAH, there is a likely convergence of donor interests and a concurrent trend of north university leadership to spearhead that effort.

Focus Direction

This situation has been common in the past, with focus on a few selected diseases and selective approaches. The theoretical justifications, although valid in restricted contexts, have been found wanting in a broader social and health context or in long-term outcomes. South voices can be silenced to compliance and disadvantage. Many global health practitioners and scientists have questioned in hindsight the usefulness and limitations of selective programs. In a recent commentary both ethical and strategic concerns on DAH were addressed. 38 Therefore it is critical that south coalitions are supported to realistically address underlying problems (the social and economic constructs in health) rather than the short-term measures that a developed country can successfully implement based on supporting systems and levels of development in sanitation, child care, and nutrition. That has been the perennial challenge not only in global health in poor countries but in the health improvement of the disadvantaged communities in affluent countries. The continuum in DAH from altruism through enlightened self-interest to soft medical diplomacy or hard mercenary or military opportunism is full of ethical dimensions in which the recipients of aid can be manipulated to become passive, coerced, or corrupted, often having little to say. The value of north consortia is their transparency and capacity to support and empower collegial south universities to address problems realistically and help them serve as ombudsmen for health and build south-south consortia that will help not only to solve emergencies but also to build processes to maintain and sustain health improvement.

Historically, colonization of the south had a predominantly military and mercenary perspective in providing health care. Even although such an overt polarization is not visibly articulated, bilateral aid arrangements still follow that model, with variations and compromises tempered with the missionary medicine approach. University consortia have overcome such tendencies and constantly show humanitarian aspects in their global health contributions, supporting the proposed notion of enlightened selfinterest for global health involvement (Fig. 1) . 39 Detractors, critics, and reasonable purists will continue to have reservations, realizing the conditions of need and the size of DAH. The need for repackaging, refinement, and justification for DAH is a continuously challenging process both nationally and internationally. Major epidemics like smallpox and the recent SARS and swine flu push the panic button to invest in protecting others outside our borders to protect us. Then one realizes that all of us are intimately connected in issues of health through germs, food, water, and air. Yet the realization that global health is linked to violence, war, disasters, and economic poverty is not easy, unless touched by killer tornadoes (United States, 2011) or the Asian tsunami (2004), which drowned a village thousands of miles away, or a nuclear disaster (Japan, 2011), which caused thousands to be evacuated. The application of benefit-accrued models such as in the eradication of smallpox is valid. To promote their acceptance in the context of NCDs has been challenging certainly in the United States, especially in the poorer communities, where structural changes as well as behavioral and medical interventions are needed. The challenges will be similar, or even greater, in developing countries. Successes in reducing NCD burden in developing countries with poor living conditions may not be so prominent as those for emerging infectious diseases. However, initiatives such as tobacco control (China) and oral cancer prevention (India, Sri Lanka, Taiwan) offer leverage to initiate and Altruism Opportunism

Enlightened Self Interest expand to comprehensive strategies through south-south partnerships. University consortia have shown effectiveness in meeting local health needs through research, training, and service networks. The shift of balance from the visibility of pandemics and disasters to the major burden of NCD and its multidimensional nature is a major conceptual shift from treatment to prevention and socioeconomic changes. That paradigm shift will require a collective educational response of universities both in the south and in the north to acknowledge and address monster problems that are buried in the iceberg of NCDs, where the diseases are manifestation of multiple conditions that are significantly rooted in the context of where and how people live. The models of comprehensive preventive health in the prominent NCDs such as cancers, obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and mental health are rudimentary in contrast to the ballooning needs in the south. China illustrates the tragic impact of the ballooning effect of smoking and tobacco use, diminishing its major health and economic gains.

Other forms of justification for DAH are the potential to serve in medical diplomacy that has been increasingly used in disaster relief. 40 Unlike the military, most universities are ill equipped as first responders in the global disaster arena. They are more efficient in providing disaster preparedness training and facilitating postdisaster long-term rehabilitation and reconstruction. However, disaster assistance with high visibility on the global stage is a temptation for universities and consortia to show their commitment at high cost and low effectiveness. Yet universities that have a primary mission to global humanitarian service as a long-standing tradition and expertise can be successful. For example Tzu Chi University, an APACPH member, is well prepared for disaster relief through its foundation as well as its global networks and partners. Such networks, often religious, tend to overcome access barriers such as political barriers that were evident during the Nargis cyclone, which killed more than 138,000 and displaced more than 2 million people in Myanmar. One of the unspoken realities in DAH is the politics in aid with bilateral agreements that dominate, and military and trade priorities that predominate. Even thoughtful aid administrators have little flexibility in overriding their governmental earmarks. Visibility in aid and more visibility in DAH have become an inevitable phenomenon, if not the key component in DAH, because it provides leverage to raise funds but also places pressure on showing immediate success. In the process there is systemic distortion (ie, all inputs go into 1 health problem: a clearly definable disease and its elimination; a distortion of overall reality). For example, the eradication of malaria was not possible by use of pesticide or mass drug administration alone without significant improvements in environment and human habitation. There are few places where there is total drug resistance and pesticide resistance. The need for balanced comprehensive approaches seems logical but of course more expensive and not so immediate. That is the paradox and motivating energy in DAH. Various scientific models justify the validity of the approaches advocated, not adequately recognizing external environments and other problems not of their immediate concern. Yet lessons in failure because of tunnel vision are not easily seen much less learnt in DAH as competing interests, technology, and visibility for success take priority.

In this aid environment, DAH has built high-tech hospitals to placate leaders of aid receipt. However, these high-profile institutions drain the services of doctors and nurses from much-needed urban and rural areas. This pharaoh effect of visible aid that does more for the donor than for recipients is seen in deteriorating hospitals in the Pacific islands, lacking maintenance or staffing. 41 As recipient countries and donors become more realistic, there is better rationalization and use of DAH such as in overall health improvement, addressing highly visible problems using low-cost interventions. Review of major aid agencies of DAH programs show that, although they have a distinct focus in their health assistance programs, more often they are competitive and duplicative rather than complementary. Although reinforcement is a useful paradigm in sustaining health improvement, one of the serious problems seen during the family planning era of the 1970s to 1980s in Asia was that the villages were flooded with paid community volunteers creating competing systems staffed with poorly paid government workers, a phenomenon that is repeating itself in parts of Africa. The driving force for instant success and visibility by donors in poor countries is a tragedy that is often repeated; raising expectations without the commitment or resources to sustain efforts through improved local systems. Political agendas predominate in DAH. However, as countries providing assistance gain experience and recipient countries gain skills in negotiation, DAH packages with greater flexibility and relevance emerge from building hospitals to supporting infrastructures, outreach, transport, disease prevention, and health education, as is increasingly seen in the aid provided by Japan and other emerging donor countries. University consortia, especially south-south consortia, can provide leadership to such policy determinations in infrastructure building and outreach. The University of Sabah Medical School, in partnership with APACPH member universities that were involved in rural/island health, established a Center of Excellence in Rural Health in 2008 to provide visibility and credibility on rural health research and training.

Direct emergency assistance through the military is common, especially for health, and is an immediate response in most countries but is often delayed in the United States. However, military assistance seems more prompt and more acceptable internationally during major disasters such as the Indian Ocean tsunami, when US Navy Hospital Ship Mercy significantly contributed to posttsunami relief in Asia. 42 Whatever the range of often overlapping motivations is, the resurgence of interest in global health has led to a dramatic increase in course offerings, joint projects, and programs across medical, public health, and nursing schools. There is a vision for health professionals to have a global perspective in caring-curing skills to serve in global settings. US universities, especially as consortia, not only have the potential, but the collective experience to make that expectation a reality. Expansion of global health training into a formal federally funded global health corps has been suggested. 43 Medical residency programs, including pediatrics, geriatrics, disaster management, and emergency medicine, are providing greater emphasis on global health training and overseas placements. 44, 45 Consortia such as GHEC have provided long-standing leadership in education and promoting interinstitutional partnerships with south consortia. Interuniversity collaborations at national and regional levels continue to further evolve in North America, Latin America-Caribbean nations, and recently in Europe. The influx of DAH funds from government and foundation sources seems to be a key catalyst. 46 What is exciting about the expansion in government and philanthropic engagement in global health is that several models to support south-south partnerships are likely to evolve as the emerging south countries take leadership to access more effectively global health resources. In the development of APACPH sustained support for national and regional networks was found to be a key step in capacity building (see Fig. 1 ).

There is much that DAH and university participation can reaffirm, whether in the north or south, especially through consortia. Raising common concerns to the common problems among vulnerable populations levels the playing fields for all. In that process, a fundamental lesson that APACPH learnt was that university consortia need to continue to bridge north-south boundaries and bring relevance to the passion to serve. This essence of global health, the sense of a common humanity, the drive that keeps a doctor, a nurse, or a health worker struggling to keep a child alive, to help a mother with a safe delivery, to prevent a cancer death (whether rich or poor, whether in hospital or a village clinic, or a home) is the same motivation that bridges the gaps between altruism and opportunism in global health.

The World Wide Web and the instant sharing of tragedies, disasters, and pandemics alike on a global scale through television images and multimedia have brought a high degree of awareness of the widely prevalent pathetic human conditions both in the upper-income, middle-income, and low-income countries. Along with popular concerns during catastrophes, the increased participation of celebrities, major philanthropists, and government has created an unprecedented climate for global contributions to specific health causes such as HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria. 46 The global media lens has shown that disasters often define and expose vulnerabilities of health systems for elderly people (Katrina, 2005; Japan, 2011) and the chronicity of neglect in sanitation (postearthquake disaster and cholera outbreak in Haiti). The stark differences and inequalities in health have become globally apparent through television lenses. In this complex developmental melee, universities serve as conduits for knowledge, technical expertise, and resources. They have made major contributions in selectively directing the improvements for global health. Instant communication and the dramatic increase in disaster reporting have accelerated the focus on health. On the negative side are tendencies for trivializing tragedy and demanding unrealistic results. The last decade has seen a significant increase in disasters. There were 385 disasters between 2000 and 2009, an increase of 233% from 1980 to 1989 and of 67% from 1990 to 1999. 39 Hurricane Katrina (2005) and a string of megadisasters and pandemics in the Asia Pacific region have filled media screens and brought home instantly how globally connected we are. In this era of disasters and pandemics, the south universities and research centers have been in the spotlight, either blamed or recognized. During that time, north-south collaboration has enhanced the credibility and expertise of institutions in the south in outbreak surveillance, infection control, and disaster management. Disasters and pandemics in the last decade have also created a stimulus for networking among APACPH members. The first APACPH Collaborating Center of Excellence for Injury Prevention and Disaster Management was established in 2005 in the Taipei Medical University, with links to the National Emergency Medical Center and the emergency medicine departments at 3 university hospitals and the School of Public Health. In addition, 3 other member universities, 2 from the south and 1 from the north, served as additional partners in training, research, and emergency relief. The Collaborating Center has provided training for educators and experts from the south in fields including disaster management in pandemics (SARS) and humanitarian relief in various contexts (Asian tsunami, earthquakes, and typhoons in Taiwan, Indonesia, China, and the Philippines). Taiwan, as the typhoon corridor in the North Pacific, being regularly exposed to earthquakes, monsoonal floods, and the largest number of typhoons every year, is geographically well located for the study of natural disasters. 47 The Center of Excellence also serves as a research center where Masters and doctoral students, health professionals, and health and hospital administrators have been trained. Research has identified several recurring problems: loss of communication and data early in disasters, leading to the impression of the loss of truth as the first symptom in any disaster; surveillance; crisis communication; and crisis management. The Collaborating Center of Excellence model developed by APACPH serves further to promote south-south exchanges and build credibility and expertise through such networks. The model has been expanded to address other needs in the Asia Pacific region Stabilizing South-South Academic Collaboration such as the epidemic of oral cancer associated with betel nut and tobacco chewing, and rural/island health. The Center for Peace and Health devoted to reduction of conflicts and violence through health initiatives has also been established.

As the focus in health generally shifts to emergencies in the global arena (epidemics and disasters), the less visible problem of NCDs has been neglected. The growing burden of NCDs in the south has since been recognized by APACPH. University presidents and senior academic leadership have become actively involved in highlighting the problem of NCD. There is growing recognition that education for health needs to begin at the core undergraduate level for personal behavioral issues (drugs, smoking diet, and violence) as well as to gain skills in cultural competencies and understanding of community structures and policies. Therefore university-wide educational reform for global health at undergraduate level with a focus on interdisciplinary partnership at the graduate level is being planned. The key and integrating strategy is to focus on community-level applied problem-solving research. These directions are based on university president consultative meetings with senior faculty and administrators during 2008 to 2011. Presidents and Global Health Conference declarations have documented support for these and follow-up actions. 48, 49 

APACPH was founded in Kauai in 1984 with 5 university members represented by deans of medical and schools of public health. As a buildup to the formation of the consortium, many University presidents, and ministers of health and law from founding member countries attended the signing ceremony. National and international nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) including the US Centers for Disease Control, WHO, UNICEF, and the World Bank were represented. The founding mission and values were to emphasize health as human right and primary health care as a priority in the achievement of health equity. 50, 51 The founding Dean from the School of Public Health in the University of Hawaii was Dr Jerrold Michael. The organization has grown slowly and deliberately to 67 members in 21 countries in 25 years. East to West it now spans from the University of Kazakhstan in Alma Ata (now Almaty), to George Washington University in the United States; north to south it extends from Tokyo University Medical School to Auckland University School of Public Health. 52 Six stages in the development of APACPH have been identified (Fig. 2) .

In the formative first decade, the newly established organization focused on vision and mission (stage 1); development of leadership through the WHO Collaborating Center for Leadership (stage 2); and small-scale research, service, and intervention projects for vulnerable populations (stage 3), which enhanced the social responsibility of south universities as well as faculty and student participation from the north. In this decade, resources mainly came from the north.

The growth and development in the second decade show the growing leadership influence from the emerging south: East Asia and Southeast Asia, the economically advanced group of countries where largely self-supporting regional offices and networks were established (stage 4). The setup of regional office enables selected countries in the region to initiate national network building (eg, Thailand, China, and Indonesia).

During the maturation and stabilization of the third decade, Centers of Excellence were established, using a senior partnership of the south with selective expertise and some limited resources coming from the north (stage 5). The establishment of a Web-based International Cyber University for Health (ICUH), and enhanced university leadership (presidents) have created a synergy for global health in partnership with the ministries of health and global health agencies. Such partnerships have initiated university-wide educational reforms for global health (President's Declaration on Global Health, Taiwan, 2009; President's Declaration on Non-Communicable Diseases, Bali, 2010). The development and strengthening of national networks of south-south universities with a collective focus on local problems is the priority at this stage of development in APACPH.

The predominance of the emerging south within the S-N-S organization is as follows. To date 23.5% of APACPH membership is represented by north universities, and 76.5% is made up of universities from 3 groups of south countries: S1 (12.5%), S2 (22%), and S3 (42%) using the country classification created by the World Bank (Fig. 3) . 53 

Four key catalysts in the development of the south-south-north collaborative model were identified.

1. Leadership that began as a genuinely shared north-south leadership, not merely tokenism, developed into a cohort of senior and sustained leadership of the south with a consultative expert role for the north. The leadership development model strongly endorsed in the early stages had its problems. The quick turnover of academic leadership such as deans and presidents in Asia, sometimes every 2 years in some countries, made it necessary to build a tier of support. The stature of the early leadership cohort and the support of global leaders of WHO and Stabilizing South-South Academic Collaboration UNICEF, as well as regional and national leaders, maintained the momentum in the first decade. 2. Resources were primarily from 1 source in the north (United States) in the initial stages. Subsequently, multiple funding sources were developed from other north members including Japan and Australia. In the later stages, the emerging south countries in East Asia (S1) and Southeast Asia (S2) assumed the major responsibility for funding through the Regional Center and Centers of Excellence. 3. The era of disasters and pandemics provided rapid exposure to the expertise and creativity of faculty and professionals and capacity of institutions in Asia to respond to these challenges. The ability to respond promptly to local conditions also gave leverage to south partners. The high-tech with high-touch cultural competencies in times of need with humanitarian response served to build credibility and trust, even under politically sensitive conditions among members. The APACPH Collaborating Centers in Injury Prevention and Disaster Management, Oral Cancer Prevention, Rural and Island Health, and Peace and Health brought together the expertise and commitment to address issues of common concern with resources largely coming from the lead university in the south and collaborating partners and donors from the north. No. Members Fig. 3 . APACPH membership growth in its first 25 years. Note. S1: south membership from countries in East Asia; S2: south membership from economically advanced countries in Southeast Asia; S3: south membership from economically slower developing countries in the south. Initially there was rapid growth of northern members, providing resources initially from the United States and later from Japan and Australia during the first decade;

The growth of the south membership from East Asia (S1) and Southeast Asia (S2) enhanced resource support in the second decade. More active recruitment of low-income countries (S3) through regional networks is seen in the later phases, with in-kind matching contribution from them in the third decade.

visibility the journal from its inception served to encourage excellence and focus on promising researchers from the south. The editorial team in partnership with major publishing houses has conducted workshops on research and publishing for junior faculty and students. b. ICUH was founded in 2003 in collaboration with Yonsei University and was established to use the World Wide Web to advance public health and medical training for students and health professionals from countries with limited resources and access to undergraduate and graduate courses such as Mongolia and Vietnam. ICUH offers a focused course in 3 areas: disaster management in response to natural disasters and pandemics; public health certificate courses; and Masters of Public Health courses. Additional efforts were made to provide the courses in the region's native language. c. The recent 42nd APACPH Global Health Conference held in Bali focused on NCDs. NCDs have become the major public health priority in APACPH with a focus on research, service, and partnership with national and global health agencies and ministries of health. The Global Health Conference also serves as an Asia Pacific forum for health policy issues and recognition of leadership largely from the south. Regional conferences and national activities continue to maintain the momentum and strengthen the network at the national level. d. The Early Career Network (ECN) was established in 2006 after the Asian tsunami and has evolved to a small but dynamic network that serves as support groups to relief operations. They have now begun to work closely with the Collaborating Centers and in the conduct of international meetings and photography exhibitions. An important function served by ECN is to bridge the gap between university education and professional practice and maintain commitment to global health issues.

With a flat, shared leadership organizational structure and limited resources of the south-north-south model, several strategies have evolved to maintain the stability of the organization. A central rotating secretariat usually managed by a north university with significant decentralization of operations to officers and regional offices has been progressively developed. The decentralization process was initiated to enhance participation of the south as well as to restrict bureaucratic overgrowth. Consequently the responsibility to provide service and to raise funds was assumed by key institutions in the south. The Centers of Excellence, ICUH, and the journal office are largely self-supporting, maintained by respective south universities, providing an expanded resource pool for the organization. The ECN of young professionals is also south driven. Besides these organizational strategies, resource contribution shifted from the north to the emerging south in the latter part of the first decade, with a growing responsibility of the south members in the second decade to contribute significantly in kind and in local expenses including the funding and management of major conferences (see Fig. 2 ). The partnership with local and global NGOs and ministries of health provided the third stabilizer. The fourth component in this stabilization process is the ongoing development of the south national network of members and NGOs, and the access to resources.

The classic model for health assistance has been an N-S conduit, the prevalence of which has produced dependence, control, exploitation, and reciprocal corruption of the donor and recipient systems. The early efforts of the consortium was to disperse Stabilizing South-South Academic Collaboration a large number of small grants on operational research and problem-solving capacities related to infectious disease control, MCH, and family planning. The emphasis was to use simple techniques and culturally appropriate strategies to ensure sustainability. These practices also leveled the academic exchanges between the north and south. During the epidemics and pandemics of SARS, avian flu, Nipah virus, swine flu, and H1N1, APACPH members provided leadership in research training and services, showing south competency. The north members supplemented the efforts through technical support and other resources. The south leadership was critical in promoting health equity and addressing sensitive issues such as neglect of female children, abuse of elderly people, and stigmatized health conditions such as HIV/AIDS. In poor countries, efforts to control or eradicate major infectious diseases by medication alone without addressing underlying social conditions and investing on infrastructure have limited success. Success requires a comprehensive primary health care approach, with involvement of key ministries besides health. In this challenge, APACPH has supported lead institutions and national and regional networks to network with NGOs to achieve common goals. For instance, the Collaborating Centers of Excellence for Oral Cancer Prevention in Asia Pacific emerged as a response to the fast-growing problem of oral cancer (in epidemic proportions in some countries) related to betel nut chewing in Asia. 54 The center is linked to cancer prevention and humanitarian organizations that rehabilitate individuals with major disfigurements and stigma. These challenges have also helped revitalize the organization's own values and commitment to redefine collectively what is unacceptable for health in the south societies as well as what is feasible with limited resources. In the context of oral cancer, the reduction of betel nut chewing is our top priority. Similarly, networks based on problem-solving efforts such as in injury prevention, indigenous health, and peace through health initiatives are being promoted. The model of health as a bridge to peace is being expanded in curricula, conferences, and publications. 55, 56 SUMMARY Twenty-five years is a benchmark for any organization, more so in fragile international partnerships. Limited resources, rapid turnover in leadership in south universities, growing disinterest in north universities as control and power shifts to the south, slow membership growth and uneven resource support, which is largely voluntary, and organizational changes have all had a negative effect to various degrees. Despite those limitations, there is an overall sense of achievement particularly in the ability of the south's capacity to take over and manage APACPH successfully and contribute through the collective partnership. The boundaries of north and south have really almost completely blurred. From small beginnings, the annual conferences have grown to become a major global health event attracting university presidents, ministers, global health organizations, and local communities together in reinforcing policy initiatives and improving efficacy. The development of Collaborating Center and ICUH has created small but vibrant networks. In-country networks and south-south partnerships have stabilized as membership levels reached a healthy functional level of 3 to 5 in-country members. An ongoing strategy to revitalize in-country and regional networks is built in through national and regional conferences and partnership in national public health and medical organizations. Member university presidents have also begun to use APACPH networks and the Global Health Conferences to foster the social responsibility of universities whether in indigenous health, urbanization, or MDG-related goals. There have been sustained efforts to recognize and retain south leadership. Over the past 25 years, a total of 65 APACPH awards for excellence in leadership, research, teaching, and services have been given to leaders from the south. A Global Health Ambassadors program to retain the influence of leadership has been instituted. Capacity building has been slow but sustained, and has become south driven. Nearly 100 faculty and students received scholarships for their Masters and doctoral studies in the first 10 years through the WHO Collaborating Center at APACPH member universities, mostly in the north. It is estimated that more than 1000 faculty and students have been supported in short-term programs at member universities in the last 20 years. More than 60% of that support came from south universities, including the 4 APACPH Collaborating Centers. Each year, 10 to 15 APACPH travel grants are awarded to students and junior faculty to attend annual and regional conferences. APACPH members provide additional matching awards. The APACPH Global Health Conferences have therefore become a real opportunity for learning and exchange. Global health leaders and university presidents from many countries add their perspectives on global health equity across nations, the founding values of APACPH, reenergizing the commitment to primary health care and the MDGs. These acts of rededication of the social responsibility of universities to local and global communities touch the cornerstone of the social and environmental constructs in health. The beliefs and actions that emerge are value laden. In imperfect organizations like a university consortium there have been significant compromises and accommodation both by the north and the south. Yet the common goals and core activities have been revitalized by the members, especially the leadership of young global health professionals, whose dedication in serving the populations in need will sustain the collaboration.

Promoting public health legal preparedness for emergencies: review of current trends and their relevance in light of the Ebola crisis,"Background: Public health legal preparedness (PHLP) for emergencies is a core component of the health system response. However, the implementation of health legal preparedness differs between low-and middleincome countries (LMIC) and developed countries. Objective: This paper examines recent trends regarding public health legal preparedness for emergencies and discusses its role in the recent Ebola outbreak. Design: A rigorous literature review was conducted using eight electronic databases as well as Google Scholar. The results encompassed peer-reviewed English articles, reports, theses, and position papers dating from 2011 to 2014. Earlier articles concerning regulatory actions were also examined. Results: The importance of PHLP has grown during the past decade and focuses mainly on infectionÁdisease scenarios. Amid LMICs, it mostly refers to application of international regulations, whereas in developed states, it focuses on independent legislation and creation of conditions optimal to promoting an effective emergency management. Among developed countries, the United States' utilisation of health legal preparedness is the most advanced, including the creation of a model comprising four elements: law, competencies, information, and coordination. Only limited research has been conducted in this field to date. Nevertheless, in both developed and developing states, studies that focused on regulations and laws activated in health systems during emergencies, identified inconsistency and incoherence. The Ebola outbreak plaguing West Africa since 2014 has global implications, challenges and paralleling results, that were identified in this review. Conclusions: The review has shown the need to broaden international regulations, to deepen reciprocity between countries, and to consider LMICs health capacities, in order to strengthen the national health security. Adopting elements of the health legal preparedness model is recommended.","P lanning for the prevention and mitigation of morbidity, mortality, and environmental damage is fundamental to public health system preparedness for emergencies (1) . An essential element in this planning process is the creation of a legal infrastructure to be activated during all phases of the emergency (2) from preevent to recovery. The existence of a legal framework is particularly important in large scale crises (3) and scenarios requiring humanitarian assistance (4) .

Public health legal preparedness (PHLP) involves more than legislation. Moulton et al. (5) defined PHLP as 'legal bench-marks or standards essential to the preparedness of that system'. Accordingly PHLP includes 1) laws/legal authorities; 2) competencies of those who apply the law; 3) information relevant for the application of the law; and 4) coordination across sectors/jurisdictions. Benjamin et al. (6) state that although these components can be broadened the improvement of legal preparedness must address all Global Health Action ae Global Health Action 2015. # 2015 Odeya Cohen et al.

Globalisation requires integrated, joint actions aimed to facilitate management of international threats including the use of PHLP.

The aim of this paper is to review recent theoretical and research trends regarding legal preparedness of the public health system for emergencies. In particular, the PHLP during the current Ebola crisis will be discussed.

Two parallel literature reviews were conducted to explore 1) theoretical and research trends of PHLP in developed countries, as well as in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs), and 2) the application of PHLP during the recent Ebola crisis. The reviews were conducted from September to December 2014 and encompassed peerreviewed articles published in English as well as reports, theses, and position papers. The study search encompassed eight electronic databases: Cochrane, LexisNexis, Proquest, PubMed, Science Direct, Scopus, Social Science Research Network, and Web of Science; the Google Scholar search engine was also employed.

The keywords used to extract relevant articles were public health, legal preparedness, and emergency. The year of publication was limited from 2011 to 2014. However, if one of the reviewed articles emphasised findings that were based primarily on specific previous models or legislative actions, these earlier articles were also reviewed. Due to the very limited findings concerning LMICs, and in order to identify elements within the context of PHLP that are implemented in those countries, additional keywords Á regulation and legislation Á were introduced to the review procedure. Articles were only included in this review if they dealt with legal aspects of emergency situations. An exclusion criterion was a focus on routine issues (e.g. the obesity epidemic). This criterion was used to screen all abstracts included in the study. In the final stage, the articles were grouped by themes.

Review of application of PHLP during the current Ebola crisis Keywords used to extract relevant articles were Ebola, public health, legal preparedness, and emergency. The review was limited to 2014. Articles were included if they focused on legal issues regarding the Ebola outbreak. This criterion was used to screen all abstracts included in the study. In the final stage, the articles were grouped by themes.

The role of PHLP in emergency response PHLP plays an important role in the overall functioning of the health system during emergencies (7, 8) . Providing legal assistance in the midst of a disaster is central to any response plan (9, 10). Adini et al. (11) found that following standard operating procedures in an emergency is crucial for assuring preparedness. Other aspects of legal preparedness relate to the status of volunteers and their ability to provide humanitarian aid after a disaster (12) .

Orenstein (13) asserts that some laws, though appropriate for routine health activities, may hinder operations during emergencies. While declaring a state of emergency may facilitate waiving laws, the implications of such waivers must be carefully evaluated. During emergencies, as maintained by Courtney et al. (14) , healthcare providers operate under challenging conditions that may require deviation from existing treatment protocols, necessitating the development of strategies to protect against legal liabilities. Similarly, Chan (15) argues in favour of granting legal immunity to private physicians to protect them against damage claims. Conversely, it is important to protect the vulnerable population from uncertified personnel performing beyond their capacity. According to Wang (4) , this issue manifests itself more intensely in situations of cross-national mutual aid that are regarded as reciprocal gestures of goodwill, where programmes cross boundaries and achieve their expected goals quickly. Thus, it is important to define obligations and rights and to establish roles, items, and standards. Other researchers (5, 6) perceived the competency of health workers as one of the core elements of PHLP.

Pandemic outbreaks inflict widespread suffering and may negatively impact international economic stability (16) . Managing pandemics involves coordinating different aspects of the health and social systems. In such situations, the law, which is a small but crucial component of emergency preparedness (8, 17) , assumes increased importance (18Á20). The speed with which viruses spread makes it imperative to ensure that a legal framework is in place to delineate mechanisms for effective epidemic management, within the country itself as well as globally (17, 21, 22) . Accordingly, efforts and reforms in this direction have been proposed and implemented worldwide, in developed countries as well as LMICs (17) from the United States to China (23) .

According to Hodge (19) , although legal reforms have occurred in the United States in the last years, three core challenges will continue to engage experts during the next decade: the legal implications of multiple emergency declarations, legal triage, and liability protection for practitioners and entities implementing crisis standards of care in response to declared emergencies (19) .

Following outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and avian flu (H5NI) in 2004Á2005, the World Health Organization (WHO) adopted the International Health Regulations (IHR), whose goal is 'to prevent, protect against, control and provide a public health response to the international spread of disease' (24). The WHO also published a checklist designed to help countries prepare effectively for infectious emergencies (25) .

The experiences of the global health system in dealing with the 2009 pandemic flu (H1N1) had a significant impact on subsequent implementation of the IHR (17, 20, 26, 27) . The IHR made valuable contributions in various areas, including issuing clear-cut reports from afflicted countries, integrating information from diverse sources, and monitoring unnecessary human rights limitations (26) . In addition, it has become a useful decision support tool (28) . However, analysis of how the IHR are applied in LMICs reveals the challenges that still lie ahead (26) . The main weakness is lack of resources and the ensuing inability to meet IHR demands and develop effective public health services (16, 17, 26, 29) . In addition, the IHR do not make allowances for local and cultural variability (17, 30Á32). Wilson et al. (26) note several arenas in which IHR application needs to be strengthened, including declaring a health emergency in international scenarios and developing mechanisms to improve compliance with WHO and IHR recommendations. Kool et al. (33) noted that in order to achieve the IHR goals it is crucial to simplify identification and detection capacities in countries lacking advanced health systems. For example, it is necessary to base disease definitions on clinical signs and symptoms without the need for laboratory confirmation (33) .

Epidemic scenarios that involve laws and PHLP concerning isolation, quarantine, and social distancing are worthy of broad attention. Limiting individual freedom in order to protect the public health has significant implications for managing infectious diseases (19, 25, 34, 35) . Preparing a legal infrastructure to administrate these situations is crucial, including declaration of an emergency situation which authorises public health officials to activate such means (19) . Nonetheless, operationalising them should not be based on legal facets alone, but should rather also consider judicial aspects. Coercion may decrease the effectiveness of protection that could be achieved through voluntary compliance. It may also increase the probability of a constitutional crisis (34). Mosher (8) notes that the law's promise of protection against abuses during an epidemic offers limited space for critics worried that individual liberties will yield to national security and public health concerns. In such cases, it is important to create an alternative framework in order to voice the views of those who are socially marginalised and have been largely silenced (8) .

The balance between individual rights and the common good A central aspect of PHLP is balancing individual needs and the common good. The need to protect individual freedom arises in all types of emergency situations, but has significant implications for the management of infectious disease outbreaks (25, 34) . Turnock (36) describes two major aims of public health laws: to protect and foster public health and to safeguard the rights of the individual. In emergency situations, imposing limitations on individual rights is unavoidable (34) . In the United States, in the 1905 Supreme Court case Jacobson v. Massachusetts the court sustained the right of the authorities to use penalties to pressure people to be vaccinated during a smallpox epidemic. This ruling interpreted the use of the public health authority and the way the court balanced two strong competing values: the public good and individual liberties (37) . Gostin (35) argues that the resulting ethical conflict is more acute in the period preceding the emergency. However, early legislation enables legal definition of individual rights, thereby facilitating optimal actions during the emergency itself (35) . According to Gerwin (34) , during pandemics, governance that assures a legal balance between the needs of the public and those of the individual enhances public trust in the authorities' ability to manage the situation. By contrast, in the wake of the 2001 terror attack in the United States, the rights of the individual were significantly curtailed by a powerful government supported by legal measures (8) .

Limited information was found regarding legal preparedness for emergencies in LMICs. Most sources focused exclusively on infectious disease management while only few related to legal aspects in the wider context of health system operation. Fischer and Kats (32) mention the rural-to-urban migration phenomenon that produces 'mega-cities' of 10 million or more inhabitants. According to United Nations estimates, three-quarters of the megacities are located in LMICs. This global trend exposes populations to disaster vulnerabilities and is associated with a dearth of risk management infrastructures Á physical, governmental, and legal (32). Nishtar et al. (38) , analysing the Pakistani health system, stated that one of its strengths is its legislative activism and the federal structure of the government, which promote the health system's ability to overcome challenges. According to them (38) , it is important to establish laws and regulations governing publicÁprivate interactions, insurance, and e-health and thus contribute towards a coordinated, joint preparedness. Van Niekerk et al. (39) found in studying South Africa that certain laws enacted for disaster risk reduction are not implemented due to lack of funds and that laws need to be updated to ensure coordination between public and private sectors.

Globally, LMICs play a crucial role in promoting prevention measures and immunisation programmes against diseases (40) . Kaddar et al. (40) contend that the focus should be on middle-rather than low-income countries. Regarding immunisation, vaccines are designated by the WHO according to the population's needs, supported by the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (41) .

An additional aspect of the legislative infrastructure relates to counterfeit medicines. Despite the efforts of the WHO (42), the regulatory structures prevailing in LMICs cannot cope with the problem of counterfeit drugs and their use (43) .

Health legal preparedness is more prevalent in developed countries compared to LMICs. Most publications dealing with PHLP focus on the creation of legal conditions (e.g. emergency declaration, legal immunity) which may promote public health preparedness for emergencies, rather than implementation of international regulations.

While the increasing importance of PHLP is a worldwide trend, it is especially well developed in the United States. The first call to address the issue of health system legislation was published by the Institute of Medicine in 1988 (44). This call was heeded after different emergency events that occurred during the first decade of the twenty-first century (the World Trade Center attack in 2001, the mailing of envelopes containing anthrax, the SARS epidemic in 2003, and Hurricane Katrina in 2005) (45) . These natural disasters and man-made events significantly impacted US society and government (35) . In addition, they demonstrated the need for a policy that would include, inter alia, a legal response defining how the health system should manage such scenarios. A health legal preparedness model was developed and adapted by the US legal and health systems. It encompasses four core components (5, 46): 1) law Á the authoritative infrastructure of public health bodies that activate the public health system, 2) competencies Á qualification of experts in areas common to legislation and health preparedness, 3) information Á updating and publicising health laws for content experts and healthcare workers and 4) coordination between legal systems and within emergency response agencies. Current publications dealing with this model discuss researching and expanding its components (45Á47), as well as broadening its application to situations that the health system faces routinely (44).

Current US literature reflects the recent improvements in the PHLP field. Studies dealing with preparedness are designed to reveal and resolve ethical and legal dilemmas in order to promote an optimal response for future situations. In addition to extensive coverage of legal aspects dealing with pandemic scenarios (3, 19, 34, 48, 49) , publications also consider the impact of PHLP on issues such as legal triage (10), motivating health workers during emergencies (2, 48, 49) , human rights during crises, legal coordination of relevant emergency bodies (10) , and the effect of an emergency declaration on health system management (2, 50) . Hodge (19) notes that upon declaration of a public health emergency the Model State Emergency Health Powers Act (2001) authorises public health officials to undertake a set of activities dealing with early detection, as well as to care for and protect public health, treat exposed or infected persons, and seek out-ofstate volunteers. The declaration is defined to inform the population, through the media, using language that is cross-culturally accessible and understandable (19) . All the items mentioned above reflect the creation of a legal infrastructure targeted for enhancing the US public health system.

In the European Union, emphasis is placed on routine application of a 'no border' policy, with minor references to emergencies (51Á53). European Union law is based on legislation (Directives and Regulations) and decisions of the Court of Justice, which intervenes when the meaning or implementation of the legislation is unclear or fails during implementation (54) . In the context of emergency preparedness, references to legal aspects focus on management of communicable disease outbreaks (21, 54, 55) . Greer et al. (54) claim that the European Union's laws play a dominant role in safeguarding the population's health, as their common laws and regulations significantly affect the health system. Nonetheless, due to factors stemming from the complexity of the European Union and the variability that exists among the European states' health systems, decisions are interpreted very generally with apparently vague provisions in the treaties. As a result, legislative interventions sometimes fail to adequately promote public health. For example, Hatzianastasiou et al. (56) found that Greek laws are aligned with accepted practices of international law in the context of communicable diseases in terms of safeguarding individual rights, but exhibit a lack of coherence, clarity, or systematisation and are often perceived as incomprehensible (56) .

In order to understand PHLP, it is vital to review studies which cover diverse types of legal management. Although this topic could be significantly broadened, the description of current trends in PHLP would be incomplete without referring to this issue. Studying PHLP during emergencies is complex, as there is a need to refer to diverse types of knowledge such as that concerning governance, policy, and perceptions of emergency professionals in order to provide meaningful insights (4).

Legal preparedness shapes the health system and its emergency response in different ways. As such, there are various methodologies that prove efficient in studying these mechanisms. The integration of legislation into emergency management still seems to be a relatively neglected area (45) . According to Jacobson et al. (45) , this is due to the lack of recognition that information about public health laws promotes best practices during emergencies. Fox (55) noted two methodological concerns regarding research on health policy governance and diseases. The first concerns the researchers' definition of governance, which influences what information they obtain and how they assess it. The second is that governance determines how diseases are conceptualised in order to make and implement policy.

Burris et al. (57) classify three types of health laws: infrastructural laws, intervention/implementation laws, and secondary legislation. Most studies in the field of law and health relate to intervention and secondary legislation and only a few relate to infrastructure and its effects on public health (52). Differences were found in the type of studies conducted in LMICs versus developed countries. In the former, the majority of studies focused on the effectiveness of infrastructural laws, international regulations, and the need for more flexible regulations (30, 58) . In developed states, studies focused on internal legislation, legal issues that might arise during emergencies, and advanced planning for future challenges (2, 19, 56) .

Most studies relating to developed countries were conducted in the United States. Differences among the individual states regarding the statutory/judicial system and the structure of healthcare agencies make it possible to investigate the effects of public health laws on the population's health. On the other hand, the variance that exists among the states influences knowledge management, which in turn affects health knowledge implementation within the framework of public health laws (59) . Rutkow et al. (2) analysed differences between individual states in an effort to identify laws that impact the public health workforce and willingness to respond to emergencies. These differences can be well noted concerning emergency management, such as ensuring accessibility of the public to information via media that is influenced by cultural characteristics as defined in the Model State Emergency Health Powers Act (2001) (19) .

Reviewing the studies relating to PHLP which were conducted in the last few years indicated that declaration of an emergency situation by the authorities was an essential component of emergency response and provided the health sector with flexibility and guidance concerning response parameters (50) . Other researchers studied perceptions regarding public health laws among organisations involved in managing emergencies. Jacobson et al. (45) found a gap between experts' perceptions of these laws and their basic aims, leading to severe deficiencies in health system preparedness. Public health and disaster management professionals may differ in their understanding of the law (47) , which hampers their ability to cooperate effectively during emergencies. According to Kaufman et al. (7) , staff training is the key to bridging differences in perception between public health workers and legal advisors. Other studies dealt with legal means for motivating healthcare workers and offering enhanced legal protection against liability while reducing the incidence of harm claims during disasters and pandemics (48, 49) . To deal with the lack of familiarity with legal preparedness, multi-professional panels were created to reach consensus concerning relevant issues (60, 61) . In both developed and underdeveloped countries, researchers that investigated regulations and laws that activate the health system during emergencies found inconsistencies and lack of coherence (56, 62, 63) .

The Ebola crisis: a case study of legal preparedness during a worldwide outbreak The Ebola outbreak clearly illustrates the involvement of legal preparedness and response during an international crisis. This section will briefly review legal issues that demonstrate the different facets of the PHLP.

The re-emergence of Ebola in 2014 in West Africa, followed by the evacuation of stricken Western healthcare workers to the United States, captured the world's attention (64, 65) . The fatality rate of the Ebola outbreak ranged from 36 to 74% (66) . Affected countries are characterised by limited resources and political instability, with low capacity health systems and a lack of essential equipment and personnel. The probability that the Ebola virus will take root in a high-resource country is small (64, 65, 67) .

The Ebola crisis displayed the importance of legal preparedness for emergency situations from a global perspective, presenting ethical and legal dilemmas of affected and unaffected countries. Managing such a crisis necessitated a multi-dimensional response, including effective functioning of health systems; coordination of diverse disciplines; international distribution; use of experimental drugs and medical procedures; safeguarding human rights; and consideration of implications in the health, political, and economic arenas. In addition, the Ebola crisis brought to the forefront basic dilemmas concerning responsibility and reciprocity among developed states and LMICs. It was essential to integrate the legal dimension into the global response in order to maximise strategies aimed at coordinating joint efforts to contain the Ebola epidemic and save lives (68) .

The global response to the Ebola outbreak was insufficient (69, 70) . Gostin and Friedman (70) argue that the outbreak uncovered a failure in global health leadership and that the WHO should be the global health leader. However, its budget is not commensurate with its responsibilities. As a result, some countries departed from the WHO directives and responded with excessive severity (e.g. imposing mandatory travel bans). In addition, several contaminated states could not realistically implement WHO recommendations and thus did not show full compliance with the guidelines (70).

Hodge et al. (67) note four issues that should be considered when creating legal preparedness for the Ebola crisis: health workers' willingness to respond, experimental drugs and medical procedures, social-distancing measures in medical settings, and potential liabilities of healthcare workers and entities. Addressing these issues could help mitigate fears, improve the public health response, protect the safety of healthcare workers and communities, and promote comprehensive medical and public health services (67) .

Effective management of emergencies such as the Ebola outbreak depends on the health systems' capacities (71) . Therefore, the most effective way to curb such outbreaks is to strengthen weak health systems and infrastructures (69, 71, 72) . Considering the vast differences between developed countries and LMICs, immediate and extensive assistance should be provided (72) . Regarding the high mortality rate of healthcare workers in the Ebola crisis (73), Hodge et al. (67) noted that the infrastructures must offset the risks taken by frontline personnel with a commitment to their protection. This issue came to the forefront because Western healthcare workers were evacuated, while frontline workers from affected places were not. In addition, the commitment to protect healthcare workers has to be standardised legally in affected countries as well as in ascending countries.

In addition to the above, a central legal issue highlighted by this crisis is protection of human rights. The acute nature of the recent outbreak necessitated imposing quarantine, isolation, and other restrictive measures, in addition to monitoring movement of travellers. However, these measures were applied excessively and, rather than proving beneficial, caused under-reporting of diagnosed patients, lowered trust in the government, and sharpened economic, political, and social challenges (68, 70, 74, 75) . During this crisis, human rights violations were wideranging, including blockage of rural areas in Sierra Leone by the army, shooting of people who unlawfully entered Liberia from Sierra Leone, and broad-sweeping barricades in Liberia that prevented access to food, medicine, and life-sustaining services. Limiting travel from affected countries is contrary to WHO guidelines (68) . Rothstein (76) noted four ethical principles that should be considered in the process of deciding whether quarantine is needed: necessity, effectiveness, and scientific rationale; proportionality and minimal infringement; humane supportive services; and public justification.

Regarding experimental treatments, it is important to formulate and adhere to ethical rules (64, 67, 69) in order to mitigate inadvertent damage, which could worsen already strained relationships between health professionals and their patients (64) .

The factors mentioned above significantly affect the public's trust in responding agencies and governance systems activated during crises such as the Ebola outbreak. The relationships between international health organisations are thus impacted (70) in both underdeveloped (32) and developed states (75, 77) .

This study reviews current trends regarding PHLP for emergencies. Over the past decade, in order to improve disaster planning and response (78) , PHLP has steadily grown in importance (18) . However, while legal preparedness is important in diverse types of emergencies, most of the literature focuses exclusively on pandemic scenarios. Furthermore, the status of PHLP is influenced by the characteristics of the country involved.

IHR represent a potentially revolutionary change in global health governance (26, 79) . One criticism is that the regulations fail to make due allowance for local conditions and characteristics (7, 30Á32). In order for IHR to be appropriately realised, health organisations must create conditions that enhance the capacities of countries in need. Regulatory attention paid to health systems' capacities may have a positive economic consequence: the provision of structured support during the pre-crisis period would significantly reduce post-outbreak outlays for assistance (39) . According to McCloskey et al. (80) , there is a need to develop trust and nurture effective, meaningful collaborations between countries to facilitate rapid detection of potential pandemics and initiation of public health actions.

From this perspective, international regulations need to standardise the implementation of legal activities, motivated by a concern for global public health and well-being. Coordination of such activities would promote routine inter-state assistance as well as collaboration during emergencies. Thus, allowing the development of responses adapted to different countries' capacities without losing sight of the overall public health goals would help expand the capabilities of poorer countries.

The Ebola crisis reveals the importance of creating legal preparedness that takes into account the needs and capacities of both affected and unaffected countries (67, 69, 71, 72) . Inadequate capacities create severe stress on a country's ability to deal with the crisis. As a result, first and foremost, medical care is harmed. Moreover, it inflicts a severe blow to individual rights. Another facet of ethical and legal implications which was evident in the current crisis concerns the protection of health workers. This topic impacts both affected countries and the countries that provide assistance.

Reciprocity between developed countries and LMICs is a global concern targeted to protect the world's health. The current global situation and the health status in developing countries directly affect the health of the world's population. Thus, developed countries have an interest, beyond their responsibility, in catering to the health status of countries that lack vital means and resources. International legal preparedness, which considers the needs and capacities of different countries, will improve the assistance provided to countries that need it and regulate cooperation between the various stakeholders.

Implementation of the PHLP model The US PHLP model was intended to strengthen health system preparedness for routine scenarios as well as emergencies (5, 18) . Implementing the four core elements (law, competencies, information, and coordination) (5) may increase legal preparedness by addressing the response of local legal and health systems for emergencies.

The adoption of elements of the US model by developing countries, may promote the capacities of health systems' preparedness, which, in turn, will contribute to the increase of global health security. Developed countries have an interest in assisting the local health capacities in LMICs. International regulations incorporating these elements would in effect expand the resources available for coping with local and international public health emergencies. At present, resources are provided to underdeveloped states mainly to manage public health threats that affect developed countries Á even though other public health hazards may pose a greater threat to the LMIC (26) .

The challenges identified in LMICs in the course of the Ebola crisis should be studied in order to assist the tailoring of appropriate legal preparedness in these countries. In certain countries, such as the United States, laws regarding infectious diseases provide the legal framework for health system operations in routine situations as well as during emergencies (81) . It is vital to understand the ways in which less developed countries manage epidemics and translate this into a legislative framework that can promote the effectiveness of local health systems.

Research in the field of PHLP Efforts to improve health preparedness must be supported by adequate research. Although a relatively new field, public health law provides important contributions to policy making and, by extension, to the health of the population (52) . The dearth of studies in this area indicates a gap that needs to be filled. Systematic research employing advanced techniques and sensitive data analyses can facilitate the study of legal preparedness and help elucidate the causal relationship between legal reforms and emergency preparedness of healthcare systems.

The findings will help promote emergency preparedness in every country.

This article provides highlights of current trends regarding PHLP as reflected in the professional literature. Nonetheless, this study did not fully examine legislation in the investigated countries. The keywords used in the literature search process did not include the word disaster. Nevertheless, in checking the articles that were found using the search engines, researchers noted only one article that was not included in the findings based on the term emergency. In addition, the literature review only included papers in the English language, which might have excluded publications from non-English speaking countries. This article provides an overview of various issues regarding PHLP but does not encompass all the particulars.

The role of the legal component in building emergency health preparedness is gaining increasing recognition worldwide, although in many countries this has been expressed only in the context of infectious diseases. The Ebola epidemic revealed that despite adoption of international regulations by LMICs their health systems still lack the capacity to manage such epidemics. There is a need to boost effective implementation of international regulations by these states, thereby strengthening their ability to deal with routine and emergency situations and fostering global health security. The IHR present a good starting point, although additional work is needed to find a legal framework that will strengthen the willingness of the various stakeholders with different interests to cooperate and coordinate health preparedness programs. It is recommended that the components of the PHLP model be widely adopted as a comprehensive basis for promoting legal preparedness in local health systems, backed by sophisticated methods of analysis directed at elucidating the effect of PHLP on the capacity to cope with emergencies and disasters. Further studies are needed in the context of natural or man-made humanitarian disasters.

Although anecdotal comments from the students indicate that the coursework has been helpful, additional research is planned to evaluate the program. N urses comprise the largest group of health care professionals in the United States (2.7 million) and are essential personnel in efforts to prepare for terrorism and disasters and to deal with the consequences of an attack. Although nurses may be willing to respond to a disaster or major public health emergency, their actual response may be determined by their sense of clinical competence, their perception of personal safety, and the confidence and safety of their family members and significant others.

An increasing concern of nursing faculty is that student nurses be trained for disaster preparedness and response in the event of a disaster or mass casualty event. [1] [2] [3] For example, the School of Nursing at the University of Texas at Austin offers a Disaster Nursing course, 4 and the Vanderbilt School of Nursing established a National Center for Emergency Preparedness in December 2002. 5 The American Association of Colleges of Nursing (AACN) envisions a professional nurse as a graduate of a baccalaureate program who is capable of providing holistic care to clients from diverse cultural backgrounds, can practice independently within the domains of nursing practice roles and collaboratively with other health team members, and acts responsibly in the event of a disaster. 6 As an active partner of the International Nursing Coalition for Mass Casualty Education (INCMCE), AACN has acknowledged that not all nurses can or should be prepared as first responders in the event of a mass casualty incident (MCI). An MCI is any incident, whether human-made or due to natural forces, ''.that results in significant disruption to the health and safety of the community or a segment thereof, or to the nation and that results, or is likely to result, in numbers of acuity that initially exceeds day-to-day operational capability of the local response community and healthcare system..'' 7 INCMCE was convened in 2001 to assure a competent nurse workforce to respond to MCIs. It is composed of representatives from schools of nursing, nursing specialty organizations, nursing accrediting bodies, and health care and government agencies. In a recent report, 8 INCMCE advocated that all nurses, regardless of experience and specialty, should possess the basic knowledge and skills needed to appropriately respond to an MCI. The MCI competencies are based on defining core competencies, core knowledge, and professional role development.

The Long Island University School of Nursing (LIUSON) Brooklyn Campus disaster preparedness program is modeled on the INCMCE nursing competencies and is embedded in the senior community health nursing course. Initially the program was limited to a 3-hour didactic component and a 1-day symposium. More recently, disaster drills have been organized that enable faculty and students to team up with a Brooklyn hospital emergency department. Mock drills have been organized to create an interdisciplinary approach that includes medical, nursing, and administrative staff. The drills link the theoretic aspect of disaster management with hands-on scenarios that simulate real-life possibilities, such as dirty bombs, plague, or other events.

Background: One School of Nursing's Educational Response Following the Events of 9/11

During the days that followed September 11, 2001 , it became apparent that the magnitude of the impact of the attacks on health care systems in New York City would have far-reaching educational implications. Issues such as incident command systems, triage, prehospital care, forensics, weapons of mass destruction care, mass sheltering, media management, mass evacuation, and responder stress and safety were no longer just the purview of military or emergency nurses. These topics would be important content to be integrated into the curriculum, and the community health nursing course was determined to be a logical place to integrate disaster preparedness.

Disaster preparedness and management is covered in a 3-hour lecture, followed by a 1-day mock drill. Administrative support for the course content has been provided by the School of Nursing dean, and funding of speakers has been provided by a McGrath Family grant.

Theoretic framework. Students are introduced to the concepts of preparedness, management, and MCIs. The core competency objectives outlined in the INCMCE report 8 are used as the framework for content development and for validating student competency in an MCI. Course content includes the 4 stages of disaster workdmitigation, preparedness, response, and recovery 9 ; weapons of mass destruction (WMD), including agent identification and recognition of covert exposure in a population, patient decontamination, and mass triage; and mass immunization. 10 Stanhope and Lancaster's book Foundations of Community Health Nursing: Community-Oriented Practice, 11 which includes a chapter on disaster management, is used as the main lecture reference. Additional resources include current articles and publications on disaster preparedness and management.

Course content. Specifically covered in the lecture is a discussion of the following concepts: (1) types of disasters (ie, human-made versus natural); (2) MCIs; (3) triage; (4) WMDs; and (5) chemical, biologic, radiologic, nuclear, and explosive agents. The 4 phases of emergency managementdpreparedness, response, recovery, and mitigationdand the different roles that nurses play in each of these phases are emphasized.

Within the discussion of the 4 phases of emergency response and preparedness ( personal, professional, and community), students are taught that there are levels of disasters and corresponding types of response. These factors can affect allocation of limited resources, involvement of local, state, and federal emergency response systems, activation of emergency communication systems, and creation of an interdisciplinary team to manage a disaster.

The didactic session focuses on assessment, communication, and problem resolution. An emphasis is placed on moving from a crisis basis for nursing care delivery to a plan of action. Students are encouraged to develop a proactive rather than a reactive approach to providing care. The lecture emphasizes the central role of the nurse, the use of critical thinking skills in clinical judgment and decision making, and the need to set priorities in order to ensure appropriate care for individuals, families, special groups ( for example, elderly persons, pregnant women, and children), and communities. Students learn to develop a personal, family plan of action for disasters and practical information, such as how to locate and become familiar with the Emergency and Disaster Preparedness Plan for the clinical facility to which they have been assigned.

Psychological content. The psychological effects of a disaster or an MCI (eg, the mental health needs of both victims and responders) are discussed within the context of crisis theory. Faculty reinforce that one cannot not respond, that human responses to stressors are expected at the physical, cognitive, and affective During the days that followed September 11, 2001 , it became apparent that the magnitude of the impact of the attacks on health care systems in New York City would have farreaching educational implications.

Students are encouraged to develop a proactive rather than a reactive approach to providing care. levels, and that the emotional trauma should be dealt with as soon as possible. Distinctions between adult and child responses are made, as are initial versus delayed reactions. Should a nurse's family or community be directly affected, it is emphasized that this factor will intensify a nurse's stress response.

Students are encouraged to discuss issues that may limit a person during an MCI, such as fear, panic, and posttraumatic stress. This content is then followed with a discussion of appropriate coping strategies for the management of personal and client responses to an MCI. The discussion is concluded with stressing the importance of clear lines of communication before, during, and after an MCI.

Ethical aspects. Some of the ethical aspects of a disaster also are covered, such as how triage in a disaster differs from traditional medical triage. The dictum, ''The greatest good for the greatest number of people'' is used as a template for discussion. Examples of patients with different types of clinical manifestations and how they are classified and managed are used to further clarify the process of disaster triage.

In 2002, a 1-day symposium was implemented that features lecturers who are experts in the field of emergency and disaster medicine who had experienced first-hand the events of September 11, 2001 , and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome in Toronto, Canada, in 2003. Speakers also included topics such as the general signs and symptoms and psychological effects of exposure to selected chemical, biologic, radiologic, nuclear, and explosive agents. After 2 years, the symposium was expanded to include an afternoon hands-on experience. Students were invited to assist at the emergency department (ED) of Woodhull Medical Center during their Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations-required, semi-annual disaster mock drill. (See Table 1 for various drill scenarios.) Students were allowed to participate in the virtual MCI, which allowed them to see and experience the relationship between disaster preparedness theory and practice. It gave them the opportunity to utilize and demonstrate critical thinking, assessment, technical and communication skills within a new context. In December 2005, the faculty added an evaluation component to empirically test knowledge transfer by using a newly developed Student Attitudes Toward Disaster Preparedness Questionnaire.

Students and faculty were integrated into the Woodhull Emergency and Disaster Preparedness Plans located within individual departments. They worked alongside hospital police, who cordoned off the doors to the ED. They worked with the nurse ED director, who took the role of ED treatment leader and was responsible for setting up appropriate triage areas and ensuring that the ED would have the appropriate space to care for an influx of patients. The director carefully scrutinized admissions and encouraged discharges. Students found that observing the nurse ED director taking a management lead in an MCI helped to reinforce the central role of nursing in disaster response in an institutional setting.

Students are encouraged to be either a responder or a victim during the mock drill scenario. As a responder, student participants are able to apply the principles of containment and decontamination, scene assessment and management, and a hands-on experience regarding how to use personal protective equipment. They also perform triage, initiate physical assessment, and carry out interventions with the use of appropriate antidotes and medications, depending on types of injury. Most of all, they realize the importance of team play and the pivotal role of the nurse in a disaster. As victims, students experience first-hand how the aforementioned procedures are executed, but more importantly, they are provided the opportunity to live the process of being in a crisis. As the recipients of care, they begin the journey of discerning the ethics of triage.

Senior nursing students possess core knowledge and have had clinical experiences that help prepare them to respond to an MCI. This foundation is built on by using community health nursing concepts as the context in which this core knowledge is extended. Unfortunately, the faculty teaching the course agree that there is not enough time to cover everything, especially the regulatory and legal aspects and the cultural, spiritual, and social issues of disasters. If time permits, additional content may include other possible nursing roles in a disaster or MCI: (1) researcher, epidemiologist; (2) first responder; (3) direct care provider; (4) on-site coordinator of care/incident commander; (5) triage officer; (6) information provider/educator; (7) generalist nurse; (8) advanced practice nurse; and (9) mental health counselor. Furthermore, it is recommended that a nurse know his or her limitations regarding knowledge, skills, abilities, and authority; the role he or she will be expected to perform; and which essential equipment (eg, stethoscope, registered nurse license, packaged snack, change of clothing, bottles of water) will likely be needed.

Students found that observing the nurse ED director taking a management lead in an MCI helped to reinforce the central role of nursing in disaster response in an institutional setting.

Having had several years of experience with integrating this content into one course, LIUSON is ready to consider integration of these concepts across the curriculum. Through curriculum mapping, we will learn how disaster preparedness and MCI response content builds upon or supports existing content and experiences. The next step, especially if additional content or experiences seem to be required, will be to locate pedagogical techniques best suited to prepare graduates in related competencies. 12 We believe that: (1) continuing to focus on the consensus-based competencies included in the INCMCE framework, as well as collaboration with hospitals and like facilities, will help us in educating LIUSON's future practitioners; and (2) empirical evaluation of knowledge gained through the administration of reliable and valid measurement tools not only will provide data but will help respond to the evaluation gap in INCMCE that currently exists. To successfully accomplish the latter, face and content validity must be established for the Student Attitudes Towards Disaster Preparedness Questionnaire by the LIUSON Test Review Committee. Test-retest reliability then can be achieved through subsequent administration of the questionnaire to student participants.

Natural and human-made catastrophic events will continue to occur and can involve major urban centers in the United States. Disaster preparedness requires that all health care providers are knowledgeable, skilled, and able to respond to a variety of threats. Because it is not practical to wait for a disaster to learn how to provide specialized care, the LIUSON faculty developed a specific educational experience for undergraduate community health student nurses. The course includes specific didactic material that is based on recommended standards. Students are given the opportunity to apply the learning and to develop additional skills by participating in a mock drill. Anecdotal comments from the students indicate that the course work has been helpful, and additional research is planned for evaluating the program. At approximately 2 pm a delivery truck filled with high-yield explosives (ie, a dirty bomb) drives up to the security checkpoint of the new Brooklyn Navy Yard Movie Studio. The driver bursts through the checkpoint and crashes the truck into the main building, causing a massive explosion that results in numerous fatalities and severe injuries. Ten ambulatory student patients who have sustained numerous injuries present to Woodhull Hospital. In addition, 5 student victims are transported to Woodhull Hospital via Emergency Management Systems. Students and 2 faculty members were briefed by the nurse director of the ED on their roles as either victims or responders in the event of mock chemical attack. Some student victims were made to look as though they had received burns, whereas others had lacerations and fractures sustained while in flight from the scene of the assault. Student victims experienced decontamination in the ''decon'' van adjacent to the hospital prior to being triaged in the ED. As the student victims converged on the ED, 2 faculty functioned as triage nurses, along with Woodhull ED nursing staff. Within a matter of minutes, our students, who took their role as victims seriously, poured through the ED doors, crying and terror-stricken. Amidst this pandemonium, the triage nurses quickly assessed victims, separating those who needed to be treated immediately from those who could wait for intervention. As the adrenalin pumped, the experience had every hallmark of a disaster, that is, little time to think and yet the need for rapid response. This was real! Drill Scenario No. 2 Fifty persons attend a conference in Wyoming, 10 of whom go on a hunting trip while in the region. Two days later, while returning from Wyoming on a bus to Brooklyn, several persons become very ill. Enlarged lymph nodes, fever, vomiting, and diarrhea develop in 5 persons, and 5 others report cough, chest pain, and tachypnea. Exiting the Williamsburg Bridge, the driver of the bus hurriedly drives to the nearest Brooklyn hospital, Woodhull Medical Center. Again, faculty and students were oriented to their roles as either victims or ED staff, but this time in response to a biologic event, pneumonic plague. On this occasion, students participated with faculty in assessment, triage, intervention, and transfer of victims to appropriate settings based on postexposure need.

In this scenario, Woodhull Medical Center tested infection control disaster plans and the triage system when faced with a stream of patients, some of whom potentially harbored contagious organisms. Ten student victims presented to ED; 5 represented day care staff who reported fever and a rash, and 5 represented persons who recently had traveled outside the United States and now were reporting fever and respiratory symptoms such as cough and congestion. The remaining students shadowed the ED nurses, who had to distinguish between patients who required quarantine versus those who could be treated and sent home. The drill was multifaceted in its attempt to test triage processes, established isolation protocols, and the adequacy of communication from the point of triage to movement of victims to the immediate clinical area.

Uganda public health fellowship program's contribution to building a resilient and sustainable public health system in Uganda,"Background: Low-income countries with relatively weak-health systems are highly vulnerable to public health threats. Effective public health system with a workforce to investigate outbreaks can reduce disease impact on livelihoods and economic development. Building effective public health partnerships is critical for sustainability of such a system. Uganda has made significant progress in responding to emergencies during the past quarter century, but its public health workforce is still inadequate in number and competency. Objectives: To reinforce implementation of priority public health programs in Uganda and cultivate core capacities for compliance with International Health Regulations. Methods: To develop a competent workforce to manage epidemics and improve disease surveillance, Uganda Ministry of Health (MoH) established an advanced-level Field Epidemiology Training Program, called Public Health Fellowship Program (PHFP); closely modelled after the US CDC's Epidemic Intelligence Service. PHFP is a 2-year, full-time, nondegree granting program targeting mid-career public health professionals. Fellows spend 85% of their field time in MoH placements learning through service delivery and gaining competencies in major domains. Results: During 2015-2018, PHFP enrolled 41 fellows, and graduated 30. Fellows were placed in 19 priority areas at MoH and completed 235 projects (91 outbreaks, 12 refugee assessments, 50 surveillance, and 60 epidemiologic studies, 3 cost analysis and 18 quality improvement); made 194 conference presentations; prepared 63 manuscripts for peer-reviewed publications (27 published as of December 2018); produced MoH bulletins, and developed three case studies. Projects have resulted in public health interventions with improvements in surveillance systems and disease control. Conclusion: During the 4 years of existence, PHFP has contributed greatly to improving realtime disease surveillance and outbreak response core capacities. Enhanced focus on evidence-based targeted approaches has increased effectiveness in outbreak response and control, and integration of PHFP within MoH has contributed to building a resilient and sustainable health system in Uganda.","The burden of communicable and non-communicable diseases (NCDs) in Uganda is high. Most major health outcome indicators fall well short of desired targets: 343 women die for every 100,000 live births, and 131 of every 1,000 children die before age 5 years. Nearly one in three children under 5 years is stunted [1] . More than half of the disability-adjusted life-years lost in Uganda are due to communicable diseases, in part due to the high HIV prevalence (6.2%) and TB prevalence (3/ 1000) [2] . The emergence of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis has spread countrywide, and the growing noncommunicable disease burden is of increasing concern [3, 4] As an ecological hotspot, Uganda has infectious disease transmission belts for meningitis, yellow fever, and viral haemorrhagic fevers. The country is prone to emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases, most of which have occurred in epidemic proportions in recent times with significant cost implications. For example, the cost of responding and controlling the 2017 Marburg Virus Disease outbreak in Kween District, Eastern Uganda was approximately $1 million USD [5] . Addressing all of these health challenges requires a resilient health system, if meaningful prevention and control is to be achieved.

Health system resilience comprises both health system strengthening and sustainability. Health system strengthening refers to significant and purposeful efforts to improve the system's performance, while sustainability has been defined as the implementation and continuous use of new practices that are able to produce the intended outcomes over a long period of time [6] . The World Health Organisation (WHO) in 2007 developed a framework that describes health system strengthening in terms of six building blocks: service delivery, health workforce, health information systems, access to essential medicines, financing, and leadership/governance [7] .

Health workforce challenges have been recognized as a critical bottleneck to the delivery of high-quality health services, including response to epidemics. The spread of Ebola in West Africa during 2013-2016 was compounded by weak-health systems characterized by lack of public health capacity for outbreak detection and control [8, 9] . While there is no doubt that new strategies are needed to respond to evolving systems challenges, even the current available human resources are not being used to sufficiently strengthen the performance of health systems. Evidence-informed policy-making presupposes the availability of high quality, relevant information, and decision-makers may need support to assess what is already known or to articulate demands for specific new evidence.

Field epidemiologists respond to public health emergencies, including outbreaks, as well as conducting epidemiologic research, evaluating and improving surveillance systems, implementing public health programs, and publishing data to facilitate evidence-based decision-making. The shortage of field epidemiologists in Uganda to address critical aspects of health in the public sector prompted the Uganda Ministry of Health (MoH), with support of key partners including Makerere University School of Public Health (MakSPH) and US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), to establish the Uganda Public Health Fellowship Program (PHFP) in 2015. PHFP is an in-service, post-master's-degree field epidemiology training program (FETP) that attempts to address human resources for health needs. As part of the MoH's long-term sustainability vision, PHFP will exist as a directorate and capacity-building arm of the Uganda National Institute of Public Health (UNIPH); UNIPH is an initiative of the MoH to create an integrated disease control centre, analogous to the US CDC. This paper describes the PHFP, its development and organization, and its contribution to building a resilient and sustainable health system by training a critical mass of competent field epidemiologists in Uganda.

The PHFP is a 2-year, non-degree-granting, full-time, competency-based fellowship program modelled after the US CDC's Epidemic Intelligence Service (EIS) program. The program is primarily funded by the US Government through the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), the President's Malaria Initiative (PMI), and the Global Health Security Agenda (GHSA). The PHFP trains midcareer professionals who have a master's degree (or higher) in a health-related discipline and who aspire to become public health leaders. During the two-year fellowship period, fellows are required to attain certain core competencies in domains that include public health emergency response, surveillance data analysis, surveillance system evaluation, applied epidemiologic study, cost analysis of outbreaks, quality improvement science, burden of disease estimation, and leadership skills. Their attainment of these competencies is demonstrated by completing a portfolio of projects in each of these domains.

PHFP is integrated as an arm of MoH, and, together with the Integrated Epidemiology and Surveillance Department (IESD), the Public Health Emergency Operations Centre (PHEOC), and other important public health programs in the MoH, conducts investigations and studies that provide data for decisionmaking for the National Task Force (NTF). The NTF is an arm of the MoH created to coordinate emergency health response, and is responsible for bringing partners together, providing strategic direction to response, and coordinating functions that contribute to prevention and control of public health emergencies.

The PHFP Secretariat is the operational and administrative unit responsible for coordinating the program. Its functions include: (a) coordination of PHFP partner collaboration with MoH, (b) organizing and supervising fellows' placements within MoH, (c) performance review of fellows, (d) back-up mentorship for Fellows and coordination of mentorship activities, and (e) development of strategic and operational plans for approval by the PHFP Steering Committee (SC). The PHFP secretariat comprises a field coordinator, two field supervisors, a scientific writer, a training manager, and an administrative assistant, based at the Ministry of Health. The CDC Resident Advisor, who provides technical and programmatic guidance, supports the Secretariat, but is not a part of it.

Applications are solicited through the print media, the program website, the alumni association, and professional associations. Short-listed candidates are required to undergo a rigorous interview process comprising an in-person interview, a Power point presentation on a given relevant topic, and an essay on a selected topic. Approximately 10 fellows are selected annually.

The service-in-training program comprises two didactic courses of approximately six weeks in duration each (~15% of the program time): an introductory course at the beginning, and an advanced course towards the end of the first year. The remaining weeks (~85% of time), the fellows are placed at an MoH host site, where they implement activities stipulated in their scope of work and work plans, tailored towards accomplishment of host site activities and fellowship deliverables. The hands-on-learning is anchored around intense continuous mentorship by mentors at the host site, the Secretariat, and staff at Makerere University College of Health Sciences.

Fellows' progress is monitored and performance appraised on a quarterly and annual basis. Supportive supervision is offered to the host site to ensure prompt identification of problems and possible solutions. (Table 1) .

Graduation: By January 2019, the first three cohorts of fellows had graduated. All graduates have been absorbed within the MoH (53%) or are working with MoH-affiliated or linked institutions or organisations [WHO, IDI, AFENET and Africa CDC] (47%) ( Table 2) .

Field projects: During the nearly four years of the program implementation, the 41 PHFP fellows completed more than 235 applied epidemiology projects, of which 91 were outbreak investigations and 12 were emergency refugee health assessments. In addition, fellows have conducted 50 surveillance projects, including analysis of surveillance data or evaluation of a surveillance system, and completed 60 epidemiological studies, 18 quality improvement projects, and 3 cost analyses for outbreaks (Table 3) . On average, each Fellow implemented 8 projects. These field investigations have been conducted throughout the country (Figure 1 ).

Communication outputs: PHFP has submitted 63 manuscripts for publication in peer-reviewed journals; 25 were published as of December 2018. A total of 29 manuscripts are undergoing internal and CDC reviews. Findings from some of the published manuscripts, such as Risk Factors for Podoconiosis in Kamwenge District, Uganda [10] were widely covered in major national and international media outlets, including international National newspapers have also published articles from many fellows, written to inform the public about current public health challenges, such as outbreaks and tips on disease prevention. These publications have contributed to use of their public health recommendations on a wider scale nationally. Contribution to building a resilient system: Prior to PHFP, there was no investigative arm for outbreak response at MoH; the PHFP created and now leads this arm, as part of the National Rapid Response Team. Outbreak reports prepared by fellows are routinely submitted to the PHEOC and presented at the National Task Force for Epidemic Preparedness and Response, which helps to guide outbreak prevention and control in the country. Examples include Field projects participated  33  62  59  81  235  Outbreak investigations  18  15  27  31  91  Emergency investigations  1  4  7  0  1 2  Surveillance  9  16  15  10  50  Applied epidemiologic studies  5  22  5  29  61  Cost analysis of outbreaks  0  2  1  0  3  Quality Improvement  0  3  4  11 identification and investigation of a large typhoid outbreak in 2015, which affected over 10,000 residents in Kampala, in which investigation findings helped to guide the successful control of the outbreak, early identification and investigation of a yellow fever outbreak in 2016, leading to a subsequent mass vaccination campaign by MoH, and investigation of a meningitis (serogroup W) outbreak in an institutionalized population in 2016, with subsequent control efforts potentially preventing spread into the civilian population. PHFP also provided epidemiologic support for nationwide outbreaks of cholera, malaria, measles and anthrax [13] . PHFP fellows have also conducted emergency assessments and evaluations at several refugee settlement areas. Implementation of recommendations from these investigations by MoH and UN agencies has potentially prevented outbreaks and improved the health of the refugees.

The prompt epidemiologic investigations conducted by the PHFP have resulted in shortened time to identify dangerous pathogens, and prevented potential spread of outbreaks. For example, due to timely investigation and prompt response, a yellow fever outbreak that occurred in 2016 was confirmed within 12 days and controlled within three weeks of the initial outbreak report. In comparison, the previous yellow fever outbreak in Uganda in 2010 took 40 days to confirm and 3 months to control [14] . Due to its achievements, PHFP won the CDC Director's Award for Excellence in Public Health and Response at the 2017 EIS conference [15] .

PHFP and the MoH are also supported by a Frontline FETP program, established by the MoH in partnership with the CDC in 2016. Frontline FETP augments disease surveillance and outbreak detection and response at the district level [16] .

In just four years of operation, Uganda's Public Health Fellowship Program has demonstrated the ability to address multiple gaps in the Uganda health system. They have generated quality products, experienced adoption of recommendations from their projects, and received national and international recognition [17] . As an integrated and adaptive program, PHFP has greatly improved Uganda's capacity to respond to disease outbreaks and other public health emergencies, controlling them at their sources, in a timely and effective manner.

Much as established literature guides response to epidemics, we are aware that each outbreak is unique. Before PHFP, outbreak responses in Uganda typically had only minimal epidemiological investigation [16] . The commencement of PHFP brought systematic approaches to epidemiologic investigations in almost all outbreaks in Uganda [18] [19] [20] . As a result, PHFP has made the National Rapid Response Team more focused and enabled the MoH to control outbreaks in a shorter time period and at lower cost. The decisions taken by the National Task Force are now routinely informed by evidence generated by PHFP.

Vertical MoH programs have benefitted from having embedded Fellows routinely analyse their data and ensure that alerts are generated promptly. Because PHFP is non-degree awarding and Fellows are required to already have at least a Master's degree on entry, fellows spend more time working on program-oriented projects that address national health needs, and less time in didactic courses. This is different from most FETPs, in which residents earn degrees while in their programs [21] . This model allows the fellows to obtain wide range of experience at all levels of public health in Uganda. Fellows have also demonstrated this capability by producing more manuscripts and presenting a number of papers at national and international level within a short span of time. Compared to the evaluation report of the FETP at Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India whose fieldwork led to the production of 158 scientific communications presented at international meetings and to 29 manuscripts accepted in indexed, peer-reviewed journals in seven years. Going by this trend, achievement of PHFP will definitely be greater than most FETPs [22] .

Beyond the health benefits to the country, PHFP and similar programs almost certainly provide return on investment through early detection, investigation and control of outbreaks, improvement in surveillance system, and provision of urgently needed data for public health programs. The recent Ebola outbreak in West Africa cost the global community $3.6B to respond to and contain and an additional $2.2B in GDP loss to Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone [23] . Had a fraction of that sum of money been used to build an effective health workforce in West Africa for early identification, investigation, and control of outbreaks, both the human and the massive economic toll of the Ebola epidemic could perhaps have been averted. The importance of putting people at the centre of delivery of health services was apparent during the initial response, the early recovery phase, and long-term planning for resilience in the Ebola response [24] . Other recent outbreaks, including the 2012 Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus and the 2015 Zika virus outbreaks, have similarly underscored the need for strong, resilient public health systems to both address the outbreaks and implement containment measures.

All fellows who have graduated have been absorbed either within MoH or are employed by institutions that work closely with the MoH. Because the program Secretariat and most host sites are in the MoH, having graduates working in the different programs within the MoH provides opportunity for mentorship of new fellows (Table 2 ). Increased retention of graduates within the Ugandan government will facilitate sustainability of the program. Presently, recruitment in Ministry of Health is the prerogative of the Health Service Commission which derives its mandate from Public Service Regulations. These regulations in its current form does not ring fence any positions for FETP graduates, however, discussion are on the table by all relevant stakeholders to incorporate a clause that will make it easier to recruit and retain FETP graduates in public service. It's important to note that Government of Uganda (GoU) intends to have 3300 field epidemiologists trained to match the current population based on the WHO target of 1 epidemiologist per 200,000 population. Based on the recruitment of 10 fellows per year and the current reliance on donor funding, it will definitely take a relatively long time to bridge this gap. However, GoU's plan to have a fully functional UNIPH which is largely funded by government in the very near future will definitely help in addressing this challenge. In addition, Makerere School of Public Health has produced 340 FETP graduates since inception in 1994.

Although PHFP has made strides in contributing to building a resilient system, there are still some challenges. The use of evidence generated for disease prevention and control is still limited, partially due to the multiple layers of implementation existing in the Ugandan system. Even when evidence is available, poor dissemination, rigid mindset, poor coordination of partners, and inadequate resources may hamper its utilization. Improved stakeholder engagement with the MOH should be able to address this challenge in the long run. Funding also has some challenges: although PHFP is currently funded by the USA Government, for full integration and institutionalization within the Uganda MoH system there must be domestic resource allocation to support this program. Recognizing this need, MoH has made PHFP a key component of the proposed Uganda National Institute of Public Health (UNIPH) by designating it as a unique directorate [25] . Once the UNIPH is formally established by the Ugandan Parliament, it will become an integrated disease control centre in the country and have diversified funding sources from the government, philanthropists, and the private sector, as well as grants and cooperative agreements from international organisations and foreign governments. PHFP is intended to be its capacitybuilding component, which will provide a competent workforce of field epidemiologists and other health professionals to meet the public health needs of the country [26] . Moreover, PHFP alumni have formed an association called 'Field Epidemiologists without Borders', which will work closely with UNIPH to champion some of the institute's objectives to ensure knowledge transfer and the building of a critical mass of field epidemiologists [27] .

During its four years of operation, the PHFP has contributed greatly to improving the real-time disease surveillance and outbreak response core capacities of the Uganda Ministry of Health. The enhanced focus on evidence-based targeted approaches has increased effectiveness in outbreak response and control, and the integration of PHFP within the MoH has contributed to building a resilient and sustainable health system in Uganda. highly indebted to Dr. Bao-Ping Zhu and Dr. Julie Harris, US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, for technical guidance during the entire implementation period of the program thus far.

"National Foundation of Nature Science of China (30890142/31070781/31200649), Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Province Higher Education Institutions, and National Key Basic Research Programs","We have recently reported that calreticulin (CRT), a luminal resident protein, can be found in the sera of patients with rheumatoid arthritis and also that recombinant CRT (rCRT) exhibits extraordinarily strong immunological activities. We herein further demonstrate that rCRT fragments 18-412 (rCRT/18-412), rCRT/39-272, rCRT/120-308 and rCRT/120-250 can self-oligomerize in solution and are 50-100 fold more potent than native CRT (nCRT, isolated from mouse livers) in activating macrophages in vitro. We narrowed down the active site of CRT to residues 150-230, the activity of which also depends on dimerization. By contrast, rCRT/18-197 is almost completely inactive. When rCRT/18-412 is fractionated into oligomers and monomers by gel filtration, the oligomers maintain most of their immunological activities in terms of activating macrophages in vitro and inducing specific antibodies in vivo, while the monomers were much less active by comparison. Additionally, rCRT/18-412 oligomers are much better than monomers in binding to, and uptake by, macrophages. Inhibition of macrophage endocytosis partially blocks the stimulatory effect of rCRT/18-412. We conclude that the immunologically active site of CRT maps between residues 198-230 and that soluble CRT could acquire potent immuno-pathological activities in microenvironments favoring its oligomerization.","Calreticulin (CRT) is a 46 kDa Ca 2+ -binding glycoprotein in the endoplasmic reticulum of eukaryotic cells [1] [2] . It folds into 3 domains including a lectin-like globular N domain (amino acid residues , a proline-rich P domain (residues 198-308) and a Ca 2+ -binding C domain (residues 309-412) [3] [4] [5] . CRT can also appear at the surface of various types of cells exhibiting multiple biological functions [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] . Recently it has been shown that soluble CRT is present in the sera of patients with rheumatoid arthritis and with SLE [13] [14] and that natural CRT (nCRT), isolated from human or mouse tissues, can directly activate macrophages in vitro [15] . Additionally, rCRT/39-272, a prokaryotically-expressed murine CRT fragment covering amino acid residues 39-272 fused with an N-terminal His-tag, was extraordinarily potent in activating B cells and macrophages in vitro and also in eliciting specific Ab production in mice [16] . This recombinant polypeptide also exhibited potent adjuvanticity, effectively assisting IgG production against conjugated target Ags with or without T cell help [16] [17] . However, molecular mechanisms underlying this phenomenon are far from clear. Recent X-ray crystographical studies by Kozlov [18, 19] . The sequence of rCRT/39-272 encompasses most of the globular N domain (aa residues , and we have previously shown that it possess lectin-like activity (selective binding with polysaccharides including carrageenan, alginic acids, and hyaluronic acids in ELISAs) [16] , implying that the prokaryotically expressed recombinant polypeptide retained the lectin activity of CRT. It is of interest to determine if destroying the carbohydrate binding and/or peptide-binding sites (by deleting first half of the N domain sequence) would also abolish the potent immunological activities observed in rCRT/ 39-272. Additionally, the fact that rCRT/39-272 is substantially more potent than nCRT in activating macrophages(see below) raised concerns regarding the possibility of LPS contamination in the E. coli.-expressed recombinant product. The ''LPS contamination'' hypothesis suggests tight binding between bacterial LPS and rCRT and also that, due to a synergistic effect, the LPS-CRT complex is a more potent immune activator than free LPS and rCRT alone. Based upon the observation that interaction between the N and C domains of CRT influences its structural stability as well as functional activity [20] , a ''C-domain deletion'' hypothesis has also been postulated, suggesting that deletion of the C-domain (as in rCRT/39-272) leads to exposure of an immunologically active site (IAS) in the N and/or P domains of CRT. The present study compares the biochemical characteristics of nCRT and a series of truncated rCRT polypeptides and investigates the molecular mechanisms underlying the potent immunological activities of soluble rCRT. The results arising from this study have important implications for our understanding of the potential role of soluble CRT in immunopathological conditions.

Native CRT was extracted from mouse livers by (NH 4 ) 2 SO 4 precipitation followed by ion exchange chromatography on a DEAE-A50 column using a linear gradient of 280-500 mM NaCl for elution. Samples of the eluted fractions were assayed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1A) , which showed that the eluent between 360-380 mM NaCl contained protein bands of the expected molecular weight for nCRT (55 kDa), which showed approximately 90% homogeneity judging by density of the major band in Coomassie blue (CBB)-stained gel (Fig. 1C ).

Recombinant murine CRT fragment  with an N-terminal His-tag and without C-terminal KDEL) was expressed in E. coli and affinity purified using a Ni 2+ -column. The resultant rCRT/18-412 product contained 3 major protein bands at 60, 46 and 32 kDa (Figs. 1B & 1C); the two larger bands (namely rCRT-60 kDa and rCRT-46 kDa), but not the smaller one (Cp32), were recognized by polyclonal rabbit-anti-CRT antisera (CRT-Abs) in Western blot (WB) (Fig. 1D ). Purified nCRT, but not BSA or recombinant enhanced green fluorescence protein (rEGFP, 28 kDa with a His-tag), was positively recognized by CRT-Abs. As evidenced by native PAGE analysis, a substantial amount of rCRT/18-412 formed higher-molecular-weight oligomers, whilst nCRT existed mostly in monomeric form (Figs. 1E & 1F).

In our previous study, rCRT/39-272 could effectively activate mouse macrophages in vitro [16] . Interestingly, rCRT/18-412 was as effective as rCRT/39-272 in inducing NO 2 2 production by [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] were analyzed by a SDS-PAGE 12% gel followed by CBB staining. Fractions 6-10 were combined, dialyzed against PBS, and then adjusted to 1 mg/ml for use as nCRT. (B) A Ni-column was employed for purification of rCRT/18-412 from a lysate of IPTG-induced E. coli harboring the expression vector for rCRT/18-412. Samples of E. coli before and after IPTG induction were loaded in lanes, flow through (binding buffer), wash through (20 mM imidazole), resultant rCRT/18-412 (300 mM imidazole), and stripping through were loaded, in the order of 1-6 into a SDS-PAGE 12% gel followed by CBB staining. Samples of nCRT, rCRT/18-412, BSA and rEGFP were compared in CBB-stained SDS-PAGE 12% gel (C) and native-PAGE (E), followed by WB using rabbit anti-CRT polyclonal antibody for detection (D, F). The secondary Ab was HRPlabeled goat-anti-rabbit IgG, with OPD as substrate. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0064951.g001 mouse peritoneal macrophages in vitro, indicating that the presence, or deletion, of the C-domain did not affect the immunological activity of CRT ( Fig. 2A ). Purified nCRT was also able to activate macrophages in vitro, but with a 50-100-fold lower potency than rCRT/18-412 ( Fig. 2A) . Although rCRT/18-412 and rCRT/39-272 preparations had been repeatedly treated with polymyxin B (an efficient LPS inhibitor) prior to functional assays, the possibility that bacterial LPS might form a tight complex with rCRT, thereby resisting PMB treatment, was always a concern. Figs. 2B & 2C demonstrate that nCRT was not able to bind LPS in ELISAs, implying that formation of tight LPS-CRT complexes in the expressing E. coli cells is perhaps an unlikely event. Moreover, LPS and nCRT at sub-optimal concentrations did not show any synergistic effect in activating macrophages (Fig. 2D) , providing circumstantial evidence against the ''LPS contamination'' hypothesis.

Contaminating RPL2 does not Contribute to rCRT Activity When preparing rCRT/18-412, Cp32 was a relatively persistent contaminant protein (Figs. 1 & 3) . To characterize this protein, the Cp32 band was sliced out of SDS-PAGE gels and then (i) used to immunize C57/BL6 mice for preparation of specific antisera; and (ii) subjected to Q-TOF mass spectrometry analysis for sequence identification. The resultant antisera (Cp32-Abs) were able to recognize the immunizing protein band, but not the rCRT-60 kDa and rCRT-46 kDa bands, in WB (Fig. 3B) . The MS result identified Cp32 as bacterial 50S ribosomal protein L2 (RPL2), which was confirmed by positive recognition of recombinant RPL2 (rRPL2, commercially available) by Cp32-Abs (Fig. 3B) . It is noteworthy that rRPL2 was unable to activate macrophages, as evidenced in NO 2 2 production assays (Fig. 3C ), and also that rRPL2 was not recognized by CRT-Abs (Figs. 4C & 4D). These results exclude the possibility that the contaminant Cp32 could make a substantial contribution to the immunological activities of rCRT. 2 in the culture supernatant was then determined using Griess Reagent and the results are expressed as mean NO 2 2 concentration (mM) 6 SD. LPS-based ELISAs were performed for detection of LPS binding with CRT (B) or lactoferrin (C). Lf or nCRT (2 mg/ml) were added to wells in polyvinyl plates pre-coated with LPS (10 mg/ml), with BSA as a negative control. Combination of polyclonal rabbit Abs against CRT, or lactoferrin, and HRP-labeled goat-anti-rabbit IgG was used for detection with OPD as substrate. The results are expressed as absorbance at OD492 nm6SD. For sinergy analysis (D), freshly isolated mouse peritoneal macrophages were stimulated with nCRT (0.3-30 mg/ml) in the presence, or absence, of LPS (0.1 ng/ml) for 24 h. Cells in medium alone (Medium) or stimulated with LPS (0.1 ng/ml) alone (LPS) were included as controls. TNF-a in the culture supernatant was then quantitated using an ELISA kit and the results are expressed as mean concentration (pg/ml)6SD. These are representatives of 3 independent experiments. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0064951.g002

Since rCRT and nCRT differ in their ability to form oligomers in solution, we next asked if the potent immunological activities of rCRT polypeptides were the result of self-oligomerization. A Sephadex G-75 column was employed for fractionation of rCRT/ 18-412 oligomers and monomers. Fig. 4A shows that rCRT/18-412 was successfully separated into 3 peaks, designated sequentially as OrCRT (higher-molecular-weight rCRT/18-412 oligomers, major peak), MrCRT-60 kDa (monomeric rCRT/18-412, 60 kDa) and MrCRT-46 kDa (monomeric rCRT-46 kDa, aa18-386, see below). Guided by the SDS-PAGE results ( , revealed their molecular mass as 46.78 kDa and 43.57 kDa, respectively. It can therefore be calculated that rCRT-46 kDa is a degradation product of rCRT-60 kDa less the C-terminal 26 amino acid residues.

As shown in Fig. 5A , OrCRTs were modestly more effective than unfractionated rCRT/18-412 in eliciting TNF-a production by murine macrophages in vitro, while MrCRT-60, MrCRT-46 and nCRT were 50-100-fold less active than OrCRTs by comparison. A similar conclusion was also drawn when NO 2 2 production was taken as a measure for macrophage activation (Fig. 5B) . Moreover, s.c. immunization of BALB/c mice with OrCRTs or unfractionated rCRT/18-412 (in the absence of adjuvant) elicited high titer serum IgG capable of recognizing both OrCRTs and MrCRTs in ELISAs (Figs. 5C-5F). By contrast, MrCRT-60 kDa (monomeric rCRT/18-412) and MrCRT-46 kDa (monomeric rCRT/18-386) were almost non-immunogenic in parallel experiments.

In order to assess whether the IAS is located in the N or P domain, the following fragments were designed: rCRT-N (residues 18-197, full length N domain), rCRT/120-250 (partial N, half P domains), rCRT/150-230 (partial N, one third P domains), rCRT/120-308 (partial N, full length P domain), and rCRT/ 198-308 (full length P domain). All, but rCRT/198-308 (very low yield and poor solubility), were successfully expressed in E. coli and affinity-purified. Both rCRT/120-250 and rCRT-N formed homodimers as well as higher-molecular-weight species (Fig. 6A) . rCRT/120-250 was as potent as rCRT/39-272 and rCRT/18-412 in terms of eliciting NO 2 2 production by murine macrophages, while rCRT-N was almost completely inactive (Fig. 6B ). Similar to rCRT/120-250, rCRT/120-308 also formed homodimers and higher-molecular-weight oligomers and showed strong macrophage-stimulatory activity in vitro (Table 1) . rCRT/150-230, which contains a single cysteine residue (Cys163) and could only form homodimers (Fig. 6A) , was approximately 10 fold less effective than rCRT/39-272 and rCRT/120-250 but nevertheless substantially more potent than MrCRTs and nCRT (Fig. 6B) . A mutant form of rCRT/150-230 (namely rCRT/150-230-C163A) was prepared by substituting the cysteine residue at position 163 with alanine. The C163A mutant was neither able to form homodimers/oligomers in solution nor activate macrophages in vitro (Figs. 6C-6E). These results map the IAS of CRT to residues 150-230 and suggest that the N-domain probably does not contribute to the immunological activity of the molecule. Moreover, the importance of oligomerization for its immunological activities is further confirmed.

In order to investigate the mechanisms for the relationship between rCRT oligomerization and its potent immunological activities, fractionated OrCRTs and MrCRT-60 kDa (monomeric rCRT/18-412) were conjugated with FITC and then compared for ability to stain macrophages. After 30 min incubation at 4uC, FITC-OrCRTs showed stronger binding to murine macrophages than FITC-MrCRTs, as evidenced by flow cytometric analysis and confocal laser scanning microscopy (Fig. 7A&B) . Substantially more FITC-OrCRTs than FITC-MrCRTs were endocytosed by macrophages after 30 min incubation at 37uC (Fig. 7B) . Moreover, monodansylcadaverine (MDC), an endocytosis inhibitor [21] , partially suppressed NO 2 2 production by macrophages under stimulation with OrCRTs, while LPS-triggered macrophage activation was unaffected by the same treatment (Fig. 7C ).

In this study, we have examined different hypotheses (i.e. Cdomain deletion hypothesis, LPS contamination hypothesis, RPL2 hypothesis and oligomerization hypothesis) for explanation of the much stronger immunogenicity and immunostimulatory activities of rCRT than nCRT. Our data strongly suggests that selfoligomerization of the rCRT polypeptides is a key factor for their strong immunological activities. As summarized in Table 1 , all four rCRT fragments containing residues 120-250 (including rCRT/18-412, rCRT/39-272, rCRT/120-250 and rCRT/120-308) self-oligomerized and exhibited potent macrophage activating ability in vitro and strong immunogenicity in vivo, while nCRT, which existed mainly in monomeric form, showed only modest stimulatory activities towards macrophages and was non-immunogenic in mice (Figs. 1 & 3) . Moreover, fractionated rCRT/18-412 oligomers were 50-100 folds more active than MrCRTs in activating macrophages in vitro (Fig. 5) . The N domain polypep-tide (rCRT/18-197) also formed higher-molecular-weight oligomers (Fig. 6A ), but it is almost completely inactive in terms of stimulating macrophages in vitro (Fig. 6B ) and inducing Ab responses in vivo (Table 1) . Clearly, oligomerization is necessary but not sufficient to arm the rCRT polypeptides with potent immunological activities.

In general, oligomerized (aggregated) proteins are more immunogenic than their monomeric counterparts. However, the immunogenicity of OrCRTs is by far the most impressive and not comparable by other protein aggregates. Even in the absence of any adjuvant, minute amount (1 ng/mouse) rCRT/18-412 or rCRT/39-272 can elicit strong IgG responses in mice ( Fig. 2; Ref. 16 ). Most, if not all, other protein antigens are unable to induce IgG production in T-cell-deficient nude mice, yet rCRT/39-272 and rCRT/18-412 could do so relatively efficiently [16, 22] . Moreover, the potent adjuvanticity of the rCRT polypeptides is also quite phenomenal. For instance, rCRT/39-272 (mostly in oligomeric forms) is able to assist the production of IgG Abs against fused target proteins or conjugated polysaccharides in healthy mice or T-cell-deficient nude mice [17, 22] . Dimerization/oligomerization of soluble CRT was also observed by previous investigators. For example, Jorgensen et al documented that shielding of the free Cys163 in the N domain is the main reason that nCRT exists mainly in monomeric form under physiological conditions. Under partial unfolding conditions such as high temperature or low PH, however, the free Cys could be exposed and subsequently help CRT oligomerization [23] . nCRT (isolated from human placenta) formed homodimers and higher-molecular-weight species through disulfide bonding as well as non-covalent association, and that oligomerized nCRT showed higher binding affinity to peptides and denatured proteins [23] . In the case of prokaryotically expressed rCRT polypeptides (the folding of which may differ from nCRT), all Cys residues in sequence could contribute to its olimerization, although it might not be absolutely necessary that all 3 Cys residues have to be available for inter-molecular cross-linking at the same time. Mancino and colleagues illustrated that self-oligomerized rCRT could better assist HLA folding in vitro [24] . There are 3 conserved cysteine residues in the amino acid sequence of CRT. Cys105 and Cys137 form intramolecular disulfide bonds, while Cys163 is free [25] [26] . It is likely that rCRT polypeptides are unable to form appropriate intra-molecular disulfide bonds like in nCRT, thereby allowing all 3 cysteine residues to participate in self-oligomerization, although formation of higher-molecularweight oligomers could also occur through non-covalent association of CRT [23, 27] . CRT is considered one of the heat shock proteins (HSPs) that share many immunological and biochemical activities [28] [29] . Interestingly, self-oligomerization also occurs to other HSPs such as GRP94 and HSP90, which is likely associated with their chaperone function [30] [31] [32] .

Koslov et al and Chouquet et al have recently solved the crystal structure of the lectin site as well as a peptide-binding site in the CRT N domain [18, 19] , which apparently play important roles in the physiological function of CRT. However, our data maps the IAS of CRT to a region of 80 residues between aa150-230 (Fig. 6 ). As rCRT-N was almost completely inactive in functional assays (Fig. 6, Table 1 ), the IAS may be narrowed down further to aa198-230 in the P domain, although a series of truncated synthetic peptides covering this region would be needed for a concrete conclusion. Interestingly, this sequence of 30 amino acid residues contains the RA shared epitope (SE)-binding site (residues 217-224) of CRT recently mapped by Ling et al. [33] . Such coinciding results from 2 independent groups further emphasize the importance of the aa198-230 region of the P domain to the immunological activities of CRT. It has been documented that the CRT P domain adopts a hairpin-shaped structure, its sequence is consisted of 3 copies of a repeat motif (type 1: IXDPXXXK-PEDWD) followed by 3 copies of another repeat motif (type 2) [34] [35] [36] . Interestingly, the SE-binding site almost completely overlaps the type 1 motif [33] . It is reasonable to suggest that the type 1 motif might also represent the core of IAS of CRT, responsible for direct biding with activation receptors on the surface of immune cells. Functional comparison data showed that rCRT/120-308 and rCRT/120-250 (possessing 3 type 1 repeats, the latter without type 2 repeats) are 10 times more active than rCRT/120-230 (with 2 type 1 repeats, no type 2 repeats) in activating macrophages (Table 1, Fig. 6B ), implying that (i) type 2 repeats do not contribute to the immunological activity of the molecule; and (ii) the presence of 3 copies of the type 1 motif is of crucial importance for the potent immunological function of OrCRTs. It can be envisaged that oligomerization of CRT multiplies its binding avidity to immune cells with receptors for the type 1 motif, thereby enabling it to deliver stimulatory signals to the cells in a highly efficient manner. We further predict that the high-avidity binding of OrCRTs to macrophages may easily trigger their uptake process. Indeed, OrCRTs can activate macrophages in an endocytosis-dependent pathway (Fig. 7) . Perhaps OrCRTs could use certain intracellular sensors to deliver immunostimulatory activity to the responding immune cells. An example of an intracellular sensor for endocytosed polymeric proteins is the NOD-like receptor (NLR) protein NLRP3, a key component of the NLRP3 inflammasome and an important intracellular sensor for microbial ligands and endogenous danger signals [37] . Masters and colleagues demonstrated that soluble oligomers of islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP), a protein that forms amyloid deposits in the pancreas during type 2 diabetes, could be endocytosed and trigger the NLRP3 inflammasome and generate mature IL-1b [38] .

Finally, the region of aa150-230 of CRT has a 98% homology between mouse and human. It would be of interest to examine if there is a functional relationship between the SE binding site and the IAS of CRT. Irrespective of such a relationship, oligomerization might occur to extracellular CRT released by tissue cells thereby converting CRT into a highly active form, which may play important roles in the development and pathogenesis of autoimmune disorders in humans.

Purification of nCRT nCRT was purified from mouse livers using a modification of a previously described methods [39, 40] . Briefly, fresh mouse liver cells (erythrocytes depleted) were collected and centrifuged at 1200 rpm for 5 min. The cell pellet was lysed in 3 volumes of lysis buffer (1% Triton-X 100, 0.2 mM PMSF in PBS) for 30 min on ice, followed by centrifugation at 35,000 g for 60 minutes. The supernatant was then precipitated using (NH 4 ) 2 SO 4 and the final precipitate dissolved in binding buffer (150 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris, PH7.4) followed by dialysis against this buffer. The sample was applied to a DEAE Sephadex A50 column (1062 cm, GE Healthcare, US) which was then sequentially washed with binding buffer and washing buffer (280 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris, PH7.4) at 1 ml/min to remove contaminating proteins. The fractions were eluted with a linear salt (280-500 mM NaCl) gradient.

The preparation of rCRT/39-272 and rEGFP was as previously described [16] and the other rCRT polypeptides used in this study were prepared using the same prokaryotic system. Specific primers were as follows: 59-CCCAAGCTTCTAATCTGTGGGGTCATC-GATCTTG-39. The rCRT/150-230-C163A mutant was constructed using TaKaRa Mutan BEST Kit (TaKaRa Biotechnology Co. Ltd) following manufacturer's instruction. The mutant primer was as follows: sense: 59-ATTCACACACCTATACA-CACTGATT-39, antisense: 59-TCATCATCCTTAGCCCGGA-TATCCT-39. All proteins were desalted by passing through PD10 columns (Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA). Protein concentration was determined using Coomassie protein assay reagent (Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA). All recombinant proteins were used at over 90% purity as judged by CBB-stained SDS-PAGE gels.

The separated protein bands in SDS-PAGE gels were electroblotted onto PVDF membranes, at a constant current of 250 mA in transbuffer (50 mM Tris, pH 8.0, containing 0.192 M glycine and 20% methanol), using a Bio-Rad Trans-Blot Cell. The strips were incubated for 1 hr at room temperature in blocking buffer (TBS containing 5% nonfat milk), followed by a overnight incubation at 4uC with constant agitation in indicated antibody diluted in blocking buffer. After 3 washes with TBS containing 0.05% Tween 20, strips were incubated for 1 hr with HRPconjugated secondary antibody (Southern Biotechnology Associates Inc., USA) and visualized using the ECL detection system as recommended by the manufacturer (Applygen Technologies Inc., Beijing, China).

LPS-based and CRT-based ELISAs were as previously described [41] . Briefly, ELISA plates were coated at 4uC overnight with rCRT or LPS and subsequently incubated with blocking solution (1% BSA in PBS) for 2 hrs at 37uC. The wells were washed five times with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 (PBS-T) prior to incubation at 37uC with 100 ml of diluted mouse sera or with indicated protein (nCRT and lactoferrin) followed by corresponding antibody in triplicate. After 5 washes with PBS-T, the plates were further incubated with HRP-labeled goat-antimouse or goat-anti-rabbit IgG Abs (Southern Biotechnology Associates Inc., AL., USA) for 1 hr at 37uC. The reaction was developed with 100 ml of o-phenylenediamine (OPD, Sigma) for 5 min and stopped with 100 ml 2 M H 2 SO 4 . Optical density (OD) was measured at 492 nm in an ELISA spectrophotometer (Titertek Multiscan Plus MK II; ICN Flow Laboratories, Irvine, UK).

All cells were cultured in complete R10 medium: RPMI-1640 supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, USA), penicillin/streptomycin (100 U/ml), L-glutamine (2 mM), and b-ME (5610 25 M). For preparation of mouse peritoneal macrophages, mice were injected i.p. with 3% thioglycollate (1 ml/ mouse) and the macrophages retrieved from the peritoneum 3 days later using a syringe. The resultant cells were.90% positive for F4/80 marker, as determined by FACS analysis. Relative macrophage stimulation activity (RMSA) of CRT is estimated using nCRT as reference, which is able to induce TNF-a production by macrophages in vitro at a concentration of 10 mg/ml or above (see Fig. 5A ). The listed results are based on several batches of independent experiments including Fig. 5A . b) Ability to elicit specific IgG responses in healthy BALB/c mice after s.c. immunization, in the absence of adjuvant, with 100 mg protein and a booster immunization with 50 mg protein a fortnight later. The mice were monitored for up to 28 days after the second immunization. ND: not detected; -: not immunogenic; +: strong humoral response; 2/+: weak response. 

Freshly prepared C57/BL6 mouse peritoneal macrophages (1.5610 5 cells/well) were stimulated with rCRT fragments, or nCRT, or LPS, in R10 medium in 96-well tissue culture plates for 24 hrs in a 5% CO 2 incubator at 37uC. The concentration of TNF-a in the culture supernatant was determined using ELISA kits (Biolegend, San Diego, USA) following the manufacturer's instructions. The concentration of NO 2 2 in the supernatant was determined by Griess Reagent. Standard curves were established using NaNO 2.

Female C57BL/6 mice between the age of 6-8 weeks were purchased from the Model Animal Research Center, Nanjing, China. All animals were maintained under specified-pathogen-free (SPF) conditions and animal usage was conducted according to protocols approved by the Soochow University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. For immunization with rCRT, mice were immunized s.c. at the base of the tail with 100 mg protein in total 100 ml PBS. When booster immunization was needed, 50 mg of protein in 200 ml PBS was injected intraperitoneally (i.p.). For immunization with PAGE gel slices containing Cp32, the band was cut out with a razorblade and then frozen in liquid nitrogen and emulsioned with CFA, which was then injected s.c. into female C57/BL6 mice. Serum samples were collected by tail bleeding, aliquoted and kept at 220uC until use.

A Sephadex G-75 (GE Healthcare, US) column of 8062 cm was employed. 5 ml of rCRT/18-412 at 10 mg/ml was loaded into the column, followed by elution with 0.9% NaCl at 20 ml/h and collected every 2 ml.

Protein was labeled by FITC using FluoroTag TM FITC Conjugation Kit (Sigma, US) according to the manufacturer's instructions. In brief, 1 mg of protein was dialyzed against 0.1 M Na 2 CO 3 , pH 9.5 at 5 mg/ml. Fluoresceine isothiocyanate (FITC, Sigma) was dissolved in the same buffer with DMSO at 1 mg/ml and 50 ml of this solution was added to the protein. The sample was gently mixed for 2 h at RT. Separation of labeled protein from unbound FITC was performed on a Sephadex G-25 column.

Flow Cytometric Analysis 10 6 freshly isolated peritoneal macrophages were stained with APC-anti-F4/80 and then incubated with 15 mg/ml of FITC-OrCRT, FITC-MrCRT or FITC-OVA for 30 min at 4uC. The binding of CRT by macrophages was determined by flow cytometry (BD FACS Canto II, US).

Macrophages (1.5610 5 /well) were plated onto poly-l-lysine coated glass slides and allowed to adhere. The cells were then incubated in a total volume of 200 ml 0.5% BSA in PBS with 15 mg/ml FITC-OrCRT, FITC-MrCRT or FITC-OVA for 30 min at 4uC or 37uC. After washing to remove unbound protein, macrophages were fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde and stored at 4uC until microscopic analysis. Finally, 1% of glycerol was added and slides were counterstained with 1 mg/ml DAPI. The cells were imaged with a Nikon confocal microscope system A1.

All experiments were repeated at least 3 times and the results are expressed as mean6standard deviation of the mean (SD). Statistical analysis was performed using the Independent-Samples t test or two-side paired t test between groups using the SPSS 14.0 program (SPSS, Chicago, IL). Differences were considered statistically significant at p,0.05.

Systematic Literature Review on the Spread of Health-related Misinformation on Social Media,"Contemporary commentators describe the current period as ""an era of fake news"" in which misinformation, generated intentionally or unintentionally, spreads rapidly. Although affecting all areas of life, it poses particular problems in the health arena, where it can delay or prevent effective care, in some cases threatening the lives of individuals. While examples of the rapid spread of misinformation date back to the earliest days of scientific medicine, the internet, by allowing instantaneous communication and powerful amplification has brought about a quantum change. In democracies where ideas compete in the marketplace for attention, accurate scientific information, which may be difficult to comprehend and even dull, is easily crowded out by sensationalized news. In order to uncover the current evidence and better understand the mechanism of misinformation spread, we report a systematic review of the nature and potential drivers of health-related misinformation. We searched PubMed, Cochrane, Web of Science, Scopus and Google databases to identify relevant methodological and empirical articles published between 2012 and 2018. A total of 57 articles were included for full-text analysis. Overall, we observe an increasing trend in published articles on health-related misinformation and the role of social media in its propagation. The most extensively studied topics involving misinformation relate to vaccination, Ebola and Zika Virus, although others, such as nutrition, cancer, fluoridation of water and smoking also featured. Studies adopted theoretical frameworks from psychology and network science, while co-citation analysis revealed potential for greater collaboration across fields. Most studies employed content analysis, social network analysis or experiments, drawing on disparate disciplinary paradigms. Future research should examine susceptibility of different sociodemographic groups to misinformation and understand the role of belief systems on the intention to spread misinformation. Further interdisciplinary research is also warranted to identify effective and tailored interventions to counter the spread of health-related misinformation online.","The spread of misinformation is not new, dating back at least to the early days of printing. Even the term ""fake news"", which has achieved considerable contemporary prominence, was first coined in 1925, when an article in Harper's Magazine, entitled ""Fake News and the Public"" mourned how newswires were allowing misinformation to disseminate rapidly (McKernon, 1925) . The growth of the Internet has, however, initiated a fundamental change. In 2013, the World Economic Forum warned that potential ""digital wildfires"" could cause the ""viral spread"" of intentionally or unintentionally misleading information (World Economic Forum, 2013) . In the health arena, much concern has focused on the spread of misinformation on immunisation, with social media acting as a powerful catalyst for the 'anti-vaxxer movement'. By encouraging individuals not to vaccinate their children, this movement has been linked to recent measles outbreaks in countries such as the UK, the US, Germany and Italy (Datta et al., 2017; Filia et al., 2017) . The prevalence and persistence of such misinformation justifies a careful and systematic review of published literature on the nature and the mechanisms by which misinformation spreads.

We first review the distinctions between various terms that relate to misinformation. Following the 2016 US presidential election, the term ""fake news"" attracted substantial media and scholarly attention. The term overlaps with other forms of misleading information, and especially misinformation and disinformation, all conveying messages, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2019.112552 Received 21 January 2019; Received in revised form 29 August 2019; Accepted 12 September 2019 stories, theories, or opinions that spread rapidly through social contacts or online media. They differ primarily with respect to intent and mode of spread. Misinformation involves information that is inadvertently false and is shared without intent to cause harm, while disinformation involves false information knowingly being created and shared to cause harm (Wardle and Derakhshan, 2017) . Although ""fake news"" is the term that received most popular attention, it is arguably the most problematic one in terms of definitional rigour. Lazer et al. (2018) described it as fabricated information that mimics news media content, but this does not capture the complexity of the phenomenon, which can include both satire and information created deliberately to mislead as a means to achieve a political or other goal (Wardle, 2017) . A recent report by a parliamentary committee in the UK concluded that ""The term 'fake news' is bandied around with no clear idea of what it means, or agreed definition (House of Commons, 2019). The term has taken on a variety of meanings, including a description of any statement that is not liked or agreed with by the reader. We recommend that the Government rejects the term 'fake news', and instead puts forward an agreed definition of the words 'misinformation' and 'disinformation'"". Since the phrase also has been politicized by powerful figures to discredit certain news media (Vosoughi et al., 2018) , we refrain from using the term ""fake news"" throughout the paper.

While noting these distinctions, in practice it often seems difficult to differentiate these categories because of the problem in ascertaining intent. For example, anti-vaccine propaganda may be spread by those who have a genuine concern, however misguided, about safety, and by those who are using the issue as a tool to undermine trust in particular governments. Thus, unless the intent is clear, we use the term misinformation as an umbrella term to include all forms of false information related to health, thereby giving those generating it the benefit of the doubt.

Before discussing the macro-phenomenon of misinformation spread, we first conceptualize the potential mechanism following Wardle and Derakhshan (2017) . Three major components are involved in the creation, production, distribution and re-production of misinformation agent, message and interpreter (Wardle and Derakhshan, 2017) . Our review will look at whether and how existing literature from different disciplines examine the type of actor behind the creation of health-related messages on social media platforms, the descriptive features of the messagethe durability and distribution of accurate and misleading information -and most importantly, the interpreter's response and how it contributes to the reproduction of misinformation. At the micro-level, individuals who receive misinformation form judgement about the believability of the message, depending on information source, narrative and context, while the tendency to spread depends on the degree to which receivers suspect such misinformation (Karlova and Fisher, 2013 ). At the macro-level, we observe patterns of misinformation cascade and characteristics of networks.

Early literature on spread of rumours (circulating stories or reports of uncertain or doubtful truth) identified the ""basic law of rumour""the amount of rumour in circulation will vary with the importance of the subject to the individuals concerned times the ambiguity of the evidence pertaining to the topic in question (Allport and Postman, 1947) . The link between psychological and cultural dimensions generated intriguing questions on what makes misinformation so easy to spread and so hard to debunk.

According to Allport and Postman (1947) , the ambiguity of the message may be due to the receipt of conflicting stories, with no one more credible than another. The concept of credibility, as investigated extensively in communications research, encompasses message credibility, source credibility, and media credibility (Metzger et al., 2003) . With traditional media, each aspect of information credibility is relatively well understood, although even there some caution is needed. In contrast, with social media, it is particularly challenging to assess the source credibility, as users themselves are the self-publisher, subject to no form of factual verification or accountability. We do know that people regard information from the internet as being as credible as conventional media such as television and radio, but not as that from newspapers (Johnson and Kaye, 1998; Kim and Johnson, 2009 ). Many studies have thus analysed the credibility of user-generated contents and the cognitive process involved in the decision to spread online information on social and political events (Abbasi and Liu, 2013; Castillo et al., 2011; Lupia, 2013; Swire et al., 2017) . This research has highlighted the importance of source credibility and persuasiveness as factors affecting the susceptibility of users to the messages conveyed. Other relevant studies have focused on important concepts such as misperception and confirmation bias, whereby people's views on factual matters are strongly influenced by prior beliefs (Taber and Lodge, 2006; Nyhan and Reifler, 2010; Jerit and Barabas, 2012) ; polarization within networks (Lewandowsky et al., 2012) ; and the combined effects of these phenomenon facilitated by social media (Del Vicario et al., 2016; Boutyline and Willer, 2017; Shao et al., 2018) . While much of the existing literature has examined social and political issues, we focus on misinformation related to health and wellbeing.

There is limited understanding of why certain individuals, societies and institutions are more vulnerable to misinformation about health. This is perhaps surprising, as health promotion and public health researchers now pay considerable attention to the potential of the internet as a tool to diffuse health-related information (Chew and Eysenbach, 2010; Ritterband and Tate, 2009; Murray et al., 2009; Scanfeld et al., 2010; Signorini et al., 2011) , employing smart phones and other mobile technologies in preventative interventions (Abroms et al., 2013; Eng and Lee, 2013; Free et al., 2013; Steinhubl et al., 2015) . Although the internet provides immense opportunities, it also lowers the cost of generating and disseminating information, allowing misinformation and sensationalized stories to propagate. What was once spread locally can rapidly become global, with ideas no longer confined or delayed by geography. This has generated a series of studies of information diffusion (Serrano et al., 2015) , rumour spread (He et al., 2015) , and consequent behavioural changes (Salathé and Khandelwal, 2011; Wakamiya et al., 2016) . These generally employ sophisticated modelling and simulation techniques to identify the rumour propagation dynamics. However, this is still in its infancy and one recent systematic review of behavioural change models found that most papers investigating spread of health-related information and behavioural changes are theoretical, failing to use real-life social media data (Verelst et al., 2016) . The literature on misinformation spread is growing, but spans disparate disciplines, including communication studies, epidemiology, psychology, and computational science. We contend that it is now necessary to integrate the different perspective and methodologies, to understand the characteristics of susceptible populations and to devise interventions that are most effective in countering this spread.

To address this gap and provide a comprehensive view on the available evidence, we undertake what is, to our knowledge, the first systematic review of studies that investigated the health-related misinformation content on social media and how it spreads online. We include papers stemming from different disciplines and we analyse them on different dimensions.

First, we identify the main health-related topics where misinformation tends to spread and the descriptive features of misinformation. By focusing on the content and the spread of different health-related misinformation, we reveal a broad landscape of issues that attract actors to espouse misleading claims. The findings shed light on the extent to which different topics are identified and investigated in the literature. This approach can inform those working in these areas.

Y. Wang, et al. Social Science & Medicine 240 (2019) 112552 This seeks to inform social scientists, psychologists, and experts in other fields working to understand this issue, who may otherwise overlook the range of theories that underpin the work of researchers seeking to conceptualize the spread of misinformation. As this is a phenomenon that can be examined from many different perspectives, we have undertaken a co-citation analysis to assess the extent to which different disciplinary paradigms are informing each other, thereby facilitating future interdisciplinary research that can contribute to a more inclusive theoretical framework.

We then explore the existing theories used to explain the phenomenon and undertake a co-citation analysis to ascertain the extent to which ideas spread among disciplinary communities.

We further discuss the different empirical strategies adopted in the analysis. In doing so, we identify the social media platforms where the authors obtain the empirical data, how they incorporate different statistical models to interpret the data, and the empirical progress in our understanding of the mechanism. We conclude by examining the potential for future interdisciplinary research and practical interventions to counter misinformation spread.

Our reporting strategy follows the PRISMA guidelines (Moher et al., 2009 This yielded 206 records from PubMed, 33 records from Cochrane, 341 records from Web of Science, 51 records from Scopus and 62 records from Google ( Fig. 1.) . We identified and removed duplicates, which resulted in 651 records that were first screened based on title, abstract, and keywords and then using full-text where necessary. All eligible references were uploaded into reference management software (Mendeley) for assessment of eligibility.

Next, we screened the results of the 651 records based on title and abstract. Articles that were not original, not involving social media, not related to health, not in English and not on human subjects were excluded. At this, and the subsequent stage, we also excluded the very extensive literature on individual cognitive biases, which would be well beyond the scope of a single review. Similarly, we excluded research on static group decision-making, which can create misinformation (e.g. the phenomenon termed groupthink), that subsequently spreads.

This left 131 potentially eligible papers, which were subject to full-text analysis, applying the following pre-specified eligibility criteria: Misinformation. Only records that concern misinformation, disinformation, fake news, rumour or any form of information disorder were included.

Social media. Misinformation had to be propagated through online media.

Health. Only records related to disease, treatments, public health and wellbeing were included.

Model or empirical. Modelling (e.g. epidemiological, rumour spread) studies or empirical analysis of the distribution or the dynamic effect of misinformation.

Humans. We are interested in humans and behaviour of humans, and therefore excluded studies about animals and plants.

Original research. We excluded review articles and editorials. Language. We excluded articles written in languages other than English.

Finally, we excluded papers that lacked analytic rigour or did not incorporate misinformation as the main component of the analysis, which resulted in 57 articles. The PRISMA (Fig. 1) shows the results of these exclusions.

For the 57 included studies, we analysed the following elements in the full-text: (i) health-related issues and findings; (ii) theoretical framework (if any) and disciplines; (iii) study design.

To gain further insights on the disciplines contributing to this increasing area of research, we conducted a co-citation analysis of eligible articles to measure the frequency with which two sources are cited together by other documents. Co-citation analysis yields insight into potential disciplinary siloes and theoretical or methodological gaps in the literature. This was possible with 121 of the papers because 10 articles were not indexed on Scopus, where we extracted citation data from.

Fig. 2 shows the number of potentially eligible articles by year. Not surprisingly, the number of studies that investigated health-related misinformation increased over the years, from 7 in 2012 to 41 in 2018 (November) with a sharp rise in 2017. The trend implied the growing scholarly interest in the social phenomenon, potentially amplified by major political events in 2016. We exclude certain articles (n = 74) due to their lack of analysis or interpretation of misinformation as mentioned above, and the remainder of this result section relates only to the 57 remaining papers after full-text analysis.

Key features of the studies included are in the web appendix. We first investigated what health-related topics have been studied in relation to misinformation. The largest category relates to communicable diseases (n = 30), including vaccination in general (8) and specifically against Human Papilloma Virus (HPV), Measles, Mumps and Rubella (MMR) and influenza (3, 2 and 1 respectively), as well as infections with Zika virus (9), Ebola (4), influenza (1), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (1) and Nile Virus (1). Many articles concern chronic noncommunicable diseases such as cancer (3), cardiovascular disease (3), psoriasis (1) and bowel disease (1). Some also address issues of diet and nutrition (3), smoking (3) and water safety or quality (2). Five studies cover a broad range of health-related misinformation or rumour online, while the remaining studies were placed in a miscellaneous category, addressing other specific diseases, health problems or medical interventions (Fig. 3) . We now briefly describe each of these in turn. 3.1. Health-related issues and findings

Vaccine uptake, especially in children, has fluctuated in recent decades in many developed countries, with marked declines during certain periods. In 2012, the journal Vaccine devoted a special issue to ""The Role of Internet Use in Vaccination"", analysing some of the communication strategies used by both the anti-vaccination movement and public health professionals. Authors recommended comprehensive, structured, and easily understandable responses to anti-vaccination messages (Betsch and Sachse, 2012; Kata, 2012; Reyna, 2012; Nicholson and Leask, 2012) . Although refusal of vaccination and movements opposing vaccines date back to the time of Jenner, publication of fraudulent research linking the MMR vaccine to autism and bowel disease (Wakefield et al., 1998) was a seminal moment. The concerns raised then, although long since discredited, have been widely disseminated on social media and even now are highly influential among some groups. For instance, Basch et al. (2017) , Donzelli et al. (2018) and Porat et al. (2018) report high online prevalence and popularity of autism-related discussions in fora on vaccination. Tustin et al. (2018) and Xu and Guo (2018) also reported widespread misinformation about side effects, as well as mistrust in government or pharmaceutical companies in discussions on vaccination. Krishna's (2017) study of active propagators of these messages found that those who were knowledge-deficient and vaccine-averse exhibit higher levels of activity than those who are not. Aquino et al. (2017) reported a significant inverse correlation between MMR vaccination coverage and online searches and social network activity on ""autism and MMR vaccine"". Taken as a whole, the research identifies anti-vaxxer and members of online communities favouring conspiracy theories as sources or propagators of misinformation, with discussions tending to revolve around rhetorical and personal arguments that induce negative emotions (fear, anger, sadness). Although there is less misinformation than accurate information, the former has greater popularity among viewers.

The Zika epidemic stimulated considerable activity on Twitter (Wood, 2018) and Facebook (Sharma et al., 2017) , as well as spread of news items (Sommariva et al., 2018) , images (Seltzer et al., 2017) , and videos (Bora et al., 2018 ) on a range of media. Conspiracy theories directed at institutions feature frequently in these discussions. For instance, the Zika virus was portrayed as a bioweapon, while rumours spread that the Zika vaccine had been developed to depopulate the earth (Sommariva et al., 2018; Wood, 2018) . Conspiracist ideation played a crucial role in one's belief in misinformation (Lewandowsky et al., 2013) . However, Bode and Vraga (2018) did not find that belief in conspiracies reduced receptiveness to correction of misinformation on Zika virus, although this research generated several important insights for design of interventions to address this issue.

The Ebola outbreak also provided much additional material. For instance, Fung et al. (2016) examined the role of Twitter and Sina Weibo (Chinese microblog, equivalent to Twitter) in spreading rumours and speculating on treatments. Pathak et al. (2015) found numerous misleading videos online concerning Ebola virus disease. Similar to the studies on vaccination, much of this misinformation comes from individuals who are highly active in influencing opinions, and rumours often garner higher popularity than evidence-based information.

Though most research on misinformation has focused on infectious disease, misinformation on chronic illnesses such as cancer and cardiovascular disease are not uncommon on social media. Okuhara et al. (2017) looked at online discussions with opposing views on cancer screening in Japan, finding that most propagated anti-cancer screening messages. Staying in Asia, Chen et al. (2018a,b) examined the nature and diffusion of misinformation on gynaecologic cancer in China. Chua and Banerjee (2018) found that individuals are more likely to trust and share cancer-related rumours if the rumours are dreadful rather than wishful, and if one has had previous personal experience.

Studies on other chronic diseases mostly speculate on or promote alternative treatments, for example on diabetes (Leong et al., 2017) , heart failure (Chen et al., 2013) , hypertension (Kumar et al., 2014) and psoriasis (Qi et al., 2016) . Again, misleading videos are more influential. In addition, research by Leong et al. (2017) in India found that diabetes videos tailored to South Asians were more misleading than those not culturally-targeted.

Unsubstantiated messages regarding diets and nutrition can have detrimental effects on susceptible individuals. For instance, Syed-Abdul et al. (2013) investigated how anorexia is promoted as fashion and linked to ideas of beauty in YouTube videos, gaining high popularity among young female viewers. Bessi et al. (2015) , analysing the diffusion of diet, environment and geopolitics-related misinformation, found that active users are more likely to span a range of categories, and that online groups promoting conspiracy theories tend to exhibit polarization. Similar patterns are observed in discussions on water fluoridation, as memorably invoked in the 1964 movie Dr. Strangelove. Seymour et al. (2015) analysed the anti-fluoride network online and found that strong ties among the community are obstacles for expert opinions to be accepted. This indicates that social homogeneity may well be the primary driver of content diffusion and clustering. The modelling of rumour spread is therefore informative of the cascades' size and potential intervention designs in countering such spread.

The tobacco industry has a long history of distorting scientific evidence and misleading consumers. Very recently, Albarracin et al. (2018) showed how misleading portrayal of tobacco's health consequences introduces positivity towards smoking. The advent of electronic cigarettes prompted Harris et al. (2014) to examine content and tweet patterns related to an e-cigarette campaign by a local public health department. The misinformation included arguments that divert attention from the products to messages that sought to discredit authorities.

A few studies have investigated specifically the psychology of individuals who believe and share rumours. Chua and Banerjee (2017) , in their analysis on epistemic belief and its effect on the decision to share rumour, showed that epistemologically naïve users have higher propensity to share online health rumours. Li and Sakamoto (2015) discovered that exposing individuals to measures of collective opinion, through counts of retweets and collective truthfulness ratings could reduce the tendency to share inaccurate health-related messages. Taken as a whole, the evidence indicates that the motivation to believe and share rumours reflects both individual and collective makings, but the consequences are difficult to predict because of the complex psychological factors involved.

Finally, the group of miscellaneous studies mainly examined specific medical interventions or issues such as drugs (Al Khaja et al., 2018) , paediatric disease (Strychowsky et al., 2013) , abortion (Bryant et al., 2014) , dialysis (Garg et al., 2015) , suicide (Li et al., 2018) and multiple sclerosis (Lavorgna et al., 2018) . The common sources of misinformation included advertisements or comments related to advertisements (Garg et al., 2015) and patients' anecdotal experiences (Strychowsky et al., 2013) . Again, misinformation was more popular than factual messages.

We next investigated the theoretical foundations in the included studies, but it rapidly became clear that there was no widely agreed approach to this phenomenon, reflecting the broad range of disciplines that have investigated it. The more dominant disciplines and research areas according to the published journals include public health, health policy and epidemiology (n = 14), health informatics (n = 8), communications studies (n = 5), vaccines (=4), cyberpsychology (n = 3) and system sciences (n = 3).

Disciplinary approaches adopted to conceptualize the phenomenon are varied, but primarily fall within the fields of psychology (n = 8) and communication (n = 4), as well as network science (n = 7). While theories in psychology focus on individual-level cognitive response to misinformation and its corrections, frameworks in network and data science characterise the (online) societal mechanisms involved. For instance, Chua and Banerjee (2018) , in investigating the online behaviour in the face of health rumours, invoked the seminal rumour theory (Allport and Postman, 1947) , which views personal involvement as a common perception that dictates one's decision to spread rumour. Moreover, rumours that are repeatedly circulated can be reinforced and accepted as credible (Rosnow, 1991) , and the consequent perceived high credibility can in turn increase intention to trust and share rumours (Shin et al., 2017) . This relates to credibility research, which suggests that perceived credibility and can heighten the persuasive impact, especially for internet users who are not motivated to process information (Metzger, 2007; Metzger et al., 2010) . Similarly, Ozturk et al. (2015) explored how different social media settings can reduce rumour spread based on rumour psychology research. Others have referred to psychological studies around conspiracist ideation, inoculation theory and social conformity in understanding the mechanism behind health misperception on social media (Bode and Vraga, 2018; Bora et al., 2018; Li and Sakamoto, 2015) . Contrastingly, the use of system or network theories are aimed at explaining the patterns of social influence, social learning, social contagion and homophily and polarization processes (Bessi et al., 2015; Radzikowski et al., 2016; Schmidt et al., 2018; Sicilia et al., 2017; Wood, 2018) . The framework typically assists the subsequent social network analysis.

Two studies borrowed insights from philosophy - Grant et al. (2015) employed the rhetorical framework to examine the persuasive features of pro-and anti-vaccine sites, while Chua and Banerjee (2017) used the epistemology framework to explore the role of epistemic belief in affecting rumour-sharing behaviour. Finally, situational theory of publics (Grunig, 1997) from public relation studies are adopted to identify vaccine-negative activists (Krishna, 2017) . The remaining articles from computational studies and clinical perspectives lack any theoretical underpinning and are purely empirical.

Given that the findings are from disparate disciplines, we conduct the co-citation analysis on all the potentially eligible articles to identify the clusters of disciplinary communities. In co-citation network analysis, the unit of analysis is the cited source, and we include the journals cited at least 5 times within the 121 articles. As seen in Fig. 4 , the distance in the map between any pair of journals reflects their similarity to each other (van Eck and Waltman, 2010), and we use the LinLog/ modularity normalization technique to minimize the distance between connected nodes (Noack, 2009) . The size of the nodes represents the number of citations, and the line indicates the presence of citation in either direction. The analysis identified 4 distinct (inter-)disciplinary clusters, which we assigned as follows (with randomly generated colours, from left to right): Social Psychology and Communications (red), General Science and Medicine (blue), Infectious Disease/Vaccine and Public Health (green), Medical Internet and Biomedical Science (purple). Overall, the literature is concentrated in general science and vaccines/infectious diseases. Psychology and communications literature sit on the periphery, with relatively less cross-citation with the science and medicine literature. Interestingly, we also observe a few sociology journals at the bordering regions between clusters, implying their incipient roles in acknowledging different insights across disciplines. There is potential for greater interdisciplinary collaboration.

Turning to research design, most studies employed content analysis (n = 38) either alone or as a component of the analysis, studying various forms of social media (n = 10), YouTube videos (n = 12), Twitter or equivalents (n = 8), websites (n = 5), images (n = 1) or mobile messengers (n = 2). Authors observe the distribution of useful and misleading information, and the pattern of consumption by different users. Some studies incorporated social network analysis or epidemiological modelling to better explain the dynamics of misinformation spread (Bessi et al., 2015; Ghenai and Mejova, 2017; Harris et al., 2014; Jin et al., 2014; Radzikowski et al., 2016; Wood, 2018) . Many designs were also complemented by sentiment measures, for instance, the ""antivaccine"" sentiment (Bahk et al., 2016; Xu and Guo, 2018) .

Seven studies used experimental designs. Bode and Vraga, in three different papers, manipulated Facebook's ""related news"" function to confirm or correct (or both) misinformation about the purported link between vaccines and autism, as well as unfounded link between genetically modified organisms (GMO) and health (Bode and Vraga, 2015; Vraga and Bode, 2017) . They also simulated Twitter feeds with false information about Zika virus to evaluate the ability of corrective responses to reduce misperception (Vraga and Bode, 2017) . Banerjee (2017, 2018) undertook web-based experiments with Y. Wang, et al. Social Science & Medicine 240 (2019) 112552 participants exposed to combinations of rumours and counter-rumours. Ozturk et al. (2015) explored different ways to reduce rumour spread on Twitter using Amazon's Mechanical Turk, an online crowdsourcing platform. Albarracin et al. (2018) used the same platform to evaluate the effects of YouTube videos on viewer attitudes to tobacco products. A few studies used survey instruments to understand how social media can spread misconceptions about Ebola in West Africa (Adebimpe et al., 2015) and inflammatory bowel disease in the USA (Groshek et al., 2017) , and to explore the relationship between knowledge deficiency and negative attitudes towards vaccines (Krishna, 2017) . One case-study adopted an anthropological approach and used thick description to review the rhetorical features of both pro-vaccine and vaccine-sceptical websites Grant et al. (2015) .

We found that, while there have been studies of the spread of misinformation on a wide range of topics, the literature is dominated by those of infectious disease, including vaccines. Overall, existing research finds that misinformation is abundant on the internet and is often more popular than accurate information. Several of the studies address areas where state action challenges individual autonomy. The classic example is vaccination, where effective protection of the population requires achievement of levels of uptake sufficient to achieve herd immunity. This review confirms that misconceptions about MMR vaccine and autism, in particular, remain prevalent on social media (Aquino et al., 2017; Chen et al., 2018a,b) . Other topics share scientific uncertainty, with the authorities unable to provide confident explanations or advice, as with newly emerging virus infections such as Ebola and Zika viruses (Basch et al., 2017; Fung et al., 2016; Sommariva et al., 2018) .

The agents that create misinformation are mostly individuals with no official or institutional affiliations. This relates to our initial discussions on credibilitywhat makes a source trustworthy for readers? Formal institutions are increasingly challenged by the rise of, for instance, ""expert patient"", blurring the boundaries between authority and quasi-proficiency (Seymour et al., 2015) . Traditional vertical health communication strategies are eroded by horizontal diffusion of conspiracy-like messages. The narratives of misinformation are dominated by personal, negative and opinionated tones, which often induce fear, anxiety and mistrust in institutions (Bessi et al., 2015; Panatto et al., 2018; Porat et al., 2018) . When people are frightened and doubtful, they can be more susceptible to misinformation. Once false information gains acceptance in such circumstances, it is difficult to correct, and the effectiveness of interventions vary according to each individual's personal involvement, literacy and socio-demographic characteristics, features that tend to be under-explored in existing research.

The included articles adopted disparate theoretical approaches in conceptualizing the phenomenon, with the dominant frameworks from the fields of psychology and network science. Theories employed in psychology aimed to explain individual-level cognitive response of misinformation and rumour online (Bode and Vraga, 2018; Bora et al., 2018; Chua and Banerjee, 2018; Li and Sakamoto, 2015; Ozturk et al., 2015) , whereas network theories focus on the social mechanism and patterns of misinformation spread (Bessi et al., 2015; Radzikowski et al., 2016; Schmidt et al., 2018; Sicilia et al., 2017; Wood, 2018) . Further co-citation analysis on all articles that investigated the phenomenon revealed that the disciplinary landscape concentrates around general science and vaccines/infectious disease, while psychology and communication studies have less cross-citation with the science and medicine literature. The sociology discipline has great potential to bridge the different communities.

Researchers have employed increasingly sophisticated analytic techniques for empirical analysis, such as the use of social media data for sentiment analysis. The majority of the articles included a content analysis of the information on social media, ranging from text, images and videos. Several studies employed complexity and network theories to model the dynamics of rumour spread and opinion polarization Jin et al., 2014) . Other studies have adopted psychological and linguistic perspectives (Fung et al., 2016; Li et al., 2018; Waszak et al., 2018) . While we have excluded research on both Fig. 4 . Co-citation analysis. We extracted citation data from Scopus and analysed citation patterns using network-clustering algorithms in VOSviewer 1.6.8. The network map shows co-citation patterns of 121 journals cited at least 5 times within the studies that are potentially eligible. The node size represents the number of citations, and the lines represent the presence of citation in either direction. We restricted the minimum cluster size to 20, which resulted in 4 disciplinary clusters and 2367 links. We were not able to identify 10 articles because they were not indexed on Scopus, we therefore exclude them for the co-citation analysis.

Y. Wang, et al. Social Science & Medicine 240 (2019) 112552 individual and group biases, we feel it is important to note how several studies invoked the concept of confirmation bias, concluding that it plays an important role in creating online echo-chambers (Bessi et al., 2015; Donzelli et al., 2018) . This highlights the need for much more research on the socio-psychological characteristics of those who believe and propagate misinformation. In particular, there is a need to understand better the roles of both ideology and belief systems (Jost et al., 2018) and what might be termed ""lazy thinking"" (Pennycook and Rand, 2018) . For instance, although the role of literacy and cues to credibility are critical concepts in the design of experiments, they should also be explored in empirical studies, and especially those that use big data from social media platforms.

Although sociology and psychology pioneered research to understand rumour (Allport and Postman, 1947; Bartlett, 1932; Kirkpatrick, 1932) , psychologists are only beginning to study the implications of the explosion in internet use (Stone and Wang, 2018) . While we conclude from the co-citation analysis that studies on misinformation in health cover a wide range of disciplines, there is a marked lack of interdisciplinary research. This could, for example, allow hypotheses to be generated by social scientists using rumour theory and tested using quantitative analysis of social media data.

While most of the studies recommended courses of action based on their results, only a handful of papers proposed specific and tested interventions to reduce misinformation spread. For instance, Ozturk et al. (2015) discovered that rumour-countering warnings such as ""this tweet may contain misinformation"" did decrease participants' likelihood of sharing a rumour, consistent with findings in the psychological literature (Bordia and Difonzo, 2004) . Bode and Vraga (2018) showed that algorithmic correction (by a platform) and social correction (by peer) are equally effective in correcting misinformation and call for campaigns to encourage users to refuse false or misleading information. The same authors have shown how expert organization can correct misinformation without damaging its credibility, presenting an appealing intervention to reduce misinformation spread (Vraga and Bode, 2017) .

Finally, there is a need to characterise the scale and nature of the phenomenon much better, for example with studies of which sociodemographic characteristics make social media users more susceptible to and therefore likely to share health-related misinformation.

Before concluding, we will note several limitations of the systematic review. First, although we have attempted to define the phenomenon we are studying, our search strategy may not capture the terminology used by others. This is not just a problem of language. There are many related phenomena, such as denialism, groupthink, fearmongering, and equivalents in other languages, such as Lügenpresse (lying press) in German and it is possible that these or others may be used, in some circumstances, to describe some elements of what we are studying. Second, even when we agree the terms, such as misinformation and 'fake news', the meanings adopted by authors can vary. Third, as noted at the outset, it is very difficult to ascertain the motives of those spreading particular rumours and myths, leaving us unable to answer the old question ""mad or bad?"". Fourth, while our focus has been on messages concerning health-related issues, misinformation about other issues can have health consequences. For instance, a man from North Carolina travelled to Washington in 2016 and opened fire at a pizzeria following the spread of what became termed the Pizzagate theory, whereby it was alleged that the pizzeria was the site of a paedophile ring organised by Democratic Party leaders. Even though comprehensively debunked, subsequent polls showed that this allegation was still widely believed. Finally, since we excluded articles that are not published in English, we may have omitted relevant papers published in other languages.

Social media platforms, although providing immense opportunities for people to engage with each other in ways that are beneficial, also allow misinformation to flourish. Without filtering or fact-checking, these online platforms enable communities of denialists to thrive, for instance by feeding into each other's feelings of persecution by a corrupt elite (McKee and Diethelm, 2010) . The accumulation of individual beliefs in these unfounded stories, conspiracy theories, and pseudoscience can give rise to social movements, such as the anti-vaccination movement, with profound consequences for public health. This is further exacerbated by the fact that it is politically incorrect to question or criticize the belief of others, and the fight for truth is nevertheless against the flow of true believers armed with ignorance and misinformation (Kaufman et al., 2018) .

We have shown that academic literature on this social phenomenon mainly revolves around vaccination and infectious disease, drawing on various disciplines, frameworks and empirical methods. Among the articles examined, there is broad consensus that misinformation is highly prevalent on social media and tends to be more popular than accurate information, while its narrative often induces fear, anxiety and mistrust in institutions. The severity and the deleterious effects it may pose on the society is hardly quantifiable, but evidence abounds that we need more research on the identification of susceptible populations, and on the understanding of socio-demographic and ideological asymmetries in the intention to spread misinformation.

Finally, since the persistence of misinformation owes both to the psychological responses and to the social contexts under which misinformation spread, potential interventions should target both fronts. At the individual level, although interventions to correct misperceptions are proven effective at times, efforts to retract misinformation need to be carried out with caution in order to prevent backfiring. This requires profound understanding on how epistemic and ideology beliefs act as obstacles to accepting scientific evidence. A more constructive approach may be to cultivate critical thinking and to improve health and media literacy, thereby equipping individuals with the faculty to critically assess the credibility of information. At the system level, how we can amend our information ecosystem to reduce selective exposure and opinion polarization is not a challenge for academics and policy-makers alone to face. We therefore hope that our review can stimulate social scientists, psychologists, computer scientist and medical professionals to not only collaborate with each other, but also engage with industries and internet consumers to understand and counter the effects of this increasingly important social phenomenon.
