The International Health Regulations: The Governing Framework for Global Health Security,"r The International Health Regulations (IHR) are the governing framework for global health security yet require textual and operational reforms to remain effective, particularly as parallel initiatives are developed.","The IHR's origins can be traced to a series of Sanitary Conferences beginning in 1851 to forge an international agreement to curb the spread of infectious diseases (originally cholera, followed by plague and yellow fever) entering Europe from Asia, particularly India and the Levant. 10 At that time, the concept of global health security meant protecting Europe without unduly hindering trade. The Sanitary Conferences led to a binding agreement in 1892-the International Sanitary Convention (ISC)-focused on quarantine for cholera. European states subsequently adopted additional conventions, which were incorporated into a single ISC. By 1926, the ISC covered primarily cholera, yellow fever, and plague. The raison d'être of the earliest treaties grew out of a perceived security imperative for powerful countries. Most important was selfprotection against external threats, rather than safeguarding the public's health in every region of the world.

In 1907, the Rome Agreement created the Office International d'Hygiène Publique (OIHP), entrusting this new agency with overseeing the international health agreements. 11 At its creation in 1948, the WHO assumed OIHP's mandate and oversight of the ISC as well as a separate convention on air travel. The WHO Constitution empowered the Organization to adopt regulations to prevent the international spread of disease (Articles 21, 22) . Its power to adopt regulations is far-reaching-binding on Member States unless they affirmatively opt out. 12 In 1951, the WHA exercised this authority to replace the ISC with the International Sanitary Regulations (ISR), covering 6 diseases. In 1969, the WHA revised the ISR, changed their name to the International Health Regulations, and removed typhus and relapsing fever. The WHA removed smallpox in 1981 after its global eradication. By the time the WHA called for fundamental revision of the IHR in 1995, the treaty applied to the same 3 diseases as the original ISC-cholera, plague, and yellow fever-and no others. hemorrhagic fever, it became clear that the IHR were insufficiently flexible to respond to new infectious disease threats. The WHA called for the IHR's revision in 1995, and subsequent resolutions in 2001 and 2002 brought critical attention to the early detection of, and rapid response to, public health threats; yet the WHA took little action to shore up the obvious weaknesses in the IHR. [13] [14] [15] The imperative for global health governance took on fresh urgency with the advent of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Although SARS cases emerged in November 2002, China delayed notifying the WHO until February 2003. China took 2 additional months before permitting WHO epidemiologists to enter Guangdong province, where the outbreak originated. Later, Beijing conceded it had experienced hundreds more cases than previously reported. 16 Then WHO Director-General Gro Harlem Brundtland criticized China's delays, 17 catalyzing a major political shift toward a global norm of transparency and prompt reporting, further driving IHR reform. 18 The WHA adopted the revised IHR in 2005, with the treaty entering into force in 2007. Currently, the IHR have 196 States Parties-every WHO Member plus Lichtenstein and the Holy See. 19 

The revised IHR aim ""to prevent, protect against, control and provide a public health response to the international spread of disease"" (Article 2). The IHR broke from a disease-specific model, embracing an ""all-hazards"" strategy. They define ""disease"" to include all illnesses or medical conditions, irrespective of origin or source, that could present significant harm to humans (Article 1). The drafters intended to incorporate biological, chemical, and radio-nuclear events, as well as zoonotic diseases and threats to food safety.

Recognizing the importance of travel and commerce, the IHR contain a ""balancing dynamic,"" comprising public health, commerce and human rights (Figure 1 ). This balance informs the health measures a State Party may take for international travelers upon their arrival and departure (eg, medical examinations, vaccinations, observation) and for keeping ships and aircraft free of contamination and disease vectors. States Parties must, though, have sufficient scientific evidence of the risk posed and of whether the measure adopted is likely to ameliorate that risk before taking restrictive travel or trade measures or impinging The IHR obligate States Parties to develop core capacities to detect, assess, report, and respond to potential public health emergencies of international concern. The IHR (Annex 1) prescribe explicit capacities for surveillance and response and for controlling and containing disease at points of entry. The IHR identify minimum core capacities required at the local, intermediate (regional/provincial), and national levels to detect unexpected morbidity and mortality, report essential information, confirm and assess the status of reported events, notify the WHO when required (following the decision algorithm in Annex 2), and respond effectively to contain and mitigate the event.

To guide States Parties in developing IHR core capacities, the WHO published the IHR Core Capacity Monitoring Framework in 2010 (subsequently updated). 20 The IHR Monitoring Framework and accompanying IHR Monitoring Tool identified 8 specific core capacities, as well as 5 other capacities concerning points of entry and specific hazards ( Figure 2 ). For each of these 13 core capacities, the WHO identified attributes and actions, asking states to use these attributes to assess their compliance.

The concept of core capacities embraced an ""upstream"" public health strategy to prevent and contain outbreaks at their source. States Parties agreed ""to collaborate with each other to the extent possible"" to develop and maintain core capacities (Article 44). States Parties were required to develop and maintain core capacities by 2012, with a possible extension to 2014, and an additional extension to 2016. In 2015, the 68 th WHA extended the deadline to 2016 for all 81 States Parties that had requested extensions. The WHA also decided to support 60 priority countries, including those in west and central Africa, to meet core capacities by June 2019 3 ( Figure 3 ). Still, the Organization's pattern has been to accept continual delays in State Party compliance.

In line with their historical origins, the IHR contain rules regarding points of entry at ground, air, and water borders, as well as health measures for conveyances, goods, containers, and travelers. Further, States Parties must apply health measures in a nondiscriminatory manner, justify additional measures, collaborate with other states, and treat personal data confidentially. States Parties must report to the WHO on their IHR implementation and comply with prescribed dispute resolution procedures. Importantly, the IHR also set up new mechanisms for twoway communication and information sharing between the WHO and States Parties. The IHR mandate that each State Party appoint a National IHR Focal Point (NFP) for routine information sharing and coordination during health crises. All states have NFPs, at least on paper, but many NFPs either are not well trained in IHR implementation or-more often-are not properly tasked to routinely communicate with WHO headquarters.

The IHR require States Parties to promptly notify the WHO of events that may constitute a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) with an ongoing obligation to inform and respond to follow-up requests ( Figure 4 ). Notifications alert the world to unfolding public health events as well as marshal resources and coordinate global response efforts. To guide notifications, Annex 2 contains a decision instrument requiring States Parties to always notify the WHO of 4 specific diseases: smallpox, wild poliomyelitis, novel human influenza, and SARS. The algorithm also lists pandemic-prone diseases that trigger further assessment, including cholera, pneumonic plague, yellow fever, and viral hemorrhagic fevers. Beyond listed diseases, States Parties must utilize the instrument to assess any event of potential international public health concern, including from unknown causes, to determine if it is unusual or unexpected, may cross boarders, or may require travel or trade restrictions (Annex 2). Departing from previous international norms, the IHR authorize the WHO to consider reports from unofficial sources, such as scientists, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), print and broadcasting outlets, and social media platforms. When it receives an unofficial report, the WHO seeks verification from the States Parties in whose territory the event occurs. The director-general (D-G) has sole power to declare a PHEIC. In determining whether to declare a PHEIC, the D-G shall consider: (a) information provided by the State Party; (b) the decision instrument; (c) the advice of the Emergency Committee, which the D-G also has sole discretion to convene; (d) scientific principles and evidence; and (e) a risk assessment regarding human health, international spread, and interference with international traffic. If the D-G declares a PHEIC, she must issue temporary, nonbinding recommendations describing health measures States Parties should take. She is also empowered to terminate a PHEIC, which automatically expires after 3 months unless extended, modified, or terminated earlier.

Declared PHEICs. The 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic put the IHR to the test. The WHO declared the first-ever PHEIC after consultation with Mexico and the United States. 21 The WHO, however, was later criticized for fueling public fear when it became clear the virus was not highly pathogenic (although it still caused more than 200,000 deaths worldwide), 22 but that criticism was primarily aimed at WHO's then definition of the pandemic influenza phases, which stood outside the IHR framework. Many States Parties also disregarded the WHO's temporary recommendations against travel and trade restrictions; several states banned pork imports, while others instituted travel restrictions and advisories. 23, 24 In 2011, the WHO Review Committee charged with reviewing IHR functioning during the H1N1 pandemic cautioned, ""The world is ill-prepared to respond to a severe influenza pandemic . . . with tens of millions at risk of dying."" 25 In 2014, the D-G declared 2 further PHEICs, for polio and for Ebola. The designation of polio appeared counterintuitive given there was only a handful of cases. Yet small pockets of polio in Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Nigeria were putting global eradication at risk. The following year, the WHA endorsed extension of the PHEIC given political instability in the regions with ongoing outbreaks. 26 The polio PHEIC declaration is untraditional, appearing more to rally political support in targeted states than to alert the world to any large-scale reemergence of the disease.

In the case of Ebola, the D-G waited 4 months after announcing an ""unprecedented outbreak"" in April 2014 before declaring a PHEIC on August 8, 2014. 27 The delay only looked worse with time, as leaked WHO documents revealed that the WHO's decisions were highly political and lacked transparency. 28 The WHO's Ebola Interim Assessment Panel in July 2015 said that urgent warnings ""either did not reach senior leaders or senior leaders did not recognise their significance."" 2 The Harvard-LSHTM Independent Panel on the Global Response to Ebola wrote, ""Confidence in the organization's capacity to lead is at an alltime low."" 4 The temporary recommendations also suffered major flaws of their own, asking states with limited infrastructure to ensure health system capacities without adequate international assistance. 29 The Ebola PHEIC declaration, though, ultimately rallied the international community to bring the epidemic under control, but not before it had claimed more than 11,300 lives. 30 Most notably, President Obama sent in military assets to build treatment facilities and provide logistical support; the UN Security Council (UNSC) adopted a historic resolution calling Ebola a threat to international peace and stability; and the UN Secretary-General created a UN Mission for Ebola Emergency Response (UNMEER). Although the D-G continued the PHEIC on December 18, 2015, human-to-human transmission has virtually ended in the 3 most affected countries. This robust, albeit delayed, response demonstrates that political resolve and ample financing can bring seemingly intractable health threats under control.

On February 1, 2016, the D-G declared the fourth, and most recent, declaration of a PHEIC in response to the Zika epidemic. 31, 32 Since Brazil reported Zika in May 2015, an estimated 1 million infections have occurred across 25 countries in the Americas. IHR NFPs throughout the Americas have been reporting laboratoryconfirmed cases of Zika to the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), which has issued recommendations for the region. 33 Most concerning is a possible association between Zika virus and neurological disease (Guillain-Barré syndrome [GBS]) or fetal abnormalities (microcephaly). Curbing the Zika epidemic will require effective vector control, mosquito and human surveillance, and research for reliable diagnostic tests and a vaccine. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advised pregnant women to postpone travel to Zika-affected countries. Women who are considering becoming pregnant should talk with their doctor. 34 This is the first time the D-G has declared a PHEIC for a mosquitoborne disease, but the scope of the declaration was narrower than for other PHEICs. Dr. Margaret Chan said, ""I am now declaring that the recent cluster of microcephaly cases and other neurological disorders reported in Brazil, following a similar cluster in French Polynesia in 2014, constitutes a Public Health Emergency of International Concern."" 35, 36 In other words, the PHEIC was for the cluster of microcephaly and GBS rather than for the Zika virus itself. From a legal perspective, the wording of the PHEIC introduces confusion as neither microcephaly nor GBS is an infectious disease. These neurological and congenital conditions per se do not appear to be hazards that could cross borders under the meaning of Annex 2. It is the Zika virus itself and the mosquito vector that have the potential for international transmission.

Undeclared and Potential PHEICs. The world is now closely watching outbreaks of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), which originated in Saudi Arabia in 2012. MERS has yet to trigger a PHEIC declaration despite its reaching more than two dozen countries and accounting for at least 1,621 laboratory-confirmed cases and 584 deaths as of December 2015. 37, 38 By September 2015, the D-G had convened 10 Emergency Committee meetings, 39 with the last two occurring during and after the spread of the virus from Saudi Arabia to the Republic of Korea, which sparked a large outbreak. 40 The Emergency Committee recommended careful monitoring and strengthened infection prevention and control. Most MERS cases were linked to hospital settings, and in the absence of sustained community transmission, the Committee concluded the conditions to declare a PHEIC had not been met. 41 For many global health crises, the D-G chose not even to convene an Emergency Committee, including cholera in Haiti, the Fukushima nuclear disaster in Japan, and chemical weapons use in Syria. Each event would have required notification under Annex 2, in addition to the several hundred events that have been reported to the WHO as potential PHEICs. Confusion still exists as to what events warrant consideration by an Emergency Committee and a potential PHEIC declaration. What steps can and should the WHO take to ensure prompt notification and information sharing, and how can the D-G improve the transparency and scientific rigor for declaring a PHEIC?

The IHR afford a vital governing framework to limit the international spread of disease. Yet, 10 years of experience has shed light on the critical challenges in implementing the IHR, as well as major omissions in the regulations. These challenges and gaps have become politically salient, with deepening concern that the IHR, and the WHO itself, have failed to fulfill the promises of sound governance and leadership. The past decade has revealed an urgent need to improve the IHR's text, but failure to effectively implement the regulations has become far more important. States Parties, in particular, have undermined the IHR's effectiveness by failing to fully comply with their international obligations. Below, we explain the gaps and features of noncompliance that have undermined the IHR's operational viability.

National core capacities for preparedness, detection, and response form the bedrock of global health security. 42 Yet most States Parties have yet to fully establish core capacities. In 2014, only 64 States Parties reported meeting core capacities, while 48 failed even to respond to the WHO 43(p6) ( Figure 5 ). Governments have not properly funded and implemented required capacities, while international assistance has been limited. 43(p6) Achieving IHR core capacities by all states remains an indisputable baseline for global health security. The more time it takes to detect an event, the slower the response is and the more lives are lost. Every WHO IHR Review Committee and all the major commissions ( Table 1 ) have demanded that States Parties build and strengthen core capacities-all to little avail. 2,43(p12,13) Finding the resources to support health system capacity building has been challenging. While States Parties committed to providing domestic resources to build core capacities, national budgets often neglect this fundamental commitment under the IHR. Many countries with limited resources have had little bandwidth to prioritize building systems for unknown threats as they have struggled to meet the everyday health needs of their populations-ranging from primary care and essential medicines to safe childbirth and healthy mothers and babies. Similarly, the WHO and higher-income States Parties agreed to provide technical and financial assistance to countries in need (Article 44), but with some exceptions, 44,45 very few have funded projects explicitly for building IHR core capacities. The bulwark of international financing has been in the form of vertical funding streams, such as for AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria. All in all, sustainable funding commensurate with the need for IHR core capacities has come neither from national governments nor from donors.

Through the IHR Monitoring Tool, the WHO expects States Parties to conduct annual self-assessments on IHR implementation, focusing on the 13 core capacities. States were supposed to issue formal reports in 2012 (with additional reports in 2014 and 2016 for governments that requested extensions) to declare if they had fully implemented the regulations. If not, countries were supposed to submit a concrete plan to reach full implementation. Even if all States Parties had reported accurately and in a timely manner, national self-assessments are unacceptable and cannot ensure uniformly high-quality national preparedness. States Parties have not collected sufficient or the right kinds of data to produce quantitative assessments of what are predominately qualitative questions. Governments, moreover, do not use a consistent set of evidence-based metrics to measure their compliance. Most importantly, self-assessments are inherently self-interested and unreliable, absent rigorous independent validation. These deficiencies undermine the integrity and utility of self-assessments. 43(p6) Beyond the failure of political will, country assessments have not been directly linked to robust technical and financial assistance. Lowerincome states, perhaps understandably, express reluctance to upgrade their capacities without such assistance. Overall, responsibility for fulfilling core capacities must be a shared one, requiring dedicated domestic budgets, international financing, and WHO leadership. And absent these political and financial commitments to build core capacities, the world is considerably less secure.

Although the IHR call for robust information sharing through reporting of potential PHEICs and subsequent requests for follow-up data, countries continue to delay notifications and/or limit the information reported. Delayed reporting and/or lack of transparency and cooperation, for example, occurred in West Africa during Ebola and in Saudi Arabia during MERS. Additionally, governments have failed to share pertinent information about international travelers, either out of defiance of their international obligations or simply due to confusion about patient privacy-all despite guidance under Article 45.

The extant governance framework reveals an inherent tension, providing a disincentive to transparency and information sharing. The IHR cannot effectively govern global health security unless governments promptly report novel infections. This follows the simple pattern of the epidemiologic curve: the faster health authorities know about a novel event, the faster they can mount an effective response, leading to fewer cases ( Figure 6 ). But governments have economic reasons to withhold or delay transparent information sharing. They fear that once they have disclosed an outbreak of a novel infection, other governments and private parties may impose travel and trade restrictions, with severe economic consequences. For example, once they have disclosed, the IHR Emergency Committee could conclude that travel and trade restrictions are warranted; or, more likely, governments or the private sector may simply take action, disregarding WHO recommendations. The adverse economic impact of early reporting under the IHR can dissuade States Parties from being fully transparent.

Given previous patterns, national concern about the economic repercussions of prompt reporting appears fully justified. Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia, for example, experienced aggregate cumulative losses over 10% of GDP due to the Ebola outbreak. 46 Canada during SARS as well as Mexico and the United States during H1N1 suffered major losses from precipitous reductions in tourism and trade. Yet, the failure [and] that have the potential for such catastrophic economic impact."" The Commission estimates that a pandemic in the 21 st century could cost in excess of US$6 trillion. 5 Despite the severe health and economic repercussions of unnecessary travel and trade restrictions, the WHO has not had the political authority or capacity to prevent States Parties from disregarding its recommendations. The WHO is not a policing agency, and the IHR offer scant inducements to ensure consistent State Party compliance. When countries balance their IHR obligation to report against the risk of economic sanctions, they may wait as long as possible before sharing vital information.

The Ebola epidemic highlighted major deficiencies in mobilizing a large-scale, coordinated response to health emergencies. The IHR provide a framework for global health security, but that framework functions only if the WHO is an effective leader and governments build strong health systems. The WHO erred at multiple levels during the Ebola epidemic. The D-G waited 5 months after cross-border spread before declaring an emergency. The WHO Regional Office for Africa (AFRO) and country offices impeded deployment of international aid workers and equipment. Most importantly, the WHO failed to mobilize adequate fiscal and human resources until the epidemic was spinning out of control. The Organization eventually corrected these mistakes, but its errors probably cost thousands of lives. The fault lies, in fairness, not only with the WHO Secretariat but also with Member States that have starved the agency of resources for many years.

The reasons for the WHO's failures are well understood but remain resistant to change. In 2011, the agency cut its budget by nearly US$600 million due to a severe fiscal deficit, notably its epidemic response capabilities. 47 Its regional structures have also been longstanding problems, with major variability in regional organizations. The D-G has called on governments and donors to build core capacities and has asked for State Party compliance with the IHR, but without impact. 48 All the Ebola commissions have exhibited an implicit distrust in the Organization to make the necessary reforms. Instead, each panel has proposed a well-funded and accountable WHO Centre for Emergency Preparedness and Response. The Harvard-LSHTM Independent Panel on the Global Response to Ebola, for example, insisted that a new center be quasi-independent, with a separate governing board ( Table 2) .

The WHO is the agency charged with overseeing the IHR. Without effective leadership, the IHR's security framework breaks down. In other words, a strong treaty text is insufficient without a well-funded and robust operational response.

When the revised IHR were negotiated, Member States aimed to be as inclusive of all public health threats as possible. However, there remained major omissions in the text, notably sample sharing and zoonotic threats. The secretary-general should initiate the integration of health and humanitarian crises trigger systems.

The WHO should establish a transparent and politically protected Standing Emergency Committee. 

Indonesia sent shock waves around the world in December 2006, when its minister for health, Siti Fadilah Supari, refused to share samples of avian influenza A (H5N1) with the WHO. Indonesia's decision revealed fissures within the international community. Developing countries backed Indonesia's claim that it was unfair to require sharing viruses without any reciprocal obligation to make vaccines and medicines affordable. The WHO led a 5-year negotiation resulting in the 2011 Pandemic Influenza Preparedness (PIP) Framework. 49 The PIP Framework, however, applies only to pandemic influenza, and not to other novel pathogens such as SARS, MERS, and Zika. The PIP Framework stands entirely outside the IHR. The regulations, furthermore, are mostly silent on the health security issues of sharing biological materials and genetic sequencing data (GSD), as well as equitable access to medical countermeasures. Article 6(2) of the IHR, however, does offer some guidance for information sharing, stating that States Parties shall continue to provide relevant public health information to the WHO following a potential PHEIC notification, including case definitions, laboratory results, source and type of risk, number of cases and deaths, conditions affecting spread, and the health measures that have been deployed. There is no explicit mention of sharing biological materials or GSD, even though one could broadly interpret Article 6(2) to encompass these data. Certainly, biological materials and GSD are pertinent public health information that would shed light on the conditions affecting the spread of disease.

Neither the IHR nor the PIP framework, moreover, addresses a modern biosecurity hazard. In the not-too-distant future, scientists will be able to sequence the genetic composition of pathogens, enabling them to re-create novel viruses and to manipulate their genetic makeup. Although, for example, smallpox has been eradicated, scientists can sequence its genome, synthesize a real smallpox virus using the genetic code, and potentially enhance the virus's ability for airborne transmission. These capabilities pose major biosecurity threats, which the IHR and the PIP Framework do not govern. Harmonizing the IHR and the PIP Framework and closing major coverage gaps would markedly improve health security.

Approximately 70% of all emerging infectious diseases have a zoological origin, yet negotiators intentionally did not explicitly include animal diseases in the IHR. The drafters were perhaps too deferential to existing regimes, such as the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) and the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). Although the IHR broadly define ""disease,"" its currently realized scope is narrow, and the regulations do not incorporate a ""One Health"" approach that fully integrates animal and human health systems. The lack of such an approach could become a particularly salient omission for diseases like Zika with large animal reservoirs and with the primary mode of transmission through an insect source.

The IHR Monitoring Framework seeks to include zoonotic diseases as ""other hazards,"" but the regulations fail to govern multisectoral engagement and coordination on zoonotic diseases or the laboratory and surveillance capacities required to identify disease in animals. As the world faces the peril of novel zoonotic diseases and the overuse of antibiotics in both humans and animals (exacerbating the global antimicrobial-resistance crisis), it appears anomalous that the IHR do not facilitate and guide research and practice at the intersection of human and animal health.

The IHR are the governing framework for global health security, yet they require textual and operational reforms. The WHO Secretariat is engaged in an internal reform process, ranging from the WHO Roadmap for Action on Ebola 3 to the Advisory Group on Reform of WHO's Work in Outbreaks and Emergencies with Health and Humanitarian Consequences. 50 In addition to the Ebola Interim Assessment Panel, 2 the agency established the WHO Review Committee on the Role of the IHR in the Ebola Outbreak and Response. 51 On January 30, 2016, the D-G announced internal reforms, including a single program and incident management strategy to oversee all health emergencies. The D-G stressed, however, yet again, that the program required sustainable funding from Member States. 52 The proliferation of internal and external reform processes could be transformative. This is ""the defining moment for the health of the global community."" 2 Yet, it is just as likely that the maze of recommendations will lead to weak or muddled reforms. In the sections that follow we offer proposals for fundamental reform of IHR implementation, WHO oversight, and State Party conformance (Table 3) . We propose politically feasible pathways to reform to avoid a long history of bureaucratic stagnation. Thus, our proposals balance the ideal with the politically possible.

Meeting IHR core capacities requires mutual responsibility and accountability. It starts with governments dedicating resources to build and sustain health systems. Every State Party should undergo independent, rigorous review of its implementation of IHR core capacities, using measurable metrics and targets, as explained below. Shared responsibilities also require technical assistance and international financing to close capacity gaps. Collective security is assured only by fulfilling these mutual obligations to sustainably build, measure, and finance health systems (Figure 7) .

Building sustainable core capacities requires fresh thinking by both donors and recipient countries. Too often, countries heavily dependent on external funding follow the priorities of donors, agreeing to erect vertical programs, stove-piped by disease. Yet, meeting IHR core capacities requires the development of horizontal programs, including diagnostic laboratories that can be used for more than just one pathogen or condition; specimen transport systems that are applicable to all samples; and event-based surveillance systems designed to pick up unusual or unexpected public health events. Building core capacity also requires integrating these systems into annual budgeting for health system strengthening.

For IHR metrics to be meaningful, valued, and utilized, they must undergo rigorous external evaluations. The WHO should establish an independent evaluation system with a feedback loop and continuous quality improvement. Independent assessments would use evidence-based metrics and indicators. Unless assessment criteria are clear, transparent, and valid, they will not be fully trusted. The measurable benchmarks for the external assessment process, moreover, should be integrated directly into Annex 1 of the IHR, which contains the core capacity requirements for surveillance and response. It may be necessary either to amend Annex 1 or to operationalize it to incorporate more granular indicators. 

Political Mechanism

Capacities Secure national and global commitment to build, strengthen, and maintain IHR core capacities linked directly to independent assessments and financing.

National governments, international organizations, bilateral donors, and funding organizations

Global health security is dependent on every nation having the ability to detect, assess, report, and respond to public health emergencies.

No textual change to IHR required for commitment to core capacities Political and financial commitment to support process required by the WHO and other funding entities, such as the World Bank and regional development banks Table 3 .

Independently Assessed Metrics Utilize rigorous metrics assessed by independent evaluators to identify capacity gaps, develop a road map, and identify funding sources to achieve core capacities.

Independent evaluation teams of domestic and external experts with the participation of the WHO, regional and country offices, and civil society

Independently assessed, vigorous metrics will provide accurate analysis of national core capacities that can then be used by funding entities to invest in core capacities or for use in insurance mechanisms.

Tasking the WHO to work with funding entities to create rigorous metrics and organize assessments Table 3 .

Political Mechanism

Harmonize independent assessments and metrics with the GHSA and the OIE's PVS Pathways.

The WHO in collaboration with the GHSA and the OIE Why:

Harmonization will ensure a One Health strategy and reduce redundancies for governments exposed to multiple evaluations. WHA understandings or addition of an annex to the IHR Parallel initiatives such as the GHSA and OIE's Performance of Veterinary Services (PVS) Pathways (measuring compliance with OIE standards on veterinary services) should be harmonized with the IHR. The IHR are the only agreement with the international legal and political legitimacy to set global security standards. Harmonizing extant multiple standards within the IHR would be more holistic, ensuring a One Health strategy and reducing redundancies for governments exposed to multiple evaluations.

States often resist external assessment due to sovereignty concerns, but the new system could be designed to foster cooperation. Evaluation teams would comprise both domestic and external experts, so national governments would be fully involved in the process. WHO, regional, and country offices would all play a strategic role. Civil society should be fully engaged, much like in UNAIDS monitoring mechanisms. Expert panels would work constructively and collaboratively to identify capacity gaps, develop a road map, and identify funding sources to achieve measurable benchmarks for success. The mandate, therefore, would not be to give a passing or failing grade but to continuously improve health infrastructure with strategic plans and adequate financing.

The World Bank's Pandemic Emergency Facility (PEF) should tie funding to country cooperation with IHR assessments. Additionally, international donors such as regional development banks, the Global Fund, and philanthropies could create funding streams for national IHR core capacities, also conditioned upon rigorous assessments. All of these measures would reinforce national commitments to build robust health systems, which align well with the UN Sustainable Development Goal of Universal Health Coverage (UHC). 53 ""What gets measured gets done."" But Laud Boateng, a GHSA Next Generation Fellow from Ghana, shifts this discourse to better reflect national experiences noting, ""what gets measured gets done, but only what gets political support gets measured, and only that which is funded gets political support."" 54 Thus, tying independent evaluations to external funding would foster cooperation and marshal resources for building core capacities.

Robust financing is required not only to build national health systems but also to support the WHO's own capacities and to ensure a surge in resources in a health emergency. Several financing models could operate separately or in concert. Increasing WHO Member State-assessed contributions would be the most logical funding source. Mandatory dues are more predictable and sustainable than discretionary funding for targeted projects. Moreover, as the treaty oversight agency, the WHO holds the legal obligation to implement the regulations, including securing adequate financing.

Assessed dues, however, are politically fraught. Several high-income Member States do not have sufficient confidence in the agency to justify an increase in their dues. They also want the discretion to direct where their international assistance is going. Consequentially, it will be necessary to create alternative financing mechanisms. The GHSA Action Packages and the PEF are realistic funding sources, but they should be synchronized with the IHR. The Global Fund offers another model, whereby the WHO and the World Bank could host a donors' conference to boost international support and cooperation. 2, 55 Irrespective of the funding mechanism, ensuring sustainable resources to develop and maintain core capacities would benefit both low-and high-income countries by strengthening security for all.

Ebola demonstrated that a well-trained, well-equipped health workforce is crucial to an effective response, including doctors, nurses, community health workers, lab technicians, infection control practitioners, and public health experts. If there are insufficient health personnel and their numbers are depleted even further by exposure to infection, the health system will fail to control outbreaks. Educating, training, supporting, and protecting health workers is a defining issue for global health security.

Even a well-prepared workforce may not be able to cope in a public health emergency. In such cases, the WHO must make provision for a surge in human resources, such as through the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN). The 2015 WHA endorsed a Global Health Reserve Workforce but failed to guarantee funding.

AIDS advocates demonstrated the power of civil society to demand global health equity. 56 Civil society organizations (CSOs) care for their communities, monitor governments, and hold stakeholders to account. As with other spheres of international law, such as in human rights or climate change, civil society could offer ""shadow"" reports and advocate for funding national capacities and fulfilling IHR and human rights obligations. Harnessing the power of CSOs requires more than incorporating them into existing or new IHR functions. Borrowing from the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, the WHO could regularly host a Conference of the Parties where civil society could meet with governments to advance IHR implementation. The Framework Convention Alliance (CSOs committed to effective implementation of the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control) has propelled tobacco control reforms. A similar CSO network for IHR implementation could be transformative.

After facing criticism for disclosing Emergency Committee members only after the H1N1 PHEIC was terminated, the WHO improved public trust by releasing member names for subsequent Emergency and Review Committees. 25(p16) The WHO also pledged transparency on expert committee members' conflicts of interest. 57 Concerns still persist, however, that Emergency Committees are influenced by politics rather than strictly scientific evidence. For example, the D-G and Emergency Committee offered no evidence for their decisions regarding H1N1, 25 very little for the first Emergency Committee meeting on Ebola, 29 and little during the initial meetings on MERS. 58 They did give more transparent explanations for polio 59 and recent MERS and Zika Emergency Committees. 60 The D-G and Emergency Committee should routinely publicly disclose their evidence and decision-making processes. Transparency would include full minutes of Emergency Committee meetings, web access to relevant documents, and live updates through social media platforms.

Independent and transparent Emergency Committee decision making would build public confidence, but these reforms are of little value if the D-G fails to convene an Emergency Committee. Outside the WHO's governing structure and drawing on civil society shadow reports, a committee of independent experts, particularly from academia and civil society, could coalesce to regularly review data on disease outbreaks and propose actions, including recommending that the D-G convene an Emergency Committee.

The declaration of a PHEIC is the public face of the WHO's outbreak response, but the agency must respond long before an outbreak becomes an international emergency. Beyond the IHR, the WHO has multiple instruments supporting early action. For example, the WHO utilizes the Emergency Response Framework (ERF) to measure the level of risk and to inform the international community of an outbreak's severity in a graduated manner. 61 As evidenced during the Ebola epidemic, using 2 distinct sets of governing rules (the ERF and the IHR) confused first responders and the public. Similar confusion arose during the H1N1 pandemic, in which the WHO did not coordinate the 6 pandemic phases in the Pandemic Influenza Preparedness and Response Framework 62 (since revised) with the PHEIC. Given the public symbolism of a PHEIC, multiple emergency response frameworks must be integrated with IHR processes.

The WHO Ebola Interim Assessment Panel recommended introducing an intermediate-level emergency-allowing gradation while retaining the power of a PHEIC. 2 A gradient system would not necessarily require a textual amendment to the IHR, as many diplomats fear. The WHO could develop informal guidelines through Article 11, which allows the agency to share information with States Parties, alerting them to potential emergencies in a graduated fashion. Alternatively, the WHA could adopt a new IHR annex that illustrates the risk gradient, limiting negotiations only to the new annex. To maintain credibility, different grades should trigger clear operational and financial strategies. For example, an intermediate-level emergency could allow the WHO to access resources from the Contingency Fund. Similarly, the World Bank could release PEF funds based on graded emergency declarations by the WHO. 63 The promise of international assistance with adequate funding, even at an early stage, could provide additional incentives for States Parties to report a potential PHEIC through the Annex 2 algorithm. A full PHEIC declaration, however, would still be needed to raise the global alert, stiffen political resolve, and mobilize major resources.

State disregard for Article 43's ""Additional Health Measures"" and Emergency Committee temporary recommendations (eg, state travel and trade restrictions and injudicious quarantines) undermines the IHR. For example, during H1N1 and Ebola, States Parties ignored WHO recommendations and imposed additional measures, impeding deployment of critical medical supplies and health workers. Regional and international carriers suspended flights; States Parties banned travel to and from, or trade with, affected countries; and quarantines of health workers returning from the region dampened the charitable instinct to help.

The WHO is not a policing agency that can readily impose sanctions on States Parties for noncompliance with their legal obligations. But it does have various means at its disposal to enhance compliance, which it has failed to use. The D-G should publicly request clear rationales for and reconsideration of additional measures, while working with States Parties to dismantle harmful policies. The D-G could more actively encourage States Parties to pursue available dispute mediation and arbitration under Article 56 (3) . She could similarly steer States Parties toward the Permanent Court of Arbitration Optional Rules for Arbitrating Disputes Between Two States. The WHO and the World Trade Organization (WTO) could similarly encourage use of the WTO Dispute Resolution procedures by States Parties harmed by additional measures. Although the WTO is primarily constituted to adjudicate WTO treaties, it could intervene in cases where state action adversely impacts both public health and international trade-such as a poultry ban during H5N1 outbreaks.

Beyond the WTO, other institutions could encourage IHR compliance. For example, at various points during the H1N1 pandemic, the FAO, OIE, and WTO together with the WHO issued joint statements discouraging trade restrictions on pork and pigs. 64, 65 It may also be possible to look to the International Court of Justice (ICJ) when one country's active violation of the IHR causes specific damage to either the population or the economy of a second country.

There is still more the WHO could do to signal strong political commitment to IHR compliance. The WHA, for example, could amend Article 48 to elevate temporary recommendations from the Emergency Committee during a PHEIC to a binding status. Even though States Parties could still disregard their international obligations, more binding treaty language could increase pressure to comply.

Textual reforms are more difficult to achieve than operational reforms. Reopening the full text of the IHR for revision would result in a multiyear negotiating process and require considerable resources and could weaken IHR norms and human rights safeguards. Our proposals for reform, therefore, should be achieved, whenever possible, by textual interpretation, understandings, and amendments to specific annexes, rather than the main text.

There is a precedent for amending an IHR annex without reopening the entire text to negotiation (2014 Resolution regarding Annex 7 and Yellow Fever). 66 States Parties could find consensus on new language or understandings focused only on particular annexes. Revisions to the main text through textual interpretations or understandings would be politically feasible. In arms control treaties, for example, States Parties use the mechanism of Review Conferences to agree on a series of understandings to guide treaty implementation and State Party compliance. The States Parties decide specifically not to reopen the original text to revision. IHR States Parties could adopt similarly effective political strategies, fully consistent with international law. ""Smart"" global health diplomacy could enhance IHR functioning without bureaucratic hurdles standing in the way of sensible reform.

Ten years after the adoption of the IHR, it is time to realize their promise. The unconscionable Ebola epidemic in West Africa opened a window of opportunity for fundamental reform-for both the IHR and the Organization that oversees the treaty. That political window, however, is rapidly closing. Donor fatigue, fading memories, and competing priorities (eg, climate change, the Paris bombings, and fighting the Islamic State) are diverting political attention. The promising results of the vaccine trial Ebolaça Suffit (""Ebola that's enough""), 67 although transformative, could further weaken political resolve. Empowering the WHO and realizing the IHR's potential would shore up global health security-a vital investment in human and animal health, while reducing the vast economic consequences of the next global health emergency.

Global Health and Foreign Policy,"Health has long been intertwined with the foreign policies of states. In recent years, however, global health issues have risen to the highest levels of international politics and have become accepted as legitimate issues in foreign policy. This elevated political priority is in many ways a welcome development for proponents of global health, and it has resulted in increased funding for and attention to select global health issues. However, there has been less examination of the tensions that characterize the relationship between global health and foreign policy and of the potential effects of linking global health efforts with the foreign-policy interests of states. In this paper, the authors review the relationship between global health and foreign policy by examining the roles of health across 4 major components of foreign policy: aid, trade, diplomacy, and national security. For each of these aspects of foreign policy, the authors review current and historical issues and discuss how foreign-policy interests have aided or impeded global health efforts. The increasing relevance of global health to foreign policy holds both opportunities and dangers for global efforts to improve health.","Global health issues have long been a concern for foreignpolicy-makers. From sanitary cordons instituted to prevent plague from entering Croatia's Dalmatian Coast to the international sanitary conventions, which began in 1851, to the victories over malaria and yellow fever that permitted the construction of the strategic Panama Canal, health and disease have been intertwined with the pursuit of foreignpolicy interests. However, over the last 2 decades, globalization has made global health more relevant across multiple aspects of foreign policy than ever before. Fidler calls this a ''revolution'' in the political status of global health, noting that ''nothing in the prior history of national and international efforts on public health compares to the political status public health has reached today'' (1, p. 45) .

While the global health community has welcomed this elevated political priority, there has been less examination of why states incorporate global health into their foreignpolicy agendas or what interests states pursue when they engage on global health issues. These questions, and the broader issue of understanding the relationship between global health and foreign policy, are the subject of this review.

In an insightful examination of this subject, Fidler (2) suggests 3 possible interpretations of global health's rise onto foreign-policy agendas. The first interpretation argues that global health is an important objective of foreign policy in itself, and that ''health has become a preeminent political value for 21st century humanity'' (2, p. 183 ). This perspective concludes that global health can transform the state interests that have historically defined foreign policy. Echoing this position, Kickbusch et al. write that ''foreign policy is now being driven substantially by health'' (3, p. 971) , and Horton suggests that health can move ''foreign policy away from a debate about interests to one about global altruism'' (4, p. 807 ).

Fidler's second perspective views global health as ''merely a tool, an instrument of statecraft the value of which extends no farther than its utility in serving the material interests and capabilities of the state'' (2, p. 185) . Far from being transformational, global health is simply another issue that foreign-policy-makers weigh against other state interests. This perspective, based on the realist theory of international relations, explains the recent political prominence of global health as a result of the growing impact of disease upon traditional security concerns: ''When diseases threaten, or show the potential to threaten, national security, military capabilities, geopolitical or regional stability, national populations, economic power, and trade interests, foreign policy makers take notice'' (2, p. 184 ).

Fidler's final perspective sees the relationship between global health and foreign policy as an evolving dynamic between foreign-policy imperatives and the science of global health. This perspective does not discount that state interests drive foreign policy, but it recognizes that influence runs both ways, arguing: ''Scientific principles. . . channel action on health in specific directions that neither ideology nor power politics can alter'' (2, p. 186) .

In this article, we examine the available literature on global health and foreign policy for evidence supporting 1 or more of these theoretical perspectives. We review published articles organized around 4 key dimensions in the relationship between global health and foreign policy: aid, trade, diplomacy, and national security. Use of these 4 dimensions, modified from Fidler's hierarchy of foreignpolicy governance functions (5), enables a detailed study of the relationship between global health and specific areas of foreign-policy practice.

A limitation of this paper is that stringent selection criteria for inclusion of published articles are not useful for addressing such interdisciplinary questions. An understanding of the relationship between global health and foreign policy benefits from examining papers across a broad range of public health, political science, and international relations literature and from incorporating case studies of interactions between global health and foreign policy that are difficult to target with search strategies. We conducted searches in numerous databases (PubMed, MEDLINE, Social Science Citation Index, JSTOR, EconLit, and Science Direct), selecting articles that either directly addressed the relationship between global health and foreign policy or were case studies of an interaction between global health and 1 or more of the 4 dimensions of foreign policy. Thus, this paper is not a comprehensive assessment of every published article related to this subject; rather, we seek to provide a review of key existing literature that illuminates the relationship and tensions between global health and the aid, trade, diplomacy, and national security aspects of foreign policy.

States engage in development assistance (including development assistance for health) for multiple reasons and with differing levels of commitment, but there is typically an explicit or implicit recognition of the value of such assistance to countries' foreign-policy objectives (6, 7) . In 1961, when US President John F. Kennedy created the US Agency for International Development, he explicitly acknowledged the US security interest in providing aid to ward off the collapse of developing-country governments, which ''would be disastrous to our national security, harmful to our comparative prosperity, and offensive to our conscience'' (8) . The United States and other countries continue to frame development aid in a foreign-policy context by linking aid to national security and economic interests (9, 10) .

The foreign-policy rationale for aid has been clearly reflected in historical trends in development assistance. Since the end of World War II, large donor states have tended to focus bilateral and multilateral aid to support countries judged to be strategically linked to national security and economic interests (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) . The basic institutional architecture for multilateral development aid-the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, and the United Nations, along with specialized United Nations agencies such as the World Health Organization (WHO)-were created after World War II with the immediate goal of rebuilding and modernizing war-damaged societies and safeguarding the security of Western powers (19) . Between the 1960s and the 1980s, aid from the United States and other Western countries ''reflected anti-communist Cold War tensions'' and focused on ''containing Soviet influence in Latin America, Southeast Asia, and Africa'' (20, p. 2) . Promises of substantial US aid packages to Egypt and Israel facilitated their signing of the 1978 Camp David peace agreement, and since 1978 these 2 countries have ranked at the top of the list of recipients of US foreign assistance (21, 22) . The top 6 recipients of US aid in 2008 were (in descending order) Israel, Afghanistan, Egypt, Jordan, Pakistan, and Iraq, indicating a clear preference for aiding strategically important partners instead of the poorest states (20) .

Development assistance for health has generally followed the same trends as overall development assistance, but it is worthwhile to note 3 key, recent trends: the dramatic increase in funding, the growing number of actors and institutions, and the overwhelming focus on a single health condition, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) (23, 24) .

According to 1 estimate, development assistance for health increased 4-fold from 1990 to 2007, from $5.6 billion to $21.8 billion per year, with more than half of this increase coming after 2000 (25) . This represents a change from previous decades, which were characterized by low, stagnant levels of health assistance (26) . This increasing volume of aid comes from and is funneled through an ever more complex set of actors: In a 2008 article, McColl (27) estimated that there are more than 40 bilateral donors, 26 United Nations agencies, 20 global and regional funding mechanisms, and 90 distinct initiatives involved in development assistance for health.

Efforts to fight HIV/AIDS received most of the increased development assistance for health. International resources for HIV/AIDS grew from a relatively paltry $292 million in 1996 to over $10 billion in 2007, quadrupling from 2001 to 2007 alone (28, 29) . While HIV/AIDS support drew just 5% of all development assistance for health in 1998, by 2007 it constituted 47% of all development assistance for health (30) . This trend is likely to continue: The Obama administration's proposed global health budget dedicates fully 70% of US official development assistance for health to HIV/ AIDS (31) . It is worth noting that while the growth in US development assistance for health increased an impressive 208% between 2001 and 2007, it was eclipsed by the growth in aid for government/civil society/democratization efforts (often highly linked to foreign-policy objectives), which grew 260% during the same period (32) .

Foreign policy links to development assistance for health trends Foreign-policy considerations underlie much of the remarkable growth in development assistance for health, from rising concerns about the national security and economic implications of health disparities to the perception of health assistance as an important ''soft power'' tool, to shifting domestic political perceptions of global health issues (33, 34) . In some cases, development assistance for health has been clearly and directly linked to national security. Since 2001, many donors have supported ''health security'' aid to reduce the threat of natural and intentional outbreaks of infectious diseases (35) (36) (37) . For example, aid for international influenza surveillance and pandemic planning and response programs was virtually nonexistent prior to the emergence the H5N1 avian influenza virus, but with the growing perception that an influenza pandemic presents a direct security threat (38) , more than $2 billion was provided to combat the disease between 2004 and 2008 (39) .

Other development assistance for health efforts is linked in a more indirect fashion to foreign policy and national security goals. Iraq, for example, received the greatest share of health-related development assistance of any country in the North Africa/Middle East region during 2002-2004, reflecting US and European interests in using health as part of its effort to foster a stable, pro-Western government there (40) . Still other development assistance for health programs has been justified on the basis of the relatively intangible benefits it provides, such as increased goodwill or trustbuilding. For instance, the US President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief has been touted as promoting positive views of the United States on the African continent (41, 42) .

Foreign-policy extensions of domestic political priorities have also shaped development assistance for health. Perlman and Roy observed that ''the orientation of [development assistance for health] had been heavily influenced by political changes in the United States and Great Britain'' (7, p. 14) . For example, during the conservative Thatcher (United Kingdom) and Reagan (United States) administrations, funding for family planning and social services was cut sharply to reflect these governments' priorities. The President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, the largest bilateral health aid program ever, had origins rooted in US domestic politics, as President George W. Bush proposed the program partly in response to lobbying from his political base (43) .

The character and amount of development assistance for health has major implications for the health of populations in poor countries, because external donor support can comprise a large percentage of their health spending (28, 44) . This makes development assistance for health that is guided more by donor interests than by scientific evidence or the priorities of recipients a concern for global health proponents (45) . While there is some evidence of increasing correlation between development assistance and recipient countries' overall burdens of disease (25) , multiple studies demonstrate a continuing and significant disconnect between aid and the burden of health conditions, including maternal mortality (46) and malaria (47) , and the disability-adjusted life years measure (48) . However, even in cases where development assistance for health has been driven primarily by narrow foreign-policy concerns, health benefits can be realized; for example, US health aid for Egypt, an integral part of US Middle East policy, has helped the country achieve dramatic declines in child mortality (49) . Thus, foreign policy's powerful influence on development assistance for health leaves many pressing global health battles underresourced but allows global health efforts that do align with foreignpolicy interests to receive significant political support and funding.

The relationship between trade and health forms part of a long history of commercial exchange between human societies, dating from the 19th century BC through the extension of trade to India and China along the Silk Road and the expansion of trade by sea from the 15th century onward (50, 51) . As trade has evolved in geographic reach, scale, mode, and type of commodity, so too have the human health implications. Most directly, the coming together of human populations through trade can spread communicable diseases, and commodities exchanged also have the potential to harm (e.g., tobacco) or promote (e.g., fruits and vegetables) health.

Since 1945, the world trading system has expanded rapidly. Built on the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) signed in 1947 and expanded through the creation of the World Trade Organization in 1995, the world trading system has grown from 23 member states to 153. Today, the World Trade Organization oversees the implementation of more than 20 trade agreements covering a vast range of trade matters, including agriculture, trade in services, and trade-related intellectual property rights. There is also a growing number of regional and bilateral trade agreements (52) . With this growth has come tensions in the trade-and-health relationship due to frequent conflict between economic interests and global health goals (53) . Here, we examine these tensions by reviewing trends in trade in health-related goods and services and the broader effects that traded goods and services can have on health and disease.

Trade in health-related goods, such as pharmaceutical agents, medicinal products, biologic agents, and medical or surgical equipment and appliances, has grown rapidly since the 1990s, notably in the Americas (54) . While the GATT sets out rules to facilitate the trade of health-related goods, notably through tariff reductions and nondiscriminatory treatment, health-related goods are recognized as requiring specific provisions given the need for stringent quality standards. Insufficient regulation of blood products, for example, led to the inadvertent trade-facilitated transmission of HIV/AIDS and hepatitis C (55) .

Another key issue in the trade of health-related goods is the health impact of standardizing patent rights under the Agreement on Trade-Related Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS). Given concerns that patent-protected drugs would be too expensive for the world's poor, the Declaration on the TRIPS Agreement and Public Health (known as the Doha Declaration) affirmed in 2001 the right of World Trade Organization member states to interpret and implement TRIPS in a manner that supports public health and, in particular, access to medicines (as permitted under GATT Article XX[b]) (56) . A clarification in 2003 specified when countries can import drugs produced elsewhere under a mechanism known as ''compulsory licensing'' (57) . Despite the World Trade Organization's claim that the Doha Declaration removed the ''final patent obstacle to cheap drug imports'' (58, p. 1), the limited capacity of developing states to actually implement the available flexibilities, especially given the stricter protections found in many bilateral and regional trade agreements (known as ''TRIPSþ'' measures), demonstrates the power of economic interests over public health considerations (59) . The WHO has convened an Intergovernmental Working Group on Public Health, Innovation and Intellectual Property Rights to seek an international agreement to balance innovation and access to medicines, but agreement has remained elusive and negotiations continue (60, 61) .

Public health advocates argue that trade in goods with the potential to harm, such as arms, tobacco, and toxic and hazardous waste (known as ''public bads''), should be restricted and that such goods should not be included in trade liberalization efforts (62, 63) . However, such arguments have been successfully opposed by the industries behind such trade, often with the support of major governments, in order to protect their economic interests.

Countries also increasingly trade in health services, traditionally regarded as nontradable, as a result of advances in information and communication technologies, increased international mobility of service providers and patients, and growing participation by the private sector in health care (64) . Under the World Trade Organization's General Agreement on Trade in Services, trade of health services is categorized under 4 modes: cross-border delivery of samples or services, consumption of health services abroad, establishment of health facilities by a foreign-based concern, and movement of health personnel across borders (65, 66) . While the extent to which trade occurs varies across these modes, there is a general trend towards increased trade in health services (67, 68) . There are potential opportunities arising from such trade, including efficiency, specialization and quality gains, public sector cost savings, expansion of service provision, export revenues and remittances, transfer of technology and skills, and increased patient choice. The risks concern distributive consequences for domestic patients and the possible ''brain drain'' of health professionals from resource-scarce countries (69).

There is a broad body of literature on the health effects of trade in non-health-related goods and services. Trade of food has received particular attention, especially with regard to issues such as access to an appropriate quantity (underand overnutrition) and quality of food, factors that influence eating habits, and broader environmental issues (70) . The regulatory framework for trade of food is focused on the World Trade Organization's Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures and the Codex Alimentarius Commission. Both, along with GATT Article XX(b), are concerned with preventing the spread of foodborne diseases while minimizing the required restrictions on trade, but application of restrictions is often controversial (71) . For example, the appropriateness of trade restrictions on beef from countries affected by bovine spongiform encephalopathy, such as the United Kingdom, Canada, and the United States, on the grounds of protecting public health has been subject to ongoing dispute (72) . Similar disputes over the public health risks of trade in poultry products (H5N1), apples (due to fire blight), and genetically modified organisms have highlighted the ongoing tensions between promoting trade and protecting health (73) .

More broadly, unfair terms of trade and their contribution to health inequalities within and across countries has been the subject of scrutiny. The persistence of trade protectionism by many countries-in the form of agricultural subsidies, for instance-disadvantages low-income countries seeking economic growth through exports (74) . Economic pressure and the desire to attract foreign direct investment sometimes engender poor occupational and environmental health regulations (75) .

In summary, there has historically been friction between trade and health concerns, implying a need for greater coherence between trade and health policy (76) (77) (78) (79) . While countries have sometimes restricted trade to prevent the spread of disease, interactions between trade and health have generally been dominated by support for economic interests over health concerns and by a desire to minimize the impact of disease upon trade (80) .

Diplomacy is the art and practice of conducting international relations, and it ''provides one instrument that international actors use to implement their foreign policy'' (81, p. 318). Diplomacy has traditionally focused on dialogue and negotiating alliances, treaties, and other agreements. However, recent usage of the term ''health diplomacy'' has encompassed not only international agreements on health but also efforts to promote the role of global health in foreign policy, as well as the use of health interventions to support foreign-policy objectives.

The origins of modern health diplomacy can be traced to 1851, when the first International Sanitary Conference met to discuss cooperation on cholera, plague, and yellow fever (82) . Countries sought to meet after recognizing that the faster movement of people by rail and ship was facilitating the spread of disease and that uncoordinated, sometimes ineffectual, national quarantine policies interrupted trade and were causing discontent among merchants (82) . With the founding of the WHO after World War II, prior sanitary agreements were folded into 1 set of regulations, the International Sanitary Conventions (later renamed the International Health Regulations (IHRs)). The new Conventions maintained the spirit of the previous negotiations in attempting to coordinate disease control measures while ensuring the least amount of interference with international trade.

During the final decades of the 20th century, it became clear to many member states that the IHRs were inadequate: The regulations covered only 3 diseases, countries were often noncompliant, and the WHO had limited flexibility to conduct outbreak surveillance and response (83, 84) . Even with recognition of these weaknesses, attempted revisions of the IHRs stalled until the 2002-2003 epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) (83) . SARS demonstrated the direct and continuing threat that transnational disease epidemics pose to health and economic interests (85) and generated the political momentum necessary to complete the IHR revision process. In this case, a threat to state foreign-policy interests was critical to advancing diplomacy on global health.

However, in adopting the revised IHRs, countries gave the WHO a novel ability to intrude upon state interests, ''privileg[ing] global health governance over state sovereignty'' by allowing the use of surveillance reports from nongovernmental organizations and electronic surveillance systems (83, p. 90) . Actions taken by certain countries during the SARS epidemic, especially China's attempts to conceal disease information, precipitated these new WHO powers to overcome selfish state interests. Despite this apparent victory of global health over narrow state interests, a number of countries and commentators have argued that the IHRs actually undervalue ''equity between developed and developing nations'' (86, p. 482 ) and risk fragmentation of poor countries' health systems and ''national health priorities set up by developing countries'' (87, p. 13) . These objections center on the IHRs' primary focus on disease surveillance, which some argue may be of greater importance to wealthy countries seeking protection from new epidemics than for poor countries with large existing disease burdens (87) . Thus, ''the WHO's authority in infectious disease control has been strengthened partly because it suited the interests of Western states to allow this to happen'' (88, p. 308) . Whether the IHRs primarily benefit wealthy states seeking to avoid epidemics or can also address burdens of disease in poorer countries will depend upon the nature of future efforts to build surveillance and response capacity in support of the IHRs.

The second critical diplomatic agreement on health was the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC). Approved by the World Health Assembly in 2003, the FCTC represents the WHO's first-ever use of its authority to create a global health treaty to ''reduce the growth and spread of the global tobacco epidemic'' (89, p. 936) . Unlike the IHRs, negotiation of the FCTC could not rely on the high political priority of such efforts. The WHO's Tobacco Free Initiative group gathered the extensive evidence that linked smoking to lung cancer, as well as studies on the negative economic impact caused by tobacco, which framed the treaty in terms of the economic self-interests of states (90) . The WHO also highlighted proven interventions that reduce tobacco consumption and formed a fruitful partnership with an effective coalition of nongovernmental organizations called the Framework Convention Alliance (91) .

While promoters of the treaty had ambitious goals and abundant scientific evidence to support stronger tobacco reduction policies, the treaty faced opposition from the governments of the United States, Japan, China, and Germany, all significant tobacco or tobacco-product producers, who succeeded in weakening the final text with flexibilities and optional language. Assunta and Chapman conclude that the ''flexibility in the FCTC language offers an ostensible excuse for. . . parties to the Convention to avoid development of robust comprehensive tobacco control policies'' (92, p. 755 ). There is also significant evidence that transnational tobacco companies sought to undermine the negotiations leading to the FCTC (93) . Finally ratified in 2005, the FCTC sets out broad obligations for reducing both tobacco demand and tobacco production, but the weakened language of the treaty, continuing opposition from transnational tobacco companies (94) , and different levels of commitment mean that enactment of FCTC measures is still highly variable across signatory countries.

As both the IHR and FCTC cases indicate, diplomatic health negotiations-even those viewed as triumphs of global health over foreign policy-are driven by state interests which can either facilitate or undermine global health objectives.

Spurred by the passage of the IHRs and the FCTC and the increasing political relevance of global health, a number of global health practitioners have advocated for and enacted policies seeking to apply diplomacy in the service of global health aims. The Oslo Ministerial Declaration, advanced by the ministers of foreign affairs of Brazil, France, Indonesia, Norway, Senegal, South Africa, and Thailand in 2006, declares that ''health as a foreign policy issue needs a stronger strategic focus on the international agenda'' and that these countries have agreed ''to make health a point of departure and a defining lens that each of our countries will use to examine key elements of foreign policy and development strategies'' (95, p. 1373; 96) . Supporting this effort, the Director General of the WHO writes that ''we need to embed the use of the health lens in foreign policy while we have this chance'' but warns that this relationship requires ''careful management for mutual benefit'' (97, p. 498 ). The United Kingdom and Switzerland have enacted national strategies attempting to establish ''policy coherence'' between their global health and foreign policies (3, p. 971). A number of middle-income countries, including Brazil (98), Thailand (99) , and Indonesia (86), also highlight global health in their diplomacy. Finally, Kaufmann and Feldbaum (100) note how diplomacy can be an essential tool for resolving global health crises of political origins, such as the 2003-2004 Nigerian boycott of poliomyelitis vaccine.

Not all diplomacy on health seeks to achieve global health goals, and states are increasingly using health interventions to support ulterior foreign-policy objectives in efforts often termed ''health diplomacy.'' One prominent example is the hospital ship tours of the US Naval Ships Mercy and Comfort, in which these US military assets deliver health, disaster, and humanitarian assistance to underserved countries. These missions work to improve health but are also driven by training needs and the intent to ''win hearts and minds through the use of health interventions'' (101, p. 3) . Broader US investments in global health are also justified by foreign-policy interests; as a former US Senator stated, ''You do not go to war with someone who has saved the life of your child'' (42, p. 219). The United States is not alone in using health interventions to serve foreign-policy objectives; the Cuban health diplomacy program (102) and Chinese health cooperation in Africa (103) are other relevant examples. Other related attempts that utilize health as diplomatic outreach have been termed vaccine (104), science (105, 106) , and disaster (107, 108) diplomacy. Such efforts have not been without criticism. Ingram observes that such efforts may ultimately be ''self-defeating,'' as ''it is precisely the fact that health professionals are not associated with the policies of states that gives them wider credibility'' (109, p. 534) .

In summary, diplomacy has been used to craft international agreements to improve global health, but state interests have been critical to either the success or obstruction of such agreements. The increasing use of health interventions by states in service of foreign-policy interests also confirms the strong role of such interests in diplomacy on global health, and will present the global health community with ethical and policy challenges.

While a number of countries have integrated human security (with its focus on the safety and protection of individuals rather than states) into their foreign policies (110, 111) , issues of national security remain atop the foreign-policy hierarchy (112) . National security is a ''contested concept'' (113, p. 254 ) and has been defined both narrowly as ''the study of the threat, use, and control of military force'' (114, p. 212 ) and more broadly as an action or event that ''threatens drastically to degrade the quality of life for the inhabitants of a state, or. . . threatens significantly to narrow the range of policy choices available to the government'' (115, p. 133) . Resistance to broadening the definition of national security to include public health or environmental issues has also been apparent. Deudney argues that ''if everything that causes a decline in human well-being is labeled a 'security' threat, the term loses any analytical usefulness and becomes a loose synonym of 'bad' '' (116, p. 448 ).

King writes that ''although often characterized as an humanitarian activity, modern public health as practiced in the United States and other Western industrialized nations has long been associated with the needs of national security and international commerce'' (117, p. 763) . For example, the founding of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine by Sir Patrick Manson, medical advisor to the Colonial Office (118) , was driven by the need to better understand tropical diseases to assure ''the health of European soldiers, traders and settlers in hostile climates'' (117, p. 765) . Similarly, the US successes against malaria and yellow fever, which enabled the building of the Panama Canal, were driven by the desire to control this strategic and economically valuable passage (119, 120) .

The close association between public health and national security was broken in the 20th century by decolonization, improved sanitation, and the introduction of vaccines and antibiotics, which together reduced the threat of disease to powerful countries and their interests (121) , and by the specter of nuclear weapons, which came to dominate national security studies (114) . However, by the 1990s, perceptions of increased vulnerability to infectious disease threats because of increased global interdependence brought infectious diseases back onto national security agendas. This was prominently expressed by the US Institute of Medicine: ''[I]n the context of infectious diseases, there is nowhere in the world from which we are remote and no one from whom we are disconnected'' (122, p. V).

Acute outbreaks of infectious diseases and the threat of bioterrorism have dominated recent national security discussions of global health, suggesting that global health issues gain political priority when they threaten state interests (33, 123) . The SARS and H1N1 influenza A epidemics, the threat of H5N1 influenza A, and, to a lesser extent, the spread of extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis have threatened the citizens and economic interests of powerful countries and have been accepted as national security threats (124) . Similarly, increasing knowledge about the extent of existing biological weapons programs (125) , the rise of nonstate terrorist actors, and the global dissemination of advances in biology (126) have driven many wealthy states to address bioterrorism as a serious threat to national security. The benefits of designating a global health issue a threat to national security include high levels of both political attention and funding (34) .

However, the benefits of linking global health to national security have not come without criticism or costs. McInnes and Lee argue that the national security agenda on health has been narrowly framed and ''dominated by the concerns of foreign and security policy, not of global public health'' (33, p. 22) , while Feldbaum et al. caution that the ''global and humanitarian objectives of the health field do not fit readily into the state-centered perspective of national security'' (127, p. 196 ). The costs of framing international cooperation on epidemic diseases in security terms are also becoming apparent. ''Developing countries are increasingly suspicious of global health initiatives justified on the grounds of 'global health security' '' (128, p. 372) because ''the harvest of outbreak intelligence overseas is essentially geared to benefit wealthy nations'' (87, p. 19) . Controversy over sharing of H5N1 influenza A viral samples (86, 129) and within negotiations over the IHRs (87) are examples of developing countries' resistance to the concept of global health security.

The framing of the HIV/AIDS pandemic as a threat to national security, predominantly between 2000 and 2005, also provides insights into the costs and benefits of linking health issues to national security agendas. This linkage, which generated attention from the United Nations Security Council and the United Nations General Assembly, raised the political priority of HIV/AIDS, which contributed to efforts to establish the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria and increased the amount of development assistance for health on global AIDS, particularly in the United States (130, 131) . However, much of the evidence used to frame the disease as a national security threat, including evidence on the prevalence of HIV among African militaries (132, 133) and its potential to cause instability in ''next wave'' states (134, p. 4; 135) , has been shown to be inaccurate (136) (137) (138) (139) (140) . Furthermore, linkage of the disease to national security agendas may have contributed to the possibly disproportionate focus on the pandemic in national aid budgets (141) and has been criticized (142) for its potential to push response to the disease ''away from civil society toward state institutions such as the military and the intelligence community'' (143, p. 122) or to push funding towards countries of strategic importance, rather than those most in need (127) .

Health interventions are being used in complex and contradictory ways in conflict situations. The public health community has sought to implement ''health as a bridge to peace,'' claiming that health interventions in ''postconflict societies can be specifically designed in such a way as to simultaneously have a positive effect upon the health of the population and contribute to the creation of a stable and lasting peace'' (144, p. 96) . Other practitioners have noted that cease-fires arranged for vaccine delivery (145, 146) and cooperative health projects between previously conflicting parties can provide beneficial and neutral forums for conflict resolution (147) (148) (149) (150) . However, critics say such efforts have ''never yielded a tangible peace benefit'' (151, p. 222) and have been driven more by ''ideology'' than evidence of effectiveness (152, p. 1020).

Militaries and nonstate actors alike are using health interventions to serve their political aims in conflict situations.

In Iraq and Afghanistan, medical and veterinary civilassistance programs are run by the US military ''for supporting pacification, gathering local intelligence, or rewarding locals for their cooperation'' (153, p. 69) . On the other side, Burkle reports that the Iraqi insurgents fighting the US military ''made controlling hospitals a priority because by owning the health and social services, the control of the people soon followed'' (154, p. 31) . In these cases, health interventions are not neutral or designed as a bridge to peace but are used to gain the support of, or control over, local populations through the offering or denial of health services.

Tension exists between public health and national security in part because ''the landscape of political insecurity is not fully congruent with the landscape of need'' (109, p. 539) . Prioritization of health issues as national security threats can generate political attention and funding but can also result in actions directed toward addressing national security interests that may or may not coincide with public health needs.

Evidence on the linkages between global health, aid, trade, diplomacy, and national security indicates that state action on health is often motivated by foreign-policy interests rather than a desire to promote health equity or achieve humanitarian benefits. These ulterior interests can be economic (protecting trade), diplomatic (preventing epidemics), strategic (preventing bioterrorism), or (often) combinations of these interests and are salient even in this new era of rising development aid for health and groundbreaking global health treaties. Conversely, little evidence supports the notion that ''foreign policy is now being substantially driven by health'' (3, p. 971). However, global health has affected the practice of foreign policy on occasions when global health and foreign-policy interests align, as the cases of SARS and the IHRs demonstrate.

While foreign-policy interests are likely to continue to determine state engagement on global health issues, selfserving motives for state action on health do not have to lead to poor outcomes, as evidenced by US aid for Egypt's leading to improved child health or the provision of medical relief by the US Naval Ship Comfort and Cuban medical professionals after the earthquake in Haiti. Whether we achieve further successes in global health or our efforts are undermined by the pursuit of traditional foreign-policy interests will depend upon the ability of public health practitioners to understand foreign-policy perspectives on health and promote global health interests in the world of high politics.

"Capacity of Public Health Surveillance to Comply with Revised International Health Regulations, USA Author affi liations: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention","Public health surveillance is essential for detecting and responding to infectious diseases and necessary for compliance with the revised International Health Regulations (IHR) 2005. To assess reporting capacities and compliance with IHR of all 50 states and Washington, DC, we sent a questionnaire to respective epidemiologists; 47 of 51 responded. Overall reporting capacity was high. Eighty-one percent of respondents reported being able to transmit notifi cations about unknown or unexpected events to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) daily. Additionally, 80% of respondents reported use of a risk assessment tool to determine whether CDC should be notifi ed of possible public health emergencies. These fi ndings suggest that most states have systems in place to ensure compliance with IHR. However, full state-level compliance will require additional efforts.","T he 2005 revisions to the International Health Regulations (IHR 2005) were a major global policy achievement to ensure international recognition and notifi cation of unusual public health events. These regulations are an international legal instrument that binds 194 countries (World Health Organization [WHO] member states). The goal of IHR 2005 is to help the international community prevent or respond to acute public health risks that have the potential to cross borders and threaten the global population. As seen with the emergence of pandemic (H1N1) 2009, diseases have the potential to spread quickly around the globe through international travel and trade (1) . Member states are required to report certain diseases and public health events to WHO. Furthermore, the rights and obligations of member states are defi ned to establish procedures that WHO must follow to uphold global public health security (2) .

The 2005 revision was the fi rst major update to the IHR since 1969 and was designed to refl ect trends in disease emergence and spread over the past several decades. The 2005 revision also was meant to unify the considerable changes in communication capacity, disease surveillance, and investigation infrastructure. Member states must report potential public health emergencies of international concern (PHEIC), including those of biologic, chemical, radionuclear, or unknown origin, to WHO. A common decision matrix that focuses national reporting around a risk assessment process is used rather than sole reliance on reporting of specifi c diseases or incidents (3). This method of reporting requires all member states to develop, strengthen, and maintain a core set of public health surveillance and response capacities at the local, intermediate, and national levels (4).

After IHR revision in 2005, member states were provided a 2-year window in which to assess their surveillance and response capacities, focusing on 4 necessary characteristics of surveillance systems: timeliness, sensitivity, stability, and usefulness (3) . Each of the 194 member states also was required to designate a National Focal Point that would assess any event within 48 hours. After the assessment specifi ed in Appendix 2 of IHR 2005, each member state must notify WHO of any potential PHEIC. Therefore, core public health surveillance systems at local and national levels must be capable of ensuring national awareness of incidents in a timely manner.

Surveillance systems exist at many levels: clinics; hospitals; and local, state, national, regional, and global levels. To be effective, these different levels must be well integrated. Literature on surveillance systems often examines each level separately or, at most, the links between 2 adjacent levels, describing the importance of integrating each system so that communication between levels is more effective (3, (5) (6) (7) . State-to-national notifi cation is a key aspect of federalist systems and has been viewed as a key challenge for countries with this type of government structure (3); several authors have noted the political and practical diffi culties these surveillance systems may face and the various ways national disease surveillance can be facilitated (8) .

In the United States, reporting of nationally notifi able diseases to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) by states is voluntary. Public health surveillance takes place within a state on the basis of reports received from a variety of sources, typically local. Reporting is mandated by state legislation or regulation. States then determine whether CDC should be notifi ed. Notifi cations from states, territories, and the District of Columbia are collected and analyzed by the National Notifi able Diseases Surveillance System. A 2004 review of this system showed that for meningococcal disease laboratory results, local entities reported to their states and then states notifi ed NNDSS within 2-117 days (5) . More recently, 60% of meningococcal diagnosis reports were received by states within 1 day after diagnosis (9) .

The literature identifi es essential elements that surveillance systems need to meet IHR 2005 criteria, including electronic information systems and supportive infrastructure, to ensure timely reporting to the National Focal Point (6, 7) . In addition, intergovernment cooperation with both formal and informal communication, from the local to the international level, are essential aspects of successfully functioning public health surveillance systems (3, 6, 8) and can ensure rapid reporting of incidents before laboratory confi rmation is received (3, 6) . Overall, key aspects of successful surveillance systems identifi ed in the literature align closely with the requirements of IHR 2005. This alignment suggests that systems built in accordance with the agreement will provide successful global coverage.

Since the new regulations took effect, no studies have been done to determine the timeliness of reporting conditions specifi ed in IHR 2005. In addition, no reports exist that discuss timeliness of notifi cation to CDC about unusual cases or outbreaks of unknown cause. To address these gaps and to determine the ability of states to comply with IHR 2005, we assessed state surveillance capacities through surveys completed by the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists (CSTE). This assessment examined several key requirements that are necessary to effectively meet national responsibilities and ensure compliance with IHR 2005.

In February 2009, CSTE electronically distributed a structured, self-administered questionnaire to state epidemiologists in all 50 states and Washington, DC. Responses were made anonymous at the time of data analysis. The questionnaire was designed to address the following questions: 1) How are states able to determine the status of potential public health emergencies? 2) Are local health departments able to report in a timely manner to the correct point-of-contact (POC) in their state? 3) Are states able to notify CDC of public health emergencies in a timely manner (i.e., within 24 hours)? 4) Do states support or implement other control measures (i.e., collaboration with other departments or cross-jurisdiction)? Frequencies and percentages were used to describe the results.

The CSTE State Reportable Conditions Assessment, completed by state epidemiologists, also was used to assess state reporting practices. Information was obtained from the 2007 Assessment, which is available for review by all states and territories (10) .

A total of 47 (92%) of the 51 eligible jurisdictions responded to the questionnaire. Eighty percent of respondents reported the use of risk assessments to determine the necessity of notifying CDC about unusual or unexpected events ( Figure 1 ). Of those who used risk assessments, ≈50% used them to initiate formal investigations. About 50% of respondents reported the use of risk assessments to evaluate whether notifi cation to the state health offi cer (51%), chief emergency response/management offi ce (47%), and CDC or other federal entities (51%), respectively, was necessary. Twentyeight percent reported use of a state-based algorithm; 25% reported use of the WHO algorithm for risk assessments. The remainder of respondents used another algorithm (excluding a state-based algorithm or the WHO algorithm) or were not sure of the algorithm used in their state.

More than 90% of jurisdictions required reports of suspected and probable cases of the 4 immediately notifi able IHR 2005 conditions (i.e., smallpox, poliomyelitis caused by wild-type poliovirus, human infl uenza caused by a new subtype, and severe acute respiratory syndrome [SARS]) within 24 hours after diagnosis (Table 1 ). In addition, 96% of states reported that they would notify CDC of suspected and probable cases of IHR 2005 conditions within 24 hours (Table 1) . Eighty-one percent of respondents reported having the capacity to transmit daily notifi cations to CDC. Of those unable to transmit daily notifi cations, 5 indicated that they would be able to provide daily electronic data to CDC within <1 year All respondents reported they would either always or sometimes notify CDC of an unusual or unexpected case or outbreak; 60% reported they would always notify CDC within 24 hours (Figure 2 ). Among the respondents, 30% would sometimes notify CDC within 24 hours. According to the 2007 State Reportable Conditions Assessment, 48 of the jurisdictions included unusual or unexpected events on their reportable conditions lists. Furthermore, most states could identify a specifi c POC in their state for reporting various public health events and emergencies (Figure 3 ). Ninety-one percent of states reported having a designated POC for zoonotic, foodborne, and infectious events; for chemical and radiologic events, 84% and 86% of states, respectively, reported having a designated POC.

More than 50% of respondents reported having formal information-sharing systems or mechanisms pertaining to emergencies or outbreaks with state law enforcement, emergency management and homeland security, agriculture, environmental protection, and fi sh and wildlife agencies, excluding the state departments of transportation (37%) ( Table 2 ). Fifty-one percent reported participating in cross-jurisdiction electronic surveillance and having reporting systems for foodborne and infectious diseases with neighboring states.

Most states can successfully conduct public health surveillance in compliance with IHR 2005. However, full state-level capacity for compliance was not found on any assessment response. Additional efforts are needed to ensure the ability of the United States to meet its IHR 2005 obligations.

Most states reported use of risk assessments to determine the need to notify CDC about unusual or unexpected events. In addition, ≈50% of states reported the use of risk assessment when initiating a formal investigation. IHR 2005 emphasizes the use of risk assessments to notify WHO about public health emergencies, rather than about specifi c events. The use of risk assessments in notifying CDC can help determine whether notifi cation is necessary and ensure timely notifi cation without waiting for laboratory confi rmation.

Most (>80%) states reported having 1 POC for reporting chemical, radiologic, foodborne, infectious, and zoonotic events. All states should have a POC to facilitate prompt assessment and appropriate reporting. Such contacts also can assist in assessing events outside their areas of expertise or with unknown cause.

Reports of capacity to transmit daily notifi cations to CDC suggest that data collection and transmission capacity has improved substantially in recent years. The ability to transmit reports to CDC is a critical function, which allows for national situational awareness in high-profi le events and public health emergencies.

Not all respondents included unusual or unexpected events on their state's reportable conditions lists. Adding this criterion would help ensure that conditions having the potential to become public health emergencies can be recognized and reported in a timely manner.

Internal and external relationships of each state can play a role in reporting. Most states have formal information-sharing systems with other agencies within their state. Such dissemination of information within a state increases the likelihood that IHR reportable events are appropriately evaluated and reported. Other agencies may have knowledge that could be incorporated into a risk assessment.

About 50% of respondents reported participation in cross-jurisdictional electronic surveillance and having reporting systems for foodborne and infectious diseases. Public health surveillance across state jurisdictions is as important as the sharing of information within a state. Neighboring states can be alerted to public health emergencies that have the potential to become widespread or even global. Our assessment has several limitations. First, only states were assessed; neither territories nor local health departments were included. Circumstances are suffi ciently different in the territories; no conclusions about their capacity should be drawn because they are likely to have different reporting practices and capacities. Future assessments should focus on identifying and documenting capacities for IHR 2005 compliance in at least a sample of jurisdictions at the local or county level. Second, our assessment relied on self-reporting, which in some instances may have led to inaccuracies or bias. Data were made anonymous before analysis so that states would not be singled out as having suboptimal reporting practices or capacities. Therefore, we could not inquire about potential discrepancies.

To enable the United States to fully meet its IHR 2005 obligations, all states should include unusual or unexpected events or outbreaks on their state lists of reportable conditions. In addition, states and CDC should work toward further development of the nationally notifi able conditions list and the timeframes for reporting. The capacity to transmit records to CDC on a daily basis is key to full compliance with IHR 2005. Risk assessments of unusual or unexpected events should be performed to determine whether they meet requirements for notifi cation to CDC as a potential PHEIC. Performing such risk assessments will enable timely notifi cation to CDC, even before laboratory confi rmation. Furthermore, state POCs are likely to facilitate recognition and reporting of potential public health emergencies within their respective states.

State health departments should work to ensure that their counterparts in state government and in local health departments understand the requirements of IHR 2005; reporting exercises may help accomplish this goal. All health offi cials, particularly those at the state level, should have a basic understanding of these international regulations, especially the reporting and notifi cation timeframes and practices. Reporting exercises would give state and local health offi cials the ability to assess potential public health emergencies in a practice environment and allow a broader perspective of when notifi cation is necessary.

Expansion of cross-jurisdictional surveillance and reporting systems also would benefi t national recognition and investigation of public health emergencies, especially for foodborne illness and infectious diseases. Such systems are not explicitly required by IHR 2005 but would assist states in the assessment and timely reporting of public health emergencies, both of which are necessary for compliance. National, state, and local government agencies should assist states in implementing these practices and developing appropriate infrastructures.

Health security capacities in the context of COVID-19 outbreak: an analysis of International Health Regulations annual report data from 182 countries,"Background Public health measures to prevent, detect, and respond to events are essential to control public health risks, including infectious disease outbreaks, as highlighted in the International Health Regulations (IHR). In light of the outbreak of 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), we aimed to review existing health security capacities against public health risks and events.","Coronaviruses are RNA viruses that are found widely in humans and other mammals. 1 Even though most human coronavirus infections result in mild diseases, the world has had two major epidemics in the past two decades from two different betacoronaviruses; severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Collectively, these two outbreaks have resulted in more than 10 000 cumulative cases, with fatal ity rates of 10% for SARS-CoV and 37% for MERS-CoV. 2 In December 2019, China reported to WHO cases of pneumonia of unknown cause occurring in Wuhan, Hubei. 3 Initial patients exhibited clinical symptoms resembling viral pneumonia. The country's capacity to detect cases facilitated early recognition and verification of the pathogen. Viral genetic sequencing of samples indicated a novel coronavirus. 4 The novel virus was named 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) and con firmed to have 75-80% resemblance to SARS-CoV. 2 As of Feb 24, 2020, approximately 80 000 confirmed cases have been reported in more than 28 countries. 5 On Jan 30, WHO declared the outbreak of COVID-19 as a public health emergency of international concern and put in place a series of temporary recommendations. 6 No specific antiviral therapies are available, and efforts to dev elop antivirals and a vaccine continue. Early indi cations suggest that bats are the primary reservoir for the virus, given COVID-19's close similarity to bat coronaviruses, 7 and while identification of the zoonotic origin of the virus continues, the public health measures for managing the outbreak rely on existing national and regional preparedness capacities to prevent, detect, verify, assess, and respond in accordance with the International Health Regulations (IHR, 2005) .

Since the IHR came into force in 2007, countries have made substantial efforts to strengthen their capacities to prevent, detect, and respond to public health emergencies. 8 Countries have been enhancing preparedness through the implementation and regular assessment of IHR national capacities to mitigate the effect of public health emergencies, including the emer gence of a novel pathogen. 9, 10 Increased understanding of the capacities that countries have to prevent, detect, and respond to public health events has been made possible through the introduction of the WHO IHR monitoring and evaluation framework and application of the framework's components including the State Party annual reporting (SPAR) process and voluntary external evaluation using the Joint External Evaluation tools, after-action reviews, and simulation exercises. 11 The results of these assessments are used to develop national action plans to strengthen IHR capacities for health security. WHO bench marks for IHR capacities include corresponding actions that can increase a country's emergency preparedness, and are used to strengthen a country's emergency preparedness and health security. 12 We analysed the 2018 SPAR submissions of 182 countries to review health security capacities in light of the COVID-19 outbreak and iden tified opportunities for further strengthening of IHR implementation. 13, 14 

We analysed 2018 SPAR submissions to review health security capacities on the basis of the following indices: capacities to (1) prevent, (2) detect, (3) respond, (4) enabling function (resources and coordination capacity), and (5) operational readiness. National scores for 18 of the 24 SPAR indi cators were applied across the five indices. Six SPAR indicators that were not directly related to our indices and infectious hazard threats, including COVID-19, were excluded. 13 The SPAR indicators selected for use in each of the five indices are shown in panel 1. Each indicator of the SPAR is scored according to a scale from level 1 to 5, in which level 1 is the lowest capacity and level 5 is the highest. 13 Countries without a score were marked as level 0. Panel 1 shows the rationale for including the indicators as part of the respective indices.

For each of the five indices we developed an index score using the following steps: (1) we grouped key indicators from the SPAR submissions according to our five indices; 13 (2) each indicator score was converted to a percentage;

(3) we aggregated indicator scores using an arithmetic average: (4) we categorised countries on an ordinal scale of levels 1-5 on the basis of the scores of the indices. These five levels are similar to the capacity levels used to assess countries using SPAR (panel 2). 13, 14 

We analysed the 2018 SPAR submissions of 182 countries. 2018 SPAR data does not exist for 14 State Parties and therefore could not be included as part of this study. 15 138 (76%) of 182 countries included were found to have an overall detection capacity at level 4 or 5. 52 (28%) countries had levels 1 or 2 capacities to prevent and 60 (33%) countires had levels 1 or 2 capacities to respond, many of which are classified as low-income and lower-middle-income countries by the World Bank. 81 (44%) countries had level 4 or 5 capacities to prevent, and 78 (43%) countries had level 4 or 5 capacities to respond. 102 (56%) countries had a level 4 or 5 enabling function. 49 (27%) countries had prevent, 34 (19%) had detect, 44 (24%) had respond, 36 (20%) had enabling function,

Evidence before this study The outbreak of 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID- 19) has spread rapidly across many countries in a short space of time. Few studies have highlighted the strength and gaps of national capacities in relation to operational readiness against health emergencies and the state of national International Health Regulations (IHR, 2005) implementation. We searched PubMed using the search terms ""operational readiness index"" in relation to ""IHR"", ""health security"", and ""emergency preparedness"" for articles published in English, between Jan 1, 2010, and Jan 24, 2020. Our search found zero results on the operational readiness index in relation to IHR.

Because of the insufficient quality of information that exists about the state of national and regional preparedness capacities, we used data and information from IHR State Party Annual Reporting tool to review existing levels of health security capacities to prevent, detect, respond, and establish enabling functions for an effective response, and operational readiness against public health risks and events, including infectious disease outbreaks.

Our results have implications for prioritising capacity building action in WHO Regions and countries, especially in terms of capacities regarding prevention, detection, response, enabling functions, and operational readiness. The operational readiness index can be used to support WHO, governments, and other international agencies to prioritise their support and implementation of operational readiness capacities for the COVID-19 outbreak. 

Infection prevention and control at the community and healthcare facility level is key for prevention, control and containment of the infection. 16 

Reaching out to communities at the local, national, and global levels are essential for prevention, detection, and control of the infection. 17

Core capacities to prevent, detect, and respond at the points of entry are crucial for prevention and control of infectious disease outbreaks.

Capacity to detect C5.1-specimen referral and transport system; C5.3-access to laboratory testing capacity for priority diseases Not all countries will have capacity to test specimens. Therefore, countries should have a system of specimen referral, transportation, and testing of suspected cases.

Reporting from communities, health-care facilities, and points of entry are crucial for prevention and detection of infectious disease outbreaks.

Capacity for verification, risk assessment, and analysis investigation is crucial for the prevention, detection, and control of infectious disease outbreaks.

Response capacity depends on availability of preparedness and response plans and mechanisms and regular testing for functionality and updating them to address gaps.

Any public health events require incident management systems to be followed. Therefore, the capacity to respond effectively to an outbreak depends on strong capacity of emergency operations.

During response, all types of resources must be mobilised in a timely manner (funds, human resources, and logistics).

Effective response to outbreaks and other health emergencies depends on case management.

Capacity for infection prevention and control is needed for effective case management and infection control.

Any suspected case detected at points of entry needs to be managed effectively, otherwise the risk of transmission across borders remains high.

Enabling function index C1.3-financing mechanism and funds for timely response to public health emergencies Availability and accessibility of financing mechanisms is essential for prevention, detection, and control of infectious disease outbreaks.

Multisectoral coordination and action is needed to manage public health events including infectious disease outbreaks.

During emergencies, different skillsets, surge capacity, and timely mobilisation of health-care workers are needed to prevent, detect, and control events.

During response, all types of resources must be mobilised to manage events.

Access to the essential health services are needed to prevent, detect, and control infectious disease outbreaks. Continuity of essential health services must be ensured during emergencies. 18 13 have been used to develop an index for operational readiness. The index helps to assess the status of national readiness capacities across each WHO region. A full description of these indicators is given in the appendix. According to WHO, high-level operational readiness to respond to emergencies will allow a timely, effective, and efficient response. Achieving readiness is a continuous process of establishing, strengthening, and maintaining a multisectoral response infrastructure that can be applied at all levels, which follows an all-hazard approach, and which focuses on the highest priority risks. Operational readiness builds on existing capacities to design and set up specialised arrangements and services for an emergency response. 19 IHR=International Health Regulations. 

Wide variation exists in the capacity for operational readiness across regions (figure 2). 21 (45%) of 47 the countries in the WHO African Region and five (22%) of 23 countries in the WHO Western Pacific Region had low capacities for operational readiness. Across all regions, 104 (57%) of 182 countries had operational readiness capaci ties at level 4 (66 [36%]) and level 5 (38 [21%]). No countries were at level 5 for operational readiness in the African and South-East Asia regions. 46 (25%) of all countries had an operational readiness capacity at level 3.

We found that countries varied widely in terms of their capacity to prevent, detect, and control outbreaks, with about half the countries reporting operational readiness capacities to respond to public health emergencies. We used the 2018 SPAR data, which is self-reported by countries to represent their capacity levels; the data are not independently verified. The inclusion of additional data sources from external IHR monitoring and assessment exercises was excluded from this study because countries are assessed across multiple years. 20 For instance, over 100 countries have implemented joint external evaluations to date, which have been carried out between 2016 and 2019. 20 The SPAR data that we used reflects the capacity of countries in 2018 only. Although

Very little functional capacity is in place to prevent and control the risk or event.

Little functional capacity available on an ad-hoc basis with the support of external resources.

The country is functionally capable at the national level; however, effectiveness is low at the subnational levels.

The country is functionally capable of dealing with various events at the national and subnational levels.

The country's functional capacity is well advanced and sustainable at all levels of health systems. the use of independently verified data would be useful (eg, external assessments such as joint external evaluations) for a review of this nature, this limitation is minimised by the fact that SPAR data has been shown to correlate strongly with externally evaluated data such as the Joint External Evaluation results. 21 Several factors affect the emergence and spread of an infectious disease outbreak within countries and between regions, including the strength of IHR capacities at the national and subnational levels, adherence to infection prevention and control measures, climate-related pressures, and the density of populations. 8, 16, 22 When an outbreak is caused by an airborne pathogen, population density or crowding is known to directly affect spread of infection. 22 Analysis of other risk variables associated with tackling an infectious disease outbreak and managing health emergencies would benefit understanding of existing country capacities, including vulnerabilities due to socioeconomic conditions, comorbid conditions, and lack of health infrastructure, which we did not take into account.

The information and data from these exercises should be analysed to build and inform readiness and response plans for preventing and controlling health emergencies including the outbreak of COVID-19. The analyses of the operational readiness index have been used to support the development of a draft WHO strategic preparedness and response plan for COVID-19. 23 These findings must be triangulated with the latest risk assessments available for COVID-19 and other assessments such as Joint External Evaluations, after-action reviews, simulation exercises, and others to understand the capacity level of countries and to implement priority actions at the national and subnational levels. 19, 23 The WHO Secretariat is working on the development of a preparedness dashboard to provide real-time information that is based on these capacity assessments. Another limitation is related to the method being based on a deterministic approach; therefore, proportionate or inverse interactions among variables could not be shown. 24 An effective way of managing airborne infections is applying evidence-based public health prevention strategies. 16, 17, 22 This method includes scaling up public awareness of behaviours such as hand hygiene and respiratory etiquette, communicating and engaging with local communities about the risks of the outbreak, and putting in place effective public health response measures. 17, 25, 26 National points of entry should also have the capacity to prevent, detect, and respond to potential threats in line with the IHR. Many countries have low capacities for preventing the occurrence and spread of outbreaks, such as measles, influenza, Ebola virus. 27, 28 Therefore, enhancing national preparedness capacities in line with the gaps identified in this study should incorporate action to strengthen points of entry.

Many countries have made substantial progress in developing effective levels of disease detection, which involves strengthening surveillance and laboratory capacities. The application of lessons learned from previous infectious disease emergencies including the 2002 SARS-CoV, 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic, MERS-CoV, Ebola virus, and Zika virus outbreaks, have helped to strengthen countries' capacities to effectively detect and verify suspect cases. 5, 8, 28, 29 The early detection of COVID-19 in China and the development of laboratory reagents for testing and genetically sequencing the novel virus are key steps that have supported the early response. 29 We showed that 76% of countries have robust detection capacities in place, which will enable early detection and verification of potential outbreaks when they occur.

A country's response capacity depends on the strength of its emergency preparedness and the regular testing and updating of national plans and capacities. 30 An effec tive response to an outbreak depends not only on the availability of adequate human resources and financing, but also on the ability to manage emergency logistics (including the handling of supply chains for essential products that are required during an emergency). Our findings show that many countries need support to achieve these capacities and increased support should be provided as a global priority action to strengthen health security. Our findings on operational readiness capacities and enabling function, which are low in many low-resource countries, underline the importance of increasing investments in scaling up IHR capacities, as described in the 2019 annual report of the Global Preparedness Monitoring Board. 8 Another challenge underpinning low national preparedness capacities is insufficient investment in human capital and poor continuity planning. 18, 31, 32 The world needs to increase investment in anthropologists, data scientists, communication specialist, educationists, and economists, who are all essential in providing necessary support for the control of infectious disease outbreaks. 12, 31, 32 The important role these specialists play in responding to outbreaks, including Ebola virus, MERS-CoV, cholera, and measles are well documented, and a key lesson from these public health emergencies has been to ensure that these skillsets are developed further. 32 Our data reinforce this notion, given the low capacities that many countries have to prevent and respond to health emergencies and infectious disease outbreaks effectively.

In the past 5 years, multisectoral coordination and collabo ration for health security strengthening has improved substantially. This coordination and collaboration is reinforced by the introduction of voluntary IHR external evaluation processes, including Joint External Evaluations, which have successfully brought multiple sectors together around common plans for national preparedness capacity building. 34 However, we showed that half of the countries analysed have low enabling functions, which means that coordination and collaboration have been insufficient. The COVID-19 outbreak requires a robust mechanism of collaboration and coordination at the global, national, and subnational levels to prevent, detect, and respond effectively.

The availability of essential health services at the community level is highly important for the ability of countries to minimise potential health emergencies during the earliest stages. Access to essential health services is one of the key indicators that contributes to the indices of enabling function and operational readiness. When an outbreak occurs, national health systems should be strong enough to be able to ensure the continued delivery of essential healthcare services, including immunisation and maternal health services. Many countries, especially those that are low resource, have insufficient access to essential health services. 34 Expanding access to essential health services in such countries would support the achievement of effective operational readiness, which is insufficient for many countries, as shown in our analysis.

According to WHO, operational readiness for emergencies will allow a timely, effective, and efficient response. 19 Achieving operational readiness is a continuous process of establishing, strengthening, and maintaining a multisectoral response infrastructure that can be applied at all levels, which follows an all-hazard approach, and which focuses on the highest priority risks. 19 Our analysis shows that more than 50% of countries analysed had the highest levels of operational readiness capacities; however, findings must be integrated with findings from local risk assessments to fully understand national readiness capacities in relation to COVID-19. 23 The findings of our analysis are similar to those of other publications that have assessed health security capacities. 36, 37 A study 36 on the assessments of health security capacities in the African Region also found similar variances in the capacity of countries. Using an analysis of results of joint external evaluations, most of the countries of the African Region have been shown to have national capacity levels of between 1 and 3, and none have achieved level 5. This variance in national capacities is similar to our findings on the operational readiness index. 36 A study 37 of systemic resilience based on one composite measure of IHR core capacities to manage cross-border infectious diseases showed that improvement in IHR capacities is associated with a decrease of incidence of cross-border infection in Europe. 37 This level of capacity is also reflected in our study, in which most of the countries of the WHO European Region were level 4 or 5 as per the operational readiness index. 37 Some countries have stronger capacities than others; however, all countries should invest in build ing greater preparedness against health emergencies.

Assessments of IHR (2005) capacities reveal that advances have been made since 2010 in many countries to better detect potential outbreaks of infectious diseases early and test suspect cases rapidly-eg, the early detection and verification of the novel coronavirus cases by China and other countries. 38 All countries are at risk of COVID-19 and other outbreaks of infectious diseases, and countries vary widely in terms of their capacity to prevent, detect, and control outbreaks COVID-19 is not fully understood, which can further aggravate the situation. Therefore these findings should be combined with the latest risk assessments that are available for COVID-19 and other assessments to understand the existing capacities. The WHO Secretariat is developing the preparedness dashboard (a data visualisation platform that will include a query system) to provide real-time information that is based on various capacity assessments. Despite the gains made in understanding the pathogen, many countries are underprepared to manage cases within their borders. Investments in preparedness urgently need to be scaled up to ensure that vulnerable countries are operationally ready and capable to respond to public health events such as the COVID-19 outbreak.

Many countries are struggling to sustain or develop their national preparedness capacities, primarily because of a lack of resources, competing national priorities, and a high turnover of health-care workers. Only half of the countries analysed in this study have the provision for adequate resources for emer gencies, and these countries are mostly either high-income or middle-income countries. Urgent action is needed to ensure that capacities are in place to prevent and manage health emergencies. The outbreak of COVID-19 is another opportunity to review the preparedness of all countries and apply key recommendations from other major public health emergencies to better protect the world against future health emergencies.

Investigating public health emergency response information system initiatives in China,"Infectious diseases pose a great danger to public health internationally. The outbreak of SARS has exposed China's fragile public health system and its limited ability to detect and respond to emergencies in a timely and effective manner. In order to strengthen its capability of responding to future public health emergencies, China is developing a public health emergency response information system (PHERIS) to facilitate disease surveillance, detection, reporting, and response. The purpose of this study is to investigate the ongoing development of China's PHERIS. This paper analyzes the problems of China's existing public health system and describes the design and functionalities of PHERIS from both technical and managerial aspects.","Recent years have witnessed a number of microbial threats which have greatly jeopardized public health in many areas of the world. One of the most publicized cases is severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) whose outbreak and rapid spread in more than 25 countries in early 2003, claimed numerous lives and caused tremendous economic losses. Other public health threats include the recent anthrax attack and outbreak of avian influenza in the United States. It is predicted that new pathogens, originating either naturally or from bioterrorism, will continue to emerge and cause new public health emergencies [1] . In order to contain the spread of infectious diseases, preparedness planning, a vigilant health system, strengthened domestic, and global disease surveil-lance, and strong interdisciplinary partnerships are needed. Admittedly, information technology which facilitates access to critical information at the opportune moment will play a strategic role in improving the delivery and effectiveness of quality patient care, and helping domestic and international communities to adequately respond to medical emergencies in a timely and efficient manner.

After the first patient at China's Guangdong province was infected by SARS, this strong contagious disease was transmitted to health care workers and family members in Hong Kong, Vietnam, Singapore, and Canada within days, providing a vivid illustration of the rapidity and ease with which infectious disease can spread to pose a global public health threat [1] . Therefore, response to public health emergencies should be regarded as a global issue and a close worldwide co-ordination is needed. Particular attention should be paid to developing countries that have relatively fewer resources to deal with public health emergencies. China was one of the countries that were the most affected by SARS. Among the 8445 cases re-ported to the World Health Organization (WHO), 5327 (63%) were from China [2] . Exploiting many effective control measures, China was able to successfully deter the outbreak in a relatively short time [3] . Nonetheless, the rampancy of SARS in the early stage of the outbreak has resulted in a chaos and exposed the fragility of China's public health information systems. As Qiang Gao, the secretary of the Ministry of Health (MOH), admitted [4] :

In terms of our work, MOH was not well prepared against the sudden public health hazards and its epidemic prevention system was relatively weak. Following the outbreak, the Ministry failed to institute a timely and unified mechanism for collecting, processing and reporting the relevant information nationwide and it did not give out clear cut instructions or effective guidance. . . . Due to a lack of a sound system of information collection, surveillance reporting and contact tracing there have appeared major weaknesses in statistics compilation on the epidemic on the part of the relevant agencies and accurate figures have not been reported to higher authorities in a timely manner.

Realizing the weakness of its public health systems, China is undertaking tremendous efforts to improve its public health system by leveraging the power of information technology. The Chinese central and local governments have appropriated sizable financial resources to build a public health emergency response information system (PHERIS). The purpose of this paper is to investigate the ongoing development of China's PHERIS. The paper reviews the literature regarding emergency response information systems, analyzes the weakness of China's old public health system, and describes the design and functionalities of PHERIS from both technical and managerial aspects.

A large portion of past research and development on emergency response systems has been conducted in the United States mostly because of the past and potential future terrorist attacks [5] [6] [7] [8] . In order to identify the relevant literature, we searched research databases including PubMed, IEEE Explore, and ACM Digital Library. The search was performed, using different combination of keywords, such as ''public health'', ''emergency system'', ''emergency response'', ''emergency response systems'', ''surveillance'', and ''bioterrorism''. We also collected information from the official websites of organizations, including the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), and the Health and Human Services (HHS), which have been sponsoring emergency response information systems initiatives. In this section we will review some major IT development and research initiatives that have been completed or are currently undergoing in the US. It should be noted that this review does not represent a comprehensive coverage of the entire body of research and practice relating to public health emergency information systems, as we only selected those that we believed are most relevant to the topic of this article.

Motivated by a series of naturally occurring and manmade disasters, federal and state governments, as well as private companies, have implemented numerous initiatives to create co-ordinated systems for surveillance, detection, and response. Given the wide recognition that the application of information technology (IT) provides previously unfathomed opportunities to improve public health practice [9] [10] [11] , many of these initiatives have sought the exploitation of IT to resolve public health threats. According to the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), there exist 217 information technologies and decision support systems of potential use in the event of a bioterrorist attack or other public health emergencies involving naturally occurring epidemics [12] . One of the most important applications of IT is public health surveillance which encompasses the ongoing systematic collection, analysis, and interpretation of health-related data for use in planning, implementing, and evaluating public health practice [13, 14] . Some example surveillance systems include a national retail data monitor which was designed to collect and analyze sales of over-the-counter health products to detect outbreak of disease [15] , a clinical data warehouse which was used for hospital infection control [16] , a data mining surveillance system which can provide sophisticated capability to control hospital infection and public health [17] , and a real-time outbreak and disaster surveillance system which was utilized for early detection of disease outbreaks [18] .

In order to integrate isolated information systems which support communications for public health labs, the clinical community, and state and local health departments and to capitalize on the potential for a cross-fertilization of data exchange, some national level projects have been implemented in the US for early detection of public health threats. The Public Health Information Network (PHIN) is a framework created by the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Based on defined data and vocabulary standards and strong collaborative relationships, the PHIN will enable consistent exchange of response, health, and disease tracking data between public health partners. The PHIN is composed of five key components: detection and monitoring, data analysis, knowledge management, alerting, and response. Other federal initiatives include: (1) the National Electronic Disease Surveillance System (NEDSS) which is an initiative that promotes the use of data and information system standards to advance the development of efficient, integrated, and interoperable surveillance systems at federal, state and local levels [19] , (2) the BioNet which is a national network of public health laboratories and federal food regulatory agencies helping the CDC to rapidly detect and determine possible links between disease agents during terrorist attacks [20] , and (3) the National Health Information Infrastructure (NHII) which is an initiative set forth to improve the effectiveness, efficiency and overall quality of health and health care in the US, a comprehensive knowledge-based network of interoperable systems, and the set of technologies, standards, applications, systems, values, and laws that support all facets of individual health, health care, and public health [21] . The commonalties of these national level initiatives are the focus on data integration and standardization which intends to facilitate the information sharing among various healthcare partners and enables early detection of public health threats.

Prior research has addressed various issues related to the design of public health emergency response information systems. An integrated disease surveillance framework has been proposed for rapidly detecting, tracking, and managing public health threats [22] , which contains six functions: data collection, detection, alert and early warning, resource planning, response assessment and evaluation, and investigation and modeling. Another public health emergency response system was proposed as a decentralized model which gives states responsibility for collecting and disseminating all necessary information and co-ordinating surveillance and response [23] . According to this model, systems in different states must be compatible on the basis of common data standards so that the federal government can oversee a national network, and each state should cope with emergencies at a micro-level. In addition, some researchers contended that state and local health departments should build dual-or multiple-use public health information infrastructure [24] , suggesting that the public health information system should be able to respond and detect not only bioterrorism, but also other infectious disease outbreaks, chemical spills or leakages, food and water contamination scenarios, and animal disease outbreaks.

Based on experiences of the ''Emergency Management Information System and Reference Index'' (EMISARI) at the Office of Emergency Preparedness (OEP), Turoff [25] asserts that ''an emergency system must be viewed as a structured group communication system where the protocols and communication structures are provided, but there is little content about a particular crisis situation except as an integrated electronic library of external data and information sources'' (p. 30). As a consequence, the design of emergency information systems should focus on the group communication process by accommodating how humans collect, contribute, and utilize data in a time-urgent manner [25] . Given that Turoff's remark is about generic emergency response information system, it is applicable to public health emergency response. It suggests that public health emergency response information systems can also be viewed as structured group communication systems. Turoff et al. [26] have articulated five criteria for the design of such a group communication system: metaphors, roles, notifications, context visibility, and hypertext. Metaphors, which pertain to the interface design, are the mental models of the system that help users to create a cognitive map between task objectives and interface elements. Roles reflect various parties' responsibilities in an event, and this concept should be built into the design of the group communication system by offering specific privileges and tools to different users. Notifications are relevant alerts to a user of change in status, data, or other information. The group communication system should raise appropriate notifications when events or actions of other users take place to cause the change. Context visibility refers to the idea that the components of the meaningful data objects are presented in a context that relates to the understandings of the user, that is, when the user activates a certain object the system should be able to know the user's intention and provide a list of relevant action choices. Hypertext refers to ''the possibility of multiple two way linkages with semantic meanings that allowed a person to utilize any item in the content of the application as a set of menu alternatives to move to another content or functionalities in the interface'' [26] . The criteria recommended by Turoff et al. assume the existence of communications networks and computing technologies and focuses on the software and interface design features.

The previous studies have provided insights into public health emergency systems. However, they are almost solely based on experiences in the U.S. Few papers examine the initiatives in public health emergency systems in developing countries. Given the important role China plays in the global public health arena, an investigation of China's public health emergency information systems will significantly contribute to the existing knowledge of public health emergency response.

Given the complexity of China' PHERIS and the lack of previous research on this topic, a case research method was employed by this study. Interviews with two professors at Health Science Center of Beijing University, three healthcare informatics experts, and six healthcare IT practitioners were conducted to collect data of the development of China's PHERIS. Additional documents were reviewed to retrieve pertinent information. These documents include government IT policies and regulations, meeting minutes, reports, development plans, media reports, and news. The credibility of the governmental documents is guaranteed, since they were either obtained from government officials or downloaded from official government websites. The quality of media reports and news is likely to be questionable. Nevertheless, this is not considered a problem, since the triangulation method was employed in this study. Triangulation is a widely accepted case research method which requires collecting data from multiple information sources and posits that multi-source data will corroborate each other and increase validity [27] . Using the triangulation method, we only included in this article the information that appeared consistently in multiple sources and discarded the conflicting information. In addition, the manuscript of this paper was reviewed by a leading health informatics researcher in China who has worked with China's central government on major public health information technology initiatives, including the PHERIS project. His review has largely ensured the validity of this paper by verifying the information gathered from interviews and non-governmental sources, such as media reports and news. The rest of this paper is mainly based on the analysis of the data we collected from interviews and documents.

China's public health information system (PHIS) has a hierarchical structure consisting of four layers: county layer, city layer, province layer, and cen-tral government layer. The primary objectives of the system are disease surveillance and monitoring. Major public health data collected by the system include epidemic report, disease surveillance, causes of death statistics, food hygiene, environment hygiene, school hygiene, women and children hygiene, profession hygiene, and public health resources allocation. The outbreak and spread of SARS have uncovered five deficiencies inherent in the PHIS, which are described as follows.

The disease reporting and surveillance have not been carried out in a timely manner. Due to the hierarchical structure of China's PHIS, disease surveillance data are reported by following a bottom-up path and the reporting is performed on a 10-day or monthly basis. Despite the establishment of a virtual private network in 2000 for electronically transmitting disease surveillance data among the four layers of the PHIS, communication between the PHIS and the sites where source public health data are collected is carried out through snail mail or telephone. In addition, surveillance reports have to be approved by relevant officials at each layer before they can move up to the next layer. As a result, the reporting cycle time is prolonged and local officials' interference could affect the accuracy of the reports. During the SARS event, it took 8-9 days on average to report a SARS case from the patient's location to the MOH, and 3-4 days to report a diagnosed SARS case from hospitals to the MOH. The delayed reporting has largely contributed to the rampancy of SARS in China.

The coverage of the PHIS is relatively small. The network of the PHIS comprises a variety of centers of disease control and prevention (CDC) which are at the county level and levels above. Although, these organizations are able to shape a national net on which public health information can be exchanged in real time, the mesh size of this net is too big to catch timely disease information. Health care organizations at the grassroots level are usually the sites where public health emergency occurs, however, these organizations are not part of the PHIS network.

The information flow in care providing organizations is inefficient. Should a public health emergency occurs, it is critical to gather accurate information regarding exploitable medical resources, such as hospital beds available, transportation capability, physicians available, care giving capability, medi-cal devices and equipments, medications, and preventive equipments, so that the emergency situation can be managed to the maximum. Due to the inefficient inter-organizational information sharing in China's hospitals as well as the inefficient communication between hospitals and disease control organizations, the admission and transfer of SARS patients during the SARS event was chaotic.

The public health regulatory system is insufficient. In China, only a few regions have established regulations to mandate and monitor the development and use of public health information systems. There are no unified regulations at the national level to enforce the exploitation of IS in disease surveillance and public health.

There is no standardized national platform for public health information exchange. China did recognize the importance of standard building, but little progress has been made on the development of health data standards, coding schemes, and communication protocols. Although, information systems have been widely used in the health care providers, disease control and prevention organizations, and health management authorities, the implementation initiatives are largely piecemeal, and lack a unified framework. As a consequence, health information is confined inside boundaries of these entities and effective health information sharing could not be easily realized due to the nonexistence of a standardized platform.

In order to be able to better manage future public health emergencies, China's central government has called for the establishment of a public health emergency information system (PHERIS) within 3 years. The PHERIS development project encompasses three phases. The first phase, which ended at the end of 2003, mainly aimed to meet the requirements of dealing with SARS and to build the foundation for the future development of public health information systems. During this phase, CDCs and health care organizations at the county level or above and some health care organizations at the village level have deployed SARS reporting systems and established SARS clinical examination and alert systems. The SARS reporting system is a secure Web-based application which allows users to report SARS cases electronically to a central database. In addition, the disease surveillance system and the command center were designed in this phase and preparations were made to roll out these systems. The second phase is planned to finish at the end of 2004. One of the major objectives in this phase is to build a national computer network infrastructure to support public health data exchange. A five-level computer network will be constructed to connect health administrative agencies, CDCs, and health care organizations at the national, province, city, county, and village levels. Another major objective of the second phase is to complete the development of the disease surveillance system so that the online reporting system not only covers SARS but all types of public health emergencies. Moreover, the second phase also intends to develop some national public health databases which can be used as knowledge bases for healthcare providers when they encounter public health emergencies, and to start and partially complete the development of the command center. The third phase is planned to complete at the end of 2005. The objective of this phase is to complete all the tasks of the development of PHERIS and realize information sharing and co-ordination among relevant organizations so that the public health emergency can be handled efficiently and effectively.

According to the MOH, public health emergencies refer to events that occur unexpectedly and can cause or potentially cause mass destruction to the public health. The Public Health Emergency Response Regulations defined four categories of such events: (1) serious epidemics, (2) mass diseases with unknown causes, (3) large scope food or profession poisoning, and (4) other events that can severely affect public health, for example, leaking of infectious bacteria from laboratories. The public health alert system in China has three levels: yellow alert, orange alert, and red alert. Fig. 1 depicts the structure of this alert system. Two levels of public health emergency response plans are triggered by emergency alerts: the provincial and the national. If the public health emergency is confined within a certain region of a province, the provincial plan will be appropriate. If the public health emergency is diffused across provinces and endangers the national public health, the national plan will be needed. Specifically, in the event of a yellow alert, the provincial public health emergency response will become ready; in the event of an orange alert, a provincial public health emergency response will be started or the national emergency response will be ready; in the event of a red alert, the national emergency response plan will be activated. The national public health emergency response plan signifies the highest level of public health threat, and China responds to this type of crisis by gathering relevant departments in the State Council and military to form a national emergency command center. One of the leaders of the State Council, that is, the premier or a vice premier, will be appointed as the commander to direct actions resolving the emergency. The command center co-ordinates and allocates national resources, makes major deci-sions, determines outward statements in press conferences, and possibly resorts to police and military forces. On the other hand, the provincial public health emergency plan is determined by the provincial government. A command center with the provincial government leader as the commander will be organized to direct emergency response activities. The difference between the national plan and the provincial plan is mainly the scope of the response activities. In addition, it should be noted that when a public health emergency response plan becomes ready, it does not necessarily have to be activated. In this scenario, the major task would be to continue carrying out disease surveillance and epidemiological investigation to examine how the emergency develops. Related stakeholders are informed to make preparations and some resources might be allocated. But if the emergency shows no sign of escalation or is controlled before it escalates, the alert would be cancelled. The major responsibilities of the MOH are supervising and co-ordinating a wide range of activities relating to the emergency, such as organizing public health surveillance and reporting, applying for approval to start the national public health emergency response plan from the State Council, organizing and co-ordinating professional organizations to conduct field investigations, treating infected patients, tracing, sterilizing, or quarantining people who were in contact with infected patients, developing technological standards, declaring new infectious disease as legal infectious disease according to pertinent laws (only legal infectious diseases can trigger public health emergency alerts), and 

The fundamental technical features of PHERIS are described from two aspects: data and network. Six databases need to be created to support the functioning of PHERIS: (1) geographic and natural environment database, (2) national socioeconomics database, (3) national public health risk factor database, (4) national morbidity and mortality database, (5) national emergency resources database, and (6) natural disaster database. Table 1 shows the content of each database. The data collected for PHERIS are heterogeneous. They are of a wide range of types, such as socioeconomics, humanity, hydrology, meteorology, environment, natural disaster, and health care. They could be numbers, texts, figures or pictures, and they could be real time data or historical data. Data from various sources will be integrated under the Microsoft .NET framework. From the network aspect, a ''five-layer and three-level'' network structure will be developed as the underlying infrastructure for PHERIS. The five layers refer to CDCs, health administrative agencies, and healthcare organizations at the levels of: (1) villages and towns, (2) counties and districts, (3) prefectures and cities, (4) provinces, and (5) nation. They are connected to the national public data network by broadband fiber lines, digital microwave, satellite communications, modem, and public telephone systems, thus forming a public health information virtual environment. The choice of communication method depends on the financial capability of different areas. The three levels refer to the establishment of major public health intranets at the city (or prefecture), province, and national level. A hierarchical star topology results from this network structure, where many villages and counties connecting to one city center, many cities connecting to one provincial center, and many provinces connecting to the national center. Fig. 2 depicts the topology. In addition, the provincial and city intranets provide network services and data services to public health related local organizations and form various community public health information networks.

Conceptually, PHERIS can be viewed as a composition of four major components: (1) a surveillance system, (2) a command center, (3) an action system, and (4) a supporting system. Fig. 3 illustrates relationships among these four components and their functional characteristics. The surveillance system captures public health emergencies and reports to the command center which assesses the emergency, raises alert, and makes decisions to respond to the emergency. The action system obtains orders from the command center and carries out the emergency response. The supporting system serves as a compulsory force to ensure all the activities of public health emergency response are undertaken properly. Lessons learned during and after a public health emergency will be incorporated into the knowledge body of improving PHERIS and reflected in future emergency detection and response.

The objective of the surveillance system is to replace the periodic manual reporting with online reporting to meet the requirements of emergency alert and response. A standard national public health emergency reporting platform with an underlying central database was implemented. Starting from 2004, authorized reporting individuals and organizations can perform online reporting, and health administrative agencies and CDCs will be able to download reports of local epidemic events and public emergencies in real time. In order to facilitate public health surveillance, CDCs at the city and county levels will develop infectious disease databases and public health risk factor databases. Regular updates will be made to these databases on the basis of surveillance reports and epidemiological investigations. Given that many Chinese health care workers lack the ability to use computers, personnel training will be carried out along with the development of the surveillance system. The surveillance system is primarily an innovation of online reporting. The implementation of this innovation radically reengineered China's former public health surveillance process by removing many intermediate stops that the public health emergency data had to go through, thus resulting in a much more efficient process.

The command center integrates public health, disease surveillance, medical care, and health regulation information by using the network platform. It intends to utilize the advanced information technology to provide critical information to a central commander team so that appropriate decisions can be made to deal with public health emergencies. The system will monitor the entire process of the emergency and has such functionalities as data collection, crisis determination, decision support, command, deployment, real time communication, and onsite support. The purpose is to make the most appropriate response to the emergency in the shortest time so that available resources can be effectively and efficiently allocated and exploited. The systems in command center encompass three application platforms and seven subsystems. The three application platforms are information platform, professional service platform, and decision making platform. The seven subsystems include database subsystem, geographic information subsystem, remote monitor subsystem, analysis and prediction subsystem, virtual reality subsystem, decision support subsystem, and search engine subsystem. Since, the command center is the central component of PHERIS, the three platforms and seven subsystems are described in more details in the following two paragraphs.

The information platform consists of the development of computer software and hardware, telecommunications infrastructure, data collection system, and data warehouses. The data collection system utilizes various technologies to capture images, graphs, statistical data, professional data, public health surveillance data, and textual data. Data storage technologies include both centralized and distributed database management models. The professional service platform is the core of the command center. Employing simulation techniques, this platform builds models to analyze the spreading processes of various infectious diseases. This exercise is largely based on the disease model database, the methodology database, and the public health knowledge base. The decision making platform is the presentation layer of the command center. All the activities involved in the public health emergency response, which includes monitoring, analyzing, investigating, predicting, decision-making, executing, and getting feedbacks, are carried out at this layer.

The seven subsystems provide technical support to the three application platforms. As shown in Fig. 4: (1) the database subsystem, the geographic information subsystem, and the remote monitor subsystem supply data to the information platform, (2) the analysis and prediction subsystem and the virtual reality subsystem serve the professional service platform, and (3) the decision support subsystem and the search engine subsystem offer services to the decision making platform. The three platforms and the seven subsystems need to share information or exchange data on a regular basis. They are integrated together to support the public health emergency response and their performances are related with each other. It should be noted that China is interested in leveraging the virtual reality technology to display the spreading process of infectious diseases in three dimensional images, to model possible outcomes of emergency response decisions, and to simulate plans of medical resource allocation in the event of an emergency. The design of the virtual reality subsystem will continuously evolve given that the application of virtual reality in public health largely remains an open research filed.

The action system is an important component of PHERIS. It is related to healthcare provision, emergency rescuing, and CDC institutions. In the event of a public health emergency, the action system will report relevant information to the command center and execute orders from the command center to allocate medical resources, such as hospital beds, medications, medical rescuing equipments, telemedicine services, long distance training, and other healthcare services. Under normal circumstances, this system is utilized to manage public health, provide medical services, facilitate emergency room services, and conduct telemedicine and other health activities. The action system plays different roles in the ''peace time'' and the ''war time.''

The supporting system is primarily a public health regulatory information system. The purpose of this system is to monitor the behavior of health care administrative agencies and healthcare organizations in fulfilling their legal obligation of protecting public health. The supporting system requires the establishment of public health regulatory LANs and central databases at the provincial and national levels. All the public health administrative agencies need to connect to the two LANs through the national public data network. The standardized format of regulatory reports will be developed. In terms of data communication of legal issues, online reporting and digital data collection methods are not in place but will be created.

This article provides an insight into the challenges currently facing China's public health and describes the development of PHERIS to prepare for and respond to public health emergencies. China recognizes that surveillance and detection of disease outbreaks is a critical part of the solution and a dynamic system incorporating command, action, and supporting components is also needed to manage emergencies. The ongoing development of PHERIS will provide a complete package for China to rapidly detect emergencies, effectively share critical information among key stakeholders, and competently manage emergencies. Comparing PHERIS with the five criteria recommended by Turoff et al. [26] , we find that the concepts of roles and notifications have been partly built into the system, while metaphors, context visibility, and hypertext are hardly realized in the system. This is not surprising, since China just started developing PHERIS and the system is still relatively rudimentary. At this stage, China's effort in developing PHERIS can be considered to be successful because of the radical emergency response process change re-sulted from PHERIS and its associated performance improvement in public health surveillance and group co-ordination. China expects PHERIS to be an adaptable system which is able to adjust to the changing environment. Thus, PHERIS will play a significant role in protecting China's public health for years to come. In summary, this article contributes to the IS literature with a description of China's PHERIS development and should be beneficial to both IS researchers and practitioners, especially those who are interested in developing countries' public health emergency response information systems.

Pandemic H1N1 in Canada and the use of evidence in developing public health policies e A policy analysis,"When responding to a novel infectious disease outbreak, policies are set under time constraints and uncertainty which can limit the ability to control the outbreak and result in unintended consequences including lack of public confidence. The H1N1 pandemic highlighted challenges in public health decision-making during a public health emergency. Understanding this process to identify barriers and modifiable influences is important to improve the response to future emergencies. The purpose of this study is to examine the H1N1 pandemic decision-making process in Canada with an emphasis on the use of evidence for public health decisions. Using semi-structured key informant interviews conducted after the pandemic (JulyeNovember 2010) and a document analysis, we examined four highly debated pandemic policies: use of adjuvanted vaccine by pregnant women, vaccine priority groups and sequencing, school closures and personal protective equipment. Data were analysed for thematic content guided by Lomas' policy decision-making framework as well as indicative coding using iterative methods. We interviewed 40 public health officials and scientific advisors across Canada and reviewed 76 pandemic policy documents. Our analysis revealed that pandemic pre-planning resulted in strong beliefs, which defined the decision-making process. Existing ideological perspectives of evidence strongly influenced how information was used such that the same evidentiary sources were interpreted differently according to the ideological perspective. Participants recognized that current models for public health decision-making failed to make explicit the roles of scientific evidence in relation to contextual factors. Conflict avoidance theory explained policy decisions that went against the prevailing evidence. Clarification of roles and responsibilities within the public health system would reduce duplication and maintain credibility. A more transparent and iterative approach to incorporating evidence into public health decision-making that reflects the realities of the external pressures present during a public health emergency is needed.","An effective public health response to a novel infectious disease will reduce the population impact. However, time constraints and uncertainty can compromise the response. This was seen with the 2003 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak where policies were developed under scientific uncertainty due to lack of published evidence and limited experience with the virus (MacDougall, 2007) . Some have suggested this uncertainty contributed to the failure to optimally control the outbreak in a timely manner in certain highly affected locations and resulted in unintended consequences such as lack of public confidence (National Advisory Commitee on SARS and Public Health, 2003) . Given the history of serious pandemic influenza outbreaks and the emergence of the H5N1 avian influenza virus, concerns about a human influenza pandemic are paramount. As a result several governments and institutions have implemented extensive pandemic plans to be better prepared and minimize uncertainty.

On June 11, 2009 the World Health Organization (WHO) raised the pandemic alert to its highest phase in response to a novel strain of H1N1 influenza (Eurosurveillance editorial team, 2009). Despite extensive planning, the use of evidence to develop policies was complicated by several factors. Public health officials had to make decisions quickly, often when information was still being gathered. Coordination was necessary across multiple levels of public health (international, federal, provincial, local) and sectors (hospitals, schools, workplaces) . Finally, pandemic policymaking has been shown to be influenced by political factors (Garoon & Duggan, 2008) and can be strained by antiviral and vaccine shortages, overwhelming demands on public health systems and intense public scrutiny (Timpka et al., 2009) .

This study sought to examine the Canadian public health system response to the 2009 H1N1 pandemic (pH1N1). Our objective was to analyse the public health decision-making process and identify the factors that influenced the uptake and application of evidence for public health policy decisions.

This policy analysis used a multiple case study design to examine policies at the federal, provincial and local levels of public health in Canada. Four policies were studied: (a) vaccine priority, (b) use of adjuvanted vaccine among pregnant women, (c) school closures as a containment strategy, and (d) recommendations on N95 respirators as a form of personal protective equipment (PPE) ( Table 1 and Supplementary Table 1) .

Study participants were from five Canadian provinces (British Columbia, Alberta, Ontario, Quebec and Nova Scotia). An initial list of 41 key informants was developed by identifying officials in federal, provincial or municipal governments, provincial or local medical officers of health, members of a pH1N1 scientific advisory group, and clinical experts in infectious diseases and/or public health. A snowball sampling method was then used to identify an additional 23 participants. We initiated recruitment by email between July and September 2010 and all interviews were complete by November 2010. All consenting participants were given the choice on the policy of focus for the interview based on their role/ responsibility during the pandemic. Many participants were involved in multiple policies and some spoke to more than one during their interview. Ethics approval for this study was obtained from the Health Sciences Research Ethics Board at the University of Toronto, Canada. All participants provided written informed consent.

The semi-structured interview guide was developed to capture the decision-making process with a focus on the use of evidence. All interviews were conducted by telephone by the principal investigator (LC) or research assistant (JT), recorded and transcribed verbatim. A second analyst (AC), present for all interviews, took additional notes and independently verified all transcriptions.

We sought public documents that detailed a pH1N1 policy recommendation related to the four policies. Primary documents included: guidance documents, statements of recommendations, interim or final government, advisory or scientific group reports and pandemic plans. Secondary documents included: information sheets, surveillance bulletins, journal publications and references from primary documents. Documents outlining recommendations were limited to those released between April 1, 2009 and May 31, 2010 while other documents were restricted to those released up to December 31, 2010. These date restrictions were in place to keep the analyses focused on pH1N1 and were determined by those responsible for monitoring these documents during the pandemic. Documents were identified through a search of an archive of published and grey literature related to pH1N1. Librarians developed this archive by performing daily local, national and international scans (www.ophla.ca). In addition, a direct search of selected public health and governmental websites was performed.

Data coding was used to abstract and synthesize data from transcribed interviews and policy documents using descriptive and iterative methods (Miles & Huberman, 1994; Yin, 1994) . We used Lomas' model for decision-making (Lomas, 2000) to guide the analysis because it captures the interactive and multidirectional knowledge transfer that occurs in the decision-making process focussing on both evidence or knowledge and its transfer within a Research studies had yet to show the significance of airborne (in addition to droplet) transmission for pandemic influenza Studies emerged that raised doubts on the ability of N95 respirators to prevent transmission of influenza among HCWs N95 respirators were recommended pandemic plans policy subsystem ( Supplementary Fig. 1 ). It also emphasizes the importance of context-based decision-making incorporating three domains that influence the process: values, institutions and information.

We also considered Sabatier's advocacy coalition framework (ACF) as it similarly emphasizes beliefs and ideologies (Sabatier, 2007) . However, this framework is less effective in describing the role of institutions. Dobrow's context and evidence utilization framework (Dobrow, Goel, & Upshur, 2004) is well-suited for examining contextual factors influencing the uptake of evidence, but has limited application to the policy and institutional subsystems where decisions take place, which was critical for pH1N1.

We also allowed thematic content to evolve independently of Lomas' framework. The principal investigator (the primary rater) developed the coding guide based on the framework and adaptations from its use in a previous analysis (Wilson et al., 2007) . The interviews were distributed between the primary and secondary rater for independent coding. A subset of transcriptions was coded by both raters to evaluate inter-rater differences. In addition, the primary rater reviewed all transcripts and coding a final time to ensure consistency. A similar process was followed for the document analysis. We reviewed coded data for themes guided by the research objectives and domains in Lomas' framework as well as themes that emerged that were not part of the framework. NVivo 9 was used to assist with data collection, organization and analysis.

We conducted 40 interviews, including six pilot interviews, and included all in the analysis. The primary roles of participants during pH1N1 are summarized in Supplementary Table 2 . Seventy-six relevant documents were identified with 12 covering more than one policy (Supplementary Table 3 ). We present our findings according to the Lomas framework and generalize themes overall, providing specific examples within policies in Table 2 .

Three competing ideologies emerged with respect to the use of evidence: (1) the evidence-based ideology: science should be the first and foremost consideration in developing policies, and decisions made in the absence of good quality evidence can result in suboptimal policies; (2) the policy-based ideology: science is a minor component of the policymaking process and evidence is meant to inform policy rather than drive policy; and, (3) a hybrid or pragmatist ideology. Most participants associated the term evidence with the traditional research-based form of scientific evidence, which were primarily epidemiological in nature.

With a perspective derived from evidence-based medicine (EBM), participants with an evidence-based ideology placed considerable value on the peer-review process associated with scientific publications and conventional epidemiological study designs. Without a peer-review process, this group felt uneasy with proceeding to a policy decision. Furthermore, participants expressed frustration when science was re-evaluated in the policy arena, believing this compromises an evidence-based approach. Their key view is that evidence should be central and at the basis of any good public health policy decision, and that good evidence leads to good policy.

""[Information on public health measures] are published in grey literature or as evaluations or reports that were implemented. It's hard to trust in the same way because it's not peer-reviewed and not subjected to the same rigor."" (participant 25, scientific advisor)

This ideology ran into a major barrier when particular standards of evidence were deemed necessary to proceed. For example, the use of adjuvanted vaccine had not been shown to be harmful in pregnant women, but advisory groups had difficulty offering conclusive advice without evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCT) conducted in pregnant women.

""The largest and most glaring gap was data on vaccine in pregnancy. That's a major issue that we still haven't solved. we end up using vaccines and other things in pregnant women yet we exclude them from the clinical trials where they would provide the data on their safety and effectiveness."" (participant 40, scientific advisor)

In contrast, participants with the policy-based ideology shared the perspective that evidence is meant to only inform policy and not dictate policy. Under certain circumstances, they believed it was justified to give less priority to science in favour of other contextual issues. Participants with this ideology felt that scientists often lack expertise in policy-making. This ideology acknowledges that personal belief and ability to sway individuals also play important roles. Furthermore, the group stressed that the purely science-based approach over-simplifies the reality of developing policies since the determining factors were often contextual.

""in a way you generate knowledge that's no use to the field because it's inapplicable even though the science is very appropriate. you're out of touch with the evidence mapping the policy."" (participant 69, public health official) ""In my view scientific advice into that [N95] decision would not have changed anything."" (participant 02, scientific advisor)

The pragmatist ideology can be seen as the centre of the continuum between evidence and policy-based ideologies. The participants who adopted this ideology felt science should be a primary consideration, but other factors including expert advice, clinical factors, logistics and ethics can be equally important and should be ""respected."" This group was more likely to have an openview of what constitutes evidence and tended not to make broad brush statements about either evidence or policy considerations, accepting that science can trump other considerations if compelling enough and vice versa. This group felt comfortable acting on the best available evidence and recognized that reaching consensus with respect to the science is often not possible.

"".science is a tool. We can debate the science for years but we have to make the best decision given the circumstance."" (participant 13, public health official) ""The decision-makers were all fully aware of the evidence and I think in a perfect environment would have chosen not to recommend the N95 masks. But they were working in the face of political and legal commitments as per the collective agreement. The evidence was available. It was considered but other factors ultimately drove the decision."" (participant 45, scientific advisor) ""Implementation considerations really are an incredibly important. confidence and public communication considerations are also really important considerations. They need to be respected every bit as much as the scientific and evidentiary considerations."" (participant 04, public health official)

Having not agreed upon definition of evidence results in further challenges in determining what counts as an evidence-based decision. While many participants support the pragmatic thinking, they recognize that current decision-making bodies lack the models to guide this in practice in a defensible way. In the current model, science evaluation and advisory recommendations are independent of decision-making. This separation has been recognized as essential to maintaining scientific integrity (Black, 2001) and is consistent with the evidence-based ideology. In situations where there was a lack of evidence, such as for the adjuvanted vaccine, it was difficult to proceed using an evidence-based ideology; therefore, other values and influences, such as the precautionary principle became of greater importance.

""It's another great example of the corner you get yourself into when you start making decisions that are not evidence-based. I mean the original decision to suggest that pregnant women should receive non-adjuvant vaccine, there was no evidentiary basis for that at all. It was one of these sort of theoretical precautionary principle sorts of things."" (participant 47, public health official)

""you can always say we'll take the precautionary principle and let's just play it absolutely safe and just go with the non-adjuvant, even though it may be less effective and it was not available."" (participant 19, clinical expert)

In a pandemic there is uncertainty at the outset. As a result, prior beliefs on epidemiological patterns were very influential. Beliefs were well entrenched because pandemic planning has been an ongoing public health effort for several years. Beliefs were most strong with respect to disease severity, health care burden and transmission. Severity was expected to be moderate to severe, having the epidemiological characteristics of previous pandemics, particularly the 1968 Asian flu pandemic or seasonal influenza (Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC), 2008). Participants also referenced the 1918e19 pandemic, avian influenza and SARS, indicating that historical memory played an important role in influencing beliefs. The health care burden was assumed to be high, having major resource implications and occupational safety concerns for health care workers. Transmission was assumed to occur through droplet spread with the possibility of airborne transmission. During pH1N1, emerging evidence that did not support these beliefs was more difficult to accept or incorporate into decision-making.

""One of the key considerations related to the N95 issue was the fact that we already had a pre-existing policy in place. that we would recommend that health care workers use N95 or the equivalent for protection. So you're not going to suddenly mid-gear change your policy."" (participant 04, public health official) ""trying to change the way you respond during a time of crisis is very difficult."" (participant 51 , public health practitioner)

Many participants felt that as pH1N1 progressed, attention was not paid to the severity of the disease soon enough and the subsequent scaling down of events to match the severity was delayed.

""we operated the same, whether or not it was a severe pandemic or not."" (participant 57, public health practitioner) ""We shouldn't have a war plan and stick with it right through to the bitter end, which I think is what we did this time. I actually don't know how you titre up or titre down but probably it's packaged with how we're communicating so that there is some room to move back if the threat is less severe than you initially worried about."" (participant 38, scientific advisor)

Beliefs were also entrenched as a result of the SARS experience, despite SARS being a hospital-outbreak versus the pH1N1 community outbreak. The impact of SARS on health care workers influenced beliefs about the severity of H1N1 and how we should prepare and respond.

""Maybe over a long period of time and as things like SARS become more distant in the memories of people working in health care that might change things."" (participant 43, clinical expert)

Several competing interests factored into the use of evidence. Health care unions were interested in protecting their workers. Professional medical societies were interested in the population they serve (e.g. Canadian Pediatric Society (CPS) for children, Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada (SOGC) for pregnant women and educational boards needed to consider both parents and school employees). Scientific advisors were tasked with evaluating the science and providing an unbiased recommendation while staying true to the quality of the science and the needs of the overall population versus specific subpopulations. Policymakers in governmental institutions were faced with balancing these and several other interests. At different jurisdictional levels in Canada, provincial and local level decision-makers needed to balance science with the overall needs and contextual factors in their community.

""When we were looking at the dosage and the number of vaccines that needed to be given to children. both the pediatricians and the public health position were based on defensible science. But the same science was interpreted differently by the two groups depending on whether their major concern was for the one individual child in front of them or whether it was in terms of how many kids could we vaccinate in how short a period of time to give a population level of protection."" (participant 32, public health official)

""we compromised on the N95s because we felt okay, so it's better to have masks used potentially unnecessarily but actually have people willing to come to work rather than risk people refusing to come to work."" (participant 32, public health official)

The complexity of Canada's executive, legislative and bureaucratic structures of public health complicated the policy process. This complexity has been noted previously to influence public health (Frank & Di Ruggiero, 2003) . With multiple levels of action, participants reported signs of disconnect between those responsible for reviewing the evidence and those exercising decisions in their respective jurisdictions. In addition, participants stated that recommendations made at the international or national level often did not consider local issues. Internationally, the WHO and US Centres for Disease Control (CDC) were highly influential.

""the vaccine decision-making process was very complex because it involved multiple levels of public health from WHO, to PHAC, to the province and then down to the local health unit."" (participant 45, scientific advisor)

Informal institutional structures were also influential. Pandemic H1N1 was the focus of intense interest and pressure from multiple citizen and advocacy groups, particularly in relation to vaccination. Pandemic plans, recommendations from the WHO and decisions made in other countries also affected how evidence was used in Canada.

""Full consideration has been given to international activities and declarations and notices issued by the World Health Organization."" (Health Canada, 9 A.D.) ""The fact that some other jurisdictions, such as Mexico and the US, implemented measures such as school closures put more pressure on Ontario to adopt similar measures."" (Ontario Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care, 2010)

Information producers included scientists/researchers, advisory groups and committees/working groups. Participants frequently expressed uncertainty about who was responsible for answering what questions. This resulted in confusion on where to look for information, particularly when differing recommendations were based on the same evidence.

Information purveyors included: government, professional organizations, media and advisory organizations with and without decision-making capability at local, provincial, federal and international levels. A common theme was that the credibility of information purveyors was paramount and needed to be preestablished. Scientific advisory groups formed during pH1N1 did not have the opportunity to establish their credibility, making their recommendations difficult to accept. For example, the National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) is responsible for scientific guidance on immunizations; however, another vaccine advisory group was created specifically for the pandemic and NACI not consulted until later on.

""It's no good having a scientific decision-making body that only exists in the setting of emergencies or one that is sufficiently far from government that they're not looking at that advice and using that advice on a regular basis."" (participant 02, scientific advisor) Credibility also posed challenges at times because recommendations coming from an established and credible organization were difficult to challenge or modify (i.e. WHO). Along with credibility, themes emerged around the challenges in achieving consensus on scientific evidence. Participants were particularly concerned about the significant amount of time spent trying to achieve consensus, commenting that long debates over scientific merits under time constraints is not helpful. It was recognized that consensus is often not feasible and therefore, different models of consensus should be considered.

""a cabinet approach, which is that you may disagree with the final decision but you go with it and you live with it."" (participant 18, public health official)

When contradictory or unclear messages were given, the ensuing confusion resulted in decreased public confidence and increased time invested to rationalize the differences.

""[WHO] made a recommendation that pregnant women should be offered non-adjuvant vaccine preferentially because there wasn't much data on the use of adjuvant, or so they claimed, in pregnant women, which set the tone for Canada. we had already ordered adjuvant vaccine for our population. So that was a bit of a challenge for us."" (participant 04, public health official) ""The untimely and ambiguous recommendations for dosing in pregnant women and young children from national and international sources put Alberta in a vulnerable position where credibility of its public health decision-makers was jeopardized because of issues beyond their control."" (Alberta Health and Wellness, 2010) One of the most influential information purveyors, the media, was looked at in an overall favourable light. Unlike previous public health events, such as SARS where the media reaction was sensationalized and disruptive at times (Lewison, 2008; Washer, 2004) , participants felt that most of the time the media took a balanced and responsible approach in their reporting by seeking appropriate advice from credible experts.

""I don't think the media drove any of our policies, other than forcing us to try and be as clear in our communications as possible."" (participant 32 , public health official) However, at certain points during the pandemic, such as around the immunization campaign, it was perceived that media coverage did have a strong influence.

""initially [the media] influenced the public perception of the vaccine. Originally it was in a negative way so that there were questions to the safety and the need for the vaccine. But then subsequently after the death of [child], it was for demand of the vaccine. Then all of the media attention on the lines and the long waiting times just added public pressure to go beyond the priority groups that were determined by the policy."" (participant 41, scientific advisor)

Academic journals were also cited as an influential purveyor. Study participants acknowledged that journals made an attempt to speed up their review and publishing of pandemic studies and made articles freely available. Nonetheless, the process was critiqued by some who commented that at times it disrupted the flow of information.

""there wasn't an awful lot of science being published about pandemic H1N1 in a timely enough fashion to affect decision-making. . So it would be really good to have a fast track peel-off kind of system of public access where people can review and it doesn't necessarily preclude subsequent publication .. because scientists need to be able to do that."" (participant 32, public health official)

Views on the sufficiency of information were divergent. Many participants expressed the desire for more information/evidence despite an acknowledgement that decision-makers may not be equipped to handle new or emerging information, even if the scientific quality is high.

Several additional themes emerged that were not explicitly captured by the Lomas framework. Comments on the use of evidence revealed concerns around transparency (i.e. operating in such a way that it is easy for others to see what actions are performed) and explicitness (policies fully and clearly expressed, leaving nothing implied). Specifically, because criteria for the inclusion or exclusion of evidence were unclear, decision-making structures themselves were described by participants as being a mystery at times. Some participants not at the decision-making table were not confident in their ability to accept and implement recommendations because they were not privy to the decision-making structure. Scientific advisors wanted to know how scientific recommendations provided were ultimately used and balanced with other factors. If advice was not explicitly referenced, those providing the scientific advice assumed it was not considered. Some felt that decision-makers often do not cite other factors, such as logistical, political and social issues as rationales because those issues are perceived as less justifiable compared to science. This lack of explicitness can result in the unintended consequence of decisions appearing to be made without appropriate justification.

""There wasn't a lot of transparency in those decisions or at least feedback to the people who were making the recommendations. It's hard to know whether they also considered the evidence. or whether there were some other factors that were forcing them to go against the recommendation."" (participant 25, scientific advisor)

A clear documentation of the process would serve to make the process more explicit and satisfy concerns raised.

""the bottom line is a decision has to be made. You have to sometimes go right down to consensus and expert opinion or extrapolation from other types of evidence or other categories of evidence to make your recommendation. I think there has to be rigor that goes along with that and documentation and clarity on the reasoning."" (participant 45, scientific advisor) Several participants commented on the multiple parallel processes which took place. Not only were there parallel processes for decision-making at multiple levels, but the generation/evaluation of evidence also happened at multiple levels and sometimes even within the same jurisdiction or institution. Such duplication contributed to inefficiencies and confusion in the recommendations.

""all of us were scrambling across all of our different domains to understand as best as we could what could be learned at any given moment. In retrospect it was so fundamentally inefficient."" (participant 16, scientific advisor) Participants noted that First Nations groups were at increased risk of mortality and morbidity and warranted vaccine priority, but overall did not speculate on the broader causes of the disproportionate mortality and morbidity. This issue was not the focus of the study or the policies examined, which could be an explanation for why this was not discussed in more detail by the participants.

In contrast to previous public health events such as SARS (National Advisory Commitee on SARS and Public Health, 2003) , the CreutzfeldteJakob disease tainted blood scandal (Wilson et al., 2001) and the Walkerton Escherichia coli outbreak (Schuster et al., 2005) , a unique aspect of pH1N1 was the advance planning. Substantial investments had been made in pandemic planning since SARS, and the identification of H1N1 in Mexico in early 2009 initiated further preparations for its anticipated spread. Advance planning did minimize uncertainty, but it also generated assumptions that created conflict when handling emerging evidence. Furthermore, evidence was interpreted differently according to the three ideologies of evidence.

According to Fishbein and Ajzen's theory of reasoned action, pandemic plans are manifestations of the intentions for a pandemic, a conscious action plan which functions as a major determinant of future behaviour (Fishbein & Ajzen, 1975) . Pandemic plans are a complex collection of assumptions based on various types of evidence. This creates a box in which policymaking begins and sometimes stays. As the outbreak unfolded it became apparent that data on severity did not match the models and underlying assumptions of most plans. Decision-making, however, continued to be framed by these models. Pandemic plans are intended to provide practical guidance and not indoctrinate ideology; however, this analysis shows that the latter prevailed. This finding is consistent with the theory of cognitive dissonance (Festinger, 1957) which explains the difficulties in adjusting when there is a discrepancy between prior held beliefs and new information based on the existing situation.

Other decision-making theories can offer insight into policy choices made despite the evidence. Challenging the content of the pandemic plans, for example on the use of N95 respirators, was avoided in certain jurisdictions given the significant conflict that would arise. This is consistent with conflict avoidance as described by the conflict model of decision-making (Janis & Mann, 1977) . A decision that involves a potential conflict provokes a degree of stress, the excess or absence of which is in turn a major determinant of the final decision. The N95 decision in Ontario was a result of ""defensive avoidance"" such that the risks to labour disruption would not be worth challenging a recommendation from the pandemic plan. The school closure policy went against a priori guidance, which largely endorsed school closure as a containment strategy. According to the conflict model, the (largely societal) risks associated with school closures outweighed the risks of staying with the decision. These two policies contrast in how differences in antecedent conditions, available evidence and resulting decisionalconflict, guided the policy actions. It is possible that the nature of the situation, and not theory, explained the N95 decision as the political and non-evidentiary considerations were considered legitimate. Compared with N95, very little epidemiological evidence existed for school closures with support mostly coming from modelling studies. However, the potentially large societal costs of closing schools supported a change in direction. The vaccine sequencing decisions also largely agreed with pandemic plans although the manifestation of the policy was extremely heterogeneous across Canada and within provinces. With the adjuvanted vaccine for pregnant women, little to no a priori information existed and therefore cognitive dissonance did not apply. Instead, the precautionary principle was largely used to justify decisions.

There are some limitations to this study. As interviews were conducted a few months after the pandemic was declared over, recall bias is a possibility. Verification of our findings with the document analysis is not susceptible to this recall bias and supported similar themes around the role of beliefs, information purveyors and ideologies. Nonetheless we acknowledge that hindsight may influence responses. All participants work within the public health or health care system. As a result, the views of individuals outside the public health system were not represented. While this is appropriate given our research question, these findings represent only one particular stream of perspectives. One of the limitations of using the Lomas framework in this analysis is the unidirectional flow between information domains and institutional structures for decision-making. During pH1N1, this exchange was multidirectional and several individuals were both producers of information and decision-makers within the formal structures, making it difficult to conceptually separate their unique influences. Lomas' framework also does not capture Canada's hierarchical, jurisdictional and institutional levels of decision-making and their interactions. Finally, the placement of evidence ideology in the values component of the model can be questioned as it is reflective of a normative stance versus a value trait.

Rationalism demands that decision-makers choose the best alternative from a set of options (Betsch, Haberstroh, & Hohle, 2002) . However, under the congruence of multiple pre-planning and entrenched assumptions, the precautionary principle and evidence-based paradigms, a complex situation emerges whereby the decision-making process cannot be easily tracked or justified according to a straightforward set of criteria. Pre-planned approaches have many benefits including clarifying accountability and strategy during uncertainty. However, caution needs to be exercised when pre-planned approaches are in place to ensure policy options are not constrained by plans. We suggest that pandemic plans need to be written and used in a way that accommodates dynamic responses to fit an emerging situation. This includes minimizing scenarios based on single assumptions and conducting a range of sensitivity analyses.

An emergent public health situation that affects a large proportion of the population will necessarily require a balance between various factors. Both evidential and policy considerations are important and improvements in addressing both effectively and explicitly within decision-making processes are needed. We recommend an iterative scientific review that re-considers science/ evidence based on the policy landscape. The challenge with this approach is that in an EBM paradigm this can be thought of as compromising evidence. We have noted throughout our analysis that this is already happening; therefore, being more explicit about the process will allow for more critical investigation. Functionally, public health needs a model that can support these types of decision constructs, but at the same time ensure rigor. One modifiable construct that would be beneficial to amend going forward is to reconsider what constitutes evidence. This analysis suggests a more comprehensive and inclusive concept of evidence that recognizes the variety of contexts in which evidence is generated and used (Upshur, VanDenKerkhof, & Goel, 2001) , and that is more appropriate during an emerging public health event. This can be facilitated by increased collaboration and discussion among researchers and policymakers to ensure the relevant evidence is generated. Such collaborations would also facilitate greater credibility of information purveyors, which is particularly important when evidence does not fit prior expectations.

Credibility, transparency and explicitness in the decisionmaking process will improve understanding and uptake of policy decisions. In particular, our analyses revealed that when and why evidence/advice is or is not considered needs to be clearly articulated. This includes outlining steps, logic, key assumptions, limitations and trade-offs considered, evidentiary or otherwise. The role of ideological perspectives and prior beliefs should also be made explicit given how influential they are in defining decisions from the outset. We acknowledge that detailed recording of evidencebased or consensus-derived decisions to ensure transparency may be idealistic in the face of time and other pressures during a crisis. One possible recommendation could be a more rigorous use of Incident Management System (IMS) processes which would serve not only to improve processes but also to ensure better documentation. At the minimum, critical post-outbreak analyses of detailed real-time records of the meetings and transcripts should occur to improve future public health actions. Finally, with many different groups addressing the same questions, inefficiencies still exist. The public health system needs to leverage existing relationships rather than create new structures during a pandemic. In addition, better clarity on who is responsible for answering what questions is needed to avoid duplication and mixed messages. Addressing inefficiencies will require trust and collaboration, supporting the themes identified around credibility.

This analysis reflects the tension that occurs during emergency public health decision-making and highlights several important considerations for public health planning. Going forward, we must ensure that our decision-making structures evolve in light of the challenges experienced during pH1N1.

Public health human resources: a comparative analysis of policy documents in two Canadian provinces,"Background: Amidst concerns regarding the capacity of the public health system to respond rapidly and appropriately to threats such as pandemics and terrorism, along with changing population health needs, governments have focused on strengthening public health systems. A key factor in a robust public health system is its workforce. As part of a nationally funded study of public health renewal in Canada, a policy analysis was conducted to compare public health human resources-relevant documents in two Canadian provinces, British Columbia (BC) and Ontario (ON), as they each implement public health renewal activities. Methods: A content analysis of policy and planning documents from government and public health-related organizations was conducted by a research team comprised of academics and government decision-makers. Documents published between 2003 and 2011 were accessed (BC = 27; ON = 20); documents were either publicly available or internal to government and excerpted with permission. Documentary texts were deductively coded using a coding template developed by the researchers based on key health human resources concepts derived from two national policy documents.","The increase in communicable and non-communicable disease incidence and prevalence, changing population demographics, along with concerns about pandemics, natural disasters, and terrorism, have highlighted the challenges faced by public health systems to respond rapidly and appropriately to threats [1, 2] . Governments, recognizing the importance of public health to address these threats, have focused on strengthening public health systems in many countries including Canada [3] , the United States [2] and across Europe [4] . A key factor in rebuilding and sustaining public health is a robust public health workforce. Improved public health human resources (PHHR) policy, planning, and management have been identified as priorities in international reports [3, 5] . In separate national public health priority setting consultations, both Canada and the United States have identified issues related to the public health workforce as priorities [6, 7] . Indeed '(no) attempt to improve public health will succeed that does not recognize the fundamental importance of providing and maintaining in every local health agency across Canada an adequate staff of highly skilled and motivated public health professionals' [3] (p. 136).

PHHR policy development and planning is complex and has a number of unique challenges. The myriad of sectors and stakeholders responsible for public health service delivery involve multiple levels of governmentnational, provincial/state, and localalong with sectors external to public health, such as primary care, schools, municipal governments, not-for-profit agencies and nongovernment organizations. The involvement of such a broad array of stakeholders poses challenges to coordination and planning for the right composition and distribution of PHHR [8, 9] . The public health workforce includes more than 25 regulated and non-regulated health care providers [10] . Because these providers are drawn from different disciplines (both health and nonhealth related), there is great variation in their entrylevel education. Indeed, most are prepared in generalist discipline-specific programmes with little formal public health education [9] adding more complexity to PHHR planning [11] .

In Canada, national consultations have identified a vision for PHHR that includes collaborative planning, building on core public health competencies that will result in a competent and flexible workforce prepared to ""meet the population's public health needs, and reduce health and social disparities"" [10] (p.iii). While national visions provide a collective direction for policy development and implementation, public health programmes are primarily developed and delivered at the provincial and local levels (for example, municipal, regional). To date, there has been little published about PHHR policy and planning at the provincial or local level and specifically during a time of change or renewal for public health systems. The purpose of this paper is to present results of an analysis of PHHR policy and planning documents for two provinces in Canada as they each implement public health renewal activities.

In Canada, public health is a shared responsibility between several levels of government. At the national level, the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) provides national leadership for action on public health with roles in facilitating intergovernmental collaboration on public health and supporting national approaches to policy and planning [12] . While the PHAC collaborates with provincial, territorial, and municipal levels of government as well as non-government organizations, each province or territory has its own public health legislation [13, 14] and unique structure for public health service delivery.

In 2003, in the aftermath of the SARS event, two Canadian provinces, British Columbia (BC) and Ontario (ON), undertook processes to define, develop, and implement public health requirements for services and programmes. The result of these parallel but independent processes led to the BC Core Public Health Functions [15] and the Ontario Public Health Standards [16] . Each province has similar and unique public health contexts. For example, in BC, public health is funded by the provincial government and delivered by five regional health authorities and one provincial health authority while in Ontario funding is shared between the provincial government and municipal (local) governments and delivered by 36 local boards of health. In addition, in both provinces some provincial agencies participate in delivery of some services. See Table 1 for additional information on BC and ON public health context.

In this paper we report on results of a comparative policy analysis conducted within a larger programme of research. The aim of this policy analysis was to compare PHHR-relevant policies and planning documents in two Canadian provinces, BC and ON, as they each implement public health renewal activities.

The 'Renewal of Public Health Systems (RePHS) in BC and Ontario' is a five year nationally funded programme of research (2009 to 2014) [17] . The RePHS study seeks to answer two major research objectives:

1. To explore and understand the core public health functions implementation process and the contextual factors influencing it in BC and ON. 2. To examine and understand the impact and outcomes of core public health functions implementation at organizational, systems, and population levels in both BC and ON.

Three cross-cutting themes are also investigated in this study:

1. Public health human resources policy, planning, and management; 2. Relationships between public health and primary care sectors; and 3. Integration of an equity lens.

Together these objectives and cross-cutting themes guide an integrated programme of research. One aim of the RePHS study was to compare how each province articulated their provincial policy directions related to PHHR at the outset of this programme of research. The policy analysis reported in this paper will provide a baseline against which to compare PHHR developments at the conclusion of the RePHS programme of research.

Questions guiding this policy analysis were: What specific aspects of PHHR policy, planning, and management are discussed in BC and ON government and public health organization documents? What are the contexts in which PHHR policy, planning, and management are discussed? and To what extent are these similar/ different?

A comparative policy analysis of documents in BC and ON was conducted to understand key aspects of PHHR policy and planning during implementation of public health renewal activities. We defined policy as those 'courses of action (and inaction) that affect the set of institutions, organizations, services and funding arrangements of the health and health care system. It includes policy made in the public sector (by government) as well as in the private sector' [18] (p. 6). Policy analysis is the systematic and disciplined examination of policy with the objective of understanding the process, content, or outcomes of policy [18, 19] . In this analysis we were interested in analysing the content of PHHR-relevant policy and planning documents within the context of change in public health. The research team consisted of academic researchers and government decision-makers with public health expertise in both provinces; team members are also investigators on the larger RePHS study.

For the purposes of this study, we included provincial government and select public health organizations' policy and planning documents relevant to public health and/or PHHR. Government and public health organization (for example, public health associations) websites in both provinces were accessed for documents and key informants and public health experts on our team identified additional relevant documents within their respective provinces. The types of documents included: provincial annual reports, core public health function/standards documents, commission reports on SARS, health human resources (HHR) and PHHR specific reports, health profession legislation, and other public health (PH) reports such as competencies development and leadership frameworks. Documents published between 2003 (beginning at the time of the SARS event) and March, 2011 were included in the analysis. Publicly available and internal provincial government and public health-related policy documents were obtained for BC (n = 27) and ON (n = 20). A small number of government documents were not publicly available but were identified as relevant to the analysis by our government team members. Relevant text from these documents was excerpted to include in the analysis while ensuring the confidentiality of documents was not compromised. While we made every

Ontario agency for health protection and promotion (later renamed Public Health Ontario). [21] to compare key aspects of PHHR policy, planning and management including policy assumptions, collaborations, scope of practice, competencies/education, and planning approaches. NVivo 9, a qualitative software program [22] , was used to organize and analyse the data. Members of the research team independently coded text within the policy documents using the coding template. After all the documents were coded and reviewed by two researchers, reports were obtained for each code, reports were reviewed by the entire the team, and consensus achieved on the coded text. A comparative analysis of BC and ON coded text was then conducted to identify similarities and differences. Narrative descriptions were written for the most frequently coded text and reviewed by the team.

We present the results and discuss the findings according to the most frequently coded HHR sub-categories across the policy documents, identifying and describing differences and similarities between provinces. Table 2 summarizes the top coded categories along with the percentage of documents coded to that category. For example, 90% of the ON documents and 59% of BC documents contained text relevant to the code HHR Planning Activity -education/training/competencies/scope of practice.

Policy documents in both provinces discussed the importance of having an educated, competent public health workforce with the appropriate competencies (knowledge, skills and attitude) for the effective and efficient delivery of public health services. To achieve this, provinces identified the importance of understanding essential public health functions in order to align the competencies necessary to carry out public health functions with appropriate health human resources. These functions were determined through extensive consultation processes in both provinces [23, 24] and nationally [25] . There are distinct differences in how BC defines essential public health functions compared to ON and Canada; but for all three, essential functions of public health include monitoring and assessment of population health status, public health surveillance, health promotion, disease and injury prevention, and health protection and enforcement [15, 25, 26] . The BC Core Public Health Functions Framework [15] , includes two different categories of essential functions:

1. those that are unique and are specifically geared towards public health (the essence of what public health does); and 2. those that help the health system to carry out its core programmes or services. This set of functions is common to the entire health system.

Both of these are considered essential for the provision of public health programmes and services.

Within the context of the BC Core Public Health Functions framework, the essential public health functions (entitled strategies), the 20 core programmes, and the application of equity and population lenses are specific public health functions which are supported by system capacity [15] . The Ontario Public Health Standards set out the minimum requirements for public health programmes and services delivered by the 36 boards of health [16] . The Ontario Public Health Standards consist of four principles (need, impact, capacity, and partnership/collaboration), one foundational standard with specific areas (population health assessment, surveillance, research and knowledge exchange, and programme evaluation), and 14 programme standards grouped into five programme areas. The standards also set out requirements, including public health functions (assessment and surveillance, health promotion and policy development, disease prevention, and health protection) that all boards of health must implement [16] . Provincial government and public health organizations' policy documents dated in the early period of this analysis identify the beginning of efforts to develop public health competencies [15, 27] and in later documents, both provinces build on the national work identifying core competency areas: public health sciences; assessment and analysis; policy and programme planning, implementation and evaluation; partnerships, collaboration and advocacy; diversity and inclusiveness; communication; and leadership [28, 29] . Both provinces undertook intensive processes to identify and explicate core public health competencies that are foundational to support public health renewal including development of core functions and public health standards.

Public health associations in both provinces played an important role in identifying core public health competencies. In ON, the Ontario Public Health Association initially established a Core Competencies Task Group in 2003 with the intent of developing a set of core competencies for public health. To avoid duplication of efforts, the Ontario Public Health Association eventually partnered in the national process to develop core public health competencies [30] . In BC, a multi-phase project was undertaken by the BC Ministry of Health and the Public Health Association of BC, funded by the Public Health Agency of Canada. The purpose was to identify and address the core and technical competencies most critical to implementing the Core Public Health Functions Framework [15] and to identify competency gaps [28] . Specific objectives of the project were to: Implement processes to meet the competency profile gaps identified in the needs assessment; Recommend appropriate education response (s); Identify the education/training opportunities that facilitate the development of competencies throughout the BC public health sector; and Develop tools for education and workforce planning [28] (p.2).

The importance of strengthening partnerships between academe and public health as an important means of ensuring that the public health workforce is adequately trained was identified in documents in both provinces [27, 31] . Partnerships with universities were also noted as being vital to create programmes that are more aligned with PHHR needs and the inclusion of the education sector in PHHR planning overall. Practiced-based public health experience was highlighted as a key component of education/training programmes to prepare the public health workforce. Both BC and ON documents discussed several strategies to build education capacity in PH including the need to train new PH professionals, integrating core public health competencies in discipline-specific undergraduate education programmes, increasing the profile of PH careers and enrolment in PH programmes, increasing funding for PH education (subsidies, scholarships, and so on), expanding educational modalities (online, summer institutes), and increasing paid student internships and training placements in public health contexts [23, 27, 32] . In the last decade, both provinces have seen an increase in development of public health education programmes including Master's of public health (MPH). In addition, voluntary guidelines for Canadian universities offering MPH programmes were developed in 2006 and revised in 2009 [33] . Investments have been made by the ON government to enhance training and education opportunities for physicians to specialize in community medicine and public health [34] .

Building and sustaining PHHR capacity is also dependent on continuing educational opportunities and the recruitment of new professionals into the system. Public health needs to ensure a competent and diverse public health workforce by providing ongoing staff development and skill building related to core public health competencies, including quality improvement and life-long learning programmes for staff members. Both provinces identified a number of training and education needs for the workforce that include developing knowledge and skills related to: leadership capacity, applying a population and equity lens, diversity and cultural competency, the social determinants of health, interprofessional collaboration, and use of evidence in practice. In BC, specific issues related to Aboriginal health and HHR planning were highlighted [35, 36] while in ON, infection control training was identified [37, 38] . These specific areas reflect contextual factors specific to each province. Consistent with arguments made by Fraser and Greenhalgh [39] , the complexity of public health requires that the workforce must be capable of adapting and responding to the changing context in which they work. This capability is supported by not only identifying the competencies required to provide public health services but by moving beyond these to facilitate different ways for those in the workforce to continue to learn and build on existing competence.

Capacity speaks to the ability of the public health system to respond to the needs of the population. Both provinces recognized the need to increase public health capacity, both in terms of system supports/changes and resources, capability development, and leadership. They also identified the need for appropriate and sufficient staff complements at the local level to meet population health needs. The importance of system capacity to direct public health strategies and support the implementation of programmes and services at local, regional, and provincial levels was identified in the BC Core Public Health Functions [40] and the Ontario Public Health Standards [16] . Specific to BC, system capacity included health information systems, health human resources, staff training and development, research and evaluation, quality management, programme planning and management capabilities, and core competencies [15] . A number of supports for capacity building were identified including those related to PHHR:

Supportive attitudes, values and philosophy that foster a safe, flexible learning environment Supportive attitudes and structures that promote cultural sensitivity and respect for diversity across all aspects of the organization Supportive policies, processes and structures to optimize the application of the core competencies to achieve desired health outcomes. Supporting advocacy to influence systemic change. Provision of resources that support the appropriate application and mix of competencies within the organization Opportunities for training, continuing education and mentoring to acquire and enhance competencies/ support the effective application of competencies Facilitating sustainable collaborative relationships with multiple sectors and partners. [40] (p.8).

While in ON, boards of health are guided by four principles in the standards that explicitly speak to public health capacity and meeting local communities' needs. The four foundational principles are: 1) Need (addressing population health needs effectively and efficiently), 2) Impact (reducing health inequities), 3) Capacity (understanding local capacity and resources, including human resources, required to achieve outcomes), and, 4) Partnership and Collaboration (fostering partnerships to promote community capacities, that is the system includes partners such as other agencies and non-governmental organizations). As with BC, the ON Public Health Standards identify a number of supports for public health capacity building including 'organizational structures and processes; workforce planning, development, and maintenance; information and knowledge systems; and financial resources' [16] (p.13).

In addition to recognizing the need for sufficient and appropriate PH staffing, many Ontario documents focused on surge capacity and emergency response to anticipated and unanticipated events [38, 41] . In their analysis of the SARS event, the Ontario SARS Commission identified the lack of surge capacity as a significant issue in the ability to respond to SARS effectively [41] and the potential to respond to future pandemic events. The different focuses between BC and ON may be explained by the ability of each province to respond to and contain the spread of SARS. Because BC was able to contain the spread of SARS before it reached epidemic proportions, it is likely that the ON public health sector viewed surge capacity as more relevant and a priority than BC did.

Documents in both provinces identified that PHHR requirements to ensure sufficient capacity included an appropriate mix of core competencies, administrative support, and mechanisms such as leadership, partnership with affiliate organizations, and training and recruitment [32, 41, 42] . Some systemic solutions identified in these documents included:

Sustainable employment strategies to increase the supply of HHR Develop increased education and training opportunities for public health professionals Consolidation of smaller health units (specific to the ON context only) Identify and implement models for effective utilization of health human resources during an emergency Systems for identification, coordination, and deployment of emergency HR resources System of cross-training and re-assignment and System of expert field support to ensure all PH practitioners have access to the expertise they need when they need it, including more effective alignment of expertise, training, and support [35, 36] .

Closely aligned with capacity was the discussion of the supply and characteristics of PHHR. Historically HHR planning has focused primarily on staffing numbers; however, many of the PHHR policy documents have approached the issue of 'supply' of PHHR with a broader understanding of planning. This encompasses not only the numbers of staff, but their characteristics such as age of the workforce, and education and competencies, and incorporating issues such as the requirements to meet population health needs into planning. Policy documents published after the SARS event in ON discuss issues of 'shortages' of public health professionals [23, 27] . Given the effects of the SARS event, other public health crises in recent years, and emerging shortages of health professionals in general, it is not surprising that early policy documents were focused on these concerns. For example, early documents discussed the shortage of key public health personnel, in particular, the need for Medical Officers of Health and those health professionals with expertise in infectious diseases [23, 27, 41] . In contrast with ON, BC documents were less focused on the discussion of shortages and improving PHHR supply with the exception of one specific recommendation of enhancing Aboriginal PH staff [35] . At the time of the policy analysis, BC had undertaken planning for a project to enumerate the public health workforce in order to 'to characterize, in a consistent manner, the size, composition and distribution of the formal public health system workforce among multiple health authorities and at the provincial level' [43] (p.1).

In ON, PHHR supply was oriented more generally at systemic issues of resource availability and public health infrastructure. There was an explicit recognition that a dedicated, diverse workforce was required for optimal public health functioning; however, the documents also identified concerns about work environments and their impact on staff [27] . This is consistent with a number of studies and reports that identify the importance of quality work environments on staff recruitment and retention [44, 45] .

Several documents in both BC and ON offered solutions to PHHR shortages, including improving PHHR planning, increased attention to recruitment and retention strategies, increased attention to enrolment and training opportunities, and targeting strategies to address shortages of specific roles in public health [27, [46] [47] [48] . In general, policy documents were more focused on the need for appropriately educated PHHR rather than simply the numbers.

Documents from both provinces recognize that collaboration is necessary across levels of government, within governments, between public health and primary care sectors, as well as with those beyond the health sector such as schools, communities, and other organizations. Integration of public health programmes and policies were deemed necessary to address the interrelatedness of social, physical, and mental health concerns [16, 28] .

BC documents explicitly discussed the importance of intersectoral, multi-sectoral and multi-disciplinary collaboration and integration in core programme papers as a strategy to ensure consistent, seamless services and achieve core functions [49] [50] [51] . In addition, the importance of collaboration between public health and primary health care was emphasized as it relates to the delivery of chronic disease prevention programmes and services [49] . BC's focus on intersectoral and multi-sectoral collaboration, as well as collaboration between public health and primary care may relate to the fact that public health is integrated into the larger health care system whereas in ON, public health is separate from the health care system at large. Public health units are not part of the Local Health Integration Networks (regional health authorities) in ON. Public health in the BC core public health documents is viewed as being provided not just by traditional public health workers, but by other professionals working across all areas of the health care system as well as outside the health care system.

ON documents discussed the need to develop and optimize strategic relationships and collaboration with current initiatives, structures, and professional organizations, and actively engage with partners in government, local public health, health care, non-profit, industry, and academia [38, 41] . Clearly defining roles and responsibilities, particularly as they relate to government and public health units, was identified as a strategy to address issues that arise in the case of infectious disease outbreaks, where the potential for conflict and procedural/ administrative holdups might be avoided with more explicit assignment of roles between sectors/jurisdictions [27] . While earlier documents discussed these policy issues and made recommendations for action, more recent documents suggest some policies related to intersectoral collaboration have been developed and implemented. For example, to address the greater coordination and consistency between sectors necessary for infection control, Regional Infection Control Networks have been established in ON [37] .

A noted issue in public health post-SARS was the leadership deficit. Both provinces have identified the development of leadership competencies, enhanced leadership skills training, and building leadership capacity as strategic policy directions [24, 27] . Leadership competencies were understood to be essential to the application of other core public health competencies and to public health worker retention, morale, and productivity [52] . For both provinces, documents outlined the roles and responsibilities of health authorities, the organizational structures of public health bodies, and relationships among public health leadership such as Medical Health Officers [13, 27, 31] .

ON documentation more explicitly addressed a perceived lack of resources for leadership in public health, and identified the need for the province to develop resources such that health unit workers are supported in developing leadership skills [27, 38] . The ON documents also spoke to the barriers, such as time, opportunities, and recognition, to developing strong leaders and leadership skills [23, 29, 38] . Documents indicated the need for leadership training (and valuation thereof ) and professional networks. One document pointed to the importance of employing and retaining professional practice leaders (for example, nurses) in each health unit, and of identifying and cultivating good leaders [27] . Since this time, ON has implemented a new provincial initiative requiring boards of health designate a Chief Nursing Officer in each public health unit [53] .

In terms of PH planning context, both provinces identified the failures of the public health system in the face of SARS, recommending the need to improve the PH system, including local and provincial preparedness, core competencies, and development and skill-building related to public health competencies to support public health professionals to address current and evolving health issues. Documents in both provinces also highlight the unique context of PH planning [27, 43] . While governments had developed HHR policy documents, mostly in response to general shortages of nurses and physicians [20, 45] , many provincial HHR strategies lack a PH component despite the stated desire to strengthen the PH workforce, ensure equity, avoid resource duplication, and enhance coordination and capacity building. A key strategy identified in the documents was the importance of PH collaborating with governments and other partners beyond the immediate health system to address systemic and workforce issues [27, 31] . A responsive public health system requires coordinated planning between systems and HHR. Strategic public health policy development and implementation needs to consider the systemic as well as PHHR issues to achieve policy goals [11] .

Populations of concern/ priority populations BC and ON documents prioritized the importance of the social and environmental determinants of health in reducing health inequities [15, 16, 52] . Documents in both provinces emphasized the importance of considering inequity and population health perspectives in moving public health priorities forward [16, 54] . Both provinces also spoke of targeting programming to meeting local need and of developing programmes to address characteristics (for example, food, early childhood development) in specific contexts and settings (for example, schools, gardens, and so on). Both the BC Core Public Health Functions and Ontario Public Health Standards discuss the importance of public health addressing the specific needs of those populations considered vulnerable or at-risk; BC refers to populations of concern or vulnerable populations while ON uses the term priority populations. In a separate analysis, researchers examined BC and ON public health renewal documents for how they conceptualized health equity. They identified that while both provinces defined health inequities in a similar way, how health equity was discussed in policy documents differed [55] .

In BC, health authorities (which include public health) may conduct a gap analysis often based on population health status assessments; these assessments can aid in identification of populations of concern and health issues that need to be addressed through public health programmes and services [56] . In addition, the use of both a population health and equity lens are explicitly described as fundamental to the core functions and contribute to identification of populations of concern. One example of a priority population for public health programmes and services in BC is First Nations/Aboriginal peoples reflecting that province's context [15, 57] including development of a First Nations health plan of which HHR is a critical component [35] . Most BC documents explicitly identified First Nations/ Aboriginal peoples, and strongly emphasized the importance of developing culturally-appropriate programmes in partnership with Aboriginal communities and other diverse groups such as immigrants and refugees [31] . BC documents recognized that tailored programmes specifically supporting Aboriginal health and health determinants are essential, and that these programmes will need to be flexible to accommodate the diversity of contexts, communities, and governance structures that exist. In terms of HHR, BC also explicitly recognized that Aboriginal health supports are often overlooked in the public health sphere because they tend to fall outside of provincial health care jurisdiction.

The ON documents defined priority populations broadly, as those populations identified by surveillance, epidemiological or other research studies, that are at risk and for which public health interventions may be reasonably considered to have a substantial impact at the population level [16] . In this approach to identifying priority populations, a population health lens is explicitly discussed while the application of an equity lens is assumed in the use of terms such as 'health inequities'. However, no documents specify the use of an equity lens to identify priority populations. In ON, low-income individuals and Aboriginal populations were also identified as examples of priority populations; however, the focus on Aboriginal populations is less obvious in ON documents. In ON, each public health unit is responsible for identifying priority populations specific to their context and jurisdiction [16] . For both BC and ON, the specific local level priorities would not necessarily be captured in provincial policy documents.

Public health renewal in BC and ON has highlighted significant issues in the public health workforce. Policy documents from government and related public health organizations in both provinces have identified similar key issues in planning the public health workforce. These include the importance of education, training, and competencies required to meet BC Core Public Health Functions/ON Public Health Standards, ensuring a sufficient supply of needed PHHR, developing public health leadership, ensuring public health capacity exists to address significant events, addressing the unique needs of priority populations/populations of concern, and the importance of intersectoral collaboration. HHR planning in general has shifted away from a narrow focus on supply or numbers of healthcare providers to focus more on identification of population health needs and addressing health inequities, and the competencies required to meet these needs [20] . This shift is evident in many of the public health policy documents reviewed with much of the discussion focused on core public health competencies, education and training, and professional development as important elements to support the public health workforce. The delivery of effective and efficient public health programme and services requires consideration of both the competence and capabilities of the workforce [39] . These provincial policy documents also align with national strategic directions emphasizing core competencies unique to public health [10, 58] . Similarities in BC and ON PHHR policy directions provide common ground for collaborative work, building on the national PHHR policy vision [10] . This collaboration may reduce duplication and more efficiently use financial and human resources.

Researchers and policy-makers have called for HHR planning approaches that are based on population health needs rather than utilization trends [10, 20] . Both provinces have identified the importance of planning public health services based on identifying regional/local population health needs and have incorporated these into their provincial policies [16, 59] ; this may provide needed information to support planning of PHHR based on assessed population health needs within regional health authorities or local health boards. Planned analysis in this programme of research includes a review of public health workforce plans.

While many similarities exist between the provinces, the context distinctive to each province has influenced and shaped how they have focused their PHHR policies. Clearly, the SARS event had a considerable impact on PHHR policy discussions in ON, particularly in the mid-2000s with recommendations for PHHR strongly linked to SARS-related issues such as surge capacity, lack of collaboration between sectors, and shortages of some public health personnel such as Medical Officers of Health and infection control specialists. For BC, the early focus on essential public health functions influenced PHHR policy and placed greater emphasis on the competencies required to meet core functions. Furthermore, given the differences between the provinces in how public health is delivered, PHHR policy must be context specific [11] . BC and ON differ in how PH is situated in the broader health care system, whether integrated into health authorities in BC or more independent and autonomous in ON, this has implications for PHHR planning. The unique contexts in BC and ON were evident in the findings; aspects of PHHR were emphasized differently in policy development and implementation.

This policy analysis identified progressive work on PHHR policy and planning with early documents providing an inventory of PHHR issues to be addressed and later documents providing evidence of beginning policy development and implementation. In recent months, ON published their provincial strategic plan for PH [60] and BC has published its updated guiding framework for PH [59] . Both provinces' documents highlight the importance of PHHR to achieve strategic directions in PH. However, while much policy-related work has been conducted to enhance PHHR planning in both provinces, there has been little evaluation of the effectiveness of the PHHR strategies. Looking ahead, future analyses should examine implementation of provincial PHHR policies at the local or regional level to examine the extent to which strategic directions are achieved. A key focus of the RePHS study is to examine the impact of provincial policies on the public health workforce at the public health unit or regional level in both provinces further enhancing understanding of PHHR policy and planning.

BMC Public Health Establishing a nationwide emergency department-based syndromic surveillance system for better public health responses in Taiwan,"Background: With international concern over emerging infectious diseases (EID) and bioterrorist attacks, public health is being required to have early outbreak detection systems. A disease surveillance team was organized to establish a hospital emergency department-based syndromic surveillance system (ED-SSS) capable of automatically transmitting patient data electronically from the hospitals responsible for emergency care throughout the country to the Centers for Disease Control in Taiwan (Taiwan-CDC) starting March, 2004. This report describes the challenges and steps involved in developing ED-SSS and the timely information it provides to improve in public health decision-making.","groups starting in November 2004 and two clear spikes in enterovirus-like infections coinciding with the two school semesters. Using ED-SSS for surveillance of influenza-like illnesses and enteroviruses-related infections has improved Taiwan's pandemic flu preparedness and disease control capabilities.

Taiwan's ED-SSS represents the first nationwide real-time syndromic surveillance system ever established in Asia. The experiences reported herein can encourage other countries to develop their own surveillance systems. The system can be adapted to other cultural and language environments for better global surveillance of infectious diseases and international collaboration.

With the recent global concern over emerging infectious diseases (EID) and the challenges of the 2003 SARS epidemics, government health officials in SARS-affected countries have begun to consider various measures of improving their infectious disease surveillance systems [1] [2] [3] [4] . Infectious disease epidemiologists and several leading public health administrators at the Centers for Disease Control in Taiwan (Taiwan-CDC) becoming aware of the importance of early detection of EID or bioterrorism, started developing an automatic alert system. Therefore, the Automatic Syndromic Surveillance Planning Task Force Committee was created and recruited infection physicians, epidemiologists, biostatisticians, and information technology (IT) experts in July 2003 to oversee the initiation and development of Taiwan's first medical informatics-based emergency department syndromic surveillance system (ED-SSS).

To prepare for this project, we reviewed the syndromic surveillance systems of other countries and officials of health informatics at Taiwan-CDC started collaborating with the Real-time Outbreak and Disease Surveillance (RODS) Laboratory at the University of Pittsburgh to develop a real-time syndromic surveillance system for Taiwan in August 2003 [1, [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] . RODS, used during the 2002 Olympic Winter Games, is the first commonly used syndromic surveillance system in the United States and has been found to efficiently process and analyze data in a timely manner [9] [10] [11] . Together, the task force and the RODS group aimed to establish a nationwide syndromic surveillance system within six months to meet the challenges of potential avian flu outbreaks for up-coming winter seasons and other future EIDs. To gain more operational level experiences, we also visited the Department of Health in New York City, where syndromic surveillance system was established and has been in daily operation since 2001 [12] . There, the task force members observed routine workflow processes and became familiar with other practical concerns of operating an ED-SSS on a daily basis. Based on these experiences and high population density in Taiwan, we decided to create a nationwide surveillance system. To this nationwide ED-SSS, we added geographical information system (GIS) technology, meant to facilitate epidemiological investigation and feedback between data providers and decision-makers [13] .

Using the electronic data from the health information systems already in place in about eighty percent of the hospitals in Taiwan required by the National Health Insurance Payment Program and the technical support of the RODS Laboratory at the University of Pittsburgh, Taiwan's ED-SSS has been in operation since March, 2004 [14] . It is the first time in Taiwan that information technology and timely data directly from hospitals has been used with systematic approaches to facilitate public health surveillance. This report shares our experience of establishing an ED-SSS in a non-English-speaking country. It covers the process of taking into account the various needs at different levels of hospitals, discusses the stages of developing the system, and highlights the characteristics of ED-SSS data collected during the first year. The experiences reported here may benefit other countries seeking to establish or improve their own surveillance systems for infectious disease.

Initially, two Taipei City Municipal Hospitals that kept electronic files of their emergency department patients' medical information were selected as pilot sites. From these two pilot hospitals, we had learned work flow involved in the process of data transfer, format of Chinese chief complaints, practical concern of ED (such as heavy workload etc.) during and after the 2003 outbreak of SARS, and available electronic ED information from nationwide emergency care hospitals. To obtain more representative data from various geographical areas, we gradually enlisted the cooperation of 189 hospitals nationwide, all offering emergency healthcare. Because many outbreaks of EIDs require emergency health care, these emergency care-designated hospitals were required transmit their ED triage and patient data to the Taiwan-CDC electronically on a daily basis ( Figure 1 ).

Nurses at the triage stations at all participating hospitals generated the bulk of the information needed for syndromic surveillance. That information included time and date of admission, date of birth, gender, home zip-code, body temperature, triage categories and chief complaints for patients admitted to their EDs. Because the National Health Insurance requires hospitals to keep clinical data written in ICD-9 codes based on the criteria of the international classification of diseases, 9th revision, clinical modification (ICD-9-CM) for billing purposes, we were also able to collect clinical data from initial assessment of each case by an ED physician. These fundamental data were provided in either the health level-seven protocol (HL-7) format or extensible Markup Language (XML) format, if HL-7 was not used by a hospital during the time of the study. Thus, ED-SSS is capable of accepting these data of above-mentioned variables (Table 1) , including the patients' clinical and demographical information, and hospital identification numbers, in either format.

All the sentinel hospitals recruited into our system had independent MySQL servers on which their data were saved, plus a remote connecting program for automatic transfer of data. Data files generated by the 189 hospitals, including data from their triage classification systems, hospital information systems (HIS) and clinical information systems (CIS), were firstly de-identified and then transferred hourly to a Microsoft SQL Server 2000 at the Taiwan-CDC. Hyper text transfer protocol over secured sockets layer (HTTPS) or secured file transfer protocol (SFTP) was used in this process. All communication histories were recorded in a log file in the SQL server at the Taiwan-CDC and monitored daily by health informatics personnel. A program was written into the system so that each transfer attempt to the Taiwan-CDC would automatically generate an e-mail to the hospital notifying them whether the transfer had been successful or not.

Three different data storage tables were designed to process the data in the Taiwan-CDC's syndromic surveillance database. All information received is initially fed into the first table, with a serial number generated in an additional column for each case. The system picks up the data from the first table every five minutes and moves it into a second temporary table for a logic check and data cleansing. At this point, the system checks for unambiguously erroneous data, e.g., a birth date later than the admission date or other variables such as body temperatures that fall outside of reasonable ranges. The data cleansing work is accomplished through a system algorithm written with SQL commands. The cleaned-up data are transferred to the third table for further epidemiological analysis, aberration detection, and then sent them to related local public health agencies.

Although only a few variables were collected from each hospital on consecutive days, one major difficulty we had was the data presented by discontinuous data, i.e. data that sometimes be there and sometimes not. Sometimes data were repeated. To handle this problem, specific criteria of data cleansing were used for different variables, including the logic checks described above and double checks for possible presence of duplicate patient records. If data in the chief complaint field was written as ""test"" or the field was left empty or if the ICD-9 field was written as ""test"" or left empty, they were deleted before data analysis. Hospital ID, date of birth, admission time, gender, and home zip-code were used as key indicators of whether a listing is a duplicate listing and be deleted as repeated data. The system was capable of performing frequent and rapid checks of any subject of hospital identification code and time format of all time fields. It was capable of moving erroneous data to an ""error table"" for storage. Incorrectly formatted ICD-9-CM data were also moved to the error table. All deletion and removal operations were recorded in the log file for monitoring. In certain situa-tions in case possible systematic errors were found (i.e., aberrant number of ED visits on certain days or occasionally inconsistent formats of ICD-9 codes), the data examiner would contact the medical informatics officers of those specific hospitals to discuss improving data entry.

After the data cleansing, we categorized ED visits into 11 different syndromic groups important in Taiwan. There were: (1) fever, (2) respiratory, (3) skin, (4) neurological, (5) upper gastrointestinal (GI), (6) lower GI, (7) haemorrhagic, (8) influenza-like illness (ILI), (9) asthma, (10) enterovirus-related infection (EVI) syndrome, and (11) syndrome for severe illness or death. Since only about 25% of all chief complaints were written fully in English and the grouping of syndromes by chief-complaints due to Chinese language barriers would have effects on the outbreak detection ability, we first analyzed our data according to the ICD-9 coded syndrome groups [15] . Definitions of clinical syndromes were based on two different sources: (1) those associated with bioterrorism-related agents as announced by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the U.S.; and (2) those identified as important by the ED-SSS Advisory Committee in Taiwan, whose members include infectious disease physicians, emergency doctors, pediatricians, and epidemiologists [16] . For example, because the epidemics of enterovirus 71 caused severe fatal cases in Taiwan in the years of 1998, 2000 and 2001, the EVI syndrome group was considered as an important syndrome group locally (ICD-9 codes listed in Table 2 ) [17] . All patient information was de-identified and only aggregated data was used for data analysis. The protocol for this study was approved by the Research Ethical Committee (Institutional Review Board) of National Taiwan University. 20 Coxsackie carditis, unspecified 074. 21 Coxsackie pericarditis 074. 22 Coxsackie endocarditis 074. 23 Coxsackie myocarditis, Aseptic myocarditis of newborn 074. 3 Hand, foot, and mouth disease Vesicular stomatitis and exanthem 074. 8 Other specified diseases due to Coxsackie virus, Acute lymphonodular pharyngitis Although the ED-SSS data started transferring on March 10, 2004, we confined our analysis to data collected between April 1, 2004 (when the data became more stabilized) and March 31, 2005 . Data were organized using statistical programs to perform a descriptive analysis of the daily and weekly plots of different syndrome cases and obtain a baseline pattern for each syndrome in Taiwan. We initially generated the SQL commands for data querying and data grouping into the 11 different syndromic groups. To increase the sensitivity of this ED-SSS in monitoring regional patterns of these 11 syndrome groups, we categorized ED-SSS data by four different geographical areas (northern, central, southern and eastern Taiwan), based on major regional variations in the types of infec-tious diseases. In analyzing the seasonal patterns of ED visits, the correlation between the ILI syndrome and respiratory or asthma syndrome was assessed by the value of Pearson's coefficient (R). the Taiwan-CDC on a daily basis. The greatest challenge as began to develop this system was communication with different hospitals. Because different hospitals were using different information systems and inputting different data with various formats, it took long time to agree which variables and their data format should be collected. At the very beginning to build the ED-SSS, we had at first intended to collect information on a large set of epidemiologically useful variables, including occupation, travel history, family clustering, other exposure-related factors, and address for each patient to help detect possible zoonosis. However, such data were not collected during routine medical examination and care. Finally, we decided to capture only parameters usually collected by the hospitals during examination, intake and care.

During the planning phase, it was necessary to gain a full understanding of what not only just public health personnel expected but also what the medical staff at participating hospitals expected from the ED-SSS. Public health officials tended to prefer a timely and sensitive surveillance system able to detect all possible outbreaks of emerging or known infectious diseases. Mostly concerned over the limited public health resources, they wanted more evidence to prove the cost-effectiveness of ED-SSS and fewer false positive signals from pilot studies before integrating the system into routine public health surveillance workflow. On the other hand, the hospitals and their medical staff had three major expectations. First, the hospitals expected an easily operated feedback mechanism and quick feedback of useful information for better decision-making. Those who had experienced nosocomial infection of SARS during the 2003 SARS outbreak were particularly interested having analyzed information, based on their own hospital or regional/national hospital data, quickly fed back them. They believed that this would provide incentive for them to share hospital data and routinely maintain the high quality of their data for public health usage. Second, the hospitals anticipated two-way communication with public health agencies, as they frequently been requested or even forced to send data on short notice when they were too busy or too involved in emergency care. What made matters worse, despite their compliance; they had difficulty in obtaining useful feedback information from the public health agencies so that they could improve their care of patients at the time of an outbreak crisis. Third, the hospital decision-makers wanted immediate firsthand feedback, particularly with regard to control of nosocomial infection and hospital management in order that their health-care workers could be protected during regional outbreaks. Considering the expectations of both public health agencies and hospitals, we learned that the syndromic surveillance system should provide efficient means of feedback and effective two-way communication.

From April 1, 2004 to March 31, 2005 , data transmitted from the 189 hospitals on 2,692,325 ED visits were collected and stored in the Taiwan-CDC database. Initially, we appointed two computer engineers to cleanse the data by checking the log files and inform the hospitals by telephone on weekdays to correct errors or provide missing data. Then, these cleaned data on daily counts of ED visits collected from ED-SSS were analyzed. The time series plot of rough data on daily numbers of ED visits in our nationwide ED-SSS during the study period is shown in Figure 3 .

The computer system shut down twice during this period. The first time occurred from August 8 th to August 9 th , when no daily procedure was installed to monitor the quality of uploaded data. To help both hospitals and public health agencies perform routine data quality checks, we installed a computer program having check-up procedures of data quality after each data transfer from the hospital to the Taiwan-CDC for automatic quality control of data. This program records all the logs of each data sending from the participated hospitals. If Taiwan-CDC doesn't receive data from hospitals, program will send e-mail automatically to inform the personnel of health informatics in that hospital about failure sending. System maintenance personnel need to check the log daily and make a phone call to the hospital to verify successful data transfer and quality of data if there are no data transfers in two consecutive days.

Only 5.04% of hospitals failed to send ICD-9-CM data, but almost half (47.4%) failed to send chief complaints. For example, of the 239,617 sets of cleaned data received in July 2005, about 7.1% of ICD-9-CM information was lacking or filled out as 'null' and 54.82% of cases did not include chief complaints. Additionally, certain hospitals transmitted the patients' chief complaints in Chinese, further complicating the analysis. Because of these difficulties, this report focuses on the data based on ICD-9-CM diagnostic codes only. The time-series plots of the 11 syndrome groups (Figure 4 , 5) that may correlate to infectious diseases and important health problems in Taiwan (e.g., asthma has become an important pediatric problem in recent years) were analyzed.

Understanding the characteristics and patterns of numbers of ED visits over time from our established ED-SSS in Taiwan is very crucial before we set up appropriate threshold levels of different syndrome groups for outbreak detection, There was a significant difference in daily counts between weekdays and weekends, which occurred on a weekly basis. ED visits were 1.288-fold-higher on weekends than on weekdays (p < 0.001), while national During this first year study, the ED-SSS found patients throughout Taiwan were more likely to seek emergency medical services at medical centers than at district or local hospitals. Most patients visiting ED were 60 years old or older (21.46%) or below the age of 10 years old (18.55%). These two groups were also at greatest risk for various infectious diseases, especially influenza (Table 3) . Young adults between 20 to 39 years old ranked the third most frequent visitors to ED (17.43%), though traffic accidents, not infectious diseases, were the main reasons for their visits. These age distributions suggest that the newly established ED-SSS was capable of providing information for the age groups most at risk for severe cases of infectious diseases in Taiwan. Male ED patients slightly outnumbered female ED patients (male : female = 1.12:1), which approximates the general distribution of gender in Taiwan (male/female ratio = 1.10). For elderly ED patients (age > 65 years old), the male/female ratio in our sample was the same as general population (male: female = 1.10:1).

To understand the epidemiological characteristics of the eleven important syndrome groups and asthma syndrome in ED-SSS, data of their daily and weekly counts were plotted and shown in Figure 4 and 5, respectively. As can been seen in time series plots in Figure 6 , the seasonal patterns for ED visits due to respiratory syndrome and ILI syndrome were quite similar with high correlation (R = 0.98), while that for asthma syndrome, which had distinct peaks, was nonetheless not highly correlated with ILI syndrome (R = 0.78) nor respiratory syndrome (R = 0.77). Importantly, the ED-SSS was able to detect peaks of these respiratory-related syndromes even occurred in or around the summer season (July to September), though their most noticeable peaks were found during the Chinese new year holidays ( Figure 5B, 5C, 5D ). Like respiratory infection syndrome, visits due to the fever syndrome also showed another peak during the summer (July to September) ( Figure 4A ). ED visits for respiratory syndrome peaked earlier (mid-September) than those visits for ILI (mid-October) and asthma syndrome (end of September, e.g. the transition period between summer and autumn). Visits for pediatric asthma syndrome for children 12 years old and below peaked in mid-autumn, around mid-October (data not shown). Later during winter season (between November and February), there was an increase 

Respiratory Syndrom Asthma Visits In gastrointestinal (GI) syndromes, visits due to upper GI or lower GI or total GI started increasing November 2004 and peaked during the Chinese New Year holidays ( Figure  4F, 4G, 4H) . Interestingly, cases of hemorrhagic syndrome also increased slightly in the winter season ( Figure 4I ).

For those syndrome groups with severe symptoms, including skin rash, neurological symptoms and death/ coma that might be related to bioterrorism attacks, there was no significantly cyclic or seasonal patterns ( Figure 4J , 4K and 4L). One spike of syndrome cases with clinical severity (severe syndrome) appeared in mid-May, but that occurred as a result of one hospital sending duplicate data that escaped from our check algorithm ( Figure 4L ).

Taiwan has very high population density (Taiwan, 632.23 persons/km 2 ; Taipei, 9662.53 persons/km 2 ), which increases the spread of many human-to-human infectious diseases [19] . This makes the surveillance of infectious diseases very important for this island. Taiwan's ED-SSS is the first syndromic surveillance system to be implemented in Asia. It also represents the first time that Taiwan's public health agencies have attempted active nationwide surveillance. Its automatic data collection mechanism is capable of capturing comprehensive population-based health information and providing important details on current disease epidemics at the community level. The information it provides can also be used as community baseline data for further infectious disease modeling and can also improve the detection of emerging infectious diseases.

In addition to the information that the ED-SSS can provide for disease control, it can open avenues for further investigation. For example, in addition to the neurological syndrome, asthma syndrome, and syndrome for severe symptoms, there were clear and consistent weekend and holiday increases in the visits of other nine syndrome groups. Because cost of ED visits in Taiwan is not as expensive as it is in other countries, especially the United States, it is very likely that many patients seek ED medical care when local clinics are closed on weekends and holidays. It is also possible that the gathering of people on the holidays would increase the transmission of certain pathogens, particularly on cold days in closed spaces where respiratory viruses including influenza virus are easily transmitted. Therefore, future research might want to investigate the effect of holidays on the aberration detection of outbreaks and prediction of number of cases for certain infectious diseases using Taiwan's ED-SSS.

We also found differences in seasonal trends in visits due to symptoms/signs related to respiratory, influenza-like illness and asthma syndromes. Our ED-SSS found a sum-mer peak in visits for cases with influenza-like illnesses in 2004. This has seldom been found by the previous passive surveillance systems used in Taiwan. These summer cases of influenza-like illness occurred before annual vaccinations usually done in October or November. Therefore, a further longitudinal analysis of influenza-like syndrome patterns is needed to formulate the best vaccination policy on human influenza.

Another epidemiological finding from our ED-SSS was an increasing trend in visits due to gastrointestinal syndrome starting late autumn 2004. Such trends have not been detected by other infectious disease surveillance systems in Taiwan. There are two possible explanations for this finding. One reason for the increases might be related to the increased activity of certain pathogens, including rotavirus or norovirus, during winter season, as was found during the winter of 2006 in both Japan and Taiwan [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] . Another reason might be the social habits of Taiwanese who like to dip raw meats and seafood into boiling water fondues and eat from the chafing pot during the winter season. This would increase the change that inexperienced or careless diners would consume undercook seafood or use chopsticks contaminated by raw seafood.

The findings of our ED-SSS, the first time in Taiwan to use daily rather than weekly data, suggest further directions for research into GI syndrome and many other diseases of significant interest to public health. For example, during the 1998, 2000 and 2001 enterovirus 71 epidemics, children aged 3 years and younger who were at higher risk of severe or fatal cases of the disease were identified for more effective prevention only after the occurrence of several cases of sudden deaths from weekly sentinel physician surveillance and later retrospective epidemiological data analysis on those cases when sample size became larger. Therefore, prospective monitoring of daily ongoing data of EVI syndrome in this high risk age group and early ED-SSS detection of enterovirus activities by local public health personnel might help minimize social panic among parents. Furthermore, the results on seasonal pattern of enterovirus-like infection in our ED-SSS was consistent with the previous epidemic patterns in Taiwan, again demonstrating the usefulness of ED-SSS to avoid future large-scale or severe epidemics caused by enteroviruses [18] . In summary, these initial findings suggest that it is necessary to develop algorithms capable of detecting aberrations for different syndrome groups from patients in different geographical areas of Taiwan, taking into account variations in the levels of medical care and the effect of weekends and holidays on ER visit.

The ED-SSS did not, however, reveal obvious trends in all syndrome groups. For example, it was hard to find seasonal patterns or secular trends in cases of coma/death, skin rash, or neurological symptoms -the three syndrome groups that might be useful in the detection of severe outbreaks caused by bioterrorism, e.g., anthrax, during the study period without bioterrorism attacks [28, 29] . Certainly, continuous monitoring for these syndrome groups at both local and national levels will be very helpful in detecting possible bioterrorism or EIDs in future years. Using those trends in coma/death and other syndrome groups of clinical severity or unexpected symptoms/signs, our ED-SSS data have provided directions for further research in the areas of pathogen detection, epidemiological clues, and improvement in public health policies. Therefore, future investigations have to control the weekend and holiday effects of ED visits for better aberration detection even during long holidays.

In daily public health practice to monitor the data of ED-SSS, careful verification and systematic management is needed once the aberration signals are detected. The server needs an automatic error feedback system function instead of the original use of engineers to double check for data errors would increase the efficiency and completeness of surveillance. Future efforts require closer collaboration between computer-science professionals and medical informatics personnel at the Taiwan-CDC to establish a system with the standard operating procedures (SOP) for database maintenance and to provide more continuous on-job training for both hospital users and local and central public health agencies [30] .

The major difficulty in developing our ED-SSS was diverse formats for different types of data, including categories of chief complaints, the ways to fill out ICD-9-CM codes, and even the different number of digits used in home zip codes in different participated hospitals. For example, most Taiwan hospital ED physicians/nurses EDs only write down one chief complaint, which is very different from the ED reports made by most U.S. hospitals which list all possible complaints (with text format) in English. Several participating hospitals only had a paper system for recording triage chief complaint data. A standard format for select syndromes and variables needs to be established and continuously reevaluated to improve data quality and stability of data transmission. There are needs to have more research into the chief complaints with Chinese styles, the suitability of chief complaints vs. ICD-9 codes, how to combine symptoms/signs and link data to improve sensitivity.

With regard to the current epidemics of avian influenza H5N1 in China and many other southeast Asian countries, an ED-SSS like the one we developed in Taiwan may play an important role in detecting an outbreak possibly caused by human-to-human transmission even when cluster size is small [31] [32] [33] [34] . Through early detection, ED-SSS may help minimize the adaptation of avian influenza virus to human populations. Because of the large volume of business traffic, international travelers, and workers from Southeast Asia coming to Taiwan, it has previously been difficult to do real-time surveillance for imported infectious diseases, including dengue, malaria, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and SARS. However, using the ED-SSS to monitor health status at the community level may help public health decision-makers handle unexpected health threats. Because countries are so interconnected today, it is imperative that we share our health information and experiences with other countries if international health is to be guarded. Our ED-SSS has equipped Taiwan the ability to closely monitor avian influenza and other potential EIDs in Asia and worldwide. We hope that by sharing our experiences developing ED-SSS, other countries can be encouraged to develop and improve their own surveillance systems for infectious disease.

Steps to a Sustainable Public Health Surveillance Enterprise Steps to a Sustainable Public Health Surveillance Enterprise A Commentary from the International Society for Disease Surveillance Steps to a Sustainable Public Health Surveillance Enterprise OJPHI,"At a time when populations are changing and disease outbreaks and other events of public health significance pose increasing risks to global health, economic stability, and national security, it is essential that, as a nation, we invest in the systems needed to promote and protect the public's health.","Online Journal of Public Health Informatics * ISSN 1947-2579 * http://ojphi.org * Vol. 5 

In 2002, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) reported that the public health system in the United States had a multitude of deficiencies that impact the ability to effectively conduct public health surveillance. These included outdated and vulnerable technologies; a public health workforce lacking training and reinforcements; lack of real-time surveillance and epidemiological systems; and ineffective and fragmented communications networks. 1 While considerable headway has been made since the IOM report was published, there is still evidence of a need for further improvements. A recent report by Trust for America's Health, for example, found that there are persistent gaps in the ability of state and local public health agencies to respond to events ranging from bioterrorist threats to natural disasters and disease outbreaks. 2 The question is-how can we reduce these gaps? Nationwide and globally, rapid changes in health information systems, cloud computing technologies, communications, and global connections are catalyzing a re-examination of disease surveillance as an enterprise that needs coordinated and integrated system elements. Sustainable surveillance, which we define as ongoing data collection, analysis, and application, coupled with a capability to respond to novel demands, is needed to ensure that public health agencies can perform reliably regardless of shifts in public health funding and priorities. The ISDS Sustainable Surveillance Workgroup identified the following steps to maintain and advance the public health surveillance enterprise:

1. Recognize systematic and ongoing public health surveillance as a core public health function that is essential for population health, economic stability, and national security. 2. Create and support funding mechanisms that reinforce enterprise (i.e., integrated systems), rather than categorical (i.e., disease or program specific) surveillance infrastructures and activities in order to reduce inefficient silos, leverage resources, and foster synergies. 3. Oppose further cuts to spending for surveillance activities. 4. Invest in surveillance workforce development to build competencies and improve organizational capacity to utilize technological advances in surveillance practice. 5. Advance a rigorous surveillance research and evaluation agenda that will deepen the understanding of community health, identify best practices, and provide evidence for decision-making. 

Public health surveillance is defined as, ""the systematic and ongoing collection, management, analysis, interpretation, and dissemination of information for the purpose of informing the actions of public health decision makers."" 3 In addition to providing information about the health status of our communities, surveillance is a foundation of emergency preparedness, food safety, infectious disease outbreak prevention and control, chronic disease assessments, and other key areas that protect the health, economy, and security of the public. While public health surveillance policy and practice have been indicated as priorities for policymakers at the national and global levels, [4] [5] [6] [7] questions remain about how to move forward from planning to implementation, especially in a time of critical cuts to federal funding.

Progress in health information technology (IT) and the increased use of electronic data and new data streams offer great potential for innovation in surveillance science and practice. For instance, the self-reporting of health information through social media (e.g., Twitter), as well as crowdsourcing projects such as Flu Near You (www.flunearyou.org) offer new options for collecting timely data. In addition, the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act, 8 legislated as part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) of 2009, is fueling the adoption of electronic health record (EHR) systems in the U.S. 9 In return for financial subsidies to implement EHR systems, hospitals and doctors are required to share data for public health purposes 9 with the intent to improve both population health outcomes and the quality of clinical practice. Sustainable surveillance systems have the potential to advance both of these goals. 10

The value of public health surveillance 1. Recognize systematic and ongoing public health surveillance as a core public health function that is essential for population health, economic stability, and national security.

Public health surveillance data is the foundation of public health programs and is required for a number of purposes, including: to demonstrate the size and impact of the public health problem being addressed by a program; to identify the population groups to which additional prevention efforts should be directed; to determine whether the problem is growing in size or abating; to provide feedback to data providers; and as part of an overall program evaluation strategy.

The significant health impacts and economic costs of disease outbreaks illustrate the critical importance of effective public health surveillance and rapid response, as well as the cost of inaction. 11 Table 1 provides examples of the health and financial burdens posed by some naturally occurring and intentional infectious disease outbreaks. The values reported in Table 1 do not fully reflect additional indirect costs of diseases and their potentially crippling effects on a community, nor do they address costs that are underreported/ unreported due to lack of data. Higher rates of illness, for example, can lead to lower worker productivity, 11 while premature mortality can reduce the size of the labor force, both of which have economic ramifications.

There is growing evidence that these economic and societal costs can be mitigated by surveillance systems that are stable; a stable system provides the best foundation for identifying whether the problem being addressed is getting bigger or smaller or disproportionately affecting a section of the population, etc., while still allowing flexibility to provide useful information quickly about emerging issues. The optimum mix of stability and flexibility will depend on the purpose(s) of surveillance and the particular health condition under surveillance. For example, in OJPHI the case of SARS, an effective surveillance system has the potential to decrease the size of an epidemic by one-third and the duration by 4 weeks, with significant cost savings. 25 Another study found that the early detection of an outbreak of highly infectious bacterial meningitis saved approximately $2 for every dollar invested in infectious disease surveillance. 26 Yet another evaluation of surveillance practice found that technological improvements in a sentinel influenza-like illness (ILI) surveillance system in Virginia saved over $9,500 (1,992 hours) in staff-time during the 2007-2008 influenza seasons. 27 Ongoing surveillance can also inform the design and evaluation of prevention and intervention programs in order to control the escalating costs associated with chronic diseases in the U.S. and abroad. 28 Some experts forecast that chronic disease prevention programs could save up to $48.9 billion per year by 2030, 29 while others predict applying electronic medical record implementation and networking to the prevention and management of chronic disease will exceed the currently projected $81 billion in annual savings. 30

Siloed surveillance systems are outdated, inefficient, and incapable of meeting today's demands for electronic data exchange and for the informatics capabilities needed to use the information for maximum benefit. Integrated programs and collaboration, on the other hand, facilitate the efficient management of the complex, varied, and proliferating issues and information sources that exist today. The nature of public health surveillance also lends itself to multiple-purpose approaches in that strategies for preventing and controlling diseases, such as West Nile virus, are to a great extent the same as for an influenza epidemic, a foodborne disease outbreak, or a bioterrorist attack. 31 Technology that enhances communication and data sharing across disease programs, surveillance systems, and even across jurisdictions increases the ease of obtaining and disseminating useful information to a broad audience, including public health agencies, healthcare providers, policymakers, and the general public. 6, 32 This rapid information exchange not only facilitates timely response, but can also reduce emergency room visits, hospital admissions, and even costs of care. 33 However, many health departments currently have systems that are not flexible enough to respond to changing health IT needs, which makes it difficult to deliver information when and where it is needed. 4 Disease or program-specific funding also exacerbates program vulnerability to funding and budgetary cuts. For example, when funding is earmarked for specific purposes (e.g., emergency preparedness and associated surveillance systems), and then is reduced, such as has occurred for public health emergency preparedness cooperative agreement funding through CDC in the past seven years, 34 it can undermine and reverse efforts to establish sustainable systems that serve multiple crosscutting purposes throughout public health. 

By contrast, an enterprise approach provides a cohesive framework that will better equip public health practitioners to address the challenges of processing large volumes of electronic data, and the concomitant analytical and visualization requirements. Specifically, enterprise funding supports a reliable, flexible infrastructure that can adapt to technological and information requirement changes, and allows for ongoing data collection and the integration of new data sources to advance all-hazard preparedness. A 2004 White House memo acknowledged how programmatic funding can lead to inefficiencies and redundancies in system acquisitions and usage and called for applying technological and human resources across programs. 35 By encouraging collaboration within and between departments, surveillance professionals can take advantage of shared platforms and resources to optimize data collection, analysis, storage, and dissemination, thus helping to reduce operational costs and improve efficiency. For example, collaboration could create opportunities for the effective integration of syndromic and reportable disease data for public health use. 36

A lack of consistent and sustainable funding is hampering the necessary expansion and improvement of public health surveillance systems at local, state, and national public health agencies. A 2010 survey of local health departments conducted by the National Association of City and County Health Officials (NACCHO) found that 72% of local health departments reported insufficient funding as one of their major barriers to modernizing their IT systems. 37 Health data collection systems that take advantage of recent technological advances have proven to be more cost effective and sustainable in the long-term. 38 Stable funding is essential to supporting the adoption of hardware and software systems as they become available, leading to a robust and sustainable public health surveillance infrastructure able to integrate, manage, and communicate the plethora of data necessary to generate actionable results. 39

The new age of disease surveillance requires a skilled public health workforce able to manage large volumes of increasingly complex electronic information, to understand the data flows, and to extract meaning from them. This calls for sophisticated and integrated competencies in public health informatics, epidemiology, statistics, and other areas, and the ability to present findings, draw conclusions, and make recommendations based on surveillance data. Furthermore, in addition to needing people who can effectively operate existing surveillance systems and carry out tasks (such as the onboarding process for collecting newly available EHR data) there is also demand for people who can identify and assess new opportunities for surveillance and design new systems that take advantage of these opportunities. 6 Online Journal of Public Health Informatics * ISSN 1947-2579 * http://ojphi.org * Vol. 5, No. 2, 2013

Attracting and retaining experts in these fields is especially challenging in light of the comparatively low base salaries allotted to public health workers compared to the salaries of technology-intensive positions in other sectors. 40 To align the surveillance workforce with new demands, the ISDS Sustainable Surveillance Workgroup suggests the following approaches:

• Provide training programs for existing and prospective public health workers to equip themselves with the necessary expertise and skills to work in rapidly evolving IT systems. • Promote public health careers at the primary, secondary, undergraduate, and graduate levels across disciplines. • Provide competitive salaries to recruit and retain a workforce skilled in public health surveillance and informatics.

5. Advance a rigorous research and evaluation agenda that will deepen the understanding of community health, identify best practices, and provide evidence to inform decision-making.

Research and evaluation play an important role in connecting the processes of information collection, information use for decision-making, and translation of decisions to actions and measurable outcomes. Research-based evidence and evaluation results can help to identify the limitations and benefits of different surveillance procedures for better decision-making and more effective resource allocation. Investing in research and applying the rigors of science to public health surveillance questions leads to informed decisions on how best to direct efforts and resources.

In addition, periodic evaluations of surveillance infrastructuresthe systems and people-are needed to assess return on investment and opportunities for quality improvement.

Effective and efficient surveillance systems are proven to save money and lives. The ability to detect and respond to known and emerging pathogens is central to protecting and maintaining population health. 41 The breakdown or absence of a stable public health surveillance infrastructure, on the other hand, can undermine efforts to mitigate disease outbreaks and other public health events. 31 Public health surveillance systems built on a strong infrastructure of core workforce competencies, information systems, and organizational capacity, 42 and supported by consistent and enterprise-based funding, are essential if we are to understand and respond to the real and growing threats to population health. By providing political commitment and financial support to this issue, decision makers can play an active role in advancing the health of individuals, communities, and nations.

Pandemic planning in pediatric care: A website policy review and national survey data,"Objectives: This study investigates current policies, key issues, and needs for pandemic planning in pediatrics in Canada. Methods: Online pandemic plans from national, provincial and territorial government websites were reviewed to identify: plans for children and families, and psychosocial and ethical issues. A survey was administered to gather participants' perspectives on the needs in pediatric planning, as well as important elements of their organizations' and regions' pandemic plans. A thematic analysis was conducted on qualitative survey responses. Results: The majority of existing plans did not adequately address the unique needs of pediatric populations, and mainly focused on medical and policy concerns. Several gaps in plans were identified, including the need for psychosocial supports and ethical decision-making frameworks for children and families. Similarly, survey respondents identified parallel gaps, in their organization's or region's plans. Conclusions: Although many plans provide guidelines for medical and policy issues in pediatrics, much more work remains in psychosocial and ethical planning. A focus on children and families is needed for pandemic planning in pediatrics to ensure best outcomes for children and families.","The impact of pandemic H1N1 (2009) has raised public awareness of the threat of a severe influenza outbreak, as the Public Health Agency of Canada, provincial, and territorial bodies continue to bolster their contingency plans. In 2003, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) revealed gaps in Ontario's emergency response capability, and highlighted the need to prepare for future epidemics. The effects of this outbreak resulted in a total of 251 probable cases and 43 deaths in Canada [1] . SARS heavily impacted the health care system in Ontario and in affected areas across the globe. Recent memories of this outbreak, coupled with the threat of pandemic H1N1 (2009) warn of the impacts of a major outbreak in Canada. Accordingly, planning has become a pressing issue for stakeholders in government, industry and community. While the exact timing, pattern and impact of a future pandemic is unknown [2, 3] , in Canada an influenza pandemic could result in as many as 10.6 million people (35%) who become clinically ill, 138,000 (0.5%) who require hospitalization, and up to 58,000 deaths (0.2%) [4] . Such concerns have become a high profile public health issue, and fears of a potential global pandemic continue to grow. Governments, policy makers, and health care providers (HCP), are planning for future pandemics, in part, based upon the lessons learned from SARS. Health Canada [5] has identified gaps in the response to SARS that should influence current policies and planning. For example, there is still a need to address ethical concerns during a pandemic, for instance, governments may be required to infringe upon civil liberties to ensure infection control, and policy makers need to establish frameworks for decisionmaking to allocate scarce health care resources [6] . A lack of coordination and communication, the poor management of resources, and the absence of a clear leadership structure within organizations and government also had a detrimental effect on the effort to control the SARS outbreak [6] [7] [8] .

Outside of Canada, critical gaps have been identified in European Union (EU) plans. These concerns include a lack of cooperation among EU countries and poorly delineated roles and responsibilities of central and regional health authorities. In addition, gaps exist in preparation for the impact on health care systems, the maintenance of essential services, and public health interventions to curb the spread of an epidemic [9] . Similar issues have been highlighted by researchers and planners world wide [10, 11] . Recently, pandemic H1N1 (2009) has reignited these concerns about preparedness.

In an effort to learn from SARS and to prepare for a future pandemic, the Government of Canada has released the ""Canadian Pandemic Influenza Plan for the Health Sector"" [4] . Similarly, the majority of provincial and territorial governments have also released their regional plans [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] (see Table 1 for selected features of pandemic plans in various jurisdictions). These documents guide health planning and responses at provincial and local levels. Government plans cover topics ranging from influenza surveillance, to the distribution of antiviral supplies, to communication and information dissemination. Although these plans are designed to protect all Canadian citizens, there continues to be a lack of dialogue or guidance to address the specialized needs of a pediatric population. Children may require specialized supplies, medications, and treatment. They also require additional supervision and family support [27] . Additionally, pandemic planning for children and families is often addressed locally, with little coordination among the various levels of planning [28] . This continued neglect of pediatrics, both by policy makers and researchers in pandemic planning, is problematic, as difficulties associated with psychosocial concerns or ethical decision-making are magnified for HCP, children and families [29] . In this paper, we present both provincial and territorial policy statements as they relate to pediatrics based on a website review of plans. We also present the qualitative results from a survey administered to pediatric pandemic planning practitioners and policy makers. The goal of the project is to assess the comprehensiveness of existing pandemic plans in Canada and to identify what professionals identified as important and needed in pediatric plans. 

There is little dialogue about ethical concerns in pandemic planning for pediatrics. As such, the literature about ethics in pandemic planning focuses primarily on adult care [30] [31] [32] . Thompson and colleagues have identified general values to guide care and policy for pandemic planning. These values include: the duty to provide care, equity, individual liberty, privacy, proportionality, protection of the public from harm, reciprocity, solidarity, stewardship, and trust [30] . Although these values are central to ethical planning and decision-making, many may be interpreted differently in pediatrics. For example, individual liberty does not apply to children in the same way as adults. Compared to adults, children lack autonomy and parents must advocate and make health care decisions on their child's behalf. Due to the lack of literature on this topic, policy makers must individually interpret the ethical issues in pediatric care. As such, policy makers who strive to maintain ethical care in pediatrics should be guided by ethical values, and stay aware of the needs of children and families. In this paper, participants identify situations where such ethical policy making must be implemented.

In this paper, we present a website review of provincial and territorial pandemic plans with respect to pediatric policies. Additionally, we present the qualitative results from a national survey on pandemic planning.

Websites of all Canadian provinces and territories, and the Public Health Agency of Canada were reviewed to identify online and publicly available pandemic plans. Each website was surveyed to identify the availability of a pandemic plan. Subsequently, these plans were reviewed to assess their comprehensiveness and to identify unique plans for children and families, and psychosocial and ethical issues. The review was completed in June 2009 by a reviewer with a background in health policy. The reviewer used content analysis to record all references to pediatrics in a database. To verify this information, the plans were read by a second reviewer, and a search function was used to ensure that available pediatric plan information was included in the review.

The web-based survey included open-ended questions that asked participants' opinions on the processes of planning, comprehensiveness and essential elements of pandemic plans in their organization or region.

The survey was hosted by Survey Monkey (http://www. surveymonkey.com/), an online application that administers questionnaires to participants. This method was chosen to increase the response rate from participants across Canada, particularly in more remote regions. An email with a link to the online survey was sent to potential participants between May and June 2008. Participants received a reminder email at 1 and 3 months after the initial request. The survey was available online in English and French.

Survey participants included individuals with expertise in pediatric care and pandemic planning, including: (1) members of national, provincial and territorial pandemic influenza committees; (2) professionals working in infection control and pandemic planning; and (3) professionals working with children, youth and families in crisis. The participants were recruited using snowball sampling.

Email invitations to complete the survey were sent to 1964 individuals, with n = 290 participants, with a response rate of 14.8%. Given this low response rate, the survey data presented is not intended to be representative. The demographic data, however, show that there are participants from all areas of pediatric care and pandemic planning. In addition, respondents from all provinces and territories participated in the survey (see Table 1 ). As such, the data identifies issues that are salient for participants who are interested and involved in the area, which may be important to consider in pandemic planning for children and families.

Open-ended survey responses were analyzed using qualitative data analysis software. A thematic analysis was conducted for each survey question using open coding. Qualitative rigor was ensured through the use of referential adequacy, negative case analysis, and peer debriefing.

Government decision-makers have learned from SARS, using this knowledge to plan for future pandemics, evidenced by the release of detailed pandemic plans. Largely, however, the application of this knowledge to pediatrics has been lacking. Specific references to pediatrics are seen in a minority of pandemic plans [4, 13, 22] , but a greater focus on pediatrics has been noted in some recently released plans [12, 15] . Some plans do not acknowledge pediatrics as a need [18, 21, 26] , while other plans suggest that the needs of this vulnerable population are being planned for, yet they do not articulate many concrete strategies to accomplish this task [16, 17, 19, [23] [24] [25] . This omission of pediatric care in pandemic plans continues despite concerns of a potential outbreak, and the responsibility of governments to coordinate a pandemic influenza response for Canadian children and families (see Table 2 ).

Governments with pandemic plans that address needs in pediatrics have solid contingency plans for medical and policy issues, but less so for psychosocial and ethical issues. Medical components of plans focus on key issues such as: pediatric specific medical supplies; stockpiling of antivirals and vaccines; and differences in symptoms, triage, treatment and isolation [4, [12] [13] [14] 23] .

Policy issues included in current plans address needs for coordination with other agencies as well as the public. These issues are often coupled with guidelines on school closures [4, [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] 19, [22] [23] [24] [25] , and only Ontario's plan addresses child care provisions for HCP [22] .

Chiefly, psychosocial and ethical concerns focus on communication [4, [12] [13] [14] 22] ; potential stressors for children and families [4, [12] [13] [14] [15] 17, 22, 24] ; grief and bereavement counselling [4, 13, 22] ; and family centred care [22] . Nevertheless, even these more thorough plans lack consideration of certain psychosocial and ethical issues, for example, 'how will decisions be made regarding children whose parents are unable to consent due to treatment?'. And 'how will children and families cope with these stressful events?'. Many such concerns, relevant to pediatric patients, families and HCP, are not documented in pediatric pandemic plans.

Notably, the above mentioned plans all contain a pediatric specific focus; in contrast, a majority of plans do not thoroughly consider these issues and tend to focus on medical and policy matters in pediatrics [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] 23, 24, 26] . As a • Notes that pediatric specific supplies will be needed • Agencies must ""determine support needed for orphaned children and the need for grieving and counselling services"" • Mentions different needs of children in terms of vaccinations, isolation, treatment • Importance of supporting staff ""through critical incident debriefing, grief counselling, child care support, etc."" • Children's/Pediatric Unit is one area in which the demand may increase markedly and continuing operation is crucial-health authority and facilities should consider these areas and determine which are critical to keep them operational result, many provinces may be under prepared to deal with the increased demand for pediatric services, especially the need for psychosocial and ethical supports. Although many plans note differences in symptoms or treatment of children, and the need for school closures, still a number of these medical and policy needs are inadequately addressed and often psychosocial or ethical concerns are not touched upon at all. In fact, these issues present challenges often left unaddressed by government plans, resulting in a significant gap in pediatric pandemic planning.

Stakeholders in pediatric services and pandemic planning participated in this cross-Canada survey and sharing written responses to open-ended survey questions, providing their suggestions for pediatric pandemic planning. Participants identified four overarching themes about important needs in pediatric planning. Main themes include: essential elements to a pediatric pandemic plan; importance of children and families in planning; importance of communication; and accounting for missing or rudimentary plans.

Participants identified plan elements they thought were central to any organization's pediatric pandemic plan. They identified concerns from resource allocation to ethical decision-making, illustrating the complexity and heterogeneity of these issues.

Participants provided a wide range of elements they thought should be included in a pediatric pandemic plan. Many expressed the importance of child care measures during a pandemic. A variety of concerns pertaining to child care were identified, such as how to manage school and day care closures for working parents. By the same token, participants felt plans should provide support for HCP, in managing child care, family and job responsibilities, in addition to providing for occupational health concerns, including the psychosocial and physical well-being of HCP.

Moreover, participants felt that ensuring the availability of psychosocial supports for various stakeholders was also an essential plan element. They suggested that plans should make provisions to provide psychosocial supports for children, families, and HCP and their families.

Providing education and information were important to participants, to promote understanding and preparation during a pandemic. Similarly, they identified communication with stakeholder groups as essential in a pediatric pandemic plan.

Participants felt that policies should provide guidance in infection control in pediatrics. Coupled with these concerns, clinical guidelines were also identified as a central and complex issue in a pediatric pandemic plan. Participants saw the need for treatment guidelines specific to pediatric populations, including guidelines for assessment and treatment, for children with an infected or absent parent or guardian, and for prevention, such as vaccination protocols. Guidelines for the treatment of routine non-influenza health care cases were viewed as especially important to maintain care and to optimally treat the largest numbers of people. A participant stated, ""we must have specific pre-set criteria on questions such as: when to stop performing elective surgeries, when to stop performing marrow and organ transplants, etc.""

Resource allocation plans were a major concern, particularly for pediatric care, to ensure that resources are available for children and families during an outbreak. Participants noted that community supports are required for stakeholder groups, for example, child care and psychosocial supports for children with an ill parent or guardian.

Another key issue was coordinating plans to include home care for those who are infected if hospitals are over capacity.

A large portion of respondents also raised concerns about ethical decision-making during a pandemic, and the need for a framework for decision-making in pandemic plans. One respondent indicated the need for an ethical framework, specific to pediatrics:

Discussion/guidance [is needed] on ethical decisionmaking processes for the pediatric population. Are these different than they will be for the adult population? Will the philosophy of family centred care be impacted during a pandemic event?

In essence, participants identified a range of issues that must be considered in pediatric pandemic planning, in order to manage the heavy burden an outbreak will place on health care systems and resources (see Table 3 ).

Participants were asked to identify missing elements in their organization's pandemic plan, and many responded with similar issues as when questioned regarding the key elements of a pediatric plan. These missing elements include: child care plans; communication and information sharing; ethical guidelines; needs of HCP (psychosocial, medical, workforce); organizational coordination; pediatric focus; continued plan development; post-pandemic planning; psychosocial needs; and resource planning and allocation.

Participants were asked to identify if their organization actively involved children and families in pandemic planning. Those who responded affirmatively provided a range of strategies to incorporate the voices of children and families in plan development. Such strategies include input from: family advisory committees, community organizations, family representatives, and research findings. Consultation with children and families ranged from extensive involvement in planning, where a ""family representative was involved as a key stakeholder on the steering committee,"" to minimal, such as consulting research studies on pediatric needs.

Conversely, participants who responded that children and families were not involved in planning provided a variety of explanations regarding why this occurred. These explanations include: pediatrics are not within the organization's mandate, the organization has a small pediatric population, plans are in development, and planners and staff are also parents. The most common response has that staff and planners are also parents, and that they can apply this experience to plan development. As an example, a participant stated, [Children and families were] not [involved] to my knowledge, other than in the capacity that many of the people that have been involved in administrative or clinical care roles are also parents. They may have also been thinking in terms of being a parent.

Accordingly, based upon these survey responses, participants provided suggestions for, and noted barriers to, incorporating the voices of children and families in pandemic planning.

Participants provided information on preferred sources and methods of information dissemination during a pandemic. These sources include: business and industry, community organizations, government, HCP, professional organizations, the media, pandemic planning organizations, public health networks, schools and daycares.

Government was seen as a major source of information during a pandemic. One respondent suggested that, ""information on the flu would be put together by those responsible at the ministry of health.""

Methods of sharing information were varied, but largely web-based solutions were suggested by participants. Participants also identified media (e.g. television, radio, print) and interactive information sharing (e.g. town hall meetings) as key strategies.

Survey respondents belonging to organizations without, or lacking a well-developed plan, were asked to identify why their organization was wanting in the area of pediatric pandemic planning. Participants suggested that they were missing strong leadership in pediatrics and that this was a major factor contributing to a minimal or nonexistent plan. They felt that they had little guidance in what was required for pediatric pandemic planning. Participants also expressed that they did not have access to resources for plan development, resulting in a ""skeleton plan"" focused on the adult population. Lastly, not having adequate pediatric services or facilities within the organization or region contributed to the lack of a pediatric pandemic plan, as pediatrics was not a priority.

While most respondents advocated pediatric planning, some participants were doubtful about the need for specific plans. These dissenting participants suggested that there are no unique pediatric issues to be addressed and that general plans are sufficient for pediatric care. Other participants suggested that a pediatric plan was unnecessary because of a minimal focus on pediatrics, or due to a small pediatric population in their organization or region. The respondents who did not see the need for a specific plan provided responses such as, ""my belief is that it should not be a separate plan-I would need evidence or rationale why a separate pediatric pandemic plan is required."" On balance, the majority of respondents saw the need for a pediatric plan, but a substantial number of others did not see the implications or relevance of planning that is specific to children and families.

Participant responses indicate that pediatric pandemic planning is an important and salient issue across Canada. Based upon qualitative analyses of survey data, participants have provided important and useful feedback on the needs and essential elements in a pediatric pandemic plan, the importance of listening to children and families, the need for communication with stakeholder groups, and factors resulting in under-developed or missing plans. Unfortunately, however, not all recommendations from participants are currently being implemented in provincial and territorial plans. This is exemplified in the congruence between what respondents felt were essential plan elements and the elements they identified as missing from their organizational or regional plans. There are clear and notable gaps in pediatric planning, both in terms of elements reported as missing by participants in their organizations' or regions' pandemic plans and in the parallel gaps in the provincial, territorial and national policy documents that were reviewed. For example, a lack of psychosocial and ethical policies in planning for pediatric care were identified as major gaps by survey respondents, and confirmed by our policy review. These discontinuities in identified key elements, and existing policies, point to the need for consideration of children and families at all levels of the planning process. Moreover, this lack of pediatric specific considerations is noted in the perceptions of survey respondents who indicated that children do not have unique needs in the event of a pandemic and in the lack of policies across provinces and territories pertaining directly to the care of children and families. To address the needs of this population effectively, the authors suggest the incorporation of pediatric plans within broader provincial, territorial and national plans.

The international literature on needs in pandemic planning notes the importance of cooperation and the need to identify roles and responsibilities in plans [9, 11] . Similarly, participants identified the importance of resource allocation, guidelines and communication in pediatric plans. It is clear that these issues are salient and must guide policymakers as they develop or update plans.

Based upon the web-based policy review, provinces with a combination of factors are often substantially more prepared based upon an analysis of their provided policies. For instance, British Columbia's (BC) [10] pediatric pandemic plan is a well-developed and readily available document which addresses the unique issues of children and families and touches upon some psychosocial concerns. Likewise, BC is an example of a province with relative wealth, and a high population density in urban areas, for instance, BC reported the third highest population growth among the provinces during 2007 (14.9 per 1000) to reach a population of 4,414,000, one of the more populated provinces in Canada [33] . BC's major cities are easily accessible via commercial travel, and the province has welldeveloped health care and government infrastructure, all of which likely contribute to the resources available for the development of a pediatric pandemic plan.

In contrast, Northern communities appear to be at the greatest risk, given current rudimentary plans that are potentially influenced by a lower population density, few major cities, and a lack of reserve human, medical, supply, policy and financial resources. These disparities require greater consideration of factors influencing inequities in pediatric pandemic preparedness, including population density, socioeconomic status, relative isolation, and available resources. Regardless of the factors that may influence the lack of pediatric contingency plans, there remains the possibility of severe outcomes for children and families in the event of an outbreak. It appears that greater attention and resources must be allocated to Northern communities to ensure adequate preparation in the event of a pandemic.

Participants suggested that web based communication will be key in the event of a severe outbreak, allowing information to be distributed remotely [34] . Posting pandemic information on websites will be critical, as identified by survey respondents, to allow quick access to up-todate information. The majority of provincial, territorial and national pandemic planning bodies have responded to this method of information dissemination, in posting pandemic plans and information on their websites.

Public and political awareness of a potential pandemic has raised concerns over resource allocation and contingency planning, but in some jurisdictions, relatively little attention has been paid to planning in pediatrics. A review of the pandemic plans of the Public Health Agency of Canada, provincial and territorial governments has identified needs in pediatric planning. These issues and concerns were also supported by survey respondents, who are experts in pediatric care and pandemic planners, qualified to note such gaps in contingency plans. To overcome these gaps, a focus on the unique needs of children and families is required, while support and resource redistribution to less advantaged provinces and territories is needed to ensure the health and well-being of all Canadians. Consideration of the factors that influence pandemic preparedness (such as population density, affluence, relative isolation, and available resources) may be helpful to inform research and policy decisions. Finally, the dissemination of information online, especially via government websites, is essential to communicate with the public during a pandemic. In brief, the findings presented here provide important suggestions to guide pandemic planning in pediatrics, in the hope that a pandemic response can ensure the safety of Canadians.

Communications in Public Health Emergency Preparedness: A Systematic Review of the Literature,"During a public health crisis, public health agencies engage in a variety of public communication efforts to inform the population, encourage the adoption of preventive behaviors, and limit the impact of adverse events. Given the importance of communication to the public in public health emergency preparedness, it is critical to examine the extent to which this field of study has received attention from the scientific community. We conducted a systematic literature review to describe current research in the area of communication to the public in public health emergency preparedness, focusing on the association between sociodemographic and behavioral factors and communication as well as preparedness outcomes. Articles were searched in PubMed and Embase and reviewed by 2 independent reviewers. A total of 131 articles were included for final review. Fifty-three percent of the articles were empirical, of which 74% were populationbased studies, and 26% used information environment analysis techniques. None had an experimental study design.","M embers of racial and ethnic minorities and underserved population groups suffer disproportionately from the consequences of disasters and emergencies. The reasons for this are varied and complex, but they include limited access to resources that can help people to take action during an emergency, culture and language barriers, lower perceived personal risk, distrust of authorities, lack of preparation and protective action, and frequent reliance on informal sources of information. 1, 2 Central to these factors, we argue, is the phenomenon of communi-cation inequalities, which we define as differences among individuals and social groups in accessing and using health information and the resultant impact on knowledge and behaviors. [2] [3] [4] While a solid body of work in social epidemiology has documented a connection between social determinants such as socioeconomic position, race, and ethnicity and health outcomes, the mechanisms linking the 2 have been less clear. Viswanath and colleagues developed an explanatory framework of how inequalities in public health emergency preparedness outcomes attributable to social determinants could potentially be explained by inequalities on various dimensions of public health emergency preparedness. 5 The framework is summarized by the Structural Influence Model (SIM) of preparedness communication depicted in Figure 1 . 5 The model is a heuristic framework developed to link social determinants with preparedness outcomes through public health emergency preparedness communications. The framework was originally developed in the context of health communication 5 and subsequently adopted to public health emergency preparedness communication to the public. 6 Communication to the public is critically important in public health emergency preparedness. It is one of 15 public health emergency preparedness capabilities developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC): ''Public Information and Warning.'' 7 During a crisis, federal, state, and local public health agencies are typically engaged in a variety of public information efforts to inform the population, encourage the adoption of preventive behaviors, and limit the adverse impacts of specific events. Yet, individuals and groups may not be able to access and use some of the resources offered to them, including information on health and specific threats, because of existing social inequalities, including socioeconomic position, race, ethnicity, and physical and mental health disabilities, among others. 8 Emergencies, including disasters, also can lead to longterm disparities, even controlling for predisaster socioeconomic status, as a study of Hurricane Katrina showed. 9 These disparities are also found among nations. For ex-ample, a United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) study showed that the adverse consequences of disasters, such as mortality, are greater among countries with low income, low life expectancy, and less education. 10 In contrast, advanced countries with higher income and education and more stable governance suffer fewer losses in disasters. 9 Poorer households tend to have poorer coping strategies and suffer consequences over the longer term. 11 In an analysis, Kim showed that poor people are more likely than nonpoor people to be exposed to disasters and that the poor are much more likely to be concentrated in disasterprone areas, highlighting the importance of public health emergency preparedness communications. 6 During an emergency, a number of psychosocial as well as social factors influence action, even when information about a probable hazard is available and promptly communicated to the public. For example, Mexican Americans often have delayed responses to natural emergencies because of the time they spend in trying to communicate with their extended families. 12 Hearing impairment may leave elderly people more vulnerable to information processing and cause difficulty in understanding evacuation orders, 13 and individuals with low literacy may be challenged in interpreting written messages and are likely to benefit from preparedness resources that are easy to read and visually appropriate. 14 Given the importance of communicating to the public in public health emergency preparedness, it is important to examine the extent to which this issue has received attention from the scientific community. The goal of this project was to conduct a systematic review of the scientific literature to describe current research in public communication in public health emergency preparedness, with a particular focus on communication inequalities and their association with communication and preparedness outcomes. This review examines the relationship among sociodemographics, behavioral characteristics, and communication outcomes in public health emergency preparedness.

We adopted the definition of public health emergency preparedness developed by Nelson et al in 2007: ''the capability of the public health and health care systems, communities, and individuals, to prevent, protect against, quickly respond to, and recover from health emergencies, particularly those whose scale, timing, or unpredictability threatens to overwhelm routine capabilities,'' 15 and we used the definition of emergency public information and warning provided by CDC: ''the ability to develop, coordinate, and disseminate information, alerts, warning, and notifications to the public and incident management responders.'' 16

The development of the literature search methodology started with a preliminary search of peer-reviewed journals in PubMed using a set of specific Medical Subject Heading (MeSH) terms (eg, communication, media, disaster, emergencies); this showed that these terms, as well as the term ''emergency preparedness,'' were not used consistently or in accordance with the definitions above. Therefore, in order to develop more specific search criteria, all articles of the 2009 volumes of the American Journal of Public Health (AJPH), Disaster Medicine and Public Health Preparedness, Journal of Health Communication, American Journal of Disaster Medicine, and Public Health Reports were manually scanned to produce a list of key words. By combining these key words with a previous strategy developed by Savoia et al, 17 a new combination of terms was created to identify the articles of interest (see Figure 2 ). The 5 journals cited above were selected because of the importance of including journals with both a broad public health scope (ie, AJPH and Public Health Reports) and a specific focus on emergency preparedness or health communication. Subsequently, the new search methodology was applied to PubMed and Embase, selecting the year 2009 and the journals listed above.

The sensitivity of the search strategy was calculated as the proportion of articles judged to be relevant for this review by 2 independent reviewers found in PubMed and Embase among those found by manual scan. The sensitivity was 94% on 20 articles with an agreement of 100% between the 2 reviewers. Subsequently, the search was extended to all articles in any journal indexed in PubMed and Embase and published in English, Chinese, French, Portuguese, or Spanish from January 1, 2001, to January 1, 2012, combining the 2 sources and excluding duplicates. The time frame was created to include the September 11 attacks and early articles on the more recent H1N1 pandemic. Only publications with an abstract obtainable through an online library were selected.

Articles were classified in 3 rounds. In the first round, titles were screened, and those clearly not referring to the topic being studied were excluded. Among these were articles on surveillance, telecommunication technology, information sharing, and epidemiologic investigations. As a result, 202 articles passed the title screening. Subsequently, 2 reviewers independently read and coded the articles according to predefined criteria (as listed below) and discussed discrepancies in their classification. Finally, classification criteria were refined, and agreement between the 2 reviewers reached 90%.

In the third round, all articles were reviewed using the refined criteria, and no discrepancies in the classification method were found at this point. Selected articles were classified according to: type of emergency (ie, pandemic influenza, hurricane, terrorist attack), country of origin, empirical (based on data derived from experience/observations) versus nonempirical approach (editorials or commentaries), study design (ie, case study, cross-sectional, longitudinal, quasi-experimental, experimental), data collection method (ie, quantitative versus qualitative), and sampling methodology when a sample of the population was included in the study (eg, cluster, convenience, probability-based, census-based).

Subsequently, we used the Structural Influence Model of PHEP Communication developed by Viswanath et al ( Figure   1 ) 5 to review the empirical studies and identify which sociodemographic variables (ie, socioeconomic position, race/ ethnicity, immigrant status, sociodemographics) were investigated as potential determinants of communication inequalities (eg, information access, exposure, processing, utilization, trust) and preparedness outcomes (eg, awareness/knowledge, risk perception, behaviors). The model was used with 3 aims: to organize the data derived from the literature review, to validate the model by verifying which associations between variables were confirmed by the literature, and to identify areas for future research.

Descriptive statistics were performed using STATA (College Station, TX, version 11) to identify how frequently specific variables proposed in the model had been investigated in the empirical studies. Articles based on nonempirical studies, such as editorials or commentaries, were reviewed to describe the most frequent topic areas being addressed and the communication theories and models described.

Of the 202 selected articles, 172 were found in PubMed and 30 in Embase. After reviewing their content, 69 articles did not meet the inclusion criteria, leaving 131 articles for final review. (See Appendix for full reference list.) The majority of the articles were published by authors whose main affiliation was with institutions in the United States (57%), followed by the United Kingdom (9%), and Canada (7%). Among types of emergencies studied, most focused on infectious disease outbreaks (55%), followed by all-hazards (14%), terrorism or bioterrorism (17%), natural disasters (8%), radiological incidents (4%), and other causes (3%). Authors from US institutions were the only ones who studied communication issues during bioterrorism or terrorism attacks and chemical and radiological disasters or that used an all-hazards approach, whereas researchers from other countries focused mostly on infectious disease outbreaks and natural disasters such as weather-related incidents and wildfires. Fifty-three percent of articles were empirical (data based), and the rest (47%) were nonempirical studies (editorials or commentaries). We noticed an increase in empirical studies during and after the H1N1 pandemic: 36% of the empirical studies were conducted during and after 2009 and looked at the response to the pandemic, whereas only 16% of the nonempirical studies were related to the H1N1 pandemic. Seventy-four percent of the empirical studies were population based, and 26% used information environment analysis techniques, which consist of a systematic analysis of messages about public health emergencies covered in different media such as news or entertainment (also known as ''media content analysis''). None of the studies had an experimental study design, which is understandable, as most studies are done during or after emergencies, making it difficult to have control groups. The distribution of the articles and their characteristics are described in Figure 3 .

Seventy-four percent of empirical studies were population based, of which 60% used a quantitative approach, 33% a qualitative approach, and 7% mixed methods. All of them were observational studies, of which 71% were cross-sectional, 11% case studies, and 4% longitudinal, and 1 had a quasiexperimental study design. In terms of data collection methods, questionnaires were used in 67% of empirical studies, in-depth interviews in 23%, and focus groups in 23%. Among the empirical studies, 54% derived their data from a random sample of the population, 40% used a convenience sample, and 15% applied cluster sampling or other methods.

Only 4 of the empirical studies were supported by a theoretical framework. More specifically, Paek et al surveyed Georgia residents and used the Transtheoretical Model (TTM) to analyze the theoretical determinants (selfefficacy, normative influence, and media effects) related to the individual's stage of emergency preparedness. 18 Taylor-Clark et al used the Structural Influence Model of Health Communication to support the analysis of the effect of low socioeconomic position and social networks among black Hurricane Katrina victims on access to and processing of evacuation orders and ability to evacuate. 2 Kim and Kang based their work on the Communication Infrastructure Theory to examine how local residents in Tuscaloosa (Alabama) responded to Hurricane Ivan in September 2004. 19 Finally, de Zwart et al supported the study of perceived vulnerability, severity, and precautionary behavior related to avian influenza in the Netherlands on Protection Motivation Theory. 20 For more information on these theories, see Figure 4 . 

We next listed the sociodemographic variables that were gathered in the population-based studies to describe which variables are most frequently used to study populations exposed to public health emergency preparedness messages. To select and organize the variables in a meaningful way, we relied on the model described above and presented in Figure 1 . We used this model as a heuristic framework to review these studies and identify the sociodemographic and behavioral factors most frequently reported in the public health emergency preparedness literature.

Age and gender were used in 81% of the studies, and race and ethnicity were taken into consideration in 50% of the studies. Among the articles reporting information on socioeconomic position-62% of the total empirical articles-only 9% provided a clear definition of socioeconomic position and of the indicators being used. The variables used to describe socioeconomic position included education (81%), income and/or wealth (63%), employment (38%), occupation (31%), and home ownership (13%), solely or in combination. Specifically, in these articles, education and income/wealth (59%) are the most commonly used combination as socioeconomic position indicators, and more than half of these are reported together with employment status. Occasionally with the education variable, occupation is mostly seen by itself, with demographic characteristics providing complementary information. Home ownership is always looked at as an addition to other more commonly used socioeconomic position variables; it is rarely used alone. Household characteristics such as family size, marital status, or number of children in the household were described in 38% of the studies, and area of residence (ie, urban versus rural) was used 31% of the time.

Researchers also gathered data on the use of social networks such as family, friends, and co-workers (15%) to receive information during an emergency, a population's attitudes (33%) (ie, preexisting beliefs about a particular threat, perceived susceptibility, trust in government's handling, and/or fairness of treatment of all social groups), participants' experience with emergencies prior to a disaster (15%), general health status (19%), and self-efficacy (15%), which was defined as the level of confidence in one's ability to undertake a recommended preventive behavior.

The most common public health emergency preparedness communication outcomes empirically studied were: information exposure (63%), trust and credibility in information sources (40%), information-seeking behaviors (29%), information processing (13%), and information utilization (31%). In terms of preparedness outcomes, the most frequently researched were: preventive behaviors (ie, immunization practices) in 65% of the studies, risk perceptions (54%), knowledge and awareness about specific threats (48%), and emotional response (ie, fear) (29%). Risk perceptions were measured along 3 dimensions: likelihood, severity, and vulnerability. Additionally, scientists measured risk perception in terms of personal risk perception or social risk perception. Other communication and preparedness outcomes examined by the literature are described in Table 1 .

Subsequently, we reviewed the population-based studies to describe what variables are commonly used to investigate potential determinants of communication and/or preparedness outcomes. Most population-based studies (75%, N = 39) looked at the association between sociodemographic factors, attitudes, and beliefs and public health emergency preparedness outcomes.

In Figure 5 , we show the proportion of empirical studies that analyze specific factors. Our data show that the literature has also focused on populations' perceptions and beliefs, such as personal and societal risk perception, self-efficacy, subjective norm, beliefs about the efficacy or safety of preventive measures (46% of population-based studies), and their relationship with communication and preparedness outcomes. Race and ethnicity have been investigated in 35% of the studies, and minority groups have consistently shown a lack of trust in the government, thus limiting their willingness to follow recommended preventive behaviors. 4, 21, 22 Socioeconomic positions, as measured by level of education and income or socioeconomic indexes, and older age have also proven to be related to a higher level of knowledge Healthcare behaviors Any activity undertaken by individuals to seek medical attention after they encounter the threat 6 (12%)

Emotional response Emotional reactions that occur as a response to a real risk or potential threat to health or environment 15 (29%)

regarding the risk and preventive measures associated with better preparedness outcomes, including higher compliance with preventive practices. [23] [24] [25] Concerning gender differences, the literature describes women as more likely to comply with preventive measures (eg, quarantine) but more reluctant than men to use pharmaceuticals released during emergency situations. 26 Social, family, and interpersonal networks, analyzed in 11% of the studies, were also found to be positively associated with individuals' ability to be informed about a threat. 25, 27 Place of residence seems to have an impact on risk perceptions and information exposure, with populations living in rural areas being less concerned about terrorist attacks than urban populations and preferring to receive information from local media compared to national media channels typically used by their urban counterparts. 21

Forty-seven percent of the articles were editorials or commentaries, of which 89% focused on specific communication topics and 11% described communication theories and their application to public health emergency preparedness. The topics most frequently addressed were risk communication (58%), information dissemination (44%), risk perception (37%), public health (system) response (27%), public trust (26%), policy and planning considerations (26%), and mass media's role during public health emergencies (23%). Other communication issues discussed included public concerns and fear (19%), public participation/public reaction (15%), risk reduction/assessment (10%), vulnerable populations (10%), cultural values (10%), exercises and drills (8%), uncertainty of informa-tion (6%), health literacy/self-efficacy (5%), and community preparedness (6%). The remaining articles (11%) described communication and behavior theories and models applicable to public health emergency preparedness (Table 1) .

In recent years, the literature has seen an increasing number of studies focused on the analysis of the information environment, performed during large-scale emergencies. In our review, 26% of empirical studies focused on this technique, of which 44% were related to the recent H1N1 pandemic. The majority of the studies (72%) were focused on the response to infectious disease outbreaks, and about half of them (44%) were conducted in the US. These articles analyzed the content covered by news media, including traditional print newspaper articles, television/online news reports, and websites developed by government agencies in preparation for or response to a specific threat. In such studies, the analysis of the accuracy and quality of news reporting and the potential impact of media coverage on public risk perceptions and behaviors were typically discussed. Only 22% of these analyses were based on a prospective study design, all of which were performed during the unfolding of the H1N1 pandemic. These studies suggest how data derived from the analysis of the information environment may inform public health officials on how messages are filtered or further elaborated by the media, and how the availability of such information, in the midst of a crisis, may be critical to improving public officials' ability to better target their messages. Despite the documented wide use of social media by state health departments 28 and recent literature on their potential use during an emergency, 29 we found only 2 studies that examined the use of social media such as Twitter and blogs in the context of a crisis.

Public information and warning is one of the most important capabilities in emergency preparedness, as seen from the responses to several types of disasters. Communicating effectively with the public about specific threats is the key to successful emergency management and public health. It helps mitigate the risks, supports the implementation of protective actions, and contributes to minimizing negative mental health impacts of disasters. 30, 31 We performed a systematic review of the scientific literature to describe the type of studies performed in this area and the association between population characteristics and public health emergency preparedness outcomes. Our findings show that various communication theories and models have been discussed in the literature without providing results on their applicability or validity in the context of emergency preparedness.

A majority of population-based studies are crosssectional, and a little more than half used probability-based sampling methods for data collection to strengthen the generalizability of the findings. The tension between external and internal validity warrants further consideration in communication studies in preparedness. 32 Large-scale studies that draw on representative samples strengthen the external validity of the findings. Moreover, if data are collected longitudinally, the findings will provide additional information on trends over time and the ways in which communication behaviors and their effects are likely to occur over time. The understanding of communication behaviors at different stages of public health emergencies will help public health authorities to plan for strategic communication efforts in future emergencies.

It is also possible to conduct field experiments and randomized control trials testing different messages and channels to document their effectiveness on different outcomes during nonemergency periods to plan for communication during emergencies. This is, however, easier said than done.

At the same time, given the nature of the public information environment, any number of factors external to the study could potentially influence outcomes, making it difficult to draw causal inferences. Randomization during emergencies could be ethically questionable and practically not feasible. Thus, more creative alternative designs such as time-series designs have been advocated by some to overcome the challenges in studying large-scale communication efforts. 32 Also, experiments with different channels and message formats could be done under simulated emergency conditions. In summary, we need more creative designs to be employed to understand the role of communications during emergencies.

Most of the literature focused on the role of risk and crisis communication and on the difficulty of informing, educating, and sometimes persuading the general population to embrace preventive behaviors. 20, 21, 33 Emphasis has been on the importance of population trust in the source of information and on the vehicle or medium through which the information is delivered. 4, 21, 34, 35 Although several types of communication outcomes have been investigatedincluding information exposure, information-seeking behaviors, and information processing and use-only a few studies have looked at population sociodemographic characteristics and behaviors as determinants of public health emergency preparedness communication outcomes. Population-based studies are rarely supported by theoretical models, and most of them rely on cross-sectional study designs in which data are typically gathered from nonrepresentative samples of the population under investigation. However, the few population-based studies being published show consistent results on how factors such as socioeconomic position, race/ethnicity, language spoken at home, and place of residence have an impact on people's ability to get ready for an emergency and respond to specific incidents. 21, 23, 36 Behavioral characteristics such as self-efficacy and perceived norm, preexisting beliefs, willingness to comply with recommended measures, and trust in the government are also associated with the way preventive messages will be received and understood by specific segments of the general public. 18, 26, 34, 37, 38 The Structural Influence Model was well suited to the purpose of identifying what variables were studied the most, showing how this model well reflects current knowledge in this topic area. Among the social determinants listed in the model, ''social networks'' have been rarely investigated as well as physical or mental disabilities and their relationship with communication outcomes. Socioeconomic position has been investigated by several studies, but the definition and measurement of socioeconomic position have not been consistently used. In terms of communication outcomes, ''information processing'' has been investigated the least; experimental studies on this outcome will be useful to better understand the effectiveness of specific communication messages.

Public health emergency preparedness outcomes have also been studied. However, specific reactions and behaviors such as ''emotional response'' were less studied than others. A recent review of the literature on issues related to communication to the public about chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear terrorism support existing psychological models of why people engage in health protective behaviors, with information about the severity of the incident, the likelihood of being exposed, the efficacy and costs or risks of recommended behaviors, and the ability of individuals to perform recommended behaviors being sought by the public. 39 

Trust plays a crucial role in ensuring that people attend to messages. Our literature review suggests segmenting the population by sociodemographic and behavioral factors may be an effective strategy to improve the ability of government agencies to develop targeted messages during a crisis. However, no experimental study has been conducted to date to examine the soundness of this approach.

Finally, our literature review has shown how during the H1N1 pandemic several articles focused on analysis of the information environment. Such studies have the potential to provide results in a rapid and less expensive way compared to large population investigations, and they have the potential benefit of informing government officials on media attention to specific threats in the midst of a crisis.

It is now widely acknowledged that public information and warning is an important public health capability to mitigate the impact of an emergency and to speed up recovery after a crisis. The rapid change in the information delivery platforms and the complexity of the information environment demand that communications during emergencies be accurate and quick. Authorities have to be agile and nimble to understand the needs of the audience, to reduce uncertainty and panic, and to facilitate action. This requires sound empirical knowledge that can inform how people learn about emergencies as well as the factors that influence their learning and that influence how people act or do not act during a crisis. While theoretical essays are useful in providing a framework, it is vital that we develop a more solid evidence base warranting more empirical studies.

The fact that only a small percentage of studies drew on a prospective design limits our understanding of how communications may be helpful during an emergency and help on recovery efforts. Communications from emergency agencies are subject to debate, interpretation, and even misinterpretation by others. This calls for real-time analysis of the information environment, which might help in course correction of public health messages and lead to a more effective response.

Social Media and Internet-Based Data in Global Systems for Public Health Surveillance: A Systematic Review,"The exchange of health information on the Internet has been heralded as an opportunity to improve public health surveillance. In a field that has traditionally relied on an established system of mandatory and voluntary reporting of known infectious diseases by doctors and laboratories to governmental agencies, innovations in social media and so-called user-generated information could lead to faster recognition of cases of infectious disease. More direct access to such data could enable surveillance epidemiologists to detect potential public health threats such as rare, new diseases or early-level warnings for epidemics. But how useful are data from social media and the Internet, and what is the potential to enhance surveillance? The challenges of using these emerging surveillance systems for infectious disease epidemiology, including the specific resources needed, technical requirements, and acceptability to public health practitioners and policymakers, have wide-reaching implications for public health surveillance in the 21st century.","to develop event-based surveillance, the existing systems have limitations. Accordingly, there is a need for further development of automated technologies that monitor health-related information on the Internet, especially to handle large amounts of data and to prevent information overload. The dissemination to health authorities of new information about health events is not always efficient and could be improved. No comprehensive evaluations show whether eventbased surveillance systems have been integrated into actual epidemiological work during real-time health events.

The acceptability of data from the Internet and social media as a regular part of public health surveillance programs varies and is related to a circular challenge: the willingness to integrate is rooted in a lack of effectiveness studies, yet such effectiveness can be proved only through a structured evaluation of integrated systems. Issues related to changing technical and social paradigms in both individual perceptions of and interactions with personal health data, as well as social media and other data from the Internet, must be further addressed before such information can be integrated into official surveillance systems.

Keywords: surveillance, health information, Internet, social media. R ecent major health events such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in Asia (2002) (2003) , pandemic H1N1/09 influenza virus worldwide (2009), and the large outbreak of Escherichia coli O104:H4 in Germany (2011) have prompted infectious disease scientists at government agencies, university centers, and international health agencies to invest in improving methods for conducting infectious disease surveillance. 1, 2 Opportunities for improvement, however, vary and are based on the distinctive features of existing types of infectious disease surveillance, which have been developed over time to address the various critical components in public health efforts against disease. Standard infectious disease surveillance methodologies have been derived from indicator-based surveillance and event-based surveillance.

Indicator-based surveillance systems are the oldest, most common, and most widely used form of infectious disease surveillance by regional, national, and international public health agencies. These systems are designed to collect and analyze structured data based on established surveillance and monitoring protocols tailored to each disease (ie, used for calculating the incidence, seasonality, and burden of disease), in order to gather relevant information about populations of interest to detect changes in trends or distributions in the population. Data on such indicators are reported by health care providers and diagnostic laboratories, by legal mandate or voluntary agreement, and are collected by surveillance specialists in governmental health agencies. This information then can be verified through communication between the governmental health agencies and the persons collecting the data in health care settings.

Indicator-based surveillance systems often contain reliable statistical methods that have been established to compare the observed number of cases of pathogens with an expected rate. The goal is to find increased numbers or clusters at a specific time, period, and/or location that might indicate a threat. Statistical methods set against thresholds of increased cases or clusters are crucial to finding potential health events. They are based on the relevant attributes of each infectious disease, such as epidemiological parameters like regional incidence, seasonality, and the known burden of disease. Thresholds can also be adjusted using statistical algorithms to vary sensitivity and specificity so that the detection procedure is refined to better suit the needs of the epidemiological situation for a disease or a specific area. This helps epidemiologists by giving them a greater capacity to monitor additional information that might signal threats to public health.

The ability of indicator-based surveillance systems to detect potential threats more quickly is lacking, however. Although generating signals based on statistical thresholds can provide an aggregation that will speed up a threat assessment, the data itself may not be the most recent. First, there is often a time lag between the occurrence of an event and the indicator-based surveillance. That is, data input and retrieval for indicator-based surveillance often rely on specific case definitions and reporting requirements that differ for physicians in hospital and community care and for laboratories, thereby causing delays in reporting to health agencies. Delays also may be caused by time lags between reporting procedures from the reporting bodies and the authorities who receive, store, and process the data, that is, by the structure of notification systems in official public health agencies that often trickle up from the local, state, and federal levels. Second, indicator-based systems are sometimes poorly equipped to detect new or unexpected occurrences of disease, owing to the predefined epidemiological attributes assigned to each infectious disease for which information is collected. This was true during the first cases of SARS-CoV in 2002 and pandemic H1N1/09 influenza in 2009, which at first were not detected because the existing systems could track only the clinical and epidemiological attributes for corona or influenza infections that had already been discovered and defined, but not new strains of viral infections. Incidentally, such shortfalls provided the impetus for the systemic improvement of indicator-based systems. By demonstrating the importance of detecting unknown but similar diseases, it became evident that new data sources and methods for monitoring such data were critical. 3 As a result of the SARS-CoV epidemic, for example, health agencies began to seriously consider ways to monitor symptoms and syndromes (ie, clusters of symptoms for particular diseases) in order to provide appropriate and fast detection with the most efficient use of required human resources.

Similar to indicator-based surveillance, event-based surveillance is based on the organized and rapid capture of information about events that can be a risk to public health. But rather than relying on official reports, this information is obtained directly from witnesses of real-time events or indirectly from reports transmitted through various communication channels (eg, social media or established routine alert systems) and information channels (the news media, public health networks, and nongovernmental organizations) ( Table 1 ). Monitoring that relies on data from these Internet sources can be used to detect threats not specifically found by indicator-based surveillance, since this information relies less on data structured and filtered through the aforementioned preestablished structures for surveillance. Event-based surveillance can identify events faster than indicator-based reporting procedures can, and it can detect events that occur in populations not able to access formal channels for reporting. In addition, event-based surveillance can be used with other established indicator-based methods, thereby enhancing the combined arsenal for combatting critically prevalent pathogens with a high threat potential, such as influenza virus or Escherichia coli. The scientific literature recently referred to this comprehensive framework of combined activities from both indicator-based surveillance and eventbased surveillance systems as ""epidemic intelligence,"" a contemporary understanding of the 1950s term with roots in public health innovation for surveillance systems at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the establishment of the Epidemic Intelligence Service (EIS). [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] Event-based surveillance continues to offer innovation for public health surveillance, for example, by capturing information about events that may not otherwise be detected in the routine collection of data from indicator-based surveillance. Events that may be detected in event-based surveillance include the following:

r Events, such as SARS, that are emerging or rarely occur and thus are not specifically part of the purview of standard indicator-based surveillance.

r Events that occur in real time but have not been detected by indicator-based surveillance, such as those events delayed by the required reporting procedures of notifying the designated health authority.

r Events that occur in populations that do not access health care through formal channels or in which formal, indicator-based systems do not exist, such as events that occur in populations in rural areas or countries with a less established infrastructure for surveillance.

Health information monitored via the Internet and social media is an important part of event-based surveillance and is most often the source on which many existing event-based surveillance systems focus. Existing systems for such event-based monitoring contain useful retrieval features that give epidemiologists and public health scientists involved in surveillance quick access to information compiled from many media and news sources. 9, 10 Other new health information technologies using new data sources from the Internet are important drivers of innovation in global surveillance, speeding up the collection and transmission of information to allow for better emergency preparedness or responses. 11 In research, event-based surveillance using data from the Internet, especially emails and online news sources, has been shown to identify surveillance trends comparable to those found using established indicator-based surveillance methods. [12] [13] [14] In practice, however, such systems have not yet been widely accepted and integrated into the mainstream for use by national and international health authorities.

We reviewed event-based surveillance systems that have actually been used, in order to examine the usefulness of event-based surveillance to existing surveillance efforts and its potential to improve future comprehensive infectious disease surveillance systems.

We conducted a systematic review to identify all currently established event-based surveillance systems used in infectious disease surveillance and to look at the type of data collected, the mode of data acquisition used by the system, and the overall purpose and function of each system. As members of a national scientific institute, our aim was to help health policy decision makers decide whether to incorporate new methods into comprehensive programs of surveillance that already contain established indicator-based surveillance.

The previous work in this area includes a systematic review, by Bravata and colleagues, of 17,510 peer-reviewed articles and 8,088 websites on surveillance systems for the early detection of bioterrorism-related diseases, which evaluated the potential utility of existing surveillance systems for illnesses and syndromes related to bioterrorism only. [15] [16] [17] Another review of peer-reviewed articles by Vrbova and colleagues synthesized surveillance systems for emerging zoonotic diseases with selected criteria used to evaluate those systems. 18 Corley and colleagues helped US federal government agencies compile aspects and attributes associated with operational considerations in the development, testing, and validation of event-based surveillance; and Hartley and colleagues drew up an outline of technical Internet biosurveillance processes. 19, 20 Although this work is important, these reviews do not provide systematically collected details of event-based systems used in practice.

We searched for peer-reviewed articles published in the indexes Pubmed, Scopus, and Scirus between 1990 and 2011 21-23 as well as Englishlanguage studies of infectious disease surveillance (and specifically event-based surveillance) and outbreak detection in human health and medicine. We excluded articles on bioterrorism (for which there is less possibility of pathogen threat), articles on solely technical aspects of system implementation or security (eg, video surveillance), those covering sentinel surveillance systems (ie, those set up randomly, periodically, or in another unsystematic way), any surveillance not based on infectious diseases, and articles without available abstracts. We used extraction criteria to collect comparable data on each system. Appendix 1 provides a detailed overview of the search strategy and methods, and the study's complete protocol also is available. 24 

Our systematic review yielded 13 event-based systems used in practice and for which complete information based on our extraction criteria was available (Tables 2 and 3) .

Event-based surveillance systems can be classified as news aggregators, automatic systems, or moderated systems. 25 News aggregators collect articles from several sources that are commonly filtered by language or country. Although their users have easy access to many sources through a common portal, they must examine each article individually. Automatic systems go beyond this by adding a series of steps for analysis but differ in the levels of analysis performed, in the range of information sources, in language coverage, in the speed of delivering information, and in methods for visualization. In moderated systems, information is processed entirely by human analysts or is first processed automatically and then 11 Automatic USA 2000 a GOARN is a WHO-coordinated network analyzed by people. Moderated systems offer a screening for epidemiological relevance of the data found within the information before it is presented to the user. Although each of the systems that we reviewed has different goals (mostly pertaining to various national, international, and regional audiences), they all foster the communication of health events or threats in the infectious disease community of scientists, physicians, epidemiologists, public health officials, policymakers, and politicians.

The systems overwhelmingly rely on media sources for data input, including local and national newspapers; news broadcasts; websites; news wires; or even short message service (SMS), the text messaging service component of phone, web, or mobile communication systems. 26 Some of the systems already have been incorporated into other larger systems. For example, GOARN links 110 existing networks, and GPHIN collects data already processed with ProMED-mail. 27 Surveillance scientists then review this information to assess its epidemiological significance and to support decision making. But because these data are not structured, epidemiologists must spend more time and energy determining their relevance to a particular situation of interest.

We identified three types of coordinating bodies for event-based systems: those based at or in cooperation with universities (Argus, BioCaster, GODSN, HealthMap, and Proteus-BIO), NGOs (GOARN, MedISys, MiTAP, and ProMED-mail) and governmental agencies (EWRS, EpiSPI-DER, GPHIN and InSTEDD).

Each of these systems has a different aim: (1) to improve early detection, (2) to enhance communication or collaboration, and (3) to supplement other existing systems. Ten of the systems are intended to improve early detection: Argus, BioCaster, GOARN, GODSN, GPHIN, HealthMap, InSTEDD, MedISys, MiTAP, and Proteus-BIO. Two of the systems are meant to enhance communication or collaboration (EWRS and ProMED-mail), and one system supplements another (EpiSPIDER for ProMED-mail).

All the systems cover 2 or more countries, but their jurisdictions could be classified as (1) 

All the event-based systems that we reviewed focused on outbreaks of different and multiple infectious diseases, with some systems, such as Argus (130), BioCaster (102), and HealthMap (170), collecting information on more than 100 diseases.

We observed 5 levels of access: (1) freely and publicly available (HealthMap, EpiSpider, GODSN, and Proteus-BIO), (2) available with a free subscription (ProMED-mail, BioCaster, and MiTAP), (3) available with a paid subscription (GPHIN, whose subscribers include governmental organizations, NGOs, and universities), (4) access restricted to certain public health officials (EWRS, Argus, GOARN, and InSTEDD), and (5) mixed-level access (MedISys, offering free but restricted access to the public and outside the European Commission [EC] and full access to officials in the EC). Accessibility varies from system to system, depending on both the scope of the system and the intended audience. While it is important to offer freely accessible information, some sensitive information (eg, personal data or other confidential data) is often filtered in specific ways among public health officials with specific restricted access. GPHIN has restricted access for organizations with an established public health mandate, with access varying according to factors like the organization's size and number of users. InSTEDD is one of the few systems using information to advise organizations like the UN, WHO, and CDC on strategic implementation. Such systems, like EWRS, provide, within a closed network, timely information for preparedness, early warning, and responses.

Each event-based system acquires data differently. Some collect information directly from sources on the Internet (eg, RSS feeds or electronic mailing lists); others collect both from formal members and informal sources; and still others collect from subscribers or members only. Ten systems collect from the Internet (Argus, BioCaster, EpiSPI-DER, GODSN, GPHIN, HealthMap, InSTEDD, MedISys, MiTAP, and Proteus-BIO), and 2 systems collect from both formal members and informal sources (EWRS and GOARN). ProMED-mail is the only system obtaining firsthand information from its subscribers.

Most of the systems we studied function as news aggregators. News aggregators (eg, Google News) use RSS to collect real-time news feeds from thousands of news sources from around the world, and many systems deal with a huge amount of information each day. MediSys, for example, monitors an average of 50,000 news articles per day from about 1,400 news portals in 43 languages. GPHIN processes from 2,000 to 3,000 news items per day, of which about a quarter are irrelevant or duplicates. 26 Many of the event-based systems utilize text-mining technology to extract only relevant data, and most have sophisticated processing systems of filtering and classifying relevant information to reduce the amount of data.

Source data (ie, event-based data retrieved from the Internet) should be reviewed for epidemiological relevance, either by human epidemiologists or automated systems. This is technologically simple but timeconsuming and expensive, with human moderation having a different role in each system. The information provided through ProMED-mail, for example, is validated and confirmed by humans. EWRS utilizes an informatics tool that filters and relays information to users via a webbased system that links contact members of the EWRS network.

Human input, hypothesis generation, and review are important components of systems. InSTEDD and GPHIN incorporate human input and review, allowing users to add comments, tags, and ranks during the data-processing phases and confirmation and feedback during the dissemination phases.

Systems without human moderation often focus on data sources that already have been validated. Many systems contain new data on outbreaks or diseases, but only some are relayed as firsthand, primary information. Other data are reported as secondary sources like newspaper articles. Although this information can be useful to surveillance epidemiologists who monitor data and conduct research on a known infectious disease area, because these events already have been reported, it does not help epidemiologists interested in the early warning and alert potential for unknown or new infectious disease areas. Because MedISys offers no human mediation in collating information sources and articles, all information must be examined in order to learn more about the outbreak or event in question. Accordingly, how the information is presented is less easily adapted for use in daily practice.

Almost all the systems not relying on human moderation are automated with thresholds used to reduce noise and to present only the most relevant data. MediSys uses a scraper software, for example, that automatically generates an RSS feed from webpages and applies a textextraction process, which then enables content analysis using analytical technology. 28 The text-extraction process uses document heuristics, an experience-based technique for computer learning that is applied to the information to enable an intelligent decision about its relevance. The heuristics learn as their output is verified against a set threshold for the epidemiological attributes of health events that have been extracted, thus improving monitoring over time. The system aggregates the extracted events into outbreaks, across multiple documents and sources, before returning the extracted information to the system. Users of the system often prefer a more structured approach, but it may present too much information (in some cases up to 1,000 events per day). The large amount of ""information noise"" also may be a hindrance, since users are then required to sift through it manually. HealthMap alleviates noise by integrating data from a variety of electronic sources that already have been moderated (ProMED-mail, WHO-validated official alerts, and the Eurosurveillance RSS multinational outbreak news site), all of which are fed into a classification engine (ie, a parser), which uses the information to produce disease and location output codes. Once classified, articles are filtered into a category and stored in a database.

Three systems are disseminated on a geographic map: BioCaster, EpiSPI-DER, and HealthMap; and 4 systems are disseminated through a website or news aggregator: MedISys, MiTAP, ProMED-mail, and Proteus-BIO. We found 6 systems that were disseminated through a secured or restricted portal: Argus, EWRS, GOARN, GODSN, GPHIN, and In-STEDD.

Our systematic literature review demonstrates the diverse attributes in current, established, event-based surveillance systems. Our review also articulates the factors that might influence the integration of such surveillance activities into official systems. The usefulness of new information sources via event-based surveillance depends on whether the information can enhance the data collection from existing surveillance methods and also on several factors related to the challenges for all systems' acquisition of data on infectious disease surveillance. 29, 30 For most epidemiologists, the process of gathering data from the Internet is complex, as it includes text mining (searching for health-related content from websites or social media), preparation (extracting and filtering relevant health-related information), and presentation of only the most relevant content (disseminating the information). In general, data are acquired and processed either automatically or by people, often relying on individual technologies for users' interaction with the data to tag (mark or catalog) the information for future use, and to comment on the information (for sharing and collaboration with other scientists), which can also be used to inform machine-learning algorithms (eg, statistical filters for data retrieval, such as Bayesian models). Systems often use automatic programming interfaces (APIs), a type of filter through which the data are passed in order to extract specific information. This is a good way of managing large sources of data from the Internet, which can be cumbersome and contain much content not related to health. These APIs process, extract, augment, and compile the epidemiological attributes in the data (ie, metadata) from multiple sources. For example, healthrelated attributes could include the data source, a relevant health term, the location, and the time of transmission. Natural language-processing systems extract from the feeds such relevant concepts as disease names and references to a geographic location. The information is then often assigned a dissemination format based on the information type (ie, epidemiological attribute) retrieved, through a network (eg, GPHIN), the Internet, email (ProMED-mail), or SMS (EWRS), or it is plotted on a geographic information system (GIS) published on the web (eg, HealthMap). The time needed to get from a potential data source to extracting and presenting epidemiological information that can be used as quickly as possible for preparedness or responses is critical. The results vary widely, depending on the combination of technologies used and whether or not human mediation is involved.

Even though event-based surveillance systems have been much improved, they still have limitations:

Information is not always moderated by professionals or interpreted for relevance before it is disseminated to interested surveillance epidemiologists. Information retrieved from event-based systems can originate from either official sources who can be seen as trusted health specialists or unofficial sources, such as the public, who may or may not be health specialists. Information from unofficial sources is often not prescreened by professionals, so it can cause reliability issues and necessitate moderation. Thus, moderation affects the quality of event-based information, compared with information from indicator-based systems, which almost always is provided by official sources.

There is no standardized system for the frequency of updates, often resulting in too much information. Information from event-based information components that use news aggregators often is incomplete and may not be timely. Data may be obsolete by the time it is picked up by epidemiologists because some information may have been published by news agencies after health organizations knew about an event or problem. In existing event-based surveillance systems, the frequency of updates varies from approximately several to hundreds of notifications per day, depending on the system.

Algorithms and statistical baselines are not well developed. Until now, event-based systems have not applied algorithms and statistical baselines to information before it is presented to users, which is a standard feature of most established indicator-based systems. Event-based systems often receive a high volume of information per day, which can overwhelm epidemiologists at public health agencies who perform surveillance and may be seen as a hindrance, since users are then required to spend time moderating the retrieved information.

New information about health events or probable cases is not always disseminated efficiently. Event-based systems filter and organize information about potential events of interest before it is presented to users. Information indexed by topic or subject enables users to decide whether they need to do more research. Some systems use online watch boards offering lists or tables of information on events; others rely on SMS; and still others provide options for other notification, like the ability to subscribe to an RSS-feed or through other web capabilities, like Twitter.

Some studies have shown that automated methods and technologies like those used in event-based surveillance can rapidly signal the detection of infectious diseases. 31, 34 In addition to speeding up detection by bypassing traditional indicator-based surveillance structures, event-based surveillance can also provide innovation in settings with weak or underdeveloped surveillance systems. In developing countries with a large disease burden, surveillance infrastructures that can use health information in the absence of traditional surveillance institutions can be critical to prevent an outbreak or reduce its impact. 35 Recent work has begun in this area to seek out information on health threats using mobile phone technology, Internet-scanning tools, email distribution lists, or networks that complement the early warning function of routine surveillance systems. [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] Our research showed that the majority of event-based surveillance systems are based in North America and Europe, with fewer local, event-based systems monitoring epidemic threats in Africa, Asia, the South Pacific, and South America. Guidance and training to create such systems on the ground should be considered, as this can lead to a faster assessment of health threats and a more rapid response by local authorities.

Previous evaluations of event-based surveillance systems have been limited, so we have very few examples to draw from. 41, 42 Although explored since the mid-2000s, largely in response to the SARS-CoV epidemic, event-based surveillance has yet to be fully integrated into public health surveillance systems. Evidence showing the added value to traditional infectious disease surveillance methods is sparse. 43 The development of appropriate metrics for monitoring and evaluating the quality of the data in event-based surveillance systems has become a priority but has just begun. Standard guidelines for the evaluation of surveillance systems offer much information about the attributes needed for measuring the appropriateness and effectiveness of specific systems. Most guidelines, however, rely on attribute descriptions taken from traditional or indicator-based surveillance. These have seldom been adapted to address specific concerns about the new information from event-based surveillance systems and may be inadequate.

Those standard operating procedures, tools, and guidance for eventbased surveillance that do exist-as is often the case with indicator-based surveillance as well-are not universally applicable, since different regions, countries, and smaller jurisdictions must adapt the surveillance systems to their particular needs. In 2005, the WHO established international health regulations (IHR) for surveillance activities that offer the WHO's 193 member states a multilateral legal framework for surveillance, notification, and responses to disease outbreaks and other emergencies with potential international public health implications. [44] [45] [46] The new IHR require the WHO and its members to develop real-time event management systems for addressing public health risks and emergencies of international concern along with the usual epidemiological tools.

Regulating the identification of disease outbreaks and other emergencies with potential international public health implications also requires technical advice to develop adequate surveillance activities. Innovative methods for screening information will no doubt become a priority as definitions of event-based surveillance, recommendations for implementing activities, and evaluations of surveillance systems are established and grow. Event-based surveillance utilizing the fast electronic communication and news sources on the Internet have been widely successful and will likely continue to help improve event-based surveillance. 32, 33, 47 The Challenges of Integrating Event-Based Surveillance

Our literature review uncovered no systems that are currently part of national programs for surveillance. Instead, they are used intermittently as complementary sources of information. We also have little information about whether or not these systems have been integrated into actual work during real-time health events. The current literature does indicate that event-based surveillance could improve official surveillance activities, but systematic evaluation within a public health agency is needed before it can be realized. 48 This is a circular dilemma, since the willingness to integrate is rooted in the lack of effectiveness studies, yet such effectiveness can be proved only by the structured evaluation of integrated systems.

The number of factors necessary for integrating such services should not be underestimated. These include time-consuming and costly collaboration with statisticians, Internet and media experts, and computer scientists to work on components of data acquisition, data processing and filtering, personalization of results, and automation for dissemination to epidemiologists. Once developed, these technical services will require staff to train and support scientific users (eg, epidemiologists) in monitoring infectious diseases, since such activities are not yet part of regular training programs for epidemiology or public health.

Another challenge is the creation of a strategy to compare and crossverify indicator-based and event-based data, since they can differ, especially in regard to syndromes and locations, which makes it difficult to make conclusions based on specific epidemiologic attributes. 49 Nonetheless, solutions must be found, perhaps newly elaborated epidemiologic ontologies for text mining and a related process of continuous improvement. Can all this be done, and is it worth it?

The benefits to epidemiologists clearly are the data retrieved for analysis and potential public health warnings and intervention. In particular, the data's value to the early warning and detection of outbreaks needs to be demonstrated by evaluating the content found in social media and other Internet data sources. Primary content (ie, firsthand observations) provided by the users themselves is valuable, as it would likely signal a potential health threat more quickly. Here again, a usability study over time is needed to help show how useful primary content would be. Online media, weblogs, scientific and nonscientific discussion forums, and direct electronic communication could help expand event-based surveillance activities, although they may have unforeseen social aspects affecting both the data and the development of a health threat. Learning of the existence of disease through firsthand observations, for example, besides signaling health events can also influence people's perception of what they are observing. If the perceived risk of an outbreak is increased, more firsthand reporting could overinflate the health event. Studies of human behavior and Internet interaction may also help clarify social and behavioral effects (eg, age, gender, education level, income, and personality traits like extraversion, openness, and emotional stability) on content generated by social media and the Internet.

Health authorities who intend to use content from social media and other Internet data also need to consider protection and privacy, such as legal and ethical implications related to using Internet and social media data for public health surveillance. For example, it remains unclear what data may be freely accessed and used and whether or not privacy laws and related issues will prevent the structured analysis of new data. These issues are relevant to any surveillance tool that processes Internet or social media data, especially at governmental institutions. 50 

Even though the importance of social media and Internet-based data to epidemiological surveillance is clear, health agencies have been reluctant to incorporate these data sources into their systems because many technical issues have not yet been addressed. The technologies used in event-based systems must be adapted to the individual perceptions of and interactions with their own epidemiological data and to social media and other data from the Internet. Future work in this field will have wide-reaching implications for investments in systems for early warnings of and responses to health threats across the globe and for optimal public health surveillance in the 21st century.

relevant. Of 827 articles, 584 remained after eliminating 243 duplicates. We carefully reviewed abstracts of the 584 remaining articles and eliminated others based on the full content of each article. The categories for classification were (1) background (ie, articles not directly describing an event-based surveillance system but rather surveillance systems in general) or (2) system (ie, articles describing at least one event-based surveillance system). Those articles categorized as system were further distinguished between those covering only one-off monitoring activities (ie, one-time collection, analysis, and interpretation of health-related data for a defined period only) vs wider surveillance (ie, continuous monitoring, systematic collection, analysis and interpretation of healthrelated data), and, finally, those covering either indicator-based or eventbased data ( Figure A1 ).

Search Results. The combined search terms retrieved 39,000 articles, and after applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria, including a rigorously defined synthesis and extraction methodology, 123 articles were identified as providing ""Background"" information only; 6 articles were identified as describing ""Monitoring Systems""; 166 articles were identified as describing an ""Indicator-Based System""; and 44 articles were identified as describing an ""Event-Based Surveillance"" system. Of those 44 articles, 18 event-based surveillance systems were identified based on reading only the abstracts. After reviewing the full texts of all 44 articles, 5 of the 18 systems that had been classified as ""Event-Based Surveillance"" did not contain sufficient information for assessment and thus were eliminated. A final result of 32 articles enabled us to provide full descriptions based on our rigorous categorical data extraction criteria, which resulted in full descriptions for 13 event-based surveillance systems used in practice.

"Bureau of Health Policy, Ministry of Health and Welfare","This study examined the public's preventive behavioral responses during the 2015 Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) outbreak in Korea and the influencing factors. Two cross-sectional telephone surveys were conducted by Gallup Korea using random digit dialing in June 2015 (n = 2004). The main outcome variables were nonpharmaceutical preventive measures (survey (1): Measures for reducing transmission (handwashing, face masks); and survey (2): Measures for avoiding contact with others). Multiple logistic regression was used to identify the factors influencing preventive behaviors. In survey (1), 60.3% of respondents reported more frequent handwashing and 15.5% reported wearing face masks at least once due to the MERS-CoV epidemic. In survey (2), 41-56% of respondents reported practicing avoidance measures. The concerned group was more likely to practice reducing transmission measures (odds ratio (OR) 4.5; 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.3-6.1) and avoidance measures (OR = 9.6; 95% CI, 6.4-14.4). The respondents who had low trust in president or ruling party had a higher practice rate of reducing transmission measures (OR = 1.7; 95% CI, 1.2-2.6) and avoidance measures (OR = 2.1; 95% CI, 1.2-3.5). Cooperative prevention measures need appropriated public concern based on effective risk communication.","The Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) epidemic in Korea has had a huge impact on Korean society. Beginning on 20 May 2015, after a patient diagnosed with MERS returned from travelling to the Middle East, a total of 186 cases were confirmed, 38 deaths occurred, and 16,693 patients were quarantined [1] . As a result, South Korea became the country with the highest number of MERS cases, apart from Saudi Arabia [2] . In addition, after a person who travelled to China following close contact with a confirmed MERS patient was confirmed with MERS in China, the government and non-governmental organizations expressed concerns that these cases could turn into a pandemic [3] [4] [5] .

To control the spread of an infectious disease such as MERS, there is a need for communication and close cooperation between the government and the people [5] . However, some inappropriate actions of the government in the early stages of the MERS outbreak contributed to the spread of this epidemic. The government did not disclose which hospitals were managing MERS patients in the early stages of the outbreak, which not only increased the fear of the public regarding MERS but also increased the incidence of secondary infections by super-spreaders-who transmit an infection to a significantly greater number of other individuals than average [6] . In addition-unlike the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the USA, which responds to epidemics with several alternative scenarios to be prepared for uncertainty-the Korean government responded to the MERS outbreak in an overly optimistic manner [7] . The government established a national epidemic plan based on the assumption that MERS has low infectivity and set the standard of close contact as more than one hour and within two meters. A study conducted after the MERS outbreak revealed that MERS can be transmitted through short-term contact, and that there is the possibility of airborne transmission in the hospital by super-spreaders [8] [9] [10] .

The cooperation of the population is also necessary to end an epidemic. The World Health Organization (WHO) has stated that from the time of outbreak of an epidemic, it is necessary to engage the community through radio-based activities and to seek cooperation to ensure that the population is prepared to take precautions at the individual level [11] . Previous studies have shown that preventive measures that individuals can practice are effective in reducing disease infection rates. Reducing physical contact between individuals in the workplace was found to reduce the rate of influenza transmission by 23% [12] , and handwashing was reported to reduce the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) [13] .

During the MERS outbreak in 2015, the government recommended wearing face masks and handwashing as preventive measures against MERS. However, no study has been performed yet investigating to what extent these measures were practiced. Identifying the preventive behavioral responses of the public and understanding their influencing factors can serve as an evaluation tool for the government for risk communication during the MERS epidemic, as well as providing basic information for effective communication of risks during future infectious disease outbreaks. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the practice rates of individual nonpharmaceutical preventive measures during the outbreak of MERS in 2015 and to identify the factors influencing their practice.

This study used the results of two surveys conducted by Gallup Korea in June 2015 during the MERS outbreak. Gallup Korea, an affiliation of Gallup International, conducts weekly telephone surveys of adults older than 19 years. The first survey for this study was conducted between June 2nd and 4th, at a time when fear was spreading after 30 cases had been confirmed and the first death caused by MERS had occurred. The second survey was conducted between June 23 and 25 after the high incidence of MERS had decreased and the number of newly confirmed cases was roughly 1-2 per day. The surveys were conducted using mobile and landline random digit dialing in eight cities and provinces. Samples were selected using post-stratification including gender, age, and province. The total number of weighted cases in this survey equals the total number of unweighted cases at the national level. The weights were normalized in order to give proportions and ratio, however not for estimating number of subtotal populations. The survey was conducted by trained interviewers using computer assisted telephone interviewing (CATI). The first survey had 1004 respondents with a response rate of 15.5%; and the second survey had 1000 respondents with a 17.7% response rate.

Measures aimed at preventing MERS practiced at the individual level were investigated by dividing them into reducing transmission behaviors (handwashing and wearing face masks) and risk avoidance behaviors (avoiding outdoor activities, public transportation, visits to healthcare facilities, and crowded places). The name ""MERS"" was present in all questions to elicit responses about behavioral changes related to MERS. The first survey assessed reducing transmission behaviors (June 2-4th) using the following questions:

(a) Do you wash your hands more often than usual because of MERS? (b) Have you ever worn a face mask because of MERS?

The second survey assessed risk avoidance behaviors (June 23-25th) using the following questions:

(a) Did you reduce or avoid outdoor activities or attending meetings this week because of MERS? (b) Did you reduce or avoid using public transportation such as the bus or the subway this week because of MERS? (c) Did you reduce or avoid using healthcare facilities such as hospitals or public health centers this

week because of MERS? (d) Did you reduce or avoid visiting crowded markets, department stores, or large discount stores this week because of MERS?

All questions about nonpharmaceutical preventive behavior required yes/no responses.

Gender, age, occupation, perceived household economic status, residential area, political orientation, and anxiety level regarding MERS were also investigated to identify factors influencing MERS nonpharmaceutical preventive behaviors. Occupation was classified as either unemployed, farming and fishery, self-employed, blue-collar worker, white-collar worker, full-time housewife, or student. Perceived household economic status was classified into five levels as lower, low middle, middle, upper middle, upper. Respondents were classified as metropolitan residents or non-metropolitan residents and distinguished by whether they resided in an area where MERS had occurred or not. Political orientation was classified based on support for the president and the political parties. Support or lack of support for the president was assessed using the options of ""approval"", ""disapproval"", or ""no opinion"", while support for the political parties was assessed based on alignment with the ruling party (Saenuri in 2015), with the opposition party, or by no opinion. Concerns regarding MERS were assessed using the question ""How worried are you about MERS infection?"". Responses were assessed on a four-point scale, with four points indicating ""very worried"" and one point indicating ""not worried at all"". A response of 3-4 points was classified as ""worried"", while a response of 1-2 points was classified as ""not worried"".

The second survey investigated the respondents' education levels and predictions regarding the MERS epidemic. Education level was classified as middle school graduate or below, high school graduate, university graduate, or postgraduate. Predictions for the MERS epidemic were evaluated using the question ""Do you think the MERS epidemic will subside or spread within a few days?"" and required the responses ""controlled,"" ""uncontrolled,"" or ""no opinion"".

Using the results of the telephone surveys, the practice rates of reducing transmission behaviors and risk avoidance behaviors were calculated according to respondent characteristics. Missing values of nonpharmaceutical preventive behaviors variables were 1% or less by personal characteristics variables.

Missing values were dropped from both the descriptive analyses and logistic regression. Logistic regression analysis was performed to explore factors influencing nonpharmaceutical preventive behaviors. Using logistic regression analysis for each reducing transmission behavior and risk avoidance behavior, ""y = 1"" was used when one or more reducing transmission or risk avoidance behaviors were practiced, otherwise ""y = 0"" was used.

This study was reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of Seoul Metropolitan Government-Seoul National University Boramae Medical Center (IRB No. 20190515/07 -2019 -11/062). The need for informed consent was waived by the board. Table 1 shows the practice rates of reducing transmission behaviors according to respondent characteristics. Fifteen percent of all respondents reported wearing face masks because of MERS, and 60% reported that they washed their hands more often than usual because of MERS. Female subjects had higher practice rates of reducing transmission behaviors than male subjects. While practice rates of wearing face masks tended to be more frequent in the lower age group of 19-39 years, practice rates of handwashing were highest among those aged 40-49 years. With respect to occupation, practice rates of reducing transmission behaviors among white-collar workers, housewives, and students were higher than those among other occupations. Farmers and fishermen had the lowest practice rates of reducing transmission behaviors, and none of them reported wearing face masks because of MERS. There was no definitive trend observed with respect to perceived household economic status. Practice rates of reducing transmission behaviors were high in areas affected by MERS and in metropolitan areas. Meanwhile, practice rates of reducing transmission behaviors were high in the groups that did not support the president. Those who did not stand by the ruling party practiced more reducing transmission measures than those who did. In addition, the group concerned about MERS infection showed high practice rates of reducing transmission behaviors. People in this group were 3 times more likely to wear face masks and twice as likely to wash their hands compared with the group that was not worried about infection. Table 2 shows the practice rates of risk avoidance behaviors according to respondent characteristics. Approximately 41-56% of respondents practiced risk avoidance behaviors. The most frequently practiced avoidance behavior was to avoid visiting hospitals and other medical institutions, while the least frequently practiced behavior was to avoid using public transportation. Risk avoidance behaviors were most commonly practiced by females, with the highest rate among those aged 30-39 years. The higher the education level, the higher the practice rate was. Housewives and white-collar workers had high practice rates; while unemployed, blue-collar and self-employed workers had low practice rates. There was no definitive trend observed with respect to perceived household economic status. There were no differences in reducing transmission measures between MERS-affected areas and non-affected areas, as well as between metropolitan and non-metropolitan areas. The group that did not indicate support for the president and the ruling party had high practice rates of risk avoidance behaviors. In addition, perception of MERS led to different risk avoidance behaviors. Risk avoidance behaviors were more commonly practiced among those who were worried about MERS infection as compared with the non-worried group, worried people were also twice as likely to practice all reducing transmission measures. The group more likely to predict that MERS would spread also had high rates of risk avoidance behaviors. Table 3 shows the factors associated with nonpharmaceutical preventive behaviors for MERS. The strongest associated characteristic related to both reducing transmission behaviors and risk avoidance behaviors was concern about MERS infection. Compared with the non-worried group, groups that were worried about MERS infection were 4.5 times more likely to practice reducing transmission behaviors and 9.6 times more likely to practice risk avoidance behaviors. Female participants were more likely to engage in nonpharmaceutical preventive behaviors than male participants were (odds ratio (OR), 1.5-1.7), while other demographic and socioeconomic characteristics such as age, education level, perceived household economic status, and area of residence were not significantly associated with preventive behaviors. Figure 1 shows the difference in practice rates of measures by political affiliations. The group that indicated support for the president had high practice rates of reducing transmission behaviors (OR, 1.8). The group that did not support the ruling party had low rates of reducing transmission behaviors (OR, 0.6) and high rates of risk avoidance behaviors (OR, 2.1). The rate of avoidance behaviors was found to not be significant, although it was found to be high among groups that predicted that MERS would spread (OR, 1.4). 

Adjusted odds ratios of nonpharmaceutical preventive behaviors according to political orientation.

This study found that about half of respondents practiced preventive behaviors and showed different preventive behavioral responses. Previous studies that investigated preventive behaviors during prevalent infectious diseases also showed that the practice rates of various preventive behaviors differed and that the practice rates of clear and practical preventive behaviors were high [14, 15] . According to a survey on preventive behaviors in the early stages of the influenza A virus subtype H1N1 outbreaks in 2009, there was a greater proportion of participants who washed their hands more often or avoided people with cold symptoms (55-67%) than of those who avoided crowded places, avoided contact with certain races, or cancelled their travel plans (13-27%) [14] . In a study on preventive behaviors during the SARS epidemic in 2003, practice rates of hygienic behaviors such as handwashing, wearing face masks, and household disinfection were also high at 65-87%; while rates of avoidance of certain places such as markets or hospitals as well as using public transportation were low at 24-75% [15] . As this study reported a low rate of wearing face masks, a behavioral characteristic similar to handwashing, further studies on the factors prompting face mask use are needed.

Despite the high level of public concern regarding infection during the 2015 MERS epidemic (52-67%) compared with the SARS epidemic in Hong Kong in 2003 (9-48%), a lower preventive behavioral response rate of 15-60% was seen with the MERS outbreak, as compared with the rate of 24-87% with the SARS epidemic [15] . This indicates that measures should be taken to increase preventive behaviors for infectious diseases. It is desirable to educate the population regarding health and preventive behaviors for infectious diseases regularly at schools and public institutions. Knowledge of the effectiveness of preventive behaviors increases the practice of such behaviors [16, 17] . In addition, education would not only promote a positive perception of preventive behaviors but also improve the quality of preventive behaviors [18, 19] .

According to a multiple logistic regression analysis performed to assess influencing factors, the characteristic with the highest level of association with preventive behaviors was concern about MERS infection. This is consistent with the results of previous studies [17, 20, 21] . Studies that investigated the relationships between perceived risk, anxiety, and preventive behaviors of the public during the H1N1 influenza epidemic found that the more seriously the public perceived MERS symptoms to be, the more likely they were to practice preventive behaviors [17] . A study conducted among nursing students during the 2015 MERS epidemic also indicated that the higher the perceived risk is, the greater the practice of preventive behavior [21] . Female participants, as well as the group that did not support the president or ruling party, were reported to have high practice rates of preventive behaviors. However, additional research is needed to understand why the use of reducing transmission measures had low odds ratios in the group who supported the opposition party. Some observers contend that the government's attitude in the early stages of the MERS outbreak led to the distrust of the public in MERS response measures [22] , resulting in high practice rates of preventive behaviors in the group with low confidence in the government and its response measures. On the other hand, there were no significant differences in rates of preventive behaviors according to major socioeconomic characteristics such as income or education level. However, given that some hierarchy-specific trends in socioeconomic variables were observed, these results might be due to the limited number of study subjects [23] .

The fact that concern about MERS infection affects preventive behaviors suggests the benefits of public communication as a means of crisis management in the event of an infectious disease outbreak. In the early days of the MERS outbreak, the government did not specify details regarding scientifically uncertain information in order to reduce public anxiety over the crisis, nor did it disclose which hospitals the confirmed patients had visited. This resulted in increased public distrust in the government [7] . Therefore, knowing that awareness and concern regarding infectious diseases trigger preventive behaviors, it is important to disclose all information on known facts and uncertainties rather than releasing limited information in the hope of reducing public anxiety, so that the government can advise the public to respond with the proper knowledge and appropriate measures.

This study has some limitations. First, the study had a cross-sectional design. It could not reveal causal associations between personal characteristics and preventive behaviors-rather, it could only suggest their relevance. Particularly, it is impossible to state at this time that political affiliation actually led to greater preventive efforts. In addition, changes in preventive behaviors according to changes in the MERS epidemic were not observed, since only one investigation for each specific preventive behavior was conducted. Second, this study could not evaluate the adequacy of preventive behaviors, because it only included questions focusing on whether or not participants practiced these behaviors. It would be useful to evaluate preventive behaviors of respondents qualitatively if questions about the circumstances and frequencies of preventive behavior practice were surveyed in future studies. Finally, bias due to non-response may occur as the characteristics of survey respondents and non-respondents differed. Nevertheless, post-stratification was used to reduce nonresponse bias in surveys, the probability of nonresponse was not equal by characteristics variables within post-strata. However, if the survey period was extended to reduce bias caused by non-response, it is possible that the reaction of the public to crises could change during the course of the investigation [24] .

Despite having a few limitations, this study is meaningful in that it is the first to evaluate preventive behavioral responses of the public during the MERS outbreak in Korea and to present various factors influencing behaviors. The frequency and ease of international travel has created an environment that facilitates the easy spread of infectious diseases between countries. In order to prevent infectious disease epidemics, collective efforts are required on the part of the government and the people. Education on preventive behaviors and appropriate risk communication strategies for the public will be a cornerstone in preventing national infectious disease crises such as the 2015 MERS outbreak.

Mandating influenza vaccinations for health care workers: analysing opportunities for policy change using Kingdon's agenda setting framework,"Background: The consequences of annual influenza outbreaks are often underestimated by the general public. Influenza poses a serious public health threat around the world, particularly for the most vulnerable populations. Fortunately, vaccination can mitigate the negative effects of this common infectious disease. Although inoculating frontline health care workers (HCWs) helps minimize disease transmission, some HCWs continue to resist participating in voluntary immunization programs. A potential solution to this problem is government-mandated vaccination for HCWs; however, in practice, there are substantial barriers to the adoption of such policies. The purpose of this paper is to identify the likelihood of adopting a policy for mandatory immunization of HCWs in Ontario based on a historical review of barriers to the agenda setting process. Methods: Documents from secondary data sources were analysed using Kingdon's agenda setting framework of three converging streams leading to windows of opportunity for possible policy adoption. Results: The problems, politics, and policies streams of Kingdon's framework have converged and diverged repeatedly over an extended period (policy windows have opened and closed several times). In each instance, a technically feasible solution was available. However, despite the evidence supporting the value of HCW immunization, alignment of the three agenda setting streams occurred for very short periods of time, during which, opposition lobby groups reacted, making the proposed solution less politically acceptable. Conclusions: Prior to the adoption of any new policies, issues must reach a government's decision agenda. Based on Kingdon's agenda setting framework, this only occurs when there is alignment of the problems, politics, and policies streams. Understanding this process makes it easier to predict the likelihood of a policy being adopted, and ultimately implemented. Such learning may be applied to policy issues in other jurisdictions. In the case of mandatory influenza vaccinations for HCWs in Ontario, it seems highly unlikely that a new policy will be adopted until perception of the problem's importance is sufficient to overcome the political opposition to implementing a solution and thus, create a window of opportunity that is open long enough to support change.","The consequences of annual influenza outbreaks are often underestimated by the general public. This circumstance may be due in part to a large proportion of healthy young adults experiencing only minor symptoms [1] , which has contributed to a lack of public awareness and complacency regarding the severity of its effects on vulnerable populations such as the elderly and individuals that are immunocompromised. Despite this misconception, influenza poses a serious public health threat around the world. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that annual influenza epidemics cause 3 to 5 million cases of severe illness worldwide, along with 250,000 to 500,000 annual deaths [2] . These epidemics are also associated with overwhelmed clinics and hospitals, many of which need to account for increased staff absenteeism and productivity losses due to illness of health care workers (HCWs) [2] .

The impact of annual influenza epidemics on some of the most susceptible populations, such those living with chronic conditions, is even more striking. Global metaanalyses of risk factors for severe disease from pandemic influenza found that 31 % of patients hospitalized had at least one other chronic medical condition, as did 52 % of those admitted to intensive care units and 62 % of fatal cases [3] . In the United States, individuals who were 65 or older consistently accounted for approximately 90 % of all influenza related deaths between 1976 and 2007 [3] .

Fortunately, vaccination can mitigate the negative effects of this common infectious disease. During the influenza seasons of 2010-2012, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that influenza vaccination helped reduce children's risk of influenza-related intensive care unit admissions by 74 % [4] . The use of vaccinations has also been associated with a 77 % reduction in influenzarelated hospitalization among adults aged 50 or over [5] . In addition, rates of influenza infections were found to be lower in vaccinated HCWs versus unvaccinated HCWs [6] and other healthy adults [7] . However, while vaccination may reduce the risk of influenza in HCWs, a recent systematic review reported the reduced risk to be less than 50 % as compared to HCWs who are not vaccinated; which suggests the need for additional solutions beyond HCW vaccinations [6] . Furthermore, recent reviews highlight the lack of clear evidence to support the benefit of vaccinating HCWs [8] to prevent the spread of influenza to elderly [1] .

Within high-income countries, influenza vaccination is readily accessible and many jurisdictions have implemented publicly funded programs to cover the cost [9] . However, public vaccination uptake has been variable [10, 11] , and perhaps more importantly, some HCWs continue to resist participation in vaccination programs.

For example, in Canada, voluntary uptake of the seasonal influenza vaccine by HCWs remains below the 90 % recommended level [12] and varies substantially across health care organizations [13] . Other studies have reported that in some locations more than 50 % of physicians also fail to take advantage of the annual influenza vaccination [13] . Inadequate levels of HCW immunization can place the vulnerable populations they care for at greater risk of health complications [14] .

A potential solution to this problem is governmentmandated inoculation for HCWs. However, in practice, there are substantial barriers to the adoption of such policies. For instance, the attitudes of HCWs in the United States toward whether to be vaccinated against influenza or not remains divided, prompting a backlash against suggestions of any mandatory policies [15] . Surveys have revealed multiple reasons why HCWs disapprove of mandated vaccination. These include beliefs that the decision to be vaccinated is personal, fears of side effects, and concern that influenza vaccines are ineffective [15] . There have also been legal obstacles to mandating vaccination as worker unions and professional associations have argued that such policies violate individual rights and freedoms [16] . Specifically, in Canada, it has been argued that mandated immunization violates one's right to refuse unwanted medical treatment under section 7 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms [16] .

New public policies are rarely adopted based solely on supportive evidence, public opinion, or interest group lobbying; rather, they typically require a confluence of events that is difficult to predict or orchestrate. Through the use of relevant frameworks, theories, or models, policy analysis can provide a greater understanding of the various processes involved and, in turn, enhance the likelihood of recognizing and seizing opportunities for new policies to be adopted [17] . In this vein, Kingdon's [18] three process streams framework helps to explain how three elements or ""streams""-problems, politics, and policiesaffect policy agenda setting dynamics. Kingdon argues that, while there is some interplay among the streams, they are largely independent of one another [18] . This framework can be used to explain how issues may make their way onto the government's decision agenda, which is a key step in the policy adoption process. The purpose of this paper is to identify the likelihood of adopting a policy for mandatory immunization of HCWs in Ontario based on a historical review of barriers to the agenda setting process.

Background information regarding the effectiveness and uptake of influenza vaccinations was gathered via narrative review, which included academic and newspaper articles, as well as government reports. Subsequently, these materials were analysed using Kingdon's agenda setting framework of three converging streams leading to windows of opportunity for possible policy adoption. No permissions to analyse the data used in this study were necessary or granted.

The authors independently categorized historical events as falling primarily into the problems, politics, or policies stream (see Table 1 ). Categories are based on Kingdon's description as noted below. Any discrepancies in classification were resolved through discussion.

In Kingdon's framework, the problems stream involves the identification of a particular social problem that has gained public or decision-maker attention and cannot be easily ignored. These problems may come to light through awareness of a change in an indicator, such as an increased infection rate, or a focusing event/crisis, such as the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003. In the politics stream, the governmental agenda is formulated and the list of issues or problems to be given attention is prioritized. This stream is impacted by political events (such as changes in public opinion/national mood), and organized forces (such as a change in government due to elections). In the policies stream, experts analyse the various problems, and suggest technically feasible and politically acceptable solutions to them.

Generally, the three streams flow independently of one another; however, a time-limited window of opportunity may open when these streams converge (as politically acceptable solutions to prioritized problems are identified). At this point of convergence, issues are most likely to reach the government's decision agenda-where policy problems and their proposed solutions are under active discussion by government decision-makers-and thus, most likely to result in the adoption of a new policy. Policy windows can also close rapidly. This tends to occur when: problems, politics, and policies are not adequately linked together; initiatives that are implemented lead to either failure or success; indicators of severity lessen; other critical items push the issue off the agenda; there has been movement through an ""issue attention cycle"" (i.e., a gradual decline of interest in the condition).

Using Kingdon's agenda setting framework (three process streams that lead to windows of opportunity when they converge) the objective of this paper is to analyse the likelihood of government adopting a mandatory vaccination policy for HCWs in Ontario.

Ontario endured through a difficult 1999-2000 influenza season. Hospital emergency departments experienced serious overcrowding [19] , which resulted in less access to health services for patients seeking critical care. This unfavourable set of circumstances was a focusing event/crisis (problems stream) that resulted in heightened media attention and highlighted the need for government action (politics stream) [19] . During this period, an effective influenza vaccine that had been used as part of a public program in other jurisdictions was available, suggesting that mandatory vaccination was a technically viable and politically acceptable solution (policies stream).

In July 2000 it was announced that Ontario would be the first province in the country to offer free influenza vaccinations to all citizens for the upcoming season to relieve the aforementioned pressure on emergency departments [19] . Ontario's Universal Influenza Immunization Program (UIIP) is offered annually through the Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care (MOHLTC), with the goal of reducing the number of influenza cases and the associated negative impact on the health care system. All individuals who live, work, or attend school in the province, and are 6 months of age or older, are covered by the program [20] . In recent years, UIIP has increased the accessibility of vaccinations by making them available at a variety of locations such as employer-sponsored clinics and pharmacies [20] .

By immunizing a critical mass of the general population, as well as HCWs, it was expected that there would be a dramatic reduction to the death toll as well as the social and economic costs associated with annual influenza outbreaks. Studies have shown that since introducing UIIP in Ontario, the number of reported cases of influenza has [22] . Despite broad public acceptance and substantial participation in the voluntary immunization program, pockets of HCW resistance persisted (politics stream), and outbreaks in long-term care facilities and hospitals continued to occur, resulting in preventable illness and death [23] . As a consequence, Ontario's MOHLTC attempted to promote voluntary vaccination of HCWs by requiring health care facilities to report vaccination rates [24] . By winter 2002, UIIP was in its second year and the issue of mandatory vaccination of HCWs was beginning to become controversial and disputed in the courts [25] . When a health care system in Hamilton instituted a mandatory vaccination policy during outbreaks, or work suspension for non-compliance, 15 staff members refused inoculation and were removed from duty without pay. This led to arbitration where the union presented its case as forced medical treatment. The arbitrator agreed with the union position citing that the policy was not supported by regulatory or statutory authority. In the decision, the arbitration board declared a violation of section 7 of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, which assures security of the person. Mandatory influenza vaccination, the arbitrator decided, was a forced medical act and therefore, contravened the Charter (St. Peter's Health System v. CUPE local 778, 2002) [25] .

Around the same time, a paramedic working in Ontario was making a constitutional challenge against the addition of annual influenza immunization to the Ontario Ambulance Act (North Bay Hospital v. CUPE local 139, 2003) [25] . His challenge also argued that mandatory immunization violated section 7 of the Charter. Pressure from the unions resulted in an amendment to the Ambulance Act in 2002, replacing mandatory vaccination with a requirement for influenza education. These cases/ political events represented a coordinated force in opposition to the mandatory vaccination initiative (politics stream). As a result, the problems, politics and policies streams were no longer aligned, closing the window of opportunity for policy change.

After the SARS outbreak, significant changes came to the public health system in Canada, bolstering pandemic preparedness and the ability to monitor emerging disease [26] . When an arbitration board faced a union challenging mandatory influenza vaccination, this time in British Columbia, the arbitrator sided with the employer noting a requirement for general immunization in the union collective agreement. In this case the employee had choices: vaccination, anti-viral medication, or to be off work without pay. The arbitrator ruled that the choices, which were not dealt with in the St. Peter`s decision, meant there was no violation of the Charter under section 7. An important note in the decision summary was the rationale that preventing the spread of influenza to vulnerable populations is clear and was agreed upon by both the employer and the union, which allowed for a realignment of the policies stream with problems and politics streams.

May 2009 saw the first wave of the H1N1 pandemic influenza strain. By July 2009, the Public Health Agency of Canada reported it still did not have a plan in place to manage HCWs who refused the seasonal influenza vaccine [27] . The seasonal vaccine did not include protection from the novel H1N1 strain and thus, worldwide production of a vaccine was implemented. Stories of production delays, low vaccine supplies, and rationing caused long lines at vaccination clinics and resulted in public anxiety [28] . Even after this pandemic experience, uptake of the vaccine by HCWs the following season remained low [23] . The H1N1 pandemic could have resulted in the opening of a new policy window, but with the relatively mild nature of the H1N1 strain, the mandatory vaccination issue did not gain adequate or sustained public attention (politics stream), closing another window of opportunity.

A long-awaited economic appraisal of Ontario's UIIP was published in 2010 [21] . Based on a measure of qualityadjusted life years, the study concluded that UIIP was cost-effective and might be considered for adoption in other provinces and countries with similar populations, health care models, and influenza rates. This evidence bolstered Ontario's influenza vaccination program and may have served as a catalyst to support further expansion of the program to include mandatory HCW vaccination, however, it was not sufficient to make mandatory vaccination a politically acceptable option.

In other jurisdictions, most notably the US, consideration of mandatory vaccination for HCWs was gaining momentum. A large US health care employer had published their successful program requiring influenza immunization for employment [14] . In Canada, the province of British Columbia initiated a task force in 2011 to investigate and recommend plans for mandatory immunization programs [29] . The task force visited nine US sites with programs in place before making recommendations in 2012 to the provincial government.

Pressure on the Ontario government to act intensified as both the evidence and prominent organizations supported mandatory HCW vaccination. For instance, the Influenza Surveillance Protocol for Ontario Hospitals was revised and included the National Advisory Committee on Immunization statement that ""… refusal of health care workers who have direct patient contact to be immunized against influenza implies failure in their duty of care to their patients [30] ."" The Association of Medical Microbiology and Infectious Disease also presented a position paper supporting mandatory immunization acknowledging that all efforts at voluntary programs had failed [19] . Public Health Ontario, The Canadian Medical Association Journal, and The American Academy of Pediatrics joined in the call for mandatory immunization [31] .

In July 2012, the British Columbia government announced a new policy that would require either influenza immunization or the wearing of a surgical mask for all HCWs during influenza season when in direct patient contact. By October 2012 the Health Sciences Association of British Columbia union had filed a grievance citing privacy issues relating to the Freedom of Information and Privacy Act (FIPA) and violations of the Human Rights Code, the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, and their collective union agreement [29] . Facing an election the following spring, the incumbent government did not repeal the policy but announced that it would wait for the outcome of the arbitration hearing and that workers who did not comply in the 2012-13 season would not face disciplinary action [32] . The government revised and softened the policy in July before going to arbitration [29] . The decision was released in October and the arbitrator had sided with the employer. It was determined the policy aligned with FIPA and there were no violations to the union agreement, the Charter of Rights and Freedoms or the Human Rights Code.

This court ruling provided the Ontario government, and health care organizations, with greater assurances that movement in the direction of mandatory vaccination for HCWs could be a viable policy option subject to HCWs being given some limited alternative to vaccination. Despite this, the Ontario government did not step forward with a consistent policy for the province. In an effort to fill this vacuum, numerous high profile Ontario hospitals announced plans to implement a mandatory ""vaccinate or mask"" policy that would require HCWs who chose not to get vaccinated to wear a mask during the influenza season [33] . Even though the Canadian Nurses' Association supported mandatory influenza vaccinations for HCWs, the Ontario Nurses' Association filed a grievance in opposition to the ""vaccinate or mask"" policy adopted by several Ontario hospitals. Following several weeks of testimony, the arbitrator found that the policy was unreasonable (policies stream) [34] . Concerns identified included that wearing a mask revealed personal health information about the HCWs decision not to vaccinate, masks were not effective, and the policy was designed to coerce HCWs [34] . This ruling leaves Ontario hospitals with no clear policy direction for the foreseeable future.

By analysing the progress of mandatory HCW immunization through the lens of Kingdon's framework, the separate streams of problems, politics, and policies can be seen to converge and diverge repeatedly over an extended period (policy windows have opened and closed several times). Since the implementation of UIIP in Ontario, there have been several potential opportunities to pursue a mandatory HCW vaccination policy. In each instance a technically feasible solution was available (policies stream). However, despite the policy's importanceprotecting the public-the problem's prominence (problems stream) and the political environment (politics stream) only aligned with the policies stream for a very short period of time. During these periods there was inadequate support for the issue to remain on the government's decision agenda long enough to result in the adoption of a new policy. In part, this seems to have been due to other problems gaining prominence and displacing the issue of mandatory vaccination of HCWs from a priority position. In addition, each time this issue gained prominence, opposition lobby groups reacted, making the proposed solution less politically acceptable.

Although the call for mandatory HCW vaccination has withstood some legal challenges-including to the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, The Freedom of Information and Privacy Act, and the Human Rights Code-there remains small but committed groups who continue to oppose such a policy. As a result, it seems highly unlikely that a mandatory HCW vaccination policy will be adopted by the Ontario government until perception of the problem's importance is sufficient to overcome the political opposition to implementing a solution.

In his book 'Blindness', José Saramago tells the story of a city struck by an epidemic of 'white blindness'. This is not the darkness or blackness that most of us associate with blindness. Instead, in this blindness, everything is white, as if, according to one man in the early pages of the book, 'I were caught in a mist or had fallen into a milky sea'. 1 Those who are blind are placed in quarantine in a disused mental hospital, with food delivered to the main entrance three times daily. Inside the hospital, the ugly side of humanity is revealed as the strong take control of the food supplies and assault the women. Beyond the hospital walls, the epidemic, initially a trickle of baffling cases, spreads to affect the whole city until, finally, soldiers no longer maintain the quarantine and the blind leave the hospital. The story follows a small band of people as they venture back into the city, led by one woman who still has her sight. Through their experiences, we see the chaos of a city where all social infrastructures have broken down and people do their best to survive in their new grim reality.

Our ability to respond to the social and economic disruption that may be caused by an outbreak of a serious infectious disease may be tested should the world experience another influenza pandemic.

Following an outbreak in 2004 of a highly pathogenic avian influenza caused by the H5N1 virus, the World Health Organization noted in 2005 that 'the world has moved closer to a pandemic than at any time since 1968'. 2 More recently, Dr Margaret Chan, Director-General of the World Health Organization, has noted that 'For the first time in history, the world has been watching the conditions that might start an influenza pandemic unfold in real-time'. 3 While human-to-human transmission of the virus has yet to be established, by 19 June 2008, there had been 385 cases of human infection with the H5N1 virus, including 243 deaths, primarily in South East Asian countries. The World Health Assembly has called on its member states to develop national preparedness plans, 4 and the World Health Organization has provided recommendations 5 and checklists 6 for national plans. While many countries have taken steps to develop preparedness plans for an influenza pandemic, variations between countries and gaps in the plans are still evident. 7 In the UK, a 2005 House of Lords Science and Technology Committee report noted that government figures estimated that illness-related absenteeism from work during a pandemic could cut gross domestic product (GDP) by £3-7 billion, while pandemicrelated excess mortality could cut GDP by an additional £1-7 billion (0.37-2.5% mortality). 8 In Australia, the impact of pandemic influenza in the absence of an effective vaccine and if containment fails has been estimated at 13,000-44,000 deaths, 57,900-148,000 hospitalizations and 1-7.5 million outpatient visits. 9 At global level, 'even in one of the more conservative scenarios, it has been calculated that the world will face up to 233 outpatient visits, 5.2 million hospital admissions and 7.4 million deaths globally, within a very short period'. 10 The sudden and dramatic increase in demands upon the health system during a pandemic would challenge already-stretched health resources and personnel, highlighting the need for health systems to have in place plans for surge capacity to respond to disasters and health emergencies. 11 In addition, absenteeism in the community more generally could challenge the continuity of critical infrastructures, such as power, telecommunications and water, upon which hospitals rely. 12 While the social disruption arising from pandemic influenza would be considerably less than the total social breakdown portrayed in Saramago's story, 'Blindness' reminds us of the fragility of our current lives and the speed with which our worlds can be turned upside down. It reminds us of how selfish and uncaring people can be when they are scared and feel threatened, and how quickly order can descend into chaos. It also tells of the courage and strength of the human spirit when faced with danger.

This paper talks about the role that law can play in providing some certainty for times of chaos. Legal frameworks can clarify the rights and duties of individuals, communities and governments for times of crisis, and public discussions around these issues can themselves help to alleviate community anxiety. In thinking about the legal framework, there are two main issues to be addressed. First, there is a need for an understanding of the role of law in public health at state, national and international levels, and the need for jurisdictional clarity when differing levels of law and government intersect. These legal frameworks are important, for they define the scope of government responses to public health emergencies at local, national and international level. Secondly, our understandings of the role of law in responding to pandemics are necessarily informed by relational bonds between individuals in society, and by the meanings of rights and responsibilities for public health laws when dealing with infectious disease.

Gostin has defined public health law as 'the study of the legal powers and duties of the state to assure the conditions for people to be healthy . and the limitations on the power of the state to constrain the autonomy, privacy, liberty, proprietary, or other legally protected interests of individuals for the protection or promotion of community health'. 13 Reynolds points out that 'Public health law is a disparate collection of laws and government responses, with its common feature a focus on the population rather than the individual'. 14 While law plays an important part in shaping the role of state action and intervention in the health of individuals and communities, the scope of these state powers is shaped by a range of factors including: the nature and traditions of the legal system in the country in question; cultural understandings of the individual, the community and the state and of the relationships between them; and the wealth or poverty of the country and its people. As Magnusson points out, in the context of liberal democracies, debates about the boundaries and meanings of public health law reflect 'competing claims about the boundaries for the legitimate exercise of political and administrative power'. 15 Our understandings of law and ethics, and indeed of health itself, are culturally and historically specific, requiring dialogue and cooperation for effective global responses to issues of common concern.

The legal framework for public health in Australia is made up of a mixture of federal and state legislation, with quarantine powers reserved to the Federal Government in the Australian Constitution, 16 and the states having control over other public health matters. The reality is somewhat more complex than this suggests, as the Federal Government can achieve public health objectives through the use of its other constitutional powers, such as the grants power in Section 96 of the Constitution which allows the Federal Government to make financial grants to the states, and the spending power in Section 81 which allows the Federal Government to fund health programs. 17, 19 However, while the Federal Government can seek to use its other constitutional powers to achieve health-related objectives, it is important to realize that the power under Section 51(ix) of the Constitution to make laws 'with respect to quarantine' is the only power relating to communicable diseases directly given to the Federal Government in the Constitution, and that this, in turn, shapes Australian debates about government responses to public health issues and emergencies.

While the absence of comprehensive health-related powers for the Federal Government in the Constitution may seem surprising given our contemporary reliance on a national public health insurance system (Medicare), and the general trend in Australia away from federalism and towards centralization, 18 it is important to remember that these are more contemporary features of the Australian political landscape and were not in existence at the time of federation and the drafting of the Constitution in the opening years of the 20th Century. 19 Australia's geographic location and the fact that it is an island continent have influenced Australia's historic approach to quarantine. Maglen has argued that while England increasingly relied upon sanitary measures in the 19th Century for protection against disease, quarantine remained an important tool against imported disease in the Australian colonies of the time. 20 New South Wales introduced Australia's first quarantine legislation with the Quarantine Act 1832, and federal quarantine legislation was adopted in 1908.

Australia's Quarantine Act 1908 (Cth) sets out the powers and procedures for the administration of quarantine in Australia. Under the Act, the scope of quarantine is quite broad and covers a range of measures which aim to prevent or control 'the introduction, establishment or spread of diseases or pests that will or could cause significant damage to human beings, animals, plants, other aspects of the environment or economic activities'. 21 The Act defines a quarantinable disease as 'any disease, declared by the Governor-General, by proclamation to be a quarantinable disease'. 22 Masters of vessels are required to make a notification to a quarantine officer if prescribed symptoms or a prescribed disease is present on board, or if the master 'has reason to believe or suspect' that a quarantinable disease or pest is on board. 23 Individuals or vessels can be ordered into quarantine if they have a quarantinable or communicable disease, 24 and there are also powers to subject individuals to quarantine surveillance in certain circumstances. 25 The Governor-General can declare, by proclamation, that an epidemic exists or that there is the danger of an epidemic, and while the proclamation exists the Minister may give directions and take actions necessary to control, eradicate or remove the danger of the epidemic by way of quarantine or measures incidental to quarantine. 26, 27 The Quarantine Act 1908 is focused on preventing quarantinable diseases at ports of entry into Australia. While there is still benefit in this focus, it is inadequate for a world where international travel is now primarily by aircraft, and passengers can travel from one country to another before they even realize that they are sick. 33 As a Canadian report on severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) noted, 'SARS has illustrated that we are constantly a short flight away from serious epidemics'. 28 While previous outbreaks of pandemic influenza have traditionally taken 6-8 months to spread globally, 29 aided by international air travel, pandemic influenza could spread globally within 3 months. 30 This potential for quarantinable diseases to emerge within domestic populations raises questions about the scope and applicability of quarantine laws in these circumstances. However, it has been argued that the broad scope of quarantine under the Act, the fact that quarantine powers are not restricted to ports of entry, and the ability for state laws to be over-ridden in emergencies suggests that the federal quarantine power could also have domestic application. 31 Domestically, state public health laws are also relevant to the notification and control of communicable diseases. In New South Wales, for example, SARS and avian influenza in humans are both notifiable diseases under the Public Health Act 1991. 32 State public health laws also contain a range of measures to enable health authorities to restrict the spread of disease, including powers to require medical testing and, in some cases, powers to restrict movement or to specify treatment of individuals who are regarded as posing a risk to public health. a The intersections between federal and state laws are relevant to Australia's responses to public health threats. As Howse has noted, 'in a public health emergency caused by the spread of an emerging infectious disease, Australia could need to rely on a patchwork of legislative measures to assist it to cope'. 34 In Australia and elsewhere, cross-jurisdictional and interagency cooperation are essential components in effective emergency responses. 35, 36 At an international level, the International Health Regulations (IHR) provide a framework for notification and response to infectious diseases. First introduced in 1951 as the International Sanitary Regulations, and renamed in 1969, the IHR required Member States to notify the World Health Organization of cases of plague, cholera and yellow fever. Prior to 1981, smallpox was also on the list of notifiable diseases. However, the IHR became increasingly irrelevant during the 20th Century with the re-emergence of old diseases such as tuberculosis, the emergence of new diseases such as SARS, and the threat of biological weapons. 37, 38 A revised version of the IHR was adopted in 2005 and took effect from 2007. The IHR (2005) seek to balance public health responses to disease against the needs of international traffic and trade, and rest on the principle that public health responses should not unnecessarily interfere with international traffic and trade. While the IHR (2005) has a list of specified diseases, including SARS and smallpox, which must be notified to the World Health Organization, the IHR (2005) also move beyond the specified-diseases approach and adopt a broader approach with focus on events which could constitute a public health emergency of international concern. Using a decision algorithm, countries are required to assess public health events in order to determine whether the event is a public health emergency of international concern. If the event is of international significance, notification to the World Health Organization is required. The new IHR focus on risks to health, and provide a more flexible and relevant approach to identification of those risks. 39, 40 The IHR (2005) focus on the development, strengthening and maintenance of capacities at national level to respond to public health emergencies of international concern. As outlined above, the legislative frameworks in Australia for public health responses to infectious diseases are shaped by Australia's federal legal system, and will also be relevant to the responses in other countries with a federal structure. In becoming a signatory to the IHR (2005), the USA submitted a reservation to the IHR on the basis of federalism, noting:

'The Government of the United States of America reserves the right to assume obligations under these Regulations in a manner consistent with its fundamental principles of federalism. With respect to obligations concerning the development, strengthening and maintenance of the core capacity requirements,.these Regulations shall be implemented by the Federal Government or the state governments, as appropriate and in accordance with our Constitution, to the extent that the implementation of these obligations comes under the legal jurisdiction of the Federal Government. To the extent that such obligations come under the legal jurisdiction of the state governments, the Federal Government shall bring such obligations with a favourable recommendation to the notice of the appropriate state authorities.' b

In Australia, the pandemic influenza planning process has taken a whole of government approach, with the planning process involving both federal and state levels of government. In 2007, the National Health Security Act 2007 (Cth) was passed. Part 2 of the Act deals with public health surveillance and has as its objects: provision of a national public health surveillance system to enhance the ability of Commonwealth, States and Territories in identifying and responding to 'public health events of national significance'; information sharing with the World Health Organization and 'countries affected by an event relating to public health or an overseas mass casualty'; and 'to support the Commonwealth, and the States and Territories in giving effect to the International Health Regulations'. 41 In April 2008, the Commonwealth, State and Territory governments signed the National Health Security Agreement to support the National Health Security Act and to ensure a coordinated approach between the different levels of government in the event of a public health event of national significance. In 2006, the National Pandemic Influenza Exercise, Exercise Cumpston 06 enabled the testing and assessment of Australia's pandemic preparedness through the use of a comprehensive simulation exercise. 42 

Quarantine laws and public health laws do give governments some fairly broad powers to declare quarantine and to restrict the movement of individuals. There is a very real sense in which these powers may well be needed in order to ensure an effective public health response to pandemic influenza. However, these laws are also clearly situated within a broader social context. Our perceptions of individual liberty and individual rights have undergone considerable evolution since most of our public health laws were originally introduced. Today, the public is likely to have high expectations about the preservation of individual liberty and freedom of movement. These expectations underpin the political context for the development and application of public health laws in Australia. Appropriate responses to these expectations will also play an important role in addressing community unease and potential disobedience to the implementation of response measures. When seeking to clarify public health laws, it is important that we take this broader social context into account.

As Gostin notes in his definition of public health law outlined above, public health laws are not only about articulating the coercive powers of the state for enforcement of public health measures, but also about the limits of state power and the rights of individuals and communities. The language of human rights is increasingly part of the landscape for health law in Australia and a See, for example, Public Health Act 1991 (NSW) s 23. internationally. [43] [44] [45] Given the potential for public health laws to impact upon the freedom of individuals, and the need for public health laws to balance the interests of individuals and society, public health laws will ideally have a transparent ethical framework, articulating the principles upon which state intervention will be premised. 46 The World Health Organization has acknowledged the importance of legal and ethical considerations to pandemic preparedness, noting that public health measures such as quarantine, compulsory vaccination and off-licence use of medicines 'need a legal framework to ensure transparent assessment and justification of the measures that are being considered, and to ensure coherence with international legislation (International Health Regulations)'. 47 Consideration of ethical issues is also essential for, as the World Health Organization has noted, ethical issues 'are part of the normative framework that is needed to assess the cultural acceptability of measures such as quarantine or selective vaccination of predefined risk groups'. 48 The exercise of state powers in terms of quarantine, isolation and detention during a public health emergency is likely to be particularly controversial in Western liberal democracies such as Australia. The extent to which the state can and should exercise its powers in this area has become increasingly relevant in public health, as is clear from debates over detention of tuberculosis patients, 49, 50 and from the use of quarantine during the SARS crisis. 51 Although comparable countries to Australia in Europe, the USA and Canada all have human rights charters or equivalents, which could provide procedural protections and safeguards for citizens in relation to quarantine and detention, Australia has yet to develop a Bill of Rights at the federal level. While Australian state and territory governments have begun enacting human rights legislation, 52 there is no comprehensive inclusion of human rights safeguards in the federal Quarantine Act, which raises issues about the mechanisms for ensuring procedural safeguards in the event of a pandemic. 53 Public health measures directed at implementing social distancing, quarantine or travel restrictions will not only infringe on individual liberties that are often taken for granted in Western societies, but are also likely to have a profound economic impact. As outlined above, estimates indicate that pandemic influenza will have a significant impact on the global economy. At local level, businesses may be closed or experience a reduction in their cash flow as public health measures are introduced or people stay home voluntarily. In such an environment, the economic cost to individuals and businesses may be significant, which in turn demands consideration of development of support systems and compensation systems for those affected. 54 In the USA, a great deal of work has been done on strengthening the public health laws, both generally and specifically for public health emergencies. The Turning Point Public Health Statute Modernization National Collaborative developed the Turning Point Model State Public Health Act. 55 In 2001, the Centre for Law and the Public's Health at Georgetown and Johns Hopkins Universities prepared a Model State Emergency Health Powers Act, setting out the powers for a state of public health emergency. The provisions of the earlier Model State Emergency Health Powers Act were adapted and included in the Turning Point Model Act. 56 Article V of the Turning Point Model Act deals with the powers of public health authorities, including the powers of quarantine and isolation. The Model Act provides that the principles to be applied in relation to quarantine and isolation include that they should be by the least restrictive means necessary to prevent the spread of disease (s 5-108[b](1)). In addition, there is a provision that:

'The needs of individuals who are isolated or quarantined shall be addressed in a systematic and competent fashion, including but not limited to, providing adequate food, clothing, shelter, means of communication with those in isolation or quarantine and outside these settings, and competent medical care.' (s 5-108[b](6)) Article VI of the Turning Point Model Act deals with public health emergencies, and contains provisions addressing: planning for a public health emergency; declaring a state of public health emergency; management of property, safe disposal of infectious waste and human remains, and control of healthcare supplies; protection of individuals; immunity from private liability; and payment of just compensation for the use or appropriation of facilities or materials.

The Turning Point Model Act is intended as a tool to enable governments to assess their existing public health laws. The Turning Point Model Act not only sets out the rights of the state in terms of its coercive powers, but also the responsibilities of the state to care for those who are isolated or quarantined. These matters are important if we are to see public health laws as a matrix of both rights and responsibilities. If individual autonomy is to be constrained in the name of public health, we also need to ensure that individual dignity, and ultimately social dignity, is maintained. Non-pharmaceutical measures may have a significant community impact. Consideration may need to be given to support mechanisms if voluntary, stay-at-home forms of quarantine or isolation are used to limit the spread of influenza in the community. There is also a need to consider the flow-on effects of some of our public health measures. If schools are closed, for example, this may have an immediate impact on the broader workforce in a context, such as the contemporary Australian one, where significant numbers of women with children are in the paid workforce.

Rights and responsibilities are multilayered. They arise at local, national and global levels and at the intersections between these levels. What is clear is that public health rights and responsibilities for infectious disease are global as well as national. If we are to assess the adequacy of our legal frameworks for pandemic preparedness, we also need to assess the adequacy of our laws in terms of their suitability for meeting our international obligations. While developed countries of the world already have sophisticated public health systems, the capacity to meet their obligations under the IHR (2005), and the financial resources to develop national vaccine stockpiles, the developing countries of the world face a very different outlook. 57 As we consider the intersections of law and public health in the context of the shared global risks of an influenza pandemic, it is important to realize that pandemic preparedness must necessarily involve improved international cooperation and the sharing of expertise to assist in capacity building for public health and the regulatory frameworks surrounding it, as well as a renewed dialogue around international obligations to help the world's poorest and least healthy people. 58 Legal analysis must be a key part of our planning for pandemic influenza. It is essential that federal and state laws are harmonized so as to ensure their smooth functioning and to eliminate crossjurisdictional differences and uncertainties. Public health laws also play a key role in setting out the rights and responsibilities of individuals, communities and governments, providing transparency and accountability to the frameworks for decision-making. In contemporary Australian society where there are high expectations of individual rights and freedoms, and of the public health system, public health laws have an important role to play in ensuring that, as far as is possible, the public's health and the public's freedom are both balanced and protected. Effective preparedness for pandemics does not end at national borders. Pandemic influenza will affect all parts of the globe, leaving no country untouched. As we prepare for the next influenza pandemic, we must remember that global cooperation is also an essential part of effective preparedness.

BMC Public Health Distributed data processing for public health surveillance,"Background: Many systems for routine public health surveillance rely on centralized collection of potentially identifiable, individual, identifiable personal health information (PHI) records. Although individual, identifiable patient records are essential for conditions for which there is mandated reporting, such as tuberculosis or sexually transmitted diseases, they are not routinely required for effective syndromic surveillance. Public concern about the routine collection of large quantities of PHI to support non-traditional public health functions may make alternative surveillance methods that do not rely on centralized identifiable PHI databases increasingly desirable.","Timely identification and subsequent reaction to a public health emergency requires routine collection of appropriate and accurate data about the occurrence and location of cases of illness. There is substantial interest in using rou-tinely collected electronic health records to support both the detection of unusual clusters of public health events and the response to public health threats detected by other means. Such data are also useful to reduce an initial alert level, if it is clear that no unusual illness clusters exist in a community. Ideally, such systems operate automatically and include sensitive and specific statistical surveillance software and alerting systems. These are often referred to as syndromic surveillance systems [1, 2] , because they typically rely on the non-specific signs and symptoms that may provide the earliest evidence of a serious public health threat, such as anthrax or SARS.

Many syndromic surveillance systems gather potentially identifiable, individual patient-level encounter records. These records are typically collected without name or address, but they do contain enough identifiers to allow re-identification in some circumstances. The potential for re-identification is greatest when records are collected from ambulatory settings or health systems that supply a unique identifier that allows the very useful identification of repeated visits over time. The risk of disclosing sensitive information that can be linked to the individual also increases when the health care facility provides more than occasional care.

In the United States, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act [3] (HIPAA) specifically exempts transfer, use and retention of identifiable electronic personal health information (PHI) to support public health activities. This exemption also applies to syndromic surveillance activities, although HIPAA was developed before large volumes of such data concerning individuals who are not suspected of having a reportable condition were being used for public health purposes in the absence of any known public health emergency. Despite the exemption, data providers may be unwilling to offer identifiable data for surveillance purposes in the face of increasing awareness of the potential costs of inadvertent disclosure or inappropriate use of PHI. Additionally, their patients may object to their providing it. These concerns are common to many developed countries and under these circumstances, designs that minimise the risk of inadvertent disclosure may be needed in order to gain the cooperation of data custodians, for surveillance systems to be feasible. The focus of this paper is on one such design, in which initial data aggregation is performed to decrease the risk of any PHI being inadvertently disclosed, before the aggregate data is centralised for subsequent statistical analysis. Although the system we describe is currently operating in the United States and many of the implementation details are specific to that context, some of the conceptual issues we describe and some of the lessons we have learned may be directly relevant to public health practice in other countries.

While it is possible to centrally collate and process deidentified records, there is a potential problem with statistical inference if multiple records from the same individual are not distinguished. This problem arises because many statistical analysis techniques applicable to surveillance, such as Generalised Linear Mixed Models [4] (GLMM), depend on the assumption that observations are statistically independent. Inference based on this assumption using ambulatory care encounter data will likely be biased if the model cannot distinguish observations from multiple encounters during a single course of illness from a single individual patient. Although the extent of this bias has not been quantified, the problem is clearly illustrated by real data. In more than half of the individuals with multiple lower respiratory syndrome encounters over a four year period from one large ambulatory care practice, a second encounter with the same syndrome was noted less than 21 days after the first encounter [1] . Our approach to this problem of statistical independence is to aggregate multiple encounters from a single individual into ""episodes"" of illness, and is described in more detail below. Reliably automating this aggregation requires that every patient's records be uniquely identifiable.

To support the National Demonstration Bioterrorism Surveillance Program (NDP), we developed a system in which no PHI leaves the immediate control of the data provider, and only aggregate data is transferred to the datacenter [2, 5] . Each data provider performs initial aggregation of the PHI within their own existing, secured data processing environment, producing data that is aggregated beyond the point where any individual patient is identifiable. Since data processing is distributed to the site of data collection rather than being performed at one central location, we describe this as a distributed processing surveillance system. Although this particular aspect of our work has briefly been mentioned in previous publications [1, 2, [4] [5] [6] , we present it in greater detail here, because we believe that it represents a potentially valuable alternative surveillance system design option that deserves more explanation and wider debate than it has received to date.

The basic principle of distributed processing is simple. Rather than collecting all needed identifiable, individual PHI records centrally for statistical processing, all PHI is pre-processed remotely, and remains secured, under the direct control of the data provider. Only aggregate data are transferred to the central datacenter for additional statistical processing, signal detection, display and distribution. At an appropriate level of aggregation, the risk of inadvertent PHI disclosure becomes very small, and may prove acceptable to data custodians and to individual patients. Although this risk is never completely absent, it is certainly decreased in aggregate data, making this approach far more acceptable to data providers in our experience, than the more traditional approach of centralized collection of directly identifiable PHI.

Before describing our distributed system, we briefly review the more familiar model of centralized aggregation and processing of PHI for surveillance. In the more traditional type of system, individual patient records, often containing potentially identifiable information, such as date of birth and exact or approximate home address, are transferred, usually in electronic form, preferably through some secured method, to a central secured repository, where statistical tools can be used to develop and refine surveillance procedures. One of the main benefits of this data-processing model is that the software and statistical methods can be changed relatively easily to accommodate changes in requirements, because they only need to be changed at the one central location where analysis is taking place. As long as appropriate details have been captured for each individual encounter of interest, the raw data can be re-coded or manipulated in different ways. Only one suite of analysis code is needed, and because it is maintained at a single, central location, costs for upgrading and maintenance are small. Inadvertent disclosure of PHI is always a potential risk with centralized systems. Even where minimally identifiable data are stored in each record, the probability of being able to unambiguously identify an individual increases as multiple, potentially linkable records for that individual accrue over time.

Rather than gathering identifiable PHI information into a central repository for analysis, a distributed system moves some of the initial data processing, such as counting aggregated episodes of care (see below), to the site where the data is being collected. This aggregation minimizes the number of individuals who have access to PHI and diminishes the risk of inadvertent PHI disclosure from the sur-Distributed processing model and data flow Figure 1 Distributed processing model and data flow.

veillance system, while still allowing effective use of the information of interest. The focus of this report is on the model used to collect surveillance data while providing maximum protection for PHI, so the statistical methods we use in the NDP, which have been described elsewhere [4] are not discussed further here.

Data flows for the NDP are illustrated in Figure 1 . Data pre-processing, detection of repeated visits by the same patient for the same syndrome, and data aggregation is performed using a custom software package, written, maintained, and distributed by the NDP datacenter. Data providers maintain complete control of the security of their own PHI and also maintain control over the operation of the data processing software, which runs on one of their secured workstations. Since the pre-processing takes place within a secured environment under the control of the data provider, there is no need for the individual patient identifiers to be divulged to the datacenter. In the case of the NDP [5] , the only data that is centrally collated consists of counts of the number of new episodes of specific syndromes over a defined time period (currently set at each 24 hour period ending at midnight), by geographic area (currently, 5-digit zip code area). More detailed definitions of ""syndromes"" and ""new episodes"" are provided below. Table 1 illustrates the data transferred from each data provider each day to the datacenter for statistical processing, reporting and alerting. Note that the although this data does not contain any obvious identifiers such as date of birth or gender, there is always a risk that a specific individual might be identifiable using additional data, and that this risk is greatest in zip codes with very small populations.

All source code required to build the data processing software is provided to the data provider at installation and whenever the software is updated, so that the local information services staff can check that there are no ""backdoors"" or other ways the distributed software could compromise the security of their systems. All information transferred to the datacenter is stored in text files (in XML format) and can be readily accessed by local staff to ensure that no PHI is being transmitted.

Participating data providers have near real-time ICD9 codes for every encounter, usually assigned by clinicians at the time of the encounter. Since much acute infectious disease manifests as broad suites of nonspecific symptoms, we monitor 13 syndromes -Respiratory, Lower gastro-intestinal (GI), Upper GI, Neurological, Botulism-like, Fever, Hemorrhagic, Skin lesions, Lymphatic, Rash, Shock-death, Influenza-like illness and SARS-like illness. All syndromes except Influenza-like illness and SARS-like illness were defined by a working group led by CDC and Department of Defense [7] . Individual ICD9 codes are used to aggregate encounters into one of these 13 syndromes. The definitions (ICD9 code lists) of 11 of these syndromes are available [7] . The definitions comprising the other two syndromes were developed in consultation with both CDC and the Massachusetts Department of Public Health.

Our surveillance algorithms [4] require statistically independent observations and are based on new episodes of syndromes. Our goal was to distinguish health care encounters that were related to ongoing care for any given episode of acute illness from the initial encounter that indicated the start of a new episode of a syndrome of interest. The derivation of the specific method for identifying first encounters for an episode of illness has been described in more detail elsewhere [1] . We define a new episode to begin at the first encounter after at least a 42day encounter-free interval for that specific patient and that specific syndrome. If there has been any encounter for that specific syndrome for the same individual patient within the previous 42 days, the current encounter is regarded as part of the usual ongoing care for the original encounter that signalled the start of an episode of illness of that syndrome. The start of a new episode for a different syndrome can occur during ongoing encounters for any given specific syndrome -ongoing encounters during an episode are counted as new episodes only if they are outside (i.e. at least 42 days since the last encounter)of an existing episode of the matching syndrome. As will be described later, all ongoing encounters within any syndrome are recorded, and are visible through reports under the control of the data provider, but they do not contribute to the counts that are sent to the datacentre for analysis. All of this processing requires consistent and unique patient identifiers for all encounters. We use the local patient master index record number for this purpose in the software that we provide, but these identifiers are not required once the processing is complete, and they remain under the complete control of the providers.

The distributed software requires the data providers to extract information about encounters of interest (daily, in our case) and convert it into the uniform format used by our distributed software. This kind of uniform representation is required for any multi-source surveillance system and is not peculiar to the distributed model we have adopted. In practice, we found that data providers could easily produce text files containing data as comma separated values in the format which we specified, and which the distributed software has been written to process. However, this requires dedicated programming effort that was supported with resources from the NDP grant.

Our project receives support from the CDC, so we are required to comply with relevant CDC standards.

Although the data being transferred to the datacenter is arguably not identifiable PHI because of the high level of aggregation, we use the Public Health Information Network Messaging System [8] (PHINMS), a freely available, secure, data transfer software suite developed by the CDC, to transfer aggregate data. A PHINMS server operates at the datacenter and each data provider operates a PHINMS client, using a security certificate supplied by the datacenter for encryption and authentication. PHINMS allows fully automated operation at both the datacenter and at each data provider. PHINMS communicates over an encrypted channel and usually requires no special modification to the data provider firewall, since it is only ever initiated by an outgoing request (the data provider always initiates the transfer of new data) and uses the same firewall port and protocol (SSL on port 443) as commercially encrypted services such as internet banking. PHINMS is reasonably robust to temporary connectivity problems, as it will try to resend all messages in the queue until they are delivered. Data transmission is one of the least problematic aspects of maintaining this system. We provide automatic installation software and it runs more or less instantaneously and transparently, without intervention in our experience. No training is needed as the process is fully automated.

All data is transferred to the datacenter in the form of eXtensible Markup Language (XML) since this is a flexible machine-readable representation and is easy to integrate with PHINMS. We used the Python [9] language for the development of the distributed software package. This choice was partially motivated by the fact that Python is an open-source language and thus freely distributable, partly by our very positive experience with Python as a general purpose application development language, and partially because in our experience, Python can be installed, and applications reliably run without any change to source code, on all common operating systems (including Linux, Unix, Macintosh and Windows), making it easy for the datacenter to provide support for systems other than Windows PC's. It is also a language with extensive support for standards such as XML, and securely encrypted internet connections. In addition, our existing web infrastructure has been built with the open-source Zope [10] web application framework, which is written mostly in Python.

A major design goal for our distributed software was that it should offer potentially useful functions for the data provider. This was motivated by our desire to encourage data providers to look at their own data in different ways that might not only help them manage the data more efficiently, but might also help them to more easily identify errors. In our experience, the task of maintaining a system like the one we have developed is far more attractive and interesting to the staff responsible at each participating institution if they gain some tangible, useful and immediate benefits. In addition, easy access to data flowing through our software is useful for ensuring transparency and to facilitate security auditing by each data provider.

The distributed software optionally creates reports that show one line of detailed information about each of the patient encounters that was counted for the aggregate data for each day's processing. These reports are termed ""line lists"" and were designed to support detailed reporting of encounter level data, so that a data provider can quickly make this information available in response to a public health need. Two versions are available, one with and one without the most specific identifying details, such as patient name and address. These standard line lists are used most often to support requests by public health agencies for additional information about the individual cases that contribute to clusters identified in the aggregate data. These lists are never transmitted to the datacenter but may be used to support public health officials investigating a potential event.

When unexpectedly high counts of particular syndromes are detected in geographically defined areas, the datacenter automatically generates electronic alerts, which are automatically routed to appropriate public health authorities. For example, in Massachusetts, electronic messages are automatically sent to the Massachusetts Alert Network within minutes of detection, where they are automatically and immediately forwarded to the appropriate Public Health personnel for follow up. Available alert delivery methods in the Massachusetts system range from email through to an automated telephone text-to-speech delivery system. Responders can configure the alert delivery method for each type of alert they have subscribed to. This alerting system is independent of our distributed system, but in practice, the ready availability of reports in electronic format containing both fully and partially identifiable clinical data for all cases comprising any particular period or syndrome makes the task of the clinical responder much simpler whenever a query is received from a public health official. Electronic reports, containing clinical information and optionally, full identifiers for all encounters can be generated as required, at the provider's site, from where they can immediately be made available to public health agencies. In the NDP's current operational mode (see Figure 1 ), a public health official calls a designated clinical responder to obtain this information. Table 2 ). The ""narrow"" version, which contains fewer identifiers, provides each patient's five-year age group instead of date of birth and does not include the physician ID or medical record number (Table 3) . At the provider's discretion, the clinical responder can provide the ""narrow"" list corresponding to the cases of interest to the public health department. If on this basis public health officials decide that further investigation is warranted, they can call the clinical provider and request a review of medical records, identifying the cases of interest by date and an index number (unique within date) in the narrow line list. The clinician finds the medical record number by looking up the date and index number in the wide line list and then accesses the record itself through the usual HMO-specific means. Resources to support clinical responders were provided through our NDP grant to participating data providers.

It would be straightforward to send detailed lists of encounters that are part of clusters directly to the relevant health department whenever the datacenter detects an event and sends an automated alert to a health department. We have not implemented this feature because all the participating health plans prefer to have an on-site clinical responder participate in the initial case evaluation with the public health agency. It would also be simple to allow designated public health personnel to initiate requests for specific line lists, even when no alert has occurred. Public health officials may, on occasion, wish to inspect the line lists to search for specific diagnoses that do not occur frequently enough to trigger an alert for their syndrome, but may be meaningful in the context of information that arises from other sources.

Although not currently implemented in the NDP, it would be feasible to allow a remote user to perform adhoc queries on the encounter data maintained by the health plan. Examples of these queries include focused assessment of disease conditions affecting subsets of the population or specific diagnoses. This type of direct query capability is currently used at some of the same participating health plans to support the CDC's Vaccine Safety Datalink project [11], a surveillance system that supports post-marketing surveillance of vaccine safety [12] .

This distributed data model supports active surveillance and alerting of public health agencies in five states with 7 participating data providers. The system has proven to be workable, and it supports the syndromic surveillance needs of the participating health departments. There are fixed costs such as programming to produce the standard input files, installation and training, associated with adding each new data provider, so we have focussed our efforts on large group practices providing ambulatory care with substantial daily volumes of encounters, completely paperless electronic medical record systems, and substantial technical resources, since these enable us to capture large volumes of transactions with each installation. Relatively large numbers of encounters are needed to ensure that estimates from statistical modelling are robust. Applying a distributed architecture to surveillance from multiple smaller practices may enable appropriately large numbers of encounters to be gathered, but may prove infeasible because of costs and lack of appropriate internal technical support and because of heterogeneity in the way ICD9 codes are recorded and assigned by each data provider. Once the programming for standard input files is completed, installation and training take approximately one day total, usually spread out over the first two weeks. Nearly all problems are related to providers getting the standard file format contents exactly right, and to transferring these to the

The distributed architecture currently in use by the NDP allows clinical facilities to provide the aggregated information needed to support rapid and efficient syndromic surveillance, while maintaining control over the identifiable PHI and clinical data that supports this surveillance.

The system provides support for the clinical providers to respond quickly to public health requests for detailed information when this is needed. In our experience, such requests involve only a tiny fraction of the data that would be transferred in a centralized surveillance model, providing adequate support for public health with minimal risk of inadvertent disclosure of identifiable PHI.

We believe this design, in which patients' clinical data remains with their own provider under most circumstances, while public health needs are still effectively met, conforms to the public's expectations, and so will be easier to justify if these surveillance systems come under public scrutiny. Many of the details of our approach are specific to the United States context, but the general principle of using distributed processing to minimise the risk of inadvertent PHI disclosure is of potential utility in other developed countries, although the specifics of our implementation may be less useful.

The benefit of decreased risk of inadvertent PHI disclosure from our approach entails three principal disadvantages compared with routine, centralized collection of identifiable data. First, a clinical responder with access to the locally stored PHI data must be available to provide case level information when a cluster is detected. It would be technically straightforward to provide detailed information for relevant cases automatically when signals are detected. We deliberately did not implement this feature in the current system, since the participating health plans expressed a strong preference for direct involvement in this process.

The second disadvantage is the need to pre-specify the syndromes, age groups, and other data aggregation parameters in advance, since changing these requires the distribution of a new release of the aggregation software.

In practice, we have addressed this by means of configura-Distributed software screen, showing results (synthetic data) after daily processing of encounter records Figure 2 Distributed software screen, showing results (synthetic data) after daily processing of encounter records.

tion data for syndrome categories read from a text file as the application loads, so the application code itself does not need alteration. This limitation could be largely overcome by creating a remote query capability to support ad hoc queries on identifiable data that remains in the control of the provider.

The third disadvantage is the technical challenge of maintaining distributed software that must reliably process data that the programmers are not permitted to examine. While the software can be exhaustively tested on synthesized data, we have occasionally encountered subtle problems arising from previously unnoticed errors in the input data. Our experience suggests that when writing this kind of distributed application, extensive effort must be devoted to detecting and clearly reporting errors in the input data before any processing takes place.

An archive of Python source code for the distributed software will be made available by the corresponding author upon request. Unfortunately no resources are available to provide technical or other support outside the NDP.

In summary, we have implemented a near real-time syndromic surveillance system that includes automated detection and reporting to public health agencies of clusters of illness that meet pre-specified criteria for unusualness [5] . This system uses a distributed architecture that allows the participating health care provider to maintain full control over potentially identifiable PHI and health encounter data. The distributed software loads simple text files that can be created from the data stored in virtually any proprietary EMR system. It sends summary data suitable for signal detection algorithms via a freely available messaging system, to a datacenter that can manipulate the aggregated information and combine it with data from other providers serving the same geographic region, and which automatically generates and sends alerts when unusual clusters of syndromes are identified. The distributed software also facilitates efficient access to fully identified patient information when needed for following up a potential event.

EVIDENCE BASED PUBLIC HEALTH POLICY AND PRACTICE Avoidable mortality by neighbourhood income in Canada: 25 years after the establishment of universal health insurance,"Aim: To examine neighbourhood income differences in deaths amenable to medical care and public health over a 25-year period after the establishment of universal insurance for doctors and hospital services in Canada. Methods: Data for census metropolitan areas were obtained from the Canadian Mortality Database and population censuses for the years 1971, 1986, 1991 and 1996. Deaths amenable to medical care, amenable to public health, from ischaemic heart disease and from other causes were considered. Data on deaths were grouped into neighbourhood income quintiles on the basis of the census tract percentage of population below Canada's low-income cut-offs. Results: From 1971 to 1996, differences between the richest and poorest quintiles in age-standardised expected years of life lost amenable to medical care decreased 60% (p,0.001) in men and 78% (p,0.001) in women, those amenable to public health increased 0.7% (p = 0.94) in men and 20% (p = 0.55) in women, those lost from ischaemic heart disease decreased 58% in men and 38% in women, and from other causes decreased 15% in men and 9% in women. Changes in the age-standardised expected years of life lost difference for deaths amenable to medical care were significantly larger than those for deaths amenable to public health or other causes for both men and women (p,0.001).","W ith the establishment of government-funded health insurance for all medically necessary services provided by hospitals in 1957 and by doctors in 1968, the Canadian health insurance system has been organised to ensure access on the basis of health need, rather than income. 1 2 Yet, despite continued gains in average life expectancy, socioeconomic differences in mortality and health continue to exist. 3 4 Persisting health disparities have led to important debates regarding access to and use of health services offered by Canada's universal health insurance system. Some Canadian studies have found that higher socioeconomic status was associated with better access to specialised services. [5] [6] [7] Other studies have shown that socioeconomic status is not associated with waiting times for elective surgery and that differences in medical need have been the main determinant of primary care and hospital admissions. [7] [8] [9] [10] Owing to a lack of appropriate population health indicators, the contribution of the health system to changes in health outcome inequalities has not been determined.

In 1976, the Working Group on Preventable and Manageable Diseases proposed using ''unnecessary untimely deaths'' as an indicator of medical care quality. 11 The Working Group presented lists of conditions for which deaths may be ''avoidable'' if appropriate medical care is provided in a timely fashion. Since then, the avoidable mortality concept has been applied as an indicator of healthcare performance at the population level and to signal possible deficiencies in healthcare that warrant additional investigation. 12 13 The relationship between avoidable mortality and socioeconomic status may provide a population-based indication of the role of different components of healthcare for reducing mortality inequalities in Canada. We examined the changes in neighbourhood income-related differences in avoidable mortality in urban Canada over a 25-year period. Using the Working Group's approach, the contribution of medical care and public health were considered separately by grouping deaths into those amenable to medical care and those preventable through public health interventions.

Death registration data for residents of Canadian census metropolitan areas were obtained from the Canadian Mortality Database for the years 1971, 1986, 1991 and 1996 . Census tract coded data for 2001 recently became available (April 2006), but could not be included in this study. The study area was restricted to metropolitan areas because neighbourhoods are more clearly defined, and residential segregation by income is more pronounced in large cities compared with small towns and rural areas. 14 The analysis for 1971 was based on 21 census metropolitan areas representing 54% of the total Canadian population. For , 1991 areas met the census metropolitan area definition and all were included in the study, representing approximately 60% of the total Canadian population.

Street address data from death registrations were used to establish the census tract of usual residence for each deceased person. Census tract population and income data were obtained from Canadian population censuses for the years 1971, 1986, 1991 and 1996 . People were classified as low income if their total economic family income or unattached individual income in the year preceding a given census was below that year's Statistics Abbreviations: IHD, ischaemic heart disease; PYLL, potential years of life lost; SEYLL, age-standardised expected years of life lost Canada low-income cut-offs. 4 Within census metropolitan areas, each census tract was ranked according to the percentage of population below the low-income cut-off. Census tracts were then assigned to quintile groups in the order of lowest to highest percentage of low-income residents, such that each quintile comprised approximately one-fifth of the total non-institutional population of the census metropolitan area. The quintile data were then pooled across census metropolitan areas.

People living in the same urban neighbourhoods may be heterogeneous in terms of socioeconomic characteristics, and individual socioeconomic homogeneity within urban neighbourhoods generally increases as the neighbourhood size decreases. [14] [15] [16] [17] However, studies comparing the health outcome association trends using census tracts (2500-8000 people) or the smaller enumeration areas (125-440 households or dwellings) as area-level indicators of socioeconomic status have shown similar results. 15 18-21 Avoidable deaths classification A list of amenable deaths was created before the analyses with reference to classification lists from selected avoidable mortality studies. [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] The avoidable causes of death were then categorised into causes amenable to medical care and causes amenable to public health (table 1) . Ischaemic heart disease (IHD) was considered as a separate category. All other deaths were grouped into a single category of ''other causes''.

Deaths amenable to medical care are those for which it is reasonable to expect a death to be prevented through medical care (ie, hospital and physician services) after the condition has developed. This list includes causes such as appendicitis and asthma, where the medical nature of the intervention is apparent. This list also includes causes such as cervical cancer, where deaths are preventable through early detection and effective treatment. Deaths amenable to public health are those for which medical services may be less effective for treating the condition, but where there are interventions that are known to prevent the condition from occurring. This group includes lung cancer and liver cirrhosis, which are mainly amenable to changes in health behaviours (such as tobacco and alcohol use) and motor vehicle accidents, which are amenable to legislative measures (such as speed limits and laws requiring use of seatbelts and helmets). 28 IHD was categorised separately because (a) both medical interventions and public health can contribute to reducing such deaths and (b) the large number of deaths from IHD would conceal the effect of medical care and public health on the other causes of death. 28 Exclusions Deaths of residents of long-term care facilities were excluded because the income of institutional residents is not collected in Canadian censuses, and the income level of the census tract in which an institution is located may be unrelated to the income of the institutional residents. Census tracts with a noninstitutional population of ,250 were excluded because their income data were not published. Deaths after 74 years of age were excluded because deaths above this age are not as likely to be preventable and cause of death certification has been shown to be less accurate for deaths at older ages. 29 This cut-off age is consistent with recent literature using the avoidable mortality concept. 12 28 30-32 Analysis

The number of years of life lost is an indicator of premature mortality that takes into account the age at death. Expected years of life lost rates were computed using the method applied for the Global Burden of Disease Project, 33 where the age-specific years of life lost were estimated using the urban Canada 1996 male and female life expectancies of the richest quintile (Q1) as the standard. To account for the different age distributions between the income quintiles, expected years of life lost rates were age-standardised by the direct method with Canada's population in 1991 as the reference population, yielding the age-standardised expected years of life lost (SEYLL). The formula for calculating the SEYLL rate for a given cause is presented below: where the sum is over age groups from 0 to 74 years, E i is the 1996 life expectancy for the mid-age of age group i of Q1, d i is the number of deaths from the cause in the age group i, p i is the number of people in the examined population age group i, p Ri is the number of people in the 1991 Canadian reference population age group i, and N R is the number of people in the reference population ,75 years of age. In all cases, the life years lost were determined by reference to ordinary ''period'' life tables based on cross-sectional data for a given year or period of years, as opposed to ''cohort'' life tables based on data for the entire life span of a generation.

Potential years of life lost (PYLL) is an alternative way of calculating the mortality burden from various causes of death. SEYLL differs from PYLL in the way the person-years of life lost are calculated. For PYLL, the life years lost are obtained by subtracting the observed age at death from an arbitrary upper limit such as 65 or 75 years. For SEYLL, the life years lost are obtained by subtracting the observed age at death from the expected age at death for a person of that age, as shown in a life table. So that death at a given age is counted equally across socioeconomic groups (whose life expectancies differ), the expected age at death for all socioeconomic groups is standardised by always taking it from the life table for the richest income quintile. The effects are that both PYLL and SEYLL give greater weight to deaths at younger ages, but compared with PYLL, SEYLL gives relatively greater weight to deaths at older ages.

A change in the absolute interquintile (Q5-Q1) SEYLL rate difference from 1971 to 1996 was selected as the primary outcome measure to determine whether mortality disparities across the neighbourhood income quintiles altered over time. We elected not to present relative differences (such as rate ratios) in mortality because relative disparity measures assist in determining aetiology and the mechanisms of interventions, which are beyond the scope of this study. Changes in the absolute differences in mortality over time provide information regarding the population health effect of health policies and interventions. 34 35 Income-related ''excess mortality'' (a measure of population attributable risk) was calculated as the difference in the SEYLL rate for the total population less that of the richest quintile (QT-Q1). This comparison quantifies the reduction in mortality that would occur if the entire population experienced the mortality level of the richest quintile. 4 35 We calculated the proportion of all-cause income-related excess mortality in 1996 attributable to avoidable causes of death. SEYLL rates by neighbourhood income quintile were calculated and presented for selected avoidable causes.

Using methods developed at Statistics Canada (G Roberts, personal communication, 2003), variance estimates for the SEYLL rates were calculated assuming that the number of deaths in each age group follows a Poisson distribution. The variance of the change between 1971 and 1996 in the Q5-Q1 difference in SEYLL for a particular cause was obtained as the sum of the four variances for SEYLLs in Q1:1971, Q1:1996, Q5:1971 and Q5:1996. A Z test was used to make the comparison of this change between causes amenable to medical care and causes amenable to public health interventions. In order to simplify their presentation, 95% CIs were not included in the plots of trends. Table 2 shows the socioeconomic characteristics of each neighbourhood income quintile in urban Canada in 1996. Poorer quintiles had a higher proportion of people unemployed, with ,9 years of education, and a lower proportion in managerial or professional occupations, or who owned their own homes. Table 3 presents the deaths and populations available for analysis by neighbourhood income quintile and by sex: after exclusions, a total of 203 605 deaths and 58.5 million personyears at risk. For both men and women, the quintile population sizes were comparable in each year. Figure 1 presents the income-related disparities in avoidable mortality (Q5-Q1 SEYLL rate differences) for causes amenable to medical care, amenable to public health, from IHD and from other causes. From 1971 to 1996, the disparity for causes amenable to medical intervention diminished 60% (1287 SEYLL per 100 000 people) in men and 78% (1264 SEYLL per 100 000 people) in women. For IHD, the disparity decreased 58% (1041 SEYLL per 100 000 people) in men and 38% (261 SEYLL per 100 000 persons) in women. The largest reductions in amenable mortality disparities from these causes occurred between 1971 and 1986. For instance, disparities in women decreased 55% (902 SEYLL per 100 000 people) and 36% (249 SEYLL per 100 000 people) for causes amenable to medical care and from IHD, respectively, during that time. For causes amenable to public health, the disparities increased 0.7% (12 SEYLL per 100 000 people) in men and increased 20% (63 SEYLL per 100 000 people) in women. Income-related disparities in avoidable mortality from other causes of death (not amenable to medical care, public health or IHD) decreased 15% (559 SEYLL per 100 000 people) in men and 9% (145 SEYLL per 100 000 people) in women. Figure 2 shows the proportion of the all-cause income-related excess mortality (QT-Q1 SEYLL rate difference) attributable to avoidable causes of death for men and women in 1996. For instance, avoidable deaths from IHD contributed 14% to the allcause SEYLL difference between the total population and the richest quintile in that population (ie, the income-related excess mortality). In 1996, avoidable causes of death together accounted for about half (49.6%) of all income-related excess mortality among men, and 42% among women. Of the excess attributable to avoidable causes, 30% among men and 18% among women were due to medically amenable causes of death. In addition, 42% of that among men and 44% among women were due to IHD.

IHD, lung cancer, perinatal mortality, cerebrovascular disease HIV and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease contributed the most to the excess, together accounting for 49% and 43% of the overall excess for men and women, respectively.

Negative proportions were observed for deaths from motor vehicle accidents in men, as well as from congenital cardiovascular abnormalities and breast cancer in women. These negative proportions indicate that the richest quintile experienced more deaths associated with those causes compared with the rest of the population in 1996. show avoidable mortality (SEYLL rates) by neighbourhood income quintile, for each cause that contributed .1% to the overall income-related excess mortality from avoidable causes (QT-Q5 SEYLL rate difference) in 1996. For most of these causes, mortality disparities diminished over time. However, disparities in mortality from lung cancer among men showed only marginal net changes from 1971 and 1996, whereas the disparities among women widened. For men, disparities in mortality from HIV widened considerably from 1986 to 1991 and narrowed marginally thereafter. For women, disparities in mortality from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease widened from 1971 to 1996. Income-related disparities in mortality from cerebrovascular disease did not change appreciably from 1971 to 1996.

For clarity, the 14 panels of figs 3-5 show only the richest, poorest and middle income quintiles. Nevertheless, this shows that the socioeconomic gradient in mortality varied by cause. However, had these data been presented for each of the five quintiles separately (data available on request from the corresponding author), one could observe that the gap between the poorest and second-poorest quintile was generally greater than the gap between any other adjacent quintiles.

Note that our summary measure of disparity-the difference between the richest quintile and the total for all quintiles together-quantifies the reduction in mortality that would occur if the entire population (not just the poorest quintile) experienced the mortality of the richest quintile. This is a means of summarising the inter-quintile differences that respects the non-linearity of the results.

Our study shows that there was a large reduction in socioeconomic mortality gradients in Canada between 1971 and 1996. However, the reduction in gradients varied considerably between diseases. As others have done, 22 24 36 37 we have attempted to infer what health system factors contribute to disease mortality reduction. We grouped diseases into the most responsible healthcare sectors (public health or medical care). This task is difficult because mortality from most diseases is influenced by a reduction in both disease onset (largely within the mandate of public health) and progression of disease to death (largely the mandate of medical care). With this caveat noted, we found a striking difference between the potential contribution of medical care and public health in reducing socioeconomic gradients. It has been suggested that medical care has played a limited role in reducing health disparities and that future health policies should be oriented towards public health initiatives in order to improve health and reduce health inequalities at the population level. 3 38-41 Our results suggest that traditionally defined medical services such as physician and hospital care have contributed to reducing the income-related burden of illness from 1971 to 1996. For most causes of death considered amenable to medical interventions, income-related disparities in mortality were relatively small in 1996. The exception is IHD, which is largely amenable to both medical care and public health. Overall, there was little change in income-related disparities in mortality from causes amenable to public health interventions. Some specific mortality diagnoses, such as cirrhosis of the liver, contributed to a reduction in mortality differences between income groups, whereas for other diseases, most notably lung cancer in women, there were widening differences in income-related deaths. Canadian studies suggest that lung cancer mortality disparities are probably the result of differences in lung cancer incidence rather than survival. [42] [43] [44] [45] There seems to be considerable unrealised potential of public health for further reducing health disparities in Canada. Indeed, there exist remarkable socioeconomic differences in individual risk factors, such as smoking, sedentary living, poor diet, obesity, stress and physical inactivity. Knowledge about these risk factors has also been shown to differ between socioeconomic groups in Canada. [46] [47] [48] [49] [50] The most notable example is tobacco-related deaths. The causal relationship between tobacco and disease mortality is well described and these same diseases have a large contribution to socioeconomic disparities. There are large numbers of public health interventions to reduce smoking that are effective, but they are either unused or underused. [51] [52] [53] Criticism regarding the effectiveness of the public health sector compared with the medical care system should take into context the distribution of resources. The proportion of total Canadian public sector health expenditures allocated to public health was 4.4% in 1975 and 6.5% in 1996. 54 There is a growing concern that public health has been chronically underresourced, which has limited its potential to contribute to improving health and reducing health inequalities. 55 Concern regarding the ability of the public health sector to respond to severe acute respiratory syndrome in 2002 has resulted in public health reorganisation and reinvestment with the creation of a new national public health agency and a US$700 million increase in funding.

Various studies have highlighted the effects of physical and social environments on health. The results of these investigations suggest that health policies should focus not only on individuals, but also on the communities in which people live. 18 56-60 Innovative intersectoral social policies, as well as targeted public health interventions, will be required to ensure progress in diminishing socioeconomic disparities.

The most important limitation of this study is the difficulty assigning deaths to their avoidable cause. IHD is a case in point. It is probable that about half of the substantial reduction in deaths from IHD were related to improvements in health behaviours (attributable largely to public health), with the remaining half attributable to medical care. 61 Both medical care and public health have reduced income-related disparities in IHD, and much of the remaining income-related disparity could be reduced by either public health or medical care interventions. Canadians of lower socioeconomic status are known to have a higher prevalence of various cardiovascular disease risk factors. 49 62 Recent studies have reaffirmed the role of these risk factors for IHD. 63 64 For medical care, the Polypill may substantially reduce IHD 65 and if socioeconomic groups were to adhere equally to the recommendations, income-related IHD disparities could diminish as well. However, it should be noted that differentials in Polypill use and adherence might lead to an increased income-related IHD mortality disparity. Studies conducted by Alter et al 5 66 and Kapral et al 6 have shown that Ontarians from lower income neighbourhoods were less likely to receive specialised health services for acute myocardial infarction and stroke, respectively. However, in both studies, lower income was shown to be associated with mortality independent of medical service characteristics, suggesting that patients of lower socioeconomic status experience greater disease severity owing to factors stemming from outside the medical care setting as well.

There are similar challenges attributing deaths to their underlying avoidable cause for other conditions in this study. Although previous investigations have applied perinatal deaths as an indicator of medical care performance, 24 Figure 5 Avoidable mortality (SEYLL rate per 100 000 people) by neighbourhood income quintile, by cervical cancer and other uterine cancer in women, and for cerebrovascular disease in men and women in urban Canada from 1971 to 1996. such deaths occur early in the neonatal period, recent evidence suggests that the disparities in perinatal mortality are also likely to be amenable to public health interventions that deal with maternal behavioural and psychosocial risk factors. [67] [68] [69] [70] Increases in HIV mortality and mortality disparities from 1986 to 1991 and subsequent reductions in mortality disparities afterwards are congruent with the development of antiretroviral therapy in the late 1980s as well as investments in AIDS research and treatment in Canada through the National AIDS Strategy in 1990. Nevertheless, because there is no cure for HIV or AIDS, preventive strategies remain the principle methods of avoiding HIV-related deaths.

This study has the advantage of examining the health system in Canada from a population health perspective using readily available mortality data. Rutstein et al 11 and other investigators point out that this is a starting point for drawing attention to areas for further investigation. It is difficult to examine the overall role of different parts of the healthcare sector over time using other sources of data and methods.

In a similar study using mortality data from New Zealand, Marshall et al 71 showed narrowing but persistent social class mortality differences from medically amenable causes of death. In England and Wales, Mackenbach et al 12 showed widening occupational class mortality gradients over time for some causes of death amenable to medical care. They concluded that medical care contributed to the widening mortality differences between socioeconomic groups. Although these dissimilar observations can be partly explained by differences in analytical methods and categorisation of amenable deaths, they also suggest that medically amenable mortality disparity trends may be variable across different contexts.

The outcome chosen for this study was an absolute reduction in mortality. Examining differences in mortality inequalities in using absolute (rate differences) and relative (rate ratios) measures would yield conflicting results. Indeed, in this study, the ratio of mortality comparing the poorest to richest quintile increased for men and decreased for women from 1971 to 1996 for causes of death amenable to medical care. An absolute reduction has greater public health meaning than a relative reduction because of its closer relation to overall health burden. The extent of absolute reductions in mortality between socioeconomic groups is a combination of both the baseline risk and the relative risk reduction. Because poorer quintiles had a higher baseline risk of death than richer quintiles early in the study, they had a greater opportunity to benefit (in absolute terms) from health interventions. Anderson et al 72 argue that medical care often has the same relative effectiveness between socioeconomic groups, and thus is well suited for reducing health inequalities if there is good access to medical services for lower socioeconomic groups. Our observations support their contention.

In conclusion, during the 25-year period of this study, reductions in rates of deaths amenable to medical care made the largest contribution to narrowing socioeconomic mortality disparities in urban Canada. Continued public support for physician and hospital services seems to be warranted in the interest of further reducing inequities in health. In addition, public health initiatives have a potentially important, but yet largely unrealised role in further reducing mortality disparities in Canada.

What this study adds N A decrease in the rate of deaths amenable to medical care made the largest contribution to reducing socioeconomic differences in mortality over a 25-year period after the establishment of universal health insurance in Canada.

N There remain significant and modifiable disparities in mortality from ischaemic heart disease and other causes amenable to public health.

N Public support for physician and hospital services seems warranted in the interest of further reducing inequities in health.

N Public health initiatives also have a potentially important, but as yet unrealized, role in further reducing mortality disparities in Canada.

Tourism policy issues for today,"The world is becoming a global village in which people from different continents are made to feel like next-door neighbours. In facilitating more authentic social relationships between individuals, tourism can help overcome many real prejudices and foster new bonds of fraternity. In this sense tourism has become a real force for world peace.","Tourism in the twenty-first century is a major vehicle for fulfilling people's aspirations for a higher quality of life. Whether this happens at the local, state/provincial, regional, national or international level, the basic tenets remain consistent. One aim is to facilitate tourism interactions between individuals and, it is hoped, lay the groundwork for peace through authentic social relationships. Tourism is part of the growing international trade-in-service, travel-sector industries. As such, it has the potential to be an important stimulant for future improvement in the economic, political, sociocultural and ecological dimensions of people's lives. Combining the elements of creating economic income with the potential to foster greater international understanding and goodwill, tourism holds promise for serving as a vehicle for peace throughout the world. This supports the lofty view that the highest purpose of tourism policy can be to balance its benefits and costs for communities as tourism destinations and to improve the quality and sustainability of life for local citizens. Tourism as a policy for peace is presented in Chapter 5.

Today's key tourism policy issues include tourism regulation and public policy, areas facilitating tourism such as information technologies, financial organizations and organizations related to tourists themselves as consumers of travel. This chapter provides an overview of such important issue areas with examples of their effects on tourism policy formation. In this context, tourism policy first is described in an ethical framework, its core components identified, and an issues-focused working definition proposed in order to provide an adequate framework for analysing and understanding the complex issues confronting the production and distribution of international tourism products and services in today's world.

The Global Code of Ethics for Tourism adopted 21 December 2001, by the 13th session of the General Assembly of the United Nations World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) outlines principles to guide tourism development. It also serves as a powerful frame of reference for the different stakeholders in the tourism sector 'with the objective of minimizing the negative impact of tourism on the environment and on cultural heritage while maximizing the benefits of tourism in promoting sustainable development and poverty alleviation as well as understanding among nations' (UNWTO, 2001 , A/RES/56/212, p. 1). The Code further states that 'provided a number of principles and a certain number of rules are observed' it should be possible to reconcile tourism in its increasingly prominent role in the services industry with contending issues in international trade such that all stakeholders in tourism development -'with different albeit interdependent responsibilities rights and duties' -will contribute collectively to this aim. This is envisioned through 'genuine' partnership and cooperation between public and private stakeholders in tourism development in an 'open and balanced way'.

In sum, the UNWTO calls upon all individuals involved in tourismrelated organizations -from local destinations to tourism generating and receiving economies and their negotiations in global trade organizationsto develop and adhere to 'a set of interdependent principles for the interpretation and application' of the Code of Ethics for Tourism. This provides a business ethics framework for examining the effect of international tourism policy issues as they apply to contemporary local, state/provincial, regional, national and international affairs.

In this light, following is a set of core tourism policy component issues (identified in spring 2005 by Master of Tourism Administration candidates in The George Washington University Tourism Policy Analysis course -TSTD 262.10 -taught by Dr Ginger Smith, co-author, and Juan Luna-Kelser):

• Guidelines/set of rules/regulation for the common good/influence behaviour/education; • Framework -participatory process; • Codes of conduct;

• Philosophy -vision to make tourism 'the sector'; • Dynamic change; • Collaboration/converging views = effective policy; • Consensus among key stakeholders;

• Based on research -measurable.

In consideration of these elements, the co-authors developed their tourism policy definition as first framed in Chapter 1 to say tourism policy is 'a progressive course of actions, guidelines, directives, principles, and procedures set in an ethical framework that is issues-focused and best represents the intent of a community (or nation) to effectively meet its planning, development, product, service, marketing, and sustainability goals and objectives for the future growth of tourism'.

To understand key tourism policy issues in the largest possible context, it is especially important for students to identify in what stage of tourism policy development a particular project or case resides. Aligning the tourism policy analysis with the proper developmental phase of tourism is a critical first step in establishing a robust research design that is both supported by adequate and accessible data and able to be completed on funding deadlines or a timeline viable to the client (which includes semester-based course professors). In this regard, a brief overview of three tourism policy development segments is offered here, with greater emphasis on the third -the summative stage -as the most useful for contemporary tourism policy analysis and destination management research.

The formative phase in tourism policy development means exactly thisthat tourism-related issues have arisen requiring new tourism policy formulation. This can occur at any level of stakeholders in the desired outcome -from local citizens to relations between and among nations. A rapid rise in tourist visits to popular 'gateway' or entry communities, whether the US National Forests in Colorado or Arizona or to cultural heritage sites such as Machu Picchu, Peru (shown in Figure 3 .1), have fostered unplanned tourism development. This has led to unexpected needs for formative tourism policies to cope with increased road congestion and pollution, potable water over-consumption, public utility resources depletion and real estate price escalation resulting in a scarcity of affordable housing for local citizens employed in the new hotels, car rental agencies and other travel-related businesses. As a result, tourism development revenues are not equally distributed. Furthermore, these overly popular original destinations then become degraded, putting at risk their inherent environmental, sociocultural and heritage values important to both tourism and local level quality of life. Thus, a well-known, mature tourism destination such as Machu Picchu must, for the sake of its own future success as a world heritage destination, reformulate its tourism policies regarding the sustainability of its infrastructure and provision of quality tourism products and services.

Other drivers for tourism policy analysis at the formative phase can be to evaluate a decision on the part of a tourism organization, destination or entire industry sector to participate in new technology. A powerful example of this at the tourism organization and destination management levels is provided by the 11 September 2001, terrorist airplane attacks in the United States on the New York City World Trade Center towers and the US Pentagon outside Washington, DC. Bill Hanbury, president of the Washington DC Convention and Visitors Corporation, was confronted by a 'new' and historic event in the United States that, at large, severely affected travel to and within the United States and the District of Columbia (DC). The US east coast suffered region-wide telephone outages on September 11 preventing President Hanbury's communication with his own employees as well as with DC public officials. Within days after September 11, he developed an unplanned, unanticipated formative tourism policy methodology for the creation of a reliable, networked alternative emergency information communication system encompassing the DC convention centre and US national capital region as a whole. The true value of this formative phase tourism policy for heightened communication preparedness fortunately to date has not been measurable in a comparable emergency situation (Hanbury, 2002) . This underscores the challenge in data collection in conducting formative phase tourism policy research.

Similarly, development phase tourism policy analysis is extremely important in many instances as it enables evaluation of policy implementation midstream. In 1999, for example, the Government of Belize established a new tourism policy placing high priority on tourism as a preferential development option with a focus on the cruise ship sector. In addition to international tourism promotion to Belize, the results also included a development phase tourism policy plan for environmental compliance for live-aboard passenger vessels, including cruise ships visiting Belize Harbour. It was premised on reassurances to Belize local tourism industry stakeholders that efforts would be made by the Department of the Environment in conjunction with the Fisheries Department and Belize Tourism Board to ensure the sustainability of the Belize tourism industry as a whole. New tourism policy rules and regulations were developed covering such issues as anchoring of cruise ships, waste disposal and passenger recreational activities onboard, such as requiring the purchase of seasonal fish and locally grown produce versus imported food. Onshore, tourism policy rules included requirements for the preservation of coral reefs during tourist diving and snorkeling activities, among others. As the cruise industry to Belize progresses, a monitoring system put in place now assists in a review and ongoing assessment of the effectiveness of the tourism development intentions of the tourism policy plan (Toy, 2004) .

Many examples exist of summative phase tourism policy analysis which evaluates long-standing policy issues and accepted norms and doctrines for continued validity. This phase often provides the most available opportunities for semester-long student tourism policy case studies and/or research projects. For example, when the citizens of the US State of Colorado in 1994 voted to oppose the continuation of an existing state tax for state tourism marketing, Colorado fell in three years from the top five to 17th place in US state travel destinations (Sommars, 1997, pp. 16-21) . Only a short duration was required for summative evaluation of the adverse results of the tax policy eliminating funding for tourism marketing and promotion to Colorado. Summative phase tourism policy research requires that evaluation questions be matched with appropriate information gathering techniques, the data collected and analysed, and tourism policy information and advice provided to public and private sector officials and other interested parties.

Another example of summative phase tourism policy analysis would be to study tourism issues serving as indicators of improved relations among neighbouring economies. With an overarching goal to improve relations between Pakistan and India, the objective is to create international tourism between the two countries to gain greater mutual understanding among citizens and increased currency exchange. Tourism facilitation includes air rights policy to create air routes between the two countries and border crossing policy to speed visa approvals. Measurable tourism policy issues in the summative evaluation might include the number of flown routes and visa inquiries and permits issued (Figure 3 .2).

In conclusion of this section, one word about methodological approaches for the study of tourism policy, whatever the evaluations phase. Tourism policy provides a lively domain for contemporary quantitative and qualitative research -or a mixture of both. Comparative case study research, used in support of a larger tourism policy critical analysis framework, provides an especially rich laboratory. 

Why are ongoing evaluations of tourism policy issues in all contexts important? It is because of tourism's integrative role in triggering growth -for better or worse in some cases -across multiple sectors of local, state/provincial, regional, national and international business commerce and services industries worldwide. Tourism's performance as an optimal growth multiplier in economic development for a large majority of modern economies matches up well against current given and future perceived needs. Not always, but often, tourism is viewed as fungible across the spectrum of economic, sociocultural and environmental aspects of development -a premier standing as well as a tall order for tourism policy issues.

Sustainable tourism, sex tourism, traveller safety and security and health and medical tourism, among others are examples of sub-factors involving regulation, planning and public policy related to tourism. As significant in the future as they are today, such issues are covered in greater depth in Chapter 10 'Tourism Policy Issues for Tomorrow'.

Even within one tourism industry segment, multiple issues exist that require tourism policy and planning. For example, international airline industries carry cargo and passengers making air rights and safety issues consummate. Cargo is rarely checked for bombs whereas domestic travellers' luggage is thoroughly checked. Effecting change to include cargo inspection could lead to a $3.6 billion dollar cost to the industry (Frank, 2005, p. 01a). With aviation air rights, it is a function, in a sense, of who owns the air and what means are used to protect the citizens while allowing air traffic. Tourism policy in this arena collides with privacy rights and business profits versus traveller safety and security issues, as acutely experienced by both international leisure and business travellers since September 11.

Furthermore, airlines often are seen as a major catalyst in conducting business. City managers for smaller cities see airlines as an integral part of attracting business (De Lollis and Hansen, 2002) . Colleges also see airlines as a key component to recruiting students (Brush and Straut, 2005, p.1p, 1c) . Hence, city managers must address both business and college needs as well as tourists.

Policy as created by elected officials can demonstrate which path to take on ethical issues in tourism. Currently, countries such as Thailand are experiencing an increase in tourism demand due to sex tourism (tourism activities which lead to sexual activity, particularly involving children). 'In 1998, the International Labour Organization reported its calculations that 2-14 per cent of the gross domestic product of Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines and Thailand derives from sex tourism. In addition, while Asian countries, including Thailand, India and the Philippines, have long been prime destinations for child sex tourists, in recent years, tourists have increasingly travelled to Mexico and Central America for their sexual exploits as well' (Nair, 2006) . Countries which are starved for hard foreign currency often look the other way as the cash flows in (Nair) . Western governments, including the United States, are now enacting laws which allow prosecution for sex tourism and the tourists despite the crimes taking place in foreign soil. Existing laws make it illegal to travel with the intent to have sex with a minor. Proposals for new laws that would make it illegal to have sex with a child in another country are now being pursued. Policy creation and implementation is complex and difficult to implement as the activities are international in scope, with victims and perpetuators coming from different countries. Further complicating this situation is the fact that each country, in many cases, has jurisdiction over only part of the criminal activity. To give more force to existing laws, a bill was introduced in the US Government on 28 April 2005, entitled the 'End Demand for Sex Trafficking Act of 2005.' The bill included a provision that would amend the language specifically to state that individuals engaging in sexual activity can be charged with a criminal offense as 'a purchaser of commercial sexual activities'. Passage of this amendment would clarify for federal prosecutors that enforcement of the law can and should be used to prosecute US-based sex tour operators (Equality Now, 2006) . Further efforts to eliminate child sex tourism are being pursued by the tourism industry itself.

European airlines are showing videos on their long-haul flights, which inform travellers of the laws against child sex tourism. The Untied Nations World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) established a Child Prostitution and Tourism Watch Task Force, whose goals are to 'prevent, uncover, isolate and eradicate' the exploitation of children in the sex trade. The International Federation of Women's Travel Organizations (IFWTO) holds seminars across the United States and globally to educate their members about the problems of child sex tourism and what they can do to help.

In 1994, the Universal Federation of Travel Agents' Association (UFTAA) was the first tourism industry organization to adopt the Child and Travel Agents' Charter. In 1996, the members of the International Air Transport Association (IATA) unanimously passed a resolution condemning the commercial sexual exploitation of children.

• A 'No Child Sex Tourism' logo has been adopted worldwide by industry organizations that are actively working to prevent and eliminate child prostitution. These sticker-logos can be obtained from the IFWTO. • In 1996, the International Hotel and Restaurant Association passed a resolution against the sexual exploitation of children and published a leaflet urging its members to help stop child sex tourism. • In Europe, tour operators have adopted codes of conduct for agents to combat sex tourism (ECPAT, 2006) .

In other words, various approaches to implementing tourism policy goals are being used to fight sex tourism. While these efforts do not use the force of law, the approaches do include moral persuasion for both the industry and the consumer. The question remains whether voluntary tourism policy compliance is enough in the face of this tragic human activity.

As the recent Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) epidemic demonstrated, health concerns are now a major factor in tourism. In some cases, the concerns for health are positive for the industry. For example, the rapid growth in the health spa industry has created an upscale niche in the travel-for-health market; however, other health concerns have a negative impact on the industry such as SARS, AIDS and other contagious diseases that are spread much more rapidly in part because of tourism and its related activities. Should one country be able to prohibit or strongly discourage travel to another nation and effectively cripple another country's economy? Policy decisions on limiting travel to countries with an epidemic may result in a significant downturn in travel overall and, in turn, affect the supporting travel and tourism infrastructure worldwide. The SARS epidemic affected travel to Asian nations with a ripple effect that resulted in lower Visa credit card use. The Asian market 'was significantly affected by the downturn in tourism prompted by the outbreak of SARS, but volume has been returning to normal there in recent weeks', Visa said (Lee, 2003, p. 20) .

Often medical travel offers another set of competing policy needs. As medical practices improve worldwide, many countries offer tourism combined with plastic surgery. 'The Confederation of Indian Industries estimates that 150,000 foreign patients came to India for treatment in 2004. And McKinsey & Co., an international consulting firm, estimates that outsourced medical care could bring India $2.2 billion a year by 2012' (Landers, 2005) .

Issues centre on insurance, monitoring medical practices and malpractice -both insurance for the doctors and prosecution for poor medical services provided during medical tourism. At what level should citizens who are used to high levels of government intervention in medical practices expect the same protections when travelling in other countries?

And, to what level should the governments of these countries of origin for medical tourism intervene to protect its citizens while abroad? This concern for citizens' medical safety is not limited to exposure to germs and viruses from other countries; the continued growth of adventure travel has resulted in more mishaps needing attention. Rescue missions, field emergency medicine -the appropriateness of government resources being used to aid people who undertake risky travel behaviour -have all come to the forefront as tourists increasingly explore multiple environments and seek new travel experiences worldwide.

As a result of September 11 and the spate of terrorist bombings throughout the world, safety for groups is a leading policy issue for tourism and safety officials. Policy clashes between privacy and safety abound. There are personal privacy issues such as luggage checks, personal scans and body checks versus the need to ensure that the person and their belongings are weapon free. Information conflicts are common -access to tourism data routinely collected (name, address, credit card information, personal preferences) and who is allowed to access such information.

To what extent should governments be allowed to view and use the information gathered by various tourism entities (particularly airline computerized reservation and Personal Information Number/PIN data)? Ongoing debate centres on the legality of expanded use of the US Department of Homeland Security data-mining program called Automated Targeting System. Its expansion and redesign from cargo screening to create a vast database of terrorism risk assessments including name, date of birth, flight itineraries, credit card information and customs inspector's interview notes for every traveller who enters or leaves the country has triggered an information ownership and security contest between the government and airlines. Outcries from the US American Civil Liberties Union regarding privacy issues also include concerns regarding the unauthorized sale of such information for marketing purposes. How can this traveller information be used and by whom; and at what point should there be tourism policy interventions by private sectors and governments on controlling access to such information? Tourism brings clashing values to the forefront. Privacy versus security, freedom to move around versus safety are two such examples, and both issues then conflict with a locality or travel company's right to economic freedom. Policy formulation helps guide government officials attempting to weigh these factors in decision-making and planning.

Space tourism is one of hottest new tourism activities today. Issues arising from this present new, creative requirements in tourism policy and planning. One of the contending issues, logically, is overall investment costs of which the launch itself is a large part. It is believed that the only potential means for significant reduction of the recurrent launch cost, which results in a stimulation of human space colonization, is to make the launcher reusable, to increase its reliability and to make it suitable for new markets such as mass space tourism. Space projects that have long-range aspects are very difficult to finance as all interested parties, even politicians, expect to see a reasonable benefit during their period of involvement or term in office. They want to be able to explain this investment to the investing companies or to the taxpayers. Planners are then forced to use benefit models instead of intuitive judgment to convince skeptical decision makers to support new investments in space. Benefit models provide insights into complex relationships and compel a better definition of goals and expected benefits to be gained from a new space venture.

One main objective as to why humans should explore space is to 'improve the quality of life'; and this is important to different interest groups -the operator of a space transportation system, the passenger and the government for various reasons. For example, the operator is strongly interested in profit, the passenger's interest is in amusement, while the government is primarily interested in self-esteem, prestige and increased national security. Each perspective leads to different individual satisfaction levels. For example, on April 22, 2007, US billionaire Charles Simonyi, 58, a native of Hungary who helped design Microsoft Word and Excel, landed in the Kazakh steppe in a Russian space capsule after completing a two-week, $25 million, voyage of his childhood dreams to the international space station (Washington Post, April 22, 2007, A21) . And Simonyi is not the first and far from the last space tourist, following 'in the footsteps of Dennis Tito, Mark Shuttleworth, Gregory Olsen and Anousheh Ansari -all of whom have also traveled to the international space station aboard Russian rockets in trips brokered by US-based Space Adventures Ltd.' (A21). Combined, these interests contribute to optimization in the development process for reusable launch vehicles (American Institute of Physics in Goehlich, 2003) . Further discussion of this topic occurs in Chapter 10.

The significance of agriculture in social terms stems largely from a community's desire to retain agriculture's aesthetic and heritage values and their contribution to sense of place and charm. Consistent with the findings from US studies that indicate resident attitudes are influenced by 'amenity value' rather than production value, perceptions about agriculture find many individuals consider agriculture very important or of higher importance but they have little understanding regarding the actual situation of agriculture in terms of economic contribution, benefits to the region, land uses and the implications of changes in agricultural production in the future. The direct aims are to generate jobs and increase returns to farmers while the indirect aims are landscape conservation through retention of agriculture, attitudinal changes in the farming community to farming practices, marketing and diversification and sustainable development that links the farming community to other sectors of the economy (Figure 3.3) .

What does a destination need to do to become an agritourism attraction? Guidelines vary from country to country, and regimes can be highly bureaucratic. In the Veneto region of Italy, farmers providing holidays are limited to hosting 30 overnight guests per night for a maximum of 160 days per year and must sell over 50 per cent of the food they produce to tourists. In Britain, Germany and elsewhere, there are stringent health and safety controls, including fire regulations and rules governing contact with farm animals (Gumbel, 2004) . All in all, agritourism is blooming worldwide and cultivating the need for tourism policy and planning in this emerging tourism sector. 

Why are tourism issues more complex when introduced into the tourism policy domain? Understanding the interrelated nature of tourism industry sectors requires monitoring and evaluation when tourism policy issues are involved. Measurement and monitoring are essential to transportation systems that move people, products and services, which, in turn, make up a major component of the international tourism industry. Similarly, restaurants and entertainment organizations serve local residents and tourists alike and are involved in business activities (such as special events, conferences and meeting planning) that are demanded by both populations. This duality adds additional complexities to the planning process for simultaneous usage in areas accommodating both tourist and host community needs. Seasonal activities with peak period use, as in ski or beach resort locations, greatly benefit from tourism policy, planning, development and evaluation in understanding 'best use' growth and sustainability measures.

Policy uses tools such as zoning to aid tourism development while mitigating the potentially negative impacts of growth and development. Minas Gerais State in Brazil, for example, currently is experiencing minimal water contamination. This situation is expected to destabilize as water demands rise due to increases in tourism-related activities (increased influx of visitors accompanied by a growing residential workforce supporting the industry). Zoning to protect the natural resources, which in turn protects water quality, is being recommended. In Colorado, USA, zoning has been used in an effort to mediate the competing needs of the tourists and the local community. 'Over the past decade, county and city officials, tourism leaders and local ranchers in Routt County, Colorado, have worked together to preserve the remaining agricultural open space' (Parizzi et al., 2001, p. 57) . With a change in zoning laws, one county adopted regulations that encouraged clustering homes to preserve open space. Housing lot size requirements were reduced allowing developers to build more units using a smaller footprint overall. In exchange, the developers must set aside undeveloped land as open space. In other words, zoning concerns involve allocation of scarce land, public and private utility, and public support services and resources -what to put where and who to best undertake and accommodate tourism policy goals and objectives are important agenda items.

A great majority of travel and tourism companies worldwide are small-to-medium-sized enterprises. Via the World Wide Web, strategically managed smaller companies now can compete with larger companies for international visibility and positioning. This combination of attributes places the tourism industry in an excellent position to achieve world leadership in the movement and management of capital and information embodied in global trade in service industries. For this reason, tourism services industries dominate supply and demand for travel-related reservation systems. The case study developed by Zachary Rozga included at the end of this chapter illustrates this synergy and access to power in terms of information distribution on the Websites of small family-run tourism hotel businesses throughout South Africa, now linked with the rest of the world via simply designed Web pages in a communication telecommunications network called the World Hotel Link.

Since the late 1970s, growth of airline and car rental computerized reservations systems has occurred rapidly. The hotel industry lagged behind, starting later in the 1980s with the advent of THISCO (the hotel information system coalition), a hotel reservation system opening first-time Internet access to tourist hotel bookings online with later links to online airline reservations systems. The tremendous expansion and diversification over the last two decades of online tourism products and services (ticketing, car rentals, hotels rooms, transportation, tour operators, etc.) beyond basic travel services formerly provided by airline computer reservation systems, such as American Airlines' Sabre CRS, typify the high value now placed on the collection and (re)distribution of tourism consumer information and financial expenditures (much of it via credit cards).

Tourism and taxes have brought the industry to the forefront of travellers' concern. While seeking the benefits of the industry, travellers often do not want to support the infrastructure. As noted earlier, Colorado experienced a large decrease in tourism when the travel-marketing budget was reduced. Taxing residents to support the tourism industry is as unpopular as other taxes; therefore, city officials often tax the visitors. Councilor Bob Finsland from Superior, Wisconsin, USA, has gone on record as saying the extra revenue could go toward tourism facilities and events, such as hockey tournaments, thereby attracting organizations to host similar events in the city. 'I think there are a lot of ways to use that money wisely as far as tourism development goes', Finsland said. 'We don't want to raise the taxes on individual citizens of Superior. We don't want to raise the taxes to the individual motel owners. We want to raise the taxes for the people who stay at these hotels and pass through our city' (Reinke, 2006) .

Another example of this thought process emanates from the USA Commonwealth of Virginia -' the additional tax shall be designated and spent for the development and improvement of the Virginia Performing Arts Foundation's facilities in Richmond, for promoting the use of the Richmond Centre, and for promoting tourism, travel or business that generates tourism and travel in the Richmond metropolitan area' (Virginia Tax Code, §58.1-3823). Other Virginian localities, such as Williamsburg, levy a flat $2.00 fee per occupied room night in lodging establishments for marketing the historic triangle of Williamsburg, James City County and Yorktown, which is shown in Figure 3 .4.

Internationally, European finance ministers are leaning toward legislation taxing airline passengers to finance development aid for foreign countries. The EU airline industry is fighting this new tax saying it threatens jobs and tourism (Tardy, 2005, p. 3). Tax issues are divisive -on the one hand, they are necessary for generating revenue to finance the tourism industry. On the other hand, travellers are growing weary of the added expense to the trip. In some places, auto rental taxes can be as much as 40 per cent of the bill.

Finance for tourism development often requires an international commitment. The World Bank is heavily involved with committing monetary resources to sustainable tourism projects. Through the International Development Association (IDA), the World Bank grants long-term interest free loans and grants for the purpose of supporting economic growth, reducing poverty and improving living conditions. 'IDA's long-term nointerest loans pay for programs that build the policies, institutions, infrastructure and human capital needed for equitable and environmentally sustainable development. IDA's grants go to poor countries already vulnerable to debt or confronting the ravages of HIV/AIDS or natural disasters' (WorldBank.org).

Three factors determine eligibility for assistance:

• Relative poverty, defined as Gross National Product (income) per person below an established threshold, currently US $965 per year. • Lack of credit worthiness to borrow on market terms and therefore a need for concessional resources to finance the country's development program. • Good policy performance, defined as the implementation of economic and social policies that promote growth and poverty reduction (WorldBank.org).

The top 10 borrower countries in fiscal year 2005, according to the US World Bank, are shown in Table 3 .1. Two examples of World Bank/IDA supported projects are Mozambique's initiatives in conservation and tourism development. The first initiative resulted in support with an 'IDA credit of US $20 million to support the conservation of biodiversity and natural ecosystems as well as promote economic growth and development based on the sustainable use of natural resources by local communities in Mozambique' (M2 Presswire, 2005) . This demonstrates the interconnectedness of tourism and other municipal functions -and, therefore, requires policies that cross departmental boundaries. IDA has also supported a project emphasizing ecological and commercially sustainable solid waste collection and disposal services in Montenegro coastal municipalities, which are needed to maintain a clean, environmentally attractive coastal area for tourism development. It is hoped that the project also will help develop the sector's institutional policy and regulatory framework and benefit tourism prospects by eliminating solid waste collection and disposal problems negatively affecting coastal tourist areas.

Alternative sources for financing include bank loans and bonds. Often poor nations turn to these sources when they have exhausted the IDA backing. Developing nations often turn to wealthy countries for support through direct loans -where the bank backs the money and bonds are floated, then used as collateral for the loans. The Japan Bank for International Cooperation has agreed on an IDA loan totalling 5.732bn yen (US $52.874m) with Egypt, for the Borg El Arab International Airport Modernization Project. The development consists of the construction of an air terminal with a capacity of one million passengers and 4000 tons of cargo annually, as well as improvements in related facilities at the airport, 40 km southwest of Alexandria (JBIC 2005).

Guam, a US territory in the Pacific Ocean, can issue bonds that are exempt from federal, state and local income taxes. The island's growing tourism industry and a planned increase in US military personnel point to economic developments necessitating more spending on infrastructure. Infrastructure improvements, however, financed by military construction funds will not address all of Guam's critical infrastructure, essential services and economic development needs.

Proceeds from bonds sales would be reissued in the form of loans to finance reconstruction projects. Like the bond banks that already serve 12 US states, a US territory bond bank would use federal grant money as collateral to guarantee the loans. The concept of a bond bank was discussed in 19 April, 2006, at a meeting of the Interagency Group on Insular Areas, which coordinates federal policy toward Guam, American Samoa, the US Virgin Islands and the Northern Mariana Islands (McConnell, 2006) .

Grants are a preferred method of obtaining money for tourism development because no repayment is required; however, one condition often set forth is that matching amounts of money must be raised to receive the grants. Other stipulations may include partnerships or other support mechanisms. A project in Mozambique, which received IDA money, also received grants. The Global Environment Facility (GEF) Board, which approved the credit was also financed by a US $10 million grant in accordance with the work program approved by the GEF Council in October 2005 as well as a US $3.7 million grant from the Japanese Policy and Human Resources Development (PHRD) Fund ( M2 Presswire, 2005) Weimer and Vining (2005) state that in its simplest definition 'policy analysis is client-oriented advice relevant to public decisions and informed by social values' (p. 24) and offer their conclusion that, '[t]he professions of planning and public administration have moved much closer to the policy analysis paradigm in recent years ' (p. 25) . In other words, anytime an action or activity related to tourism may have an effect on a group or location is what, when, and where tourism policy issues matter the most at the destination management level Tourism policy at its best provides direction for the management of destination organizations around a unified strategic plan without which people may inadvertently or intentionally enact conflicting laws or rules negating tourism policy planning attributes. Preservation of status quo versus environmental sustainability for tourism purposes will continue as a debate worldwide in the areas of tourist access to world monuments and cultural heritage sites. National park year-round recreational access via snowmobiles and other off-road vehicles versus limited off-season use in support of nature and wildlife preservation are permanent issues in tourism policy evaluation in most regions of the world. State-controlled forest fires versus unregulated wild fires also challenge tourism policy formation in management of recreation with preservation goals.

Other significant issues related to zoning are exemplified in efforts by the Italian hotel industry working with municipal government to manage uncontrolled growth in hotel construction resulting in unsafe hotels built too close together marring historic views. Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, USA, for example, a major US battlefield, also provides both a long history and interesting future for tourism policy and planning regarding the impact of controlled growth as it relates to marketing and demand. Gettysburg deconstructed a privately built and owned look-out tower to 're-authenticate' the original battlefield landscape. Beach communities such as Ocean City, Maryland on the US Atlantic coast, too, must grapple with high tourist numbers during 'spring flings' or college fun tourism. The effect on local residents experiencing seasonally related tourism's 'bombardment' from the outside world requires coordination of tourism policy and planning efforts.

Through all the stages of tourism policy formation, development and implementation, one sees the conflicting needs that call for effective actions and evaluation. Tourism policy provides direction on what action is appropriate. In the formative stage, policy addresses new concerns such as disease or terrorism. At the development phase, policy addresses on-going issues. This is particularly relevant for developing countries and other regions of the world addressing economic, sociocultural and environmental sustainability issues, such as air and water pollution, crowding, degradation and depletion of tourism resources. Lastly, there is the summative stage where existing tourism policy results are reviewed for continued relevancy and efficacy. Tourism policy and planning evolve as the industry itself grows generating new requirements for areas such as commerce activity, telecommunications, sustainability and land use.

Why tourism policy issues point to -and will matter so dramatically in -the future is the way this chapter ends while ongoing evaluation of how contending issues central to today's tourism policy development and implementation affect future populations just begins. Adoption of tourism policy issues sustaining all of tourism's environments -natural and physical, human and man-made -would seem the greatest contribution still possible for tourism to make.

Zachary Rozga, The George Washington University Master of Tourism Administration Graduate, President of GeoSavvy Development, Cape Town, South Africa, www.geosavvydev.com, zachary.rozga@gmail. com. To access this and other GW web-based tourism policy case studies, please go to the following link to the GW/American University Trade and Environment (TED) Database (www.american.edu/ted).

The question this case study attempts to answer is, how have governments and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) used information and communication technology (ICT) to improve development of smallto-medium-sized tourism enterprises (SMTEs)?

SMTEs have been targeted in a number of countries as a sector to be focused on for overall economic development of traditionally impoverished and undeveloped lands and peoples. Tourism has been one sector deemed most appropriate for rural developing nations because the point of sale in the commerce is generally in the rural area and provides an alternative form of income generation to traditional agrarian methods.

This case study focuses on a new online booking agent that was created specifically to attend to the needs of the developing world and support SMTEs -The World Hotel Link (WHL).

The Pro-Poor Tourism Partnership says, ""One of the critical issues for poor producers is often access to the market -access to the established industry and to tourists"". Most small hotels and guesthouses and local NGOs have little or no opportunity to market to tourists via the Internet, thus they gain little share of the dollars tourists spend. Most tourism dollars end up offshore. Typically, only US $10-20 of every US $100 spent by the tourist in developing countries remains in the country. According to United Nations Environment Program, of each US $100 spent on a package tour, only around US $5 actually stays in a developing country's economy.

The George Washington University's International Institute of Tourism Studies (GWU/IITS) commissioned a survey of worldwide tourism development practitioners, academics and stakeholders to assess what issues were concerned with donor-funded tourism development and what they perceived to be the most important issues facing tourism. The number one response from the survey in the ""poorest performance"" category was market access for tourism development projects (GWU/IITS, 2004) .

In the developed world, some innovative nations have grasped the importance of effective clustering and the use of networks to spread the economic impact of tourism through proper ICT usage. The Australian Federal Government has realized the impact that the Internet has on promotion of the tourism product, and they also understand the need to have a consistent tourism product. Tourism is a highly fragmented industry that is made up of numerous SMTE (95-98 per cent of all tourism companies fall into this category), and the success of the industry is based on the sum of the parts. The Department of Industry, Science and Resources created the policy of Australia dotcom to aid each and every SMTE to utilize the Internet.

In line with that thinking a small team of tourism, sustainability and technology specialists set out to find an ICT-driven solution to market access for developing world SMTE accommodation providers. The outcome, the World Hotel Link (WHL), offers a unique online platform to help small and mid-sized accommodation providers market sustainable tourism to the independent traveller. Launched as an IFC technical assistance project for hotels and guesthouses in Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos in 2004, it is now a private company whose various sites in an everincreasing number of countries (30 plus in May 2006) attract about 5000 visitors a day.

Although parallels to the WHL (www.worldhotel-link.com) model can be drawn with Expedia, Orbitz and Hostelworld, it is different in that it has been designed specifically for the developing world, seeking to:

• bridge the digital divide • deliver pro-poor outcomes and • drive the uptake of sustainable tourism practices.

Each destination is served by a local e-marketplace operator (MPO) who is responsible for collecting and managing content for the Websites, responding promptly to travellers on the booking system and interfacing with accommodation providers. The local MPO serves as an ICT intermediary for product owners who may not communicate in English, possess technical skills or have access to ICT facilities. Meanwhile, the global WHL acts as an intermediary for the local MPOs by undertaking central coordination; improving technology development/support; and undertaking Web marketing, data hosting and online payment gateways, and so on. WHL has been built from the ground up with technology specifically designed to make the franchise MPO model work even for accommodation providers who do not have ICTs including telephones, computers or other easy avenues of communication.

The following model is a representation of how WHL's initiatives are implemented into less developed areas and the how the ""Tourism Cluster"" by-product is created (Figure 3 .5). The model on the left shows the relationship in an environment without an ICT intermediary. The product and market have a major disconnection, and information flow between them is stopped. In the model on the right, the product is accessible to the market through the intermediary plus the market can provide tastes and demands to the product. As the cycle continues, the process should enhance the product, increasing adherence to the demand of the market, thus providing a better and more sustainable product responsive to market demand.

In addition to bringing SMTEs into the global marketplace, WHL is working with mainstream operators who are trying to make a difference in their destination. To demonstrate the power of ICT networks, WHL is pioneering a new ""Sustainable Tourism Ranking"" into the booking engine. WHL is leveraging the network of sites and clients -independent travellers booking via the sites -to apply an eBay-style supplier-buyer ratings system to get sustainable tourism on the radar screen.

To date, sustainable tourism has always remained a fringe niche market and not had the profound impact that experts say it does. Under the WHL approach, accommodation providers display their product in a way that helps travellers understand what they are doing whether from an environmental, social or cultural standpoint to care for the local destination. Displayed visually as a ""Caring for the Destination"" rating, there is an opportunity for travellers to provide feedback and inform other travellers about this product or activity. As demand grows, more suppliers will want to be listed with this rating.

WHL sets up and supports local Internet portals that enable smaller hotels and guesthouses to be marketed on the Internet. WHL works as a franchise. Local partners with local knowledge own and operate the local WHL portals while being connected seamlessly to WHL's global network. WHL provides the technical platform, the web marketing and management support.

The hotels on WHL are usually three-star or less and often depend on walk-in guests, which means their income is unstable. This also means their employees face seasonal unemployment. Increased market access through the WHL allows these SMTEs to become less dependent on walk-ins and have a more regular income, which in turn benefits everyone -hotels have lower employee turnover and provide more stable jobs. It also means more secure income for people in the associated businesses that offer products and services linked to the tourism sector.

Independent travel is the fastest growing segment of the travel industry.

A 2004 International Finance Corporation study on Eco-Lodges put the global independent traveller market at 50 per cent. Many travellers use guidebooks and the Internet to select destinations and accommodation and rarely use tour packages. Thus they spend and leave more money locally. By serving smaller accommodation providers, WHL is making it easier for independent travellers to find interesting travel experiences, which in turn translates into more bookings for local SMTEs.

WHL operates as a global franchise network with local ownership of the booking service in each destination. This means the commissions and booking jobs remain in the country. While WHL charges a monthly service fee to franchise owners, it represents only a small portion of their revenue.

Small local accommodation providers have problems reaching the market.

There are large numbers of interesting and unique places to stay in guidebooks, but few are online. Some do not even have a phone number. Thus tourists book only with the hotels they can find on the Web. Because WHL franchisees are local people on the ground with local knowledge, they can actively coach and support the smallest guesthouses who otherwise would not be online or able to receive advance bookings. WHL provides access -a major obstacle for SMTEs -where others cannot.

Through its sustainability ratings and traveller feedback, WHL encourages local SMTEs to develop and manage interesting traveller experiences through connections with local NGOs and community groups that operate orphanages, schools or hospitals and eco-or cultural projects. Typically, these initiatives benefit the poorest and most vulnerable in the local community, as well as preserving the local culture and environment for future generations.

The approach taken in most regions of the world in driving the uptake of sustainable tourism practices has been driven largely by industry experts and government. It has involved a top-down approach with little effort to engage travellers and has resulted in the production of numerous codes, standards and certification or labelling schemes. The fact is, however, that despite significant expense in developing and promoting these approaches over the past 15 years, industry has largely ignored them, and the travelling public has almost no idea what they are. Even the jargon used extensively by industry players to describe the sector (e.g., terms such as sustainable tourism, responsible travel, eco-travel, geo-savvy, interactive travellers, etc.) remains unfamiliar to the majority of travellers.

Despite this, there is growing evidence that travellers are sensitive to issues of environmental, social and cultural degradation and would prefer, all things being equal, to support those industry players who are doing a good job -economically, environmentally, socially and culturally. This is particularly true of independent travellers. Further, there is a shift occurring from ""things to see"" type of travel to ""things to experience"" as travellers seek to connect more closely with the local destination. These travellers are seeking a more genuine travel experience deriving from a closer interaction with the local communities and the natural environment.

Recognizing the failure of the certification approach trying to encourage the industry to meet minimum ""standards"", Worldhotel-link.com Limited (WHL -an accommodation booking company) has developed a new approach with a strong bias toward engaging SMTE accommodation providers and travellers. In this model, SMTE accommodation providers undertaking any activities which preserve a sense of place or are in some way caring for or preserving the destination, socially and/or environmentally, are provided a free branding opportunity on the web (a chance to differentiate themselves), intended to appeal to the growing body of interested (i.e., geo-savvy, responsible, interactive) travellers. These travellers are then encouraged to provide feedback, which is published online, informing other travellers about the initiative (e.g., whether it is real or simply a ""green wash""; whether the initiative ""moved"" them;

whether the accommodation management/staff ""walk the talk"", etc.). The traveller feedback, if positive, should encourage more like-minded travellers to select the accommodation provider, improving occupancy and returns. By showing SMTE accommodation providers that doing good is good business, this should over time encourage more SMTE accommodation providers to start incorporating initiatives which care for the destination.

In doing the work of collecting information about SMTE accommodation providers to put online, WHL identified many small SMTEs actively engaged in projects, which, in their own way, were positive steps toward improving sustainable outcomes for the destination. None of the initiatives were of themselves ""certifiable"", but they all were valid. They were meaningful to the SMTE involved and addressed specific local needs. Examples included employing and training orphan children, supporting local schools, running a turtle hatchery, restoring a damaged coral reef, teaching traditional building skills, supporting volunteer workers and restoring historical buildings.

WHL then started to write up some of these initiatives as ""brand differentiators"" for the respective accommodation providers, highlighting for travellers what the accommodation providers were doing. Some initiatives were small, some large, but many offered the guests either a unique experience or, at least, an opportunity to feel that by staying with this accommodation provider they were doing some good. As a small SMTE, trying to differentiate yourself only on price, location and facilities is a slippery slope. Good service is a given, so what you have left as an option is really related to selling a unique experience, and it is this WHL is tapping. This then led to the idea of an ""eBay style"" bottom-up sustainable tourism marketing model. The SMTE accommodation provider (the supplier) markets their initiative(s) now a core part of their product, and the traveller (the buyer) after staying at the property gives them a rating and provides feedback online for other travellers to read and evaluate in making their buying decision.

First, it is free for the SMTE accommodation provider to participate.

Second, it is up to the accommodation provider what they undertake. This means that programs are more likely to be addressing perceived local needs either at the enterprise level or the community level. This increases ownership. Third, WHL is providing a direct link to a commercial benefit. If travellers like what the accommodation provider is doing and provide positive feedback, more business results. Doing good becomes good business. Fourth, travellers are engaged. They can now feel good about where they are staying and provide positive feedback for others. A virtuous circle has been built.

Regular traveller feedback on the authenticity of the initiatives and the commitment of the SMTEs will play a powerful role in keeping the checks and balances and in driving improvement. This approach also ensures that costs are kept low. Most of the traditional certification systems currently rely on external funding, and Font (2005) 

The scheme is inclusive of all stakeholders. It does not detract from traditional top-down expert certification rather it complements it with a truly bottom-up traveller and industry driven component. The WHL vision is to get enough SMTEs involved in this approach at the destination level to start to shape the destination.

The developing world Tourism is a major economic sector worldwide and especially in developing countries. According to the World Bank's World Development Indicators Report 2002, more than 70 per cent of the world's poorest countries rely on tourism as a key engine of economic growth. Poorer countries have the most to gain from pro-poor tourism initiatives. But they are also the most vulnerable to the negative effects of mass tourism, in terms of social, environmental and cultural degradation.

International -In the developing world, many individual private sector players, government employees and NGOs have come to understand the importance of the Internet and its effect in the tourism industry. However, many of these players have not understood the expanse and change of the Internet toward commercial ventures as opposed to purely informational. In tourism jargon, this has become known as ""booking versus looking"". Even when actors have grasped this concept, they have not understood the breadth of sites that exist on the web. Even subregional sites get lost in the myriad of tourism Websites that now exist.

On the other hand, the large well-established international booking agents (Expedia, Travelocity, Opodo, etc.) have not been able to figure out how to sell the developing world to its clientele, mainly due to the fact that there is a greater proliferation of individually owned SMTEs in the developing world that is not on any mainframe booking systems.

WHL is the first booking agent that has understood both the importance of local presence (the MPO) and international branding and marketing.

National -In the developing world, at the national level, there is a real misunderstanding of tourism as a private sector activity. Many times the decision makers at this level have no real tourism experience and do not understand how to market or sell at the enterprise level. Therefore, it is much easier to ignore the situation and focus on the nation as destination and allow the private sector to sort itself out. This attitude has a tendency to isolate nations and allow large private sector (and typically foreign-owned) operators to dominate the value chain. This is the exact behaviour that leads to offshore booking agents dominating the sales and not taking place in the nation. Also, with this attitude, very little information about the destination is maintained locally, increasing reliance on a foreign operator to manage the trip for the traveller out of fear.

Regional -Regions within nations not only do not cooperate to sell the product but battle for individual travellers. Many times adversarial campaigns are undertaken with little understanding of growing the whole market. WHL helps to mitigate concerns by forcing an identity of destination and then by not discriminating who can and who cannot be listed in the destination. WHL will work to ensure that appropriate products are given equal status and add value to the destination.

Local -This is where WHL is at its strongest. As described in the ICT intermediation, many operators have no voice at all in the global tourism value chain. These single ""mom and pop"" SMTEs are completely ostracized from the mainstream tourism economy, even though they provide the most authentic experience. WHL has specifically engineered the franchise system to allow for adequate coverage to support these SMTEs (Figure 3 .6). 

For nations that are attempting to use tourism as a means of economic stimulus for their country, they must consider the means at which the intended audience will receive this information. The Internet is a powerful tool and must be looked at as a means to broadcast the message about product. Instituting computers, e-mail, software and the Internet to populations of people who do not even have clean running water is a daunting task, yet it is necessary. The governments of countries need to look for innovative means to implement ICT into the rural areas that they are promoting for tourism.

In order to understand the importance of these policy implications, one must consider the sustainability of these projects. At this point, the largest barrier to sustainability is market access. The model depicted in Figure 3 .6 is a visual representation of information flow in rural destinations. In areas where most of the inhabitants have never used a telephone, the likelihood of Internet implementation is quite low.

The World Hotel Link concept currently looks at the accommodation portion of a trip. Tours encompass a much wider span of activities and products. The WHL concept should be broadened to capture the spectrum of products such as transportation, handicrafts, eco-activities, adventure sports, safaris, festivals, artistry, and so on.

Governments can learn a great deal about how to manage their destination by looking at the holistic approach that WHL employs from the private sector and find their role in the development process and focus on those activities. Too often government tries to play too large a role in tourism development and disconnects with the market and in the end the traveller.

As a model, the WHL platform could quite nicely work in other industries that affect the economies of the developing world.

The idea behind the policy of community-based tourism promotion is to protect the cultural heritage and value of the local population that some culture focused routes take place in. Some examples of where this has been extremely successful in the developed world are The Camino de Santiago in Northern Spain and Southern France and Hadrian's Wall in Northern England. Both of these destinations were driven by government policies to enhance rural livelihood through the promotion of cultural preservation and tourism.

In both cases, on macro-level planning, importance was placed on creating defined strings of clusters that were displayed and defined geographically using GIS and Internet technologies. Without the economies of scale for multiplying the budgets and efforts of local municipalities, they would never have been able to raise the amount of private sector or donor support. As well, the necessary infrastructural demands would not have been met to create an effective globally competitive destination.

Tourism historically has been criticized as a major detriment to the environment. The World Hotel Link ICT model attempts to engage the traveler as well as the host destination in tourism development that is environmentally sustainable.

Leveraging the Laboratory Response Network Model for the Global Health Security Agenda,"Promoting global health security as an international priority is a challenge; the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in its Global Health Security Agenda has articulated the importance of accelerating progress toward a world safe and secure from infectious disease threats. The goals are to (1) prevent and reduce the likelihood of outbreaks-natural, accidental, or intentional; (2) detect threats early to save lives; and (3) respond rapidly and effectively using multisectoral, international coordination and communication. Foundational to this agenda is the World Health Organization (WHO) Revised International Health Regulations (IHR) of 2005, which provide the legal framework for countries to strengthen their health systems in order to be able to respond to any public health emergency of international concern. This article proposes leveraging the distributed structure of the US-managed Laboratory Response Network for Biological Threats Preparedness (LRN-B) to develop the core capacity of laboratory testing and to fulfill the laboratorystrengthening component of the Global Health Security Agenda. The LRN model offers an effective mechanism to detect and respond to public health emergencies of international concern.","I n recent years, considerable resources have been invested in improving laboratory systems in resourcelimited settings. Noticeable improvements in infrastructure and laboratory diagnostics can be observed in some but certainly not all of these settings. More coordination is needed to implement national laboratory plans, improve the quality of laboratory services, and expand surveillance for emerging infectious disease threats. In February 2014, the Obama Administration launched the Global Health Security Agenda (GHSA) with the aim of moving toward a world safe and secure from infectious disease threats. 1 Foundational to this agenda is the World Health Organization (WHO) Revised International Health Regulations (IHR) of 2005, which provide the legal framework for countries to strengthen their health systems in order to be able to respond to any public health emergency of international concern. The IHR goals are ''to prevent, protect against, control and provide a public health response to the international spread of disease in ways that are commensurate with and restricted to public health risks, and which avoid unnecessary interference with international traffic and trade.'' 2 The regulations call on countries to meet 8 core public health capacities, one of which is laboratory testing.

High-quality laboratory testing is an essential component in initiating a public health response to terrorism, natural disasters, and emerging threats. It allows for effective decision making to close buildings or entire geographic areas, to treat exposed people, and to deploy therapeutics. In a recent editorial coinciding with the launch of the GHSA, Secretary of State John Kerry, then-Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius, and Assistant to the President for Homeland Security Lisa Monaco provided the sobering update that ''80% of the world's nations still are not prepared to deal with new pandemics.'' 3 The GHSA offers a path forward to support countries in achieving the core capacities of the IHR. This article proposes leveraging the distributed structure of the US-managed Laboratory Response Network for Biological Threats Preparedness (LRN-B) to develop the core capacity of laboratory testing and to fulfill the laboratory-strengthening component of the GHSA. The LRN model offers an effective mechanism to detect and respond to public health emergencies of international concern.

The Laboratory Response Network

The creation of the LRN stemmed from Presidential Decision Directive 39, which outlined antiterrorism policies and missions for federal departments and agencies. 4 One such mission was the ability of the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to identify threat agents, conduct epidemiologic investigations, and provide public health, medical, and pharmaceutical support. To that end, in 1999, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), in partnership with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the Association of Public Health Laboratories (APHL), launched the LRN to strengthen the nation's ability to rapidly detect biological and chemical agents that could be used by violent, nonstate actors. 5 The LRN-B began with only 17 laboratories and has since expanded to approximately 160 member facilities, which include both domestic and international laboratories, and thousands of sentinel clinical laboratories, 6 which form the foundation of the system. The LRN-B is diverse and encompasses public health, military, veterinary, environmental, and food laboratories that provide reference testing for a wide array of sample types including environmental samples and clinical specimens. The network has many strategic partners, which allows for coordination among federal, state, and local public health agencies, clinical laboratories, first responders, and law enforcement. 7 The foundation of the LRN is a unified operational plan and standardization of laboratory testing, so that a test result generated from one LRN member laboratory is the same as a result generated from another network laboratory, thus providing for rapid, high-confidence results to inform public health decisions.

At the beginning stages of the LRN, the primary focus was to prepare for and respond to potential bioterrorism events. In fact, the preparation efforts of the network enabled the US to have a rapid and extensive response to the 2001 anthrax attacks. Lessons learned from this response were used by APHL and CDC to strengthen outreach to clinical laboratories and first responders and to develop tools to assist laboratories in planning for surge capacity. Over the years, the LRN mission has expanded to include response to chemical threats 8 and other public health emergencies, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), monkeypox, influenza A virus subtype H5N1 (avian influenza), influenza A virus subtype H1N1 (2009 pandemic influenza), and, in 2014, the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and Ebola virus. Today's vision for the LRN-B is a laboratory system for rapid, high-confidence results to inform critical public health decisions about biological threats.

The LRN-B is organized as a 3-tiered pyramid (see Figure 1 ). At the base are thousands of sentinel clinical laboratories, which perform initial screening of potential biological threat agents. When sentinel clinical laboratories cannot rule out the presence of a threat agent, they refer specimens and isolates to an LRN reference laboratory.

The LRN is a national security asset that, with its partners, will develop, maintain, and strengthen an integrated domestic and international network of laboratories to respond quickly to biological, chemical, and radiological threats and other high-priority public health emergency needs through training, rapid testing, timely notification, and secure messaging of laboratory results. More than 160 state, local, and federal facilities provide reference testing, producing high-confidence test results that are the basis for threat analysis and intervention by both public health and law enforcement authorities. State and local public health laboratories comprise approximately 70% of the 164 LRN-B member laboratories. At the apex are national laboratories, such as those at the CDC and the Department of Defense (DoD). National laboratories primarily provide specimen characterizations that pose challenges beyond the capabilities of reference laboratories, and they provide support for other LRN members during a serious outbreak or terrorist event. The most dangerous or perplexing pathogens are handled only at BSL-4 laboratories at CDC and the US Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID).

The LRN-B is an excellent model of an interconnected yet distributed system that has proven its value by detecting several threats. However, perhaps the most successful aspect of this network is its role in strengthening the US public health laboratory system. With the creation of this network in 1999, US public health laboratories received federal funding to help build laboratory capability and capacity to prepare for and respond to acts of terrorism, natural disasters, and emerging threats. These primary characteristics of the LRN-B model can be used to develop the laboratory framework for the GHSA:

Strengthens existing public health and defense laboratory systems; public health laboratories use CDCprovided funds to ensure they have safe and secure facilities, procure instrumentation and associated maintenance agreements; military laboratories use the DoD resources to support their LRN activities Invests in public health workforce; federal funds support personnel at the state and local levels Provides training to ensure a highly skilled workforce Provides technical assistance such as troubleshooting scientific assays and equipment Provides standardized protocols and tests Uses molecular diagnostics Ensures coverage for human, animal, food, and environmental specimens Provides standardized electronic data messaging with laboratory results that contribute to sound public health decisions Uses a specific system for communications and provides help desk support to member laboratories Uses a restricted access website to house materials that can be accessed by member laboratories Invests in continuous quality improvements, such as conducting multicenter evaluations of assays, seeking feedback on operations from laboratories, providing scientific and policy guidance to laboratories, and collecting and sharing model practices Maintains qualified membership by using performance measures that include ongoing proficiency tests and designated timeframes for results and communications Promotes partnerships by convening member laboratories via routine conference calls and national meetings, and by engaging with subject matter experts across the federal agencies to ensure scientific integrity

In addition to detecting biological threats and emerging infectious diseases, there are 2 other core areas to support the detection of chemical and radiological threats. CDC has initiated plans to develop the LRN for Radiological Threats Preparedness (LRN-R). They are currently working on newer and more rapid methods to analyze clinical specimens for radioactive materials, a vital component of the response to an event involving human radiation exposure. Once funded, the LRN-R will be structured similarly to the LRN-C, with some laboratories having full capability to analyze radiological specimens; others will have more limited capability, and still others will have the capacity for packaging and shipping the specimens to a laboratory with higher functionality.

The LRN for Chemical Threats Preparedness (LRN-C) was established in 1999 and was composed of CDC and 4 public health laboratories, with a fifth public health laboratory joining the network in 2000. It quickly became apparent that 5 public health laboratories would not be sufficient to respond to a large-scale event. Today, there are 55 LRN-C members (CDC and 54 public health laboratories). All laboratories are qualified to package and ship clinical specimens (Level 3); 47 laboratories have the capability to test for exposure to toxic chemical threat agents (Level 2); and 11 laboratories (10 state public health laboratories and CDC) have expanded capability to test for exposure to additional threat agents, such as mustard agents, nerve agents, and other industrial chemicals (Level 1). They also have expanded capacity to provide 24/7 analytical analyses in a large-scale event.

The methods that are developed are all based on mass spectrometry and are quantitative, detecting the actual chemical agent, or more commonly, a metabolite of the agent, in urine or blood. In an overt incident, the agent will most likely be known, based on symptoms and injuries. For those with obvious symptoms or injuries, detecting exposure or the extent of exposure to the agent is probably not necessary. These methods take on importance in identifying those individuals who have been exposed but do not display symptoms or injuries immediately following the incident, and in alleviating the concerns of the majority of individuals who have not been affected but are concerned.

The initial focus of the LRN-C was to develop analysis methods for detecting exposure to chemical threat agents. Today, the methods have expanded to include a variety of different chemicals that may or may not be used overtly but pose a public health risk, including a variety of toxins and poisons ( Figure 2 ).

Both the LRN-B and LRN-C have extensive performance measures to ensure that member laboratories are meeting the requirements and demonstrating scientific integrity in their work. Further, the partnerships aspect of the LRN ensures that new technologies are evaluated in a collaborative manner and that there is a focus on continuous quality improvements. The LRN is constantly seeking feedback from its membership and uses this information to make quality improvements to all operations. In essence, the LRN brings a standardized framework for preparedness and response to public health threats that can be used to support the GHSA.

Promoting global health security as an international priority is a challenge. In its GHSA, CDC has articulated the importance of accelerating progress toward a world safe and secure from infectious disease threats. The goals are to (1) prevent and reduce the likelihood of outbreaks-natural, accidental, or intentional; (2) detect threats early to save lives; and (3) respond rapidly and effectively using multisectoral, international coordination and communication. Encompassed in these goals are 9 specific objectives to ensure a coordinated and targeted approach with partner countries.

The LRN provides a model system that can be leveraged to fulfill the detection goals of the GHSA. Following are some specific examples of how the LRN model can be used.

One of the objectives is to promote biosafety and biosecurity systems. Prior to the development of the LRN, state-operated laboratory facilities were aging, underfunded, and often lacked the BSL-3 capacity to safely handle agents that could be used as biological weapons. The public health infrastructure had deteriorated over the years due in large part to a lack of resources, the migration of laboratory workers away from laboratories and into higher-paying positions, and a decrease in the number of students pursuing careers in microbiology. In the face of these challenges, the LRN employed the existing public health infrastructure as the backbone of its network and rebuilt it through funds awarded to states by HHS's CDC Cooperative Agreement on Public Health Preparedness and Response for Bioterrorism (now called the Public Health Emergency Preparedness [PHEP] Cooperative Agreement). 9 Since the inception of the PHEP Cooperative Agreement, LRN-B public health laboratories have used the funding to build, expand, and maintain BSL-3 suites. 10 A BSL-3 suite is a contained area that must meet stringent biosafety requirements, including biosafety cabinets, controlled double-door access, and engineering controls, such as negative air pressure relative to surrounding rooms and microfiltration of air. BSL-3 agricultural facilities have additional safeguards, including decontamination of liquids prior to release into the sewage system, separate HEPA filtration of exhausted air, and pressure-impervious walls, floors, and ceilings designed to protect workers and the environment from accidental exposure to certain regulated agents. 11 Finally, BSL-3 enhanced facilities have even more safety features.

All US state public health laboratories currently have at least 1 BSL-3 laboratory with BSL-3 suites in the facility. These laboratories also comply with stringent US government regulations, such as those that govern the possession and transfer of select agents and toxins. Given their extensive experiences, LRN-B public health laboratories can serve as ''twinning'' centers to assist international laboratories with strengthening their biosafety and biosecurity systems to protect the laboratorians and the public.

Laboratory twinning initiatives are an effective and efficient way of capacity building, training, mentorship, and skill transfer. The Laboratory Twinning Initiative was launched by the WHO Lyon office, with the support of an independent steering committee, as a mechanism to support national efforts to meet IHR competencies. 12 The twinning agreements were designed to support public health laboratory services by establishing long-term mentoring partnerships between national and state public health laboratories and linking these sites. The requirements of the twinning agreements were: (1) approval of the national government as a prerequisite for a twinning project; these partnerships need to fit in with government priorities and national plans for building a functional public health laboratory system; (2) acknowledgment by the national government that the resource-limited laboratory is its national public health laboratory or a component of its public health laboratory structure; (3) the work of the laboratories participating in twinning projects must be relevant to national and regional plans for the organization Figure 2 . The LRN Structure for Responding to Chemical Threats. A designation level 1, 2, or 3 identifies laboratory capabilities and defines member network participation.

of an epidemic alert and response network; (4) the objectives and expected outcomes, evaluation process, conditions of collaboration, and roles and responsibilities of each partner must be clearly defined; and (5) where possible and appropriate, the development of commonly defined research projects is encouraged, as these often provide good opportunities to strengthen capabilities and attract donors' support.

APHL has supported 4 WHO twinning agreements. The project scopes of work varied from country to country and were carefully crafted based on the laboratory needs and interests of the participating organizations. Examples of the projects supported include: In 2009 APHL established a WHO twinning partnership specific to quality, biosafety, and biosecurity systems between the New Mexico Department of Health, Scientific Laboratory Division, and the Paraguay National Laboratory that could be replicated in other countries to support the GHSA (Figure 3 ). Despite a limited program budget, technical assistance and training exchange visits coupled with distance mentorship provided a solid mechanism for knowledge transfer and capacity building. This partnership yielded the following for the Paraguay laboratory: Development of quality assurance and biosafety manuals; Institution of a pipette calibration program; Biosafety training sessions delivered; BSL-3 facility planning and design completed; and Establishment of a quality committee at the laboratory.

In April 2014, through the support of CDC, APHL launched a twinning partnership between the New Mexico Department of Health, Scientific Laboratory Division, and a GHSA pilot country, Uganda (Uganda National Health Laboratory). This twinning agreement will center on the 6 pillars of the IHR laboratory core competencies outlined by the WHO-Afro office: Coordination of laboratory services; Laboratory capacity for the high-priority diseases; Laboratory quality management systems; Specimen collection and transportation; Biosafety and biosecurity; and Laboratory-based surveillance and public health actions. 13 The twinning model has proven a sustainable and costeffective method for technical assistance and knowledge transfer, in part because of the efficiency gained by linking entire institutions. Technical assistance visits, training, and informational tours are able to be conducted across laboratory disciplines and departments, allowing for results that can affect the accurate identification and control of infectious diseases. Leveraging the LRN model and instituting twinning agreements to support the model could significantly accelerate progress in efforts to strengthen laboratory systems. Laboratory twinning could also be considered and implemented for ''South-to-South'' collaborations, allowing for countries with similar laboratory systems to support each other and establish regional laboratory networks.

There are 4 detection objectives that are intrinsically core LRN principles.

1. Launch, strengthen, and link global networks for real-time biosurveillance. The LRN is a critical system for ongoing surveillance of threat agents. Member laboratories have detected a number of threats ranging from Bacillus Strengthening the existing LRN to be the mechanism that CDC uses to deploy assays for infectious threats such as MERS-CoV, dengue virus, and chikungunya virus will ensure an extensive standard laboratory system for real-time surveillance, detection, and response. Further, expanding the concept of the existing LRN framework and engaging other partner countries in strategic planning discussions to share lessons learned and exchange model practices could help in the development of laboratory networks across the world. Similar to the APHL and CDC partnership, in which APHL assists with the daily operations of the LRN and provides recommendations on strategic issues, 16 CDC can engage with other organizations such as the African Society for Laboratory Medicine (ASLM) to support a standard laboratory response network concept. This approach would eliminate unnecessary costs of establishing a new framework for laboratory response, use existing tools and resources, and thus increase efficiency.

Launched in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, in March 2011, ASLM was established to advocate for laboratory medicine, laboratory professionals, and laboratory networks throughout Africa. 17 This important organization, and specifically its intent to support laboratory networks, provides a critical platform for the GHSA. The President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) blueprint outlines the US government's strategy for ongoing efforts to defeat the HIV/AIDS epidemic and specifically calls for groups to ''support the African Society for Laboratory Medicine, and assess whether other country or regional health systems strengthening initiatives are needed to strengthen technical capacity.'' 18 The laboratory networks supported by ASLM could provide the communication system, governance, and management support necessary to respond to a public health emergency, following the LRN model.

Strengthen the global norm of rapid, transparent reporting and sample sharing. One of the hallmarks of the LRN is rapid data exchange. LRN member laboratories must have a secure mechanism to share laboratory data on threat agents with the CDC. Currently, most laboratories use an application called LRN Results Messenger (LRN RM), which allows LRN member laboratories to instantly manage and share standard LRN-related laboratory data. LRN RM represents the first iteration in an incremental approach to providing full standards-based electronic data exchange for this vital laboratory network. However, the nature of the application requires laboratorians to enter their data into LRN RM and their Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS), a time-consuming double entry process that could take up critical time in an emergency. Over time, increased capabilities have allowed for improved methods, and the LIMS Integration (LIMSi) project is the LRN's next step in electronic data exchange. The LIMSi project addresses the delay by aiding laboratories in connecting their existing LIMS to CDC, enabling LRN member laboratories to fulfill electronic data exchange needs for the LRN using their own systems and eliminating the need for LRN RM and double data entry. To implement LIMSi, CDC is collaborating with APHL to provide public health laboratories with necessary resources. There is still much to be done with LIMSi, and thus LRN RM remains a vital platform for many laboratories to rapidly exchange data with CDC.

The area of rapid and transparent reporting will require significant coordination with domestic and international partners and perhaps will be the most challenging aspect of the GHSA. Reviewing US public health laboratories and the LRN approach to data exchange could help to shape the data exchange model of this initiative.

Additional challenges may arise with sample sharing across international borders. However, the WHO IHR (2005) recognized this issue and included language to facilitate sample processing and disposal: ''States Parties shall, subject to national law and taking into account relevant international guidelines, facilitate the transport, entry, exit, processing and disposal of biological substances and diagnostic specimens, reagents and other diagnostic materials for verification and public health response purposes under these Regulations.'' 13 3. Develop and deploy novel diagnostics and strengthen laboratory systems. The LRN has a long and rich history of collaborating with federal agencies to develop new assays; partnering with state and local public health laboratories to evaluate new assays; and working with APHL to deploy these diagnostics to member laboratories. As noted earlier, the LRN is often credited with strengthening the US public health laboratory system.

The LRN-B is a unique asset in responding to all-hazard threats, providing immediate and sustained laboratory testing and communication and performing threat agent surveillance. LRN member laboratories have an impressive MANGAL AND MARYOGO-ROBINSON track record of responding to real-time threats in a timely and efficient manner and building partnerships across all levels of government and with the private sector. During the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, the public health emergency infrastructure built as part of the LRN was key to the response. ''Dual-use'' public health emergency infrastructure built as part of the LRN was integral to the H1N1 response by ensuring the following:

Availability and use of real-time PCR capacity using ABI 7500 Fast in 43 state and 11 county public health LRN reference-level laboratories. Much of this capacity was in place due to LRN approval for purchase of real-time PCR instrumentation using CDC/PHEP Cooperative Agreement funds, followed by ABI 7500 Fast instrument upgrades supported through the CDC Influenza Division. Availability and use of automated extraction systems with many of these in place due to LRN approval for purchase with PHEP funds for LRN capacity. Availability and use of molecular testing staff in public health laboratories that were funded and trained by both the CDC/LRN and the CDC Influenza Division. Availability of appropriate biosafety facilities in public health laboratories. Use of existing CDC LRN PHEP-funded systems enabled rapid and effective communication between clinical laboratories and public health laboratories.

4. Train and deploy an effective biosurveillance workforce. APHL has an extensive history of training laboratorians, 19 including the LRN workforce, and hosting fellowship programs. An example of a successful training initiative is the Emerging Infectious Diseases (EID) Laboratory Fellowship Program, sponsored by APHL and CDC, which trains and prepares scientists for careers in public health laboratories and supports public health initiatives related to infectious disease research. The EID Advanced Laboratory Training Fellowship is a 1-year program designed for bachelor's or master's level scientists, with emphasis on the practical application of technologies, methodologies, and practices related to emerging infectious diseases. The EID Laboratory Research Fellowship is a 2-year program designed for doctoral level (PhD, MD, or DVM) scientists to conduct highpriority research in infectious diseases. The process is competitive both for fellows and host laboratories.

Human resource development is critical to strengthening laboratory systems. Currently, there is a ''lack of sufficient numbers of well-trained laboratory scientists in public health service and inadequate laboratory management and leadership skills.'' 20 Nurturing laboratory leadership and management has to be supported for the effective oversight and administration of public health laboratory networks. APHL instituted the APHL-George Washington University (GWU) Institute for Public Health Leadership and Management in 2007 to provide senior-level public health professionals with essential tools for assessing national laboratory systems and strategies for strengthening the capacities and capabilities of high-quality public health laboratories. Initially taught at the GWU campus, and more recently transferred to the University of Dar-es-Salaam, Tanzania, and the Polytechnic of Namibia, this seminar has convened leaders from all over the world for 2 weeks of intense training on such topics as organizing an effective laboratory network; program evaluation, planning, and resource allocation; performing laboratory-based disease surveillance and response; developing and managing a central laboratory database; promoting professional development and a sustainable workforce; integrating laboratory information management systems and electronic medical records; electronic reporting of laboratory test results; and strategic planning and policy development. This type of training allows for leaders to gain the tools necessary and return to their home countries to implement effective laboratory networks.

Promoting a training culture similar to the LRN and leveraging existing APHL domestic and global partnerships for laboratory leadership and management will greatly enhance the capabilities of the biosurveillance workforce.

One of the objectives here is to develop an interconnected global network of emergency operations centers and a multisectoral response to biological incidents. APHL has provided guidance to US public health laboratories to assist in the development and exercise of continuity of operations plans. 21 Encompassed in these model continuity of operations plans guidelines is information on establishing an incident command system and ensuring linkages with various local, state, and national emergency operations centers. APHL's domestic expertise in supporting and testing continuity of operations plans can translate into the global arena with the goal of ensuring timely notification and sharing of laboratory results with appropriate agencies and partners.

In the anthrax attacks of 2001 (Figure 4) , 22 people were infected, 5 people lost their lives, and the cleanup cost was more than $1 billion. US public health laboratories tested thousands of samples to rule out or confirm the presence of any possible threat agent as well to restore public confidence that postal and other facilities were not contaminated with anthrax spores. CDC estimated that 284,000 people died worldwide during the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic. 3 Interconnected global systems are needed to ensure the rapid detection and containment of emerging threats as well as to reassure the public that it is safe to resume their daily living activities. Thus, strengthening the capacities LEVERAGING THE LRN MODEL FOR GHSA Figure 4 . Laboratories in Action: Preparing, Detecting, and Responding to Public Health Threats and capabilities of laboratories must be a priority as the GHSA moves forward. Leveraging the highly successful LRN model allows for internal coordination with CDC to better use subject matter expertise, training models, emergency operations center procedures, data exchange, and other technical resources; continued and expanded partnerships with DoD, the Department of State, and ministries of health; and use of the vast member network including state and local public health laboratories as potential twinning and training centers. Engaging APHL and other partners in strategic discussions to determine how best to meet the overarching goals of ''prevent, detect, and respond'' will ensure that all existing resources are brought to bear in this global effort to strengthen infectious disease detection systems.

Usefulness of Clinical Definitions of Influenza for Public Health Surveillance Purposes and on behalf of the PIDIRAC Sentinel Surveillance Program of Catalonia †,"This study investigated the performance of various case definitions and influenza symptoms in a primary healthcare sentinel surveillance system. A retrospective study of the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of the cases reported by a primary healthcare sentinel surveillance network for eleven years in Catalonia was conducted. Crude and adjusted diagnostic odds ratios (aDORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of the case definitions and symptoms for all weeks and epidemic weeks were estimated. The most predictive case definition for laboratory-confirmed influenza was the World Health Organization (WHO) case definition for ILI in all weeks (aDOR 2.69; 95% CI 2.42-2.99) and epidemic weeks (aDOR 2.20; 95% CI 1.90-2.54). The symptoms that were significant positive predictors for confirmed influenza were fever, cough, myalgia, headache, malaise, and sudden onset. Fever had the highest aDOR in all weeks (4.03; 95% CI 3.38-4.80) and epidemic weeks (2.78; 95% CI 2.21-3.50). All of the case definitions assessed performed better in patients with comorbidities than in those without. The performance of symptoms varied by age groups, with fever being of high value in older people, and cough being of high value in children. In patients with comorbidities, the performance of fever was the highest (aDOR 5.45; 95% CI 3.43-8.66). No differences in the performance of the case definition or symptoms in influenza cases according to virus type were found.","Viral upper respiratory tract infections remain a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, with influenza infections being an important cause [1, 2] . Influenza viruses A and B cause annual epidemics and produce 3-5 million cases of severe disease and 290,000 to 650,000 respiratory deaths annually [3] . Because influenza epidemics lead to increased social concern each season and the appearance of a novel influenza A subtype virus can cause a pandemic, and disease surveillance is crucial from a public health perspective [4] .

A retrospective study of the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of the cases detected in a primary healthcare sentinel surveillance network for eleven years (2008 to 2018) in Catalonia, a Spanish region with 7.6 million inhabitants, was conducted.

The PIDIRAC (Pla d'Informació de les Infeccions Respiratòries Agudes a Catalunya) sentinel surveillance system [15] is constituted of general practitioners and pediatricians from 40-44 primary care centers distributed throughout Catalonia. The mean number of general practitioners involved during the study period was 32 (ranging from 27 to 35) and the mean number of pediatricians was 26 (ranging from 24 to 28). The mean percentage of the population surveyed was 0.97% (ranging from 0.86 to 1.06).

Each sentinel physician collected weekly nasopharyngeal swabs by simple random selection in up to two individuals who presented symptoms compatible with ARI (with no specified case definition) or ILI according to the European ILI case definition [8] , namely: sudden symptom onset as well as at least one of four systemic symptoms (fever >37.8 • C or feverishness, malaise, headache, and myalgia) and at least one of three respiratory symptoms (cough, sore throat, and shortness of breath).

The samples were sent to the core laboratory of the PIDIRAC surveillance system for determination of respiratory viruses (influenza viruses A-C, syncytial respiratory virus, parainfluenza viruses 1-4, adenovirus, coronavirus, rhinovirus, metapneumovirus, and bocavirus) by real-time reverse Viruses 2020, 12, 95 3 of 13 transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Individuals whose clinical samples showed coinfection and those positive for influenza virus C were excluded.

For each individual, the following variables were collected: reported fever >37.8 • C, cough, malaise, headache, myalgia, sore throat, shortness of breath, sudden onset of symptoms, coryza, age, sex, comorbidities (chronic cardiovascular disease; pulmonary disease, including asthma; liver disease; renal disease; metabolic disorders including diabetes mellitus; obesity, defined as a body mass index >40; and immunodeficiency), and microbiological laboratory results.

The ECDC and WHO case definitions for ILI and the ECDC definition of ARI [7, 8] were analyzed. Influenza epidemic weeks were defined each season according to the data provided by PIDIRAC.

To investigate the performance of different case definitions and symptoms, we calculated the sensitivity (Se), specificity (Sp), positive predictive value (PPV), positive likelihood ratio (LR), negative LR, crude and adjusted DOR, and 95% confidence intervals (CI) [16] for all weeks (weeks 1-52/53) and for epidemic weeks (weeks with ILI incidence rate above the set epidemic threshold per each season), comparing the cases in which the influenza virus was detected with cases negative for influenza or positive for other respiratory viruses. The analyses were carried out considering all influenza A and B viruses jointly and influenza A and influenza B viruses separately.

To calculate the crude DOR for each case definition and symptom, logistic regression models with the outcome of laboratory-confirmed influenza were constructed. To calculate the adjusted DOR (aDOR), multivariate logistic regression models adjusted by age, sex, comorbidities, and season were constructed using backward selection. The analysis was performed using the SPSS version 25 statistical package and R version 3.5.0 statistical software.

All of the data used in the analysis were collected during routine public health surveillance activities as part of the legislated mandate of the Health Department of Catalonia, which is officially authorized to receive, treat, and temporarily store personal data in cases of infectious disease [17] . All of the data were fully anonymized. All of the study activities formed part of the public health surveillance and therefore were exempt from institutional board review.

During the study period, 10,830 samples were collected, of which 438 were excluded because of coinfection, and 25 because they were caused by influenza C virus. Therefore, 10,367 samples were analyzed, of which 3241 (31.3%) were positive for influenza (2035 influenza A only and 1196 influenza B only), 50.3% were female, 51.7% were aged <15 years, and 10.9% presented comorbidities. The most frequent clinical manifestations were fever (86.3%) and cough (80.9%; Table 1 ). The WHO definition of ILI showed the highest sensitivity (82%) and the lowest specificity (37%), whereas the ECDC ILI case definition showed the lowest sensitivity (58%) and the highest specificity (52%). The most predictive case definition for laboratory-confirmed influenza was the WHO case definition for ILI, in both all weeks (aDOR 2.69; 95% CI 2.42-2.99) and in epidemic weeks (aDOR 2.20; 95% CI 1.90-2.54). The ECDC acute respiratory infection (ARI) definition had the worst performance (aDOR 1.45; 95% CI 1.33-1.58 for all weeks and 1.36; 95% CI 1.21-1.54 for epidemic weeks). The clinical manifestations that were significant positive predictors of laboratory-confirmed influenza were fever, cough, myalgia, headache, malaise, and a sudden onset of symptoms. Fever had the highest aDOR in all weeks (4.03; 95% CI 3.38-4.80) and in epidemic weeks (2.78; 95% CI 2.21-3.50; Table 2 ).

The performance of the case definitions and the specific clinical manifestations by age group and the presence of comorbidities for all weeks is shown in Table 3 , and for epidemic weeks in The performance of case definitions and symptoms in all weeks and in epidemic weeks for the influenza A and influenza B cases was similar (Figure 1 ). influenza A and influenza B cases was similar (Figure 1) .

For the influenza A virus, the WHO ILI case definition showed the best performance in both all weeks (aDOR 2.81; 95% CI 2.47-3.20) and in epidemic weeks (aDOR 2.16; 95% CI 1.82-2.57). The symptom that performed best in both was fever in all weeks (aDOR 4.29; 95% CI 3.46-5.32) and in epidemic weeks (2.72; 95% CI 2.06-3.59).

For the influenza B virus, the WHO ILI case definition also showed the best performance in both all weeks (aDOR 2.47; 95% CI 2.11-2.91) and in epidemic weeks (aDOR 2.23; 95% CI 1.81-2.75). Fever was the symptom with the best performance both in all weeks (aDOR 3.58, 95% CI 2.73-4.71) and in epidemic weeks (3.00, 95% CI 2.11-4.25). 

The importance of integrating data from sentinel sites with that from other medical and non-medical sources to detect and assess influenza epidemics has been pointed out [18] [19] [20] . However, each component of the integrated system must be assessed separately so as to improve data interpretation. This study assessed the performance of a primary healthcare sentinel surveillance system in detecting true influenza cases.

The proportion of laboratory-confirmed influenza cases obtained in all weeks was 31.3%, a value in the mid-range of the results of other studies, which range between 7.1% [21] and 52.2% [22] . The disparity of positive results reported by different authors [9, 13, 19, 20, 23, 24] suggests that various specific circumstances influence the performance of each surveillance system.

The WHO and ECDC ILI case definitions for the surveillance of influenza in Catalonia performed differently, with differences in specific subgroups of patients, such as older people or those with comorbidities, although the results were similar when all weeks or only epidemic weeks were analyzed.

For the WHO and ECDC ILI case definitions, the overall sensitivities were 82% and 58%, and the specificities were 37% and 52%, respectively. A 2009-2014 French study [9] found higher sensitivities (89.8% for the WHO definition and 96.1% for the ECDC definition) but lower specificities (21.4% for the WHO definition and 6.6% for the ECDC definition). The differences may be because we only knew that patients had a temperature of >37.8 • C, instead of the required temperature of ≥38 • C stated in the WHO definition, and because in the French sentinel network, the ARI definition was an inclusion criterion, and nearly all patients included in the dataset had fever [25] . However, as in the French study, the WHO case definition of ILI was a better discriminator than the ECDC definition in our study.

The WHO ILI case definition had the best performance (aDOR 2.69; 95% CI 2.42-2.99) and was superior in people aged ≥65 years (aDOR 5.87; 95% CI 3.92-8.80) and in those with comorbidities (aDOR 4.00, 2.80-5.72). In contrast, the ILI definition of ECDC had a global performance of 1.52 (95% CI 1.40-1.66), and performed better in people aged ≥65 years (aDOR 2.32; 95% CI 1.62-3.34).

The ARI definition of ECDC had the worst overall performance (aDOR 1.45; 95% CI 1.33-1.58). This seems logical, as we compared confirmed cases of influenza against disease caused by other respiratory viruses or that were negative for influenza viruses, but not the performance of the definition in detecting any laboratory-confirmed influenza infection.

Another French study [26] during the 2012-2013 and 2013-2014 seasons concluded that the ILI ECDC definition performed poorly in tracking influenza epidemics, and suggested that the case definition adopted in any country should include fever. Our results support this idea, as the ARI case definition, which does not include fever, had the worst performance in confirmed influenza cases, both for all influenza A and B viruses jointly, and influenza A or B virus separately.

In a study carried out in Singapore between 2005 and 2009 in primary healthcare centers, the best performing ILI case definition was that of the WHO (DOR 13.5), while that of the ECDC was worse (DOR 9.7); the authors concluded that either definition is appropriate, while the ECDC ARI definition is inadequate for influenza surveillance [14] .

Fever had the best performance in all weeks (aDOR 4.03; 95% CI 3.38-4.80) and in epidemic weeks (aDOR 2.78; 95% CI 2.21-3.50), and the best performance in both groups was in people aged ≥65 years. In contrast, a prospective study of children and adults in Canada during 2008-2011 found fever was discriminative for influenza infection in children, but not in adults [2] .

Our results are in accordance with those of Falsey et al. [27] in the United States, which showed that fever was important in the elderly so as to retain specificity for the diagnosis of influenza.

Cough was the symptom with the second-best performance in all weeks (aDOR 1.85; 95% CI 1.65-2.08). Other studies have also found that the most predictive clinical manifestations are fever or cough. A review by Call et al. showed that, in spite of the different study periods considered, fever and cough were the most discriminating clinical manifestations, with a DOR ranging between 14 (95% CI 8.8-23.0) and 1.9 (95% CI 1.0-3.4) for fever, and between 12 (95% CI 1.4-97) and 1.4 (95% CI 0.71-5.0) for cough [13] .

A United States study [28] found that measured or reported fever had a better capacity to discriminate the risk of true influenza infection than measured fever alone (DOR 1.95; 95% CI 1.73-2.20 and 1.79; 95% CI 1.59-2.0, respectively), with the performance of cough (DOR 6.99; 95% CI 5.60-8.73) being better than for cough and reported or measured fever (DOR 3.18; 95% CI 2.83-3.57).

In the study by Casalegno et al. [9] , which was carried out in weeks 40 to 15, but not specifically in epidemic weeks, cough had the best performance (aDOR 2.53; 95% CI 2.23-290), with the best values in people aged ≥65 years (aDOR 5.55; 95% CI 2.67-11.52). In all weeks in our study, cough clearly performed worse than fever, with the best value in people aged 5-14 years rather than in older people.

In a 2009-2011 study in a Northern Indian rural community [21] , the best performance was for cough (aDOR 3.1; 95% CI 1.5-6.7), followed by measured fever >38 • C (aDOR 2.5; 95% CI 1. 3-4.9) . In contrast, the reported fever was not associated with laboratory-confirmed influenza cases (aDOR 1.3; 95% CI 0.5-3.6).

A 2007-2008 United States study by Woolpert et al. [23] found that independent predictors of laboratory-confirmed influenza in the 6-49 years age group were cough and fever (aDOR 47.99; 95% CI 6.29-366.13 and 3.84; 95% CI 2.23-6.61, respectively), although acute symptom onset and, to a lesser extent, myalgia, were also predictors of laboratory-confirmed influenza. In our study, myalgia was a predictor in all age groups, but the sudden onset of symptoms was a poor predictor in adults. Unlike our results, where headache had the third best performance (aDOR 1.94; 95% CI 1.78-2.12), other authors found headache had the best performance (DOR 21.2; 95% CI 5.2-86.4) [14] .

We found that sore throat was not a predictor of confirmed influenza in all weeks or in epidemic weeks, and was a discrete predictor only in the <5 years age group (aDOR 1.33; 95% CI 1.09-1.63). Likewise, it was not a significant predictor of confirmed influenza in all age groups in the United States study by Shah et al. [12] in 2009-2011, which found that the most discriminating clinical manifestations, with an aDOR >3, were cough and fever. Our results support the removal of sore throat from the clinical case definition in order to improve performance, as suggested by other authors [5] .

A study by Boivin et al. in Canadian outpatient clinics in 1998-1999 concluded that cough and fever in a patient at a time when the influenza virus is circulating widely in the community is likely to be associated with influenza [29] . We found the discriminative capacity of the WHO ILI case definition that combines fever and cough was very close both in epidemic weeks and in all weeks (aDOR 2.20; 95% CI 1.90-2.54 and 2.69; 95% CI 2.42-2.99). In the review by Call et al. [13] , the DOR for the combination of fever and cough ranged between 6.6 (95% CI 4.2-10) in patients aged ≥60 years and 3.6 (95% CI 3.1-4.2) in all ages.

No specific symptom can accurately diagnose influenza and, therefore, laboratory confirmation in representative samples of clinically compatible cases is crucial. This lack of specific influenza symptoms may explain, at least in part, why syndromic surveillance, which is routinely beneficial for the early detection of outbreaks of various infectious diseases, is not adequate for influenza surveillance [30] .

As in the present study, Woolpert el al. [23] found no relevant differences in the clinical characteristics of influenza cases caused by the influenza A or B viruses, reinforcing the findings of other authors that influenza type A or B infection can affect different age or risk groups, but cause a similar clinical syndrome [31] [32] [33] [34] .

An interesting result of our study is that all case definitions assessed performed better in patients with comorbidities than in all patients. Most studies of the performance of the case definitions used for influenza surveillance do not distinguish between patients with or without comorbidities, and those that include comorbidities [21, 29] do not analyze the performance of case definitions in patients with comorbidities separately, as we did. Future studies should consider this factor.

Our study had strengths and limitations. The main strength is that we only included patients with a laboratory-confirmed diagnosis of influenza, thus eliminating verification bias [13] , and that all physicians were working in sentinel primary healthcare centers using the same criteria for clinical samples. Another strength is that other possible etiologies of acute respiratory infections were studied in all samples, excluding those with coinfection [24] .

A first limitation is that, in our sentinel surveillance network, fever was predefined as a temperature >37.8 • C, but the specific temperature was not reported. In our opinion, the impact of this limitation may be minimal, as other factors, such as individual and daily variations, the site of measurement, and the natural trend for physicians to round temperatures up or down, can influence the measured temperature [9] . Secondly, age, the influenza type and subtype [5] , or the season [18] might be partially responsible for differences in the performance of the variables studied. However, we adjusted for age and season, and it seems improbable that our results are invalid. Thirdly, during epidemic weeks, when physicians are aware of the onset of epidemic activity, the criteria for the sampling of suspected ILI patients might be less rigorous [28] , but we have analyzed the performance of case definitions and clinical manifestations during both epidemic weeks and in all weeks, and no relevant differences were observed. Fourthly, although frequent in studies based on surveillance data, the number of patients aged ≥65 years was quite low (only 7.9% of all patients studied).

First, the WHO ILI case definition performed better than the ECDC ILI case definition, especially in older people. Secondly, all case definitions performed better in patients with comorbidities than in those without. Thirdly, the performance of the symptoms varied between age groups, with fever performing well in older people and cough in children, and in patients with comorbidities, fever performed best. However, no differences in the performance of case definitions or symptoms were found according to the influenza virus type.

BMC Public Health Beyond traditional surveillance: applying syndromic surveillance to developing settings -opportunities and challenges,"Background: All countries need effective disease surveillance systems for early detection of outbreaks. The revised International Health Regulations [IHR], which entered into force for all 194 World Health Organization member states in 2007, have expanded traditional infectious disease notification to include surveillance for public health events of potential international importance, even if the causative agent is not yet known. However, there are no clearly established guidelines for how countries should conduct this surveillance, which types of emerging disease syndromes should be reported, nor any means for enforcement.","In this paper, we review examples of these novel applications in the detection of vector-borne diseases, foodborne illness, and sexually transmitted infections. We hope to demonstrate that syndromic surveillance in its basic version is a feasible and effective tool for surveillance in developing countries and may facilitate compliance with the new IHR guidelines.

All countries, whether high or low resourced, need sensitive disease surveillance systems for the early detection and monitoring of outbreaks. Syndromic surveillance, or the use of near ""real-time"" data and automated tools to detect and characterize unusual activity for further public health investigation, has been used in the United States and many other countries to augment traditional surveillance. For the purposes of this debate, we propose an expanded definition of syndromic surveillance to include the use of data on pre-diagnostic clinical syndromes rather than confirmed cases of specific diseases. The use of pre-diagnostic data and statistical algorithms aims to detect epidemics earlier than traditional surveillance based on reporting from laboratories and healthcare facilities, including atypical presentations of severe disease [1] . In 2003, over 100 different US health jurisdictions used syndromic surveillance to augment their public health surveillance [2] . In addition, several countries have used syndromic surveillance for the early detection and response to diseases of public health importance.

Despite this widespread use, syndromic surveillance is meant to enhance rather than replace traditional surveillance. An Institute of Medicine study concluded that a balance is needed between strengthening the proven approach of traditional surveillance and innovative surveillance systems [3] .

In many developing countries, surveillance is limited due to the lack of a robust public health or laboratory infrastructure; however, the revised International Health Regulations [IHR] , which entered into force for 194 World Health Organization [WHO] member states in 2007, require the reporting of public health emergencies of potential international concern even if the disease agent is unknown, such as for a previously unknown disease or a known disease presenting in more severe form [1, 4] . Syndromic surveillance, just as in the developed world, can augment traditional surveillance in developing countries [1] .

Syndromic surveillance often involves automated electronic reporting and statistical algorithms that sometimes require a complex information technology infrastructure. However, syndromic surveillance does not need to be highly computerized or technical; its tools can be simple, using few technological or human resources, and can complement existing surveillance programs [5] .

An early example of ""low technology"" syndromic surveillance is the use of acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) as the syndromic flag for poliomyelitis. The syndrome is infrequent and may detect an excess of cases of poliomyelitis in a timely fashion by comparing observed rates of AFP to expected rates [6, 7] . Nonetheless, syndromic surveillance can detect outbreaks of disease that do not fall into current WHO case classifications, which is particularly important for emerging diseases, or diseases with severe clinical presentations with undetermined diagnoses, such as the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome [SARS] outbreak of 2002-2003.

Since resources for surveillance are scarce in many countries, compounded by high rates of staff turnover and difficulties with Internet access and other communication tools, syndromic surveillance systems in low resourced countries need to be simple and build on prior work. The WHO open-source systems for surveillance are accessible to countries and technological assistance can be provided [5] . This paper will review the background for the IHRs and their application to syndromic surveillance, and review examples of syndromic surveillance programs that are currently being used in developing countries.

Given the recent concern for pandemics such as SARS and highly pathogenic avian influenza [H5N1], global and regional surveillance should be built on the concept of integrated surveillance. Prior to their revision, the IHR mandated reporting of only three diseases to the WHO: cholera, plague, and yellow fever. A revision of the IHR undertaken in 1995 was finalized in 2005 [4] . The revised IHR address the need for strengthening of disease surveillance by modifying disease lists to include syndromes for diseases of epidemic potential, and recommend the establishment of mechanisms for reporting outbreaks of major public health importance and the development of early warning surveillance systems. The IHR now include reporting by all countries for poliomyelitis, smallpox, human influenza caused by a new subtype, SARS, cholera, plague, yellow fever, viral hemorrhagic fevers, West Nile virus [WNV] , and other diseases of regional concern such as meningococcal disease and dengue [4, 8] .

Annex I, part A.4 (a) of the revised IHR states that ""state parties are to develop the capacity to detect events involving disease or death above expected levels for the particular time and place in all areas within the territory of the State Party,"" providing impetus for countries to improve their broad based public health surveillance infrastructure. IHR 2005 expands upon the previous IHR by broadening the scope of public health reporting, demanding improved surveillance and response at the country level, and strengthening core surveillance and outbreak response capacity [9] . Refer to Figure 1 Recommended syndromes for surveillance include hemorrhagic fever, acute respiratory syndrome, acute gastrointestinal syndrome, neurological syndrome, and a provision for severe infectious illness [10] . Although these syndromes are not officially part of the decision instrument, implementation of the syndromic approach complements the disease-specific approach with a precise definition for each syndrome, and was pilot-tested in 21 countries [8, 11] . Development and field testing of syndromic reporting initially identified 5 syndromes of potential public health importance. After the interim review, WHO concluded that syndromic reporting could be useful at the country level but was not feasible for the purposes of glo-bal public health reporting due to the challenges of field reporting of syndromes and inability to standardize rules for outbreak control for these syndromes [8, 11] . Baker and Fidler raised concerns that syndromic surveillance may not be effective in the timely detection of emerging diseases [9] . Although these critiques raised valid concerns, in some areas syndromic surveillance systems have detected outbreaks in a timely fashion, complementing traditional surveillance. The WHO also supported the use of syndromic surveillance at the national level during its interim review as part of strengthening core surveillance capacity. Many countries have already implemented surveillance systems to comply with the revised IHR, including surveillance for severe diarrhea, dengue fever [DF] and dengue hemorrhagic fever [DHF] , and acute flaccid paralysis [e.g., refs. [7, 8, 12] ].

A meeting of the Pan American Health Organization on the Surveillance Network for Emerging Infectious Diseases in Amazon countries in 2005 recommended the development of early warning systems, adopting the syndromic approach to surveillance to heighten the sensitiv- ity of disease detection and improve clinical management of cases, such as the febrile icteric syndrome for yellow fever. Although in 2005 there were few guidelines for syndromic surveillance in the region, a recommendation to disseminate protocols was made [13] , and new applications have since been developed, as we discuss below.

General Surveillance for Infectious Diseases Many syndromic surveillance systems detect general febrile illnesses such as malaria, dengue fever, other vector-borne diseases, and foodborne illness. Collaboration between countries with experience in syndromic surveillance and low resource nations has resulted in the introduction of syndromic surveillance to those countries.

[EWORS] is a collaboration between the Indonesian Ministry of Health and the US Naval Medical Research Unit-2 [NAMRU-2], in Jakarta, and was adopted by the Government of Indonesia as a national surveillance system in 2007 [1, 5, 14] . EWORS includes patients presenting to public hospitals and suspected of having an acute infection. Participating hospitals, clinics and emergency departments use a short, standardized questionnaire to collect demographic and clinical information. The questionnaire is filled out on a computer terminal with EWORS software and the data files are sent by email to the EWORS hub in the Ministry of Health for analysis daily. Counts of sign and symptom combinations that may reflect infectious diseases of national importance are compared to baseline counts by automated algorithms and monitored at reporting hospitals and Ministry of Health offices. If an outbreak is suspected, Ministry of Health staff may initiate investigation or control efforts. The EWORS hub also sends a monthly report to each participating site summarizing their surveillance data. System advantages include rapid data acquisition and interpretation by hospital operators, which may allow for earlier case finding. One limitation of EWORS has been the challenges with linking suspected outbreaks to response actions, which requires coordination of local bureaucracies. A second limitation is challenges with standardization of procedures at hubs, which can create alert uncertainty [15] . EWORS has now expanded to include other Southeast Asian nations, including Laos. In Peru, the Ministry of Health and US Naval Medical Research Center Detachment [NMRCD], in Lima, have collaborated to develop a similar system for early warning of dengue epidemics [15] . A second Peruvian system, Alerta, developed by Voxiva, the Peruvian Navy, and NMRCD, allows real time transmission via mobile telephone, text message, or Internet of health information from sailors and their families [1] . The system monitors all nationally notifiable diseases and syndromes, as well as other diseases of particular importance to the Peruvian Navy. [15] . Demographic and clinical data for suspected or confirmed cases of disease and syndromes is collected by the medical officer at each site, who spends ten to thirty minutes daily in medical record review for reporting. The data is then transmitted to the Alerta Disamar central hub by Internet, toll free telephone, or radio. Reporting frequency varies by disease and ranges from daily or twice weekly in batches for common syndromes such as diarrhea or respiratory illness. The hub uses Voxiva software to convert data reported by different communication methods to a common format. Staff review graphs of weekly counts automatically generated in Excel. Alerta has identified over 31 disease outbreaks [15, 16] and has facilitated investigation of diarrheal disease, malaria, and influenza as well as detected an outbreak of cyclosporiasis at a naval base in Lima, Peru. Alerta has been especially useful in helping the Peruvian Navy identify and respond to outbreaks at remote bases, which previously may have gone unreported or identified long after they began because usual reporting channels were slow [15, 17] .

Syndromic surveillance may provide a relatively inexpensive tool for early detection of malaria outbreaks in low resource countries. In Ethiopia, weekly malaria cases collected from health centers in 10 districts from 1990 to 2000 were reviewed [18] . Four types of alert threshold algorithms were compared by plotting a curve for each type of alert. The curve demonstrated potentially prevented disease cases versus the number of alerts over a decade. This study found that simple weekly percentile cutoffs were as good as the more complex algorithms for detection of malaria outbreaks [18] , exemplifying that syndromic surveillance can be basic while still providing useful information. WHO has advocated alerts when weekly cases exceed 75% of baseline [19] ; syndromic surveillance may be able to provide early alerts of this type that will allow timely spraying and mass drug administration. The use of these types of comparative statistics in surveillance is a novel method for evaluation of the performance of malaria early warning systems [18] .

In 2002, the Uganda Ministry of Health piloted a new district level monitoring system in the southwestern highlands. Incoming clinical data from health centers are collated and entered onto a district level computer and compared with a baseline of historical illness data. An anomaly measure is used to provide the index of deviation, followed by electronic reporting. This simple system detected two malaria outbreaks in Kabale, in 2005 and 2006, more than two weeks before case numbers began to peak [20] .

Some surveillance systems monitor climatic and environmental data to forecast infectious disease outbreaks. In some areas, climate variables monitored by satellite can provide a two to three month lead-time for malaria epidemics [21] . In Eritrea, monthly outpatient cases of malaria in 242 districts and NDVI and rainfall datasets showed strong correlation, but coverage of clinical data stations was considered too poor to be of use in epidemic control [21] . In Tanzania, analysis of two malaria seasons in the highlands showed an association between regional rainfall and malaria cases. An early warning system based on rainfall observations may thus be useful for malaria epidemic prediction in some areas [21, 22] . An example of such a system is the USAID Africa Data Dissemination website FEWS-NET, which uses rainfall-based indicators to predict change in malaria risk [23] . Similar dissemination websites could be employed in low to medium resource countries for malaria and other vector-borne diseases where remote Internet access is available.

Syndromic surveillance for malaria may enhance public health response. Since a locally transmitted case of malaria occurred in 2006 in Jamaica, active fever surveillance has been implemented for early detection at sentinel healthcare sites, airports and seaports [24] . Analysis occurs at the local level and then is transmitted centrally on a daily basis. The information is then used to conduct active door to door surveillance of fever cases if warranted.

Dengue surveillance is typically conducted by the passive notification of suspected or confirmed Dengue Fever (DF) or Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever (DHF) cases and deaths. These passive systems have low specificity due to infrequent laboratory confirmation but are still useful due to their simplicity and low use of resources. Unfortunately, waiting for reporting by clinicians may lead to delays in public health action and decrease efficacy of control measures. Active surveillance may include clinician sentinel networks, active fever surveillance by community health workers, and sentinel hospital systems. The first two monitor for nonspecific viral syndrome, which may also be useful for detecting outbreaks of other diseases such as influenza or malaria. A web-based reporting system may improve reporting completeness [25] . Hospital sentinel systems monitor for severe disease and death, with immediate investigation of all hemorrhagic fever. Such systems must be complemented by laboratory-based surveillance for trends and serotypes [26] .

Despite concerns with its specificity, surveillance of the fever syndrome may be useful given that fever is likely caused by dengue in endemic regions [27] . In addition to serologic surveillance, there has been great interest in syndromic surveillance for detection and control of dengue [28] .

As an example, in 2004 an early warning system, 2 SE FAG, was established in French Guiana with the goal of detecting outbreaks of febrile illness in French soldiers, including dengue [29] . In 2006 the system was expanded to include 25 civilian health centers that provide surveillance on sanitary conditions. Before 2006, the only data available for dengue surveillance in French Guiana was laboratory confirmed cases. They compared the frequency and timing of detected febrile cases with the traditional surveillance system for dengue, and the sensitivity was found to be high, but specificity was low [30] [31] [32] . For this system, data on all cases of fever, suspected and confirmed cases of dengue fever, and confirmed cases of malaria by syndromic surveillance syndrome definitions (fever plus headache, myalgia, arthralgia, or retro-orbital pain) are employed. Data is collected in real-time by a medical provider seeing a patient, and information is recorded on the available platform (PDA or a computer). Data is then reported to French health authorities in Cayenne. Syndromic surveillance data is converted to a weekly format and reported to the health authorities weekly in cases of normal operation, or immediately in the case of an alarm. Automated alarms are issued from the syndromic surveillance system based on current past experience graph (CPEG). Under ideal circumstances, there is a 60-minute delay between case presentation and detection by the system [30, 31, 33] . To evaluate the effectiveness of the system, during an outbreak of DEN-2 DF beginning in November 2006, data on confirmed dengue fever cases from a reference laboratory and data from 2SE FAG for the occurrence of undiagnosed fever associated with headaches, arthralgias, myalgias, or retro-orbital pain were compared. Levels of alarm and public health actions taken were also recorded. The syndromic surveillance pre-alarm activated 6 weeks prior to the full alarm in week 2 of 2006 and provided early warning for military personnel in comparison to the laboratory-based program [33] .

The system was able to detect 6900 suspected dengue cases compared to 800 laboratory-confirmed cases in 2006. Although the sensitivity was high, specificity was low. Other limitations included incomplete report forms and dengue fever reporting being 67% higher than with traditional reports, most likely because traditional surveillance is limited to confirmed cases [30] [31] [32] . Despite its sensitivity, there has been some concern with using a febrile syndrome for dengue surveillance, given that of 7195 febrile cases, only 8% were confirmed to be dengue [13] . As in other applications of syndromic surveillance, other methods of surveillance must also be in place. A lab-oratory-based system for dengue may be more useful; yet given limited laboratory capabilities in dengue endemic areas, syndromic surveillance may provide valuable information on population epidemiology prior to laboratory confirmation [13] . Vector surveillance and control provides the earliest opportunity to avert or contain dengue epidemics, but many dengue-endemic countries lack resources for launching these programs.

The IHR call for reporting of other vector borne diseases such as West Nile virus and Rift Valley fever. A surveillance system developed in the Netherlands for early detection of WNV focuses on cases presenting with neurologic diseases and includes the monitoring of hospital discharge data, trends in laboratory testing, and monitoring neurological diseases in horses [34] . Such a system could be applied to medium resource developing countries by monitoring the neurologic syndrome and neurologic disease in animals.

Similar to early warning systems for malaria, comparison of different prediction models for cutaneous leishmaniasis [CL] show a strong relationship with climatic variables and thus may be amenable to the development of an early warning system [35] . Models for CL incidence in Costa Rica may outperform models with no climatic indicators [36] . For vector-borne diseases with a clear relationship with the El Nino Southern Oscillation phenomenon [ENSO], models that use climate indicators to forecast disease risks are being developed [37] . In Australia, climate modeling has shown a sensitivity of up to 90% when combined with mosquito surveillance data to predict epidemics of Ross River virus disease [38] . However, many climate-based systems are not widely used due to the lack of published models outside testing areas. Disease modeling is often limited to discrete data sets for small areas [39] . Nonetheless, modeling of these data sets may be useful for selected syndromes in low resource regions. Monitoring of both climate triggers and vector-borne disease indicators together may increase sensitivity and specificity and also provide validation of data sources and backup for potential system failure.

Several recent emerging infectious disease outbreaks, such as SARS and highly pathogenic avian influenza [H5N1], arose in Asia. Surveillance for new respiratory illnesses is therefore crucial in this region. In many regions, electronic data exist that can assist with an automated system. In Taiwan, an emergency department based syndromic surveillance system for 189 hospitals automatically transmits electronic patient data to the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control. This system was built on existing work done in the United States in collaboration with the Realtime Outbreak and Disease Surveillance [RODS] Laboratory [40] . The goal of this system, among the first nationwide real time surveillance systems in Asia, is to detect winter and summer spikes in influenza-like illness, respiratory syndrome, and gastrointestinal illness [41] . Should another epidemic like SARS arise, this system may be able to provide early warning and notification, thus improving global surveillance of emerging infectious diseases. Such automated systems could be used in other medium resource regions for the detection of emerging viral illnesses.

Syndromic surveillance for foodborne illness is important given the globalization of the food supply and the morbidity caused by diarrhea in the developing world. Systems can monitor for gastrointestinal illnesses through the tracking of diarrhea and vomiting symptoms. In the United States, the RUSick 2 disease forum is a web-based forum that allows residents to report information on nausea, vomiting and diarrhea syndromes, including foods consumed, with the goal of identifying common food vehicles in gastrointestinal outbreaks. The goal of this system is to decrease the time delay with routine laboratory surveillance for food borne outbreaks. Completeness of the syndromic surveillance reports collected via the webbased forum has been found to be as effective as similar reports from phone calls to the health department [42, 43] . Poison Control Center data has also been used to detect foodborne outbreaks, and found to be useful in early detection where there is no confirmatory diagnostic information available [44] . Establishment of these types of networks may be useful in areas with medium resources and good communications infrastructure.

These types of surveillance can also be applied to the developing world. In the Pacific region, there are four distinct levels of foodborne disease surveillance: no formal surveillance, syndromic surveillance, laboratory or pathogen-specific methods, and integrated food chain surveillance [45] . Vanuatu and Solomon Islands primarily use syndromic surveillance. Few countries have specialized laboratory surveillance, and thus information on specific pathogens is limited. A regional approach under the Pacific Public Health Surveillance Network would include development of uniform case definitions for reporting as the basis for syndromic surveillance and facilitate centralized data collection and sharing [45] .

Incidence estimates of typhoid fever in Egypt have been derived recently from hospital-based syndromic surveillance along with lab-based surveillance. Although assisted by the syndromic surveillance system, the majority of patients were evaluated in the primary care system and would not have been detected by the hospital based syndromic surveillance. This situation emphasizes the ability of syndromic surveillance to augment but not replace traditional surveillance. Syndromic surveillance must be broad in scope in order to catch mild disease and expand surveillance beyond hospital data, which tends to capture more severe cases [46] . This type of surveillance may be difficult to enact in low resource regions with limited access to laboratory facilities.

As for vector-borne diseases, environmental parameters may be useful for early detection of food or waterborne disease outbreaks. One study found strong correlation between cases of Vibrio cholera O1 in children in Bangladesh and temperature and rainfall two to four months prior. This type of model could be a good model for a climate-based early warning system for cholera in this region [47] and could be implemented in low resource countries.

Syndromic surveillance systems have also been useful in detection of diarrheal outbreaks. EWORS facilitated the detection of a large cholera outbreak in Indonesia [48] .

The WHO recommends a global health sector strategy as part of a multisectoral approach to responding to epidemics of STIs, including a syndromic approach for the detection and management of abnormal vaginal discharge [49] . The WHO strategy aims to decrease the cost of testing and to improve treatment practices, with a certain minimum data required for surveillance. This plan mandates knowledge of the prevalence of specific agents and their susceptibilities, which necessitates at least periodic laboratory surveillance [50] . Vaginal discharge and urethritis are the most common syndromes [51] . Syndrome case reports may include genital ulcers, urethral discharge, and vaginal discharge [52] . Monitoring of these syndromes may allow improved public health response for countries with low resources, for which automated reporting is not easily implemented. Since the introduction of syndromic surveillance in 1996 in Burkino Faso, the prevalence of STIs such as gonorrhea, syphilis, and chlamydia has decreased [53] , providing an impetus to continue this surveillance. In Cote d'Ivoire, the national health information system collects data in all community-based public health clinics, which are located in 29 districts and 10 regions [54] .

In the United States, the Philadelphia Department of Public Health monitors chief complaint and discharge data from emergency departments containing reportable disease information to detect cases of syphilis and manage them according to CDC guidelines [55] . These types of systems could be implemented in the developing world where electronic data or computerized systems are available.

Syndromic surveillance is thought by many to be a high technology tool. But surveillance of syndromes is not a new phenomenon, with one of the earliest examples being acute flaccid paralysis for detection of poliomyelitis outbreaks [6] . Surveillance of influenza like illness worldwide is another example of syndrome rather than disease specific surveillance [56] . While syndromic surveillance is augmenting traditional surveillance in the developed world, it also has the potential to improve timely detection of infectious disease outbreaks in developing countries, most of which lack access to a strong public health infrastructure and specialized laboratories. The burden of public health surveillance in under-resourced and understaffed settings is a challenge. Despite this, there are several examples of low cost syndromic surveillance programs that may enhance global public health. For example, community based programs that employ volunteers may lessen the burden on hospital workers [15] . Increased use of automated reporting may decrease the burden on health care and public health workers and allow for more complete reporting of potential cases of public health importance.

Syndromic surveillance may be especially useful for early epidemic control of certain vector borne diseases as well as for diseases of public health importance that have the potential to cross international boundaries. Examples of current applications of syndromic surveillance in developing countries are summarized in Table 1 . The IHR mandated the reporting of diseases of international importance; surveillance for syndromes may facilitate compliance with this IHR requirement. There is currently no infrastructure in place to enforce these guidelines, and each country must design a national surveillance system that can allow for timely detection and notification of these disease outbreaks. Although WHO is required to assist countries in developing capacity to meet these requirements, no funding is allocated from WHO for this purpose. Thus, improving countries' national public health infrastructure and reporting capabilities will require large financial and technical support, likely from countries with existing automated reporting [9] . Improvements in the communication infrastructure, including Internet access, will need to occur to allow electronic communication and enhance the timeliness of reporting. Furthermore, investment in training in epidemiology, field investigation, and information technology are vital to the future success of broader surveillance activities.

Although syndromic surveillance can provide useful early warning of diseases such as malaria, there are no guidelines for what to do with the information provided. It is still necessary to have a robust public health infrastructure for investigation of cases and implementation of an effec- [54] tive control program as with any surveillance system. Simple monitoring tools can facilitate effective epidemic control, but require the translation of this early warning information into timely public health action.

Syndromic surveillance systems should build on existing public health surveillance infrastructure, as well as work that has been done in other regions. The collaboration between the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control and the RODS Laboratory is one such example [40, 41] . With increasing access to the Internet, and decreased cost and improved user friendliness of information technology in developing countries [1] , novel applications for syndromic surveillance are enhancing traditional surveillance and will hopefully continue to improve the detection of outbreaks worldwide, fulfilling the goals of the IHR. We hope this review demonstrates both the effectiveness and feasibility of ""low-tech"" syndromic surveillance in low resources countries, and can be the starting point for further development of guidelines for how to conduct syndromic surveillance in developing countries.

Surveillance and outbreak report,"Although the World Health Organization recommends contact investigations around air travel-associated sputum smear-positive tuberculosis (TB) patients, evidence suggests that the information thus obtained may have overestimated the risk of TB infection because it involved some contacts born in countries with high TB burden who were likely to have been infected with TB in the past, or because tuberculin skin tests were used, which are less specific than the interferon gamma release assay (IGRA) particularly in areas where Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccination coverage is high. We conducted a questionnaire survey on air travel-associated TB contact investigations in local health offices of Japan from 2012 to 2015, focusing on IGRA positivity. Among 651 air travel-associated TB contacts, average positivity was 3.8% (95% confidence interval (CI): 2.5-5.6) with a statistically significant increasing trend with older age (p < 0.0094). Positivity among 0-34 year-old contacts was 1.0% (95% CI: 0.12-3.5%), suggesting their risk of TB infection is as small as among Japanese young adults with low risk of TB infection (positivity: 0.85-0.90%). Limiting the contact investigation to fewer passengers (within two seats surrounding the index case, rather than two rows) seems reasonable in the case of aircraft with many seats per row.","International air travel has become widely accessible and the International Civil Aviation Organization has forecast that scheduled passenger traffic around the world will more than double, from 2.7 billion in 2011 to 6 billion annually by 2030 [1] . This will increase the frequency of transmission of communicable diseases [2] such as influenza [3] , measles [4] , SARS [5] and particularly tuberculosis (TB) during air travel [6] .

The World Health Organization (WHO) issued a guideline on TB and air travel in 1998, and the third edition was published in 2008 [7] , recommending that member states should conduct contact investigations for close contacts of not only smear-positive but also culturepositive TB patients, if the index case was diagnosed with multidrug-resistant TB. However, the guideline itself acknowledges that the available evidence for the risk of TB transmission during air travel and outcome data from passenger contact investigations are limited and it calls for a coordinated international approach to research, data collection, analysis and dissemination to strengthen the evidence base for operational decision-making and policy development. Moreover, a systematic review on contact investigations associated with air travel in 2010 argued that the evidence for TB transmission in commercial aircraft is limited and that there is reason doubt the value of actively screening air passengers for infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis [8] . A more recent systematic review on the subject did not find any further evidence of TB transmission and concluded that the risk of TB transmission aboard aircraft seems to be very low [9] .

The challenges in estimating risk of contracting TB infection associated with air travel include the difficulty of obtaining the appropriate evidence: (i) Contact investigation for air passengers is often complicated by the unavailability or reluctance of the airline companies to share the flight manifest and by the unavailability of contacts. (ii) Contacts may have been infected with TB in the past, e.g. those born in countries with a high burden of TB. (iii) The specificity of tuberculin skin testing (TST) used in most contact investigations is low, leading to high positivity among the contacts, e.g. 24% in data from the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (US CDC) [10] .

In Japan, the TB notification rate has declined in the past six decades from 698.4 per 100,000 population in 1951 to 17.7 per 100,000 population in 2013 [11] , which is equivalent to the rate in Poland (17.6/100,000) and Estonia (18.4/100,000) in 2014 [12] . However, 8,000 smear-positive TB cases are still reported every year [13] and more than 65% of those involve persons aged 65 years or older, reflecting the ageing population. Therefore, incidents in which infectious, particularly elderly, TB cases travel by air unaware of their infectiousness, are not uncommon. On the other hand, almost all children and young adults are estimated to be uninfected [14] [15] [16] , therefore the positivity among children and young adults could be used as a surrogate marker for the risk of contracting TB in contact investigations. The local governments of Japan usually comply with the WHO guidelines and conduct contact investigations for contacts of smear-positive index TB patients associated with air travel. However, in Japan, no literature has been published on the contact investigations associated with air travel and the outcomes of contact investigations have not been reported.

Interferon gamma release assays (IGRA) can diagnose latent TB infection more sensitively and specifically than TST because TST also reacts to Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccination and the interpretation of TST results is likely to be ambiguous where BCG vaccination coverage is high [15] [16] [17] [18] . Two IGRA are currently available in Japan, the T-Spot TB (T-SPOT; Oxford Immunotec, Abingdon, United Kingdom) and the QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube assay (QFT-GIT, Qiagen, the Netherlands), and they are widely used in contact investigations, including those associated with air travel [19] .

We conducted a questionnaire survey on air travelassociated TB contact investigations in the local health offices of Japan from 2012 to 2015, focusing on IGRA positivity among the contacts. The purpose of the study was to estimate the risk of TB transmission associated with air travel, particularly using the IGRA positivity among children and young adult contacts as the outcome indicator.

An incident of infectious TB involving air travel was defined as an event in which the WHO guidelines for initiating contact investigations were met [7] and in which the local health offices decided to undertake an investigation. Events with an index case with smearnegative TB or unknown smear status, or with a flight duration shorter than 6 hours were excluded. Since in most of the contact investigations, only the flight time was available but not the ground delays after boarding or after landing, we decided that a flight duration of 6 hours or more would meet the definition of the total flight duration of 8 hours or longer stipulated in the WHO guideline.

The practice of contact investigations of TB contacts in Japan is similar to that recommended elsewhere [20] . Briefly, once a TB case is reported to a local health office by a physician, a public health nurse of the health office where the patient lives visits the patient to conduct an interview about contacts. When the case is smear-positive, the health office initiates a contact investigation (initiator health office). When a contact is a resident of another health office's jurisdiction, the initiator health office requests the health office at the residency (implementer health office) to conduct health screening for the contact on its behalf. When a ministry of health of a foreign country requests the national TB programme (NTP) of Japan to conduct a contact investigation associated with air travel for a Japanese resident, the NTP asks the health office of the contact's residence to conduct health screening. The health screening usually involves IGRA tests and, if indicated, a chest X-ray.

In contact investigations associated with air travel, the initiator health office usually obtains information from the airline company on seating positions of the index case as well as the contacts who were seated in the two rows in front of and behind the index case and on the contact details of the contacts. It then sends letters to the health offices where the contacts live to request health screening. When a contact is a resident of a foreign country, the initiator health office normally asks the NTP of Japan to coordinate the investigation with the ministry of health of that country.

In November 2015, we sent a questionnaire to all 486 local health offices in Japan and asked whether they had conducted contact investigations associated with air travel from 2012 through October 2015. Those who conducted contact investigations as either an initiator or an implementer health office, or both, were further asked about the index cases and the outcomes of the contact investigations via a structured questionnaire. The data collection was conducted from late November 2015 through March 2016.

Data collected included characteristics of the index case (age group, sex, smear test result, presence of cough at diagnosis and a brief description of chest X-ray shadow), the boarded flights (flight numbers, destinations and duration), outcomes of the contact investigation, particularly the number of the eligible contacts defined as those who were on two rows in front of and behind the index case, the number of contacts screened for TB, including the number of the contacts with IGRA, and how many were positive in the IGRA. Those contacts who also had contact with the index case outside the airplane, such as family members or travel companions, were excluded.

The data on the events were entered into Microsoft Excel. The events reported both from the initiator and the implementer health offices were sorted by the date of the flight, the flight number or the airline company, and the destination. When we found duplicated events, only the data reported from the initiator health offices were used. The events with unknown flight dates, unknown flight numbers or airline companies or unknown destinations were excluded.

The investigated contacts were pooled and classified by age groups, and the positivity was calculated as a whole, by age under 35 years and by age groups.

A binomial estimation of the 95% confidence intervals (CI) was performed using R software (Version 3.01, The R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria) to compare the IGRA positivity between the age groups.

Of the 486 local health offices of Japan, 451 (93%) responded. Table 1 shows the overview of the questionnaire survey. A total of 17 health offices reported that they took the lead in one or more of the contact investigations on 19 index TB patients who boarded airplanes between February 2012 and September 2015. The median duration between the dates of the air travel and the TB diagnosis of the patients was 1 month, ranging from 1 to 4 months. The total number of eligible contacts the initiator health offices reported, excluding those who had contact with the index cases outside of the airplanes, was 942, of whom 574 (61%) were screened for TB and 523 (56%) had IGRA test results available. Six eligible contacts declined TB screening. Thus, the response rate (the sum of those who were screened and who declined, divided by the number of eligible contacts) was 62%. An additional 70 health offices reported that they implemented the contact investigations for one or more of the contacts of 23 index TB patients (requested by foreign countries and the health offices that did not respond in our study) and provided IGRA test results on 128 contacts.

Of the total 651 contacts, 25 (3.8%; 95% CI: 2.5-5.6) were positive for IGRA (Table 2) . Among 205 contacts aged 0-34 years, two (1.0%; 95% CI: 0.12-3.5) were positive for IGRA. All of the 651 contacts were resident in Japan, however, details on their nationality were not known. The Cochran-Armitage test revealed that there was a statistically significant increasing trend towards a correlation between age group and positivity of IGRA test results (p < 0.0094). For eight contacts with negative IGRA test results reported by the implementer health offices, the information on flight date, flight route or flight number was not available, and we were unable to cross-check this with the information from the initiator health offices. Thus, we excluded the eight contacts from the database.

No contact developed TB disease after contact with a TB case on an airplane.

We conducted a questionnaire survey on air travelassociated TB contact investigations conducted in Japan. We found that 3.8% of the contacts had positive IGRA test results, with the positivity among the child and young adult contacts being 1.0%, which is almost equivalent to the IGRA positivity in Japanese medical students with no previous risk of TB infection (0.85%) [15] and in healthy university students (0.90%) [16] . This suggests that the risk of contracting TB infection associated with air travel is minuscule.

This level of risk is consistent with published data (0-4%) from 1993 to 2008 [10, [21] [22] [23] but much lower than the risk reported in the early 1990s (30%) [24, 25] .

There was a statistically significant increasing trend of IGRA positivity with older age. This might reflect accumulated TB infection in the past [26, 27] , particularly in the 1950s and 1960s when the TB notification rates in Japan were higher than 150 per 100,000 population [28] , rather than recent TB infection associated with air travel. Even in the late 1970s, the TB notification rates were higher than 60 per 100,000 population [28] . We therefore believe that it is reasonable to exclude those aged older than 35 years when analysing the risk of TB associated with air travel in our study.

The reason why the risk of TB infection associated with air travel is minuscule is that most commercial aircrafts used for long-distance flights have installed good ventilation systems with air exchange rates of more than 10 times per hour [29] and HEPA filters [30] , which are equivalent to the requirements for isolation areas of healthcare facilities in the US [31] , reducing the risk of TB infection during air travel. We have collected the IGRA test results of more than 600 passenger contacts, enabling us to stratify them into age groups and analyse the data of the age group of 0-34 years-olds, who are least likely to have been infected with TB before the relevant air travel.

In addition, since the positivity of IGRA was used as the main outcome indicator for the contact investigation, the data we report here were more sensitive and specific than those obtained using TST, particularly for areas where BCG vaccination coverage is very high. As we obtained information on contact investigations of TB associated with air travel from almost all the health offices of Japan and included in this study, we believe that these data are representative of the risk of contracting TB infection during air travel to and from Japan.

However, our study has some limitations: Since most health offices did not conduct the IGRA tests for the contacts immediately after the contact with TB cases, we were not able to calculate conversion rates. Considering the delay between contact with a TB case, diagnosis of the TB case and initiation and implementation of the contact investigation by different health offices, we believe it would be next to impossible to conduct the first IGRA tests within two or three weeks of contact with a TB case, and thus this limitation is practically unavoidable.

Although we assumed that contacts younger than 35 years were almost naïve to TB infection before the relevant air travel, this may not have been the case.

Combined with the unavailability of the IGRA conversion rates mentioned above, we may have overestimated the TB risk associated with air travel. However, considering the low IGRA positivity (1.0%) among children and young adult contacts, we believe the main conclusion would not change.

Because the study was a questionnaire survey administered to the health offices of Japan, it has additional limitations. Some health offices may not have reported having conducted air travel-associated contact investigations and thus may not be listed in our database. However, because we employed an inventory method to collect information on the contact investigations from both the initiator and the implementer health offices, including the central NTP unit, we believe that we have done our best to obtain an almost complete picture on air travel-associated contact investigations conducted in Japan.

The information some implementer health offices provided was incomplete and therefore excluded from the database, leading to a possible bias. However, considering that only eight contacts were excluded and that all of them were negative in IGRA, the potential bias is small and the IGRA positivity may be overestimated, but not underestimated. Finally, it should also be noted that the authors do not know the quality of IGRA tests conducted for the contacts at each health office.

From our findings, we believe that the WHO could narrow the criteria for initiating air travel-associated contact investigations to, for example, only smearpositive TB, as is recommended by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) in the risk assessment guidelines for infectious diseases transmitted on aircraft (RAGIDA) related to TB [32] . As the ECDC guideline further recommends, the infectiousness of the index case, such as transmission to household members or other close contacts, should be considered before initiating air travel-associated contact investigations [9] . As modelling studies suggest, the risk of contracting TB infection on an aircraft varies from low to moderate and is highest in the rows closest to the index case [33] . Limiting the contact investigation to fewer passengers (within two seats surrounding the index case, rather than two rows) in the case of wide aircraft with many seats per row seems reasonable [9] . Countries with a high burden of TB should prioritise other, more important, activities [8] .

"The Global Emerging Infection Surveillance and Response System (GEIS), a U.S. government tool for improved global biosurveillance: a review of 2009","The Armed Forces Health Surveillance Center, Global Emerging Infections Surveillance and Response System (AFHSC-GEIS) has the mission of performing surveillance for emerging infectious diseases that could affect the United States (U.S.) military. This mission is accomplished by orchestrating a global portfolio of surveillance projects, capacity-building efforts, outbreak investigations and training exercises. In 2009, this portfolio involved 39 funded partners, impacting 92 countries. This article discusses the current biosurveillance landscape, programmatic details of organization and implementation, and key contributions to force health protection and global public health in 2009.","Despite optimism in the 1960s that mankind had conquered infectious diseases, the world has repeatedly confronted the reality of its continued vulnerability. Two landmark Institute of Medicine (IOM) reports outlined these vulnerabilities [1, 2] . Recent events emphasize the wisdom of these documents, and the fact that the global community must unite to address emerging infectious diseases.

The first of two IOM reports, released in 1992, highlighted the potential role of Department of Defense (DoD) overseas laboratories in addressing the vulnerabilities of emerging infections. DoD has a long history of medical research and development, much of which has been performed through a network of overseas laboratories. Although their geographic locations have changed through time, five laboratories were in operation in 2009: Cairo, Egypt; Nairobi, Kenya; Bangkok, Thailand; Lima, Peru; and Jakarta, Indonesia in 2009 (Figure 1 ) [3] . Historically, the role of these laboratories was limited almost exclusively to the research and development of products, such as vaccines, antimicrobials or diagnostics, that would benefit the health of DoD forces throughout the world. Surveillance for infectious diseases, however, was minimal. Between 1992 and 1996, numerous documents and communications within DoD recognized the need for global emerging infection surveillance initiatives leveraging these overseas laboratories, and emphasized the commitment of DoD to these endeavors.

In 1996, the Executive Office of the President of the United States issued a Presidential Decision Directive (NSTC-7) stating that current capabilities were inadequate to protect the U.S. or global public health communities from emerging infectious disease (EID) threats [4] . DoD was again specifically noted among various federal agencies as having global presence and expertise that could be leveraged to help improve worldwide EID surveillance and preparedness. With these events, the DoD Global Emerging Infections Surveillance and Response System (DoD-GEIS) was established, thereby expanding the mission of DoD to address threats posed to the U.S. and other nations by newly emerging and reemerging infectious diseases. This was a timely development: The next decade brought SARS, West Nile virus and avian influenza, to name a few, and more recently, the H1N1 influenza virus emerged in 2009 as a pandemic threat.

In 2008, DoD-GEIS became a Division of the Armed Forces Health Surveillance Center (AFHSC) by direction of the deputy secretary of defense [5] . This move centralized DoD-wide healthcare surveillance initiatives with domestic and overseas laboratory surveillance efforts. In 2009, AFHSC-GEIS provided direction, funding and oversight to a network of 39 partners (Table 1) at approximately 500 sites. Ninety-two countries were impacted with either active surveillance, capacity-building initiatives or participation in training exercises ( Figure 1 ). This paper will summarize implementation of this global DoD laboratory surveillance network and its contributions in 2009, and discuss potential for the future as the U.S. government becomes increasingly proactive in global biosurveillance.

In addition to AFHSC-GEIS, many other DoD, U.S. government and U.S. nongovernmental organizations engage in surveillance or capacity-building activities throughout the world [6, 7] . In 2009, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) spent more than $1.7 billion on health and over $1.4 billion on humanitarian assistance [8] . Fiscal year 2009 appropriations by the U.S. Congress totaled $33.7 million for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) Global Disease Detection Program, the principal and most visible CDC program for developing and strengthening global public health capacity to rapidly identify and contain disease threats from around the world. The total budget for CDC's global health programs in fiscal year 2009-including the Global AIDS Program, Global Immunization Program, Global Malaria Program and others-was $308.8 million [9] . The U.S. Department of State's Biological Engagement Program (BEP) received congressional appropriations of $27 million in fiscal year 2009 to engage scientists internationally on issues related to disease surveillance and detection, biosafety and biosecurity. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) addresses animal health surveillance in the U.S., but is also engaged internationally in capacity building, research and biological control, and outbreak response, with a focus on identifying and evaluating biological agents that could impact global commerce of agricultural products [10] . USDA is also the official U.S. representative to the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE).

Through Defense Health Program funding, the assistant secretary of defense for health affairs provides $52 million annually to AFHSC-GEIS. The assistant to the secretary of defense for nuclear and chemical and biological defense programs recently embraced emerging infections as a threat to national security, placing global surveillance also within the scope of that organization [11] . Implemented largely through the Defense Threat Reduction Agency, historically that organization's focus has been threat-agent reduction and containment in the former Soviet Union. Authorization to extend globally and beyond threat agents is in process and will be conducted in part through the agency's Cooperative Biological Engagement Program. This is likely to result in an additional infusion of [12] . Most drugs licensed for the treatment of malaria were also products of DoD research and development [13, 14] . AFHSC-GEIS surveillance provides baseline infectious disease risk data that directly influences priorities and viable geographic locations for the conduct of various projects within the MIDRP. Much of the justification for engagement by the U.S. government in this work falls under the category of ""health diplomacy."" The meaning of ""global health diplomacy"" can be controversial, but a commonly accepted definition by the University of California at San Francisco is ""political change activity that meets the dual goals of improving global health and maintaining and improving international relations abroad, particularly in conflict areas and resource-poor environments.""

The involvement of DoD partners throughout the world in implementing this program can clearly be seen as serving a global health diplomacy role. By conducting surveillance and capacity building and assisting with training and outbreak investigations, all integrated into the functions and capabilities of host-country agencies, relationships are forged and trust is developed. International relations abroad are improved. Other DoD organizations work in this broad field of health diplomacy, but less directly in active biosurveillance.

Funding avenues and oversight for these different U.S. government health and surveillance initiatives are independent of each other, and coordination is complex. In a recent publication, the Center for Strategic and International Studies commented that with expanding efforts, agencies should leverage the existing successful programs, and seek a ""unity of effort."" [15] . The release in November 2009 of the National Strategy for Countering Biological Threats (Presidential Policy Directive-2) also emphasizes the need for coordination: ""No single stakeholder can fully address the challenge of biological threats on its own"" [16] . This document uses similar terminology as many of the mid-1990s documents that resulted in the development of DoD-GEIS.

The global laboratory assets of DoD have long been recognized as valuable platforms from which to conduct biosurveillance. Each laboratory is ""sponsored"" in-country by either the Ministry of Defense or Ministry of Health. In addition, close working relationships exist with other components of the host and neighboring countries' governments and academic institutions. Leveraging and empowering these relationships is a formula for success with expanded activities. Maintaining personnel at these military laboratories has also proven sustainable over time, when other U.S. government programs found this to be difficult. DoD's unique ability to provide valuable logistical support is a factor, as is its global integrated health care system meeting the health needs of uniformed families throughout the world that can help determine exposures and risk. The synergy between this system and the DoD laboratory system is becoming clear now that both organizations exist at AFHSC.

Another reason for DoD engagement in these endeavors lies in DoD's mission to ""deter war and protect the security of our country"" [17] . Combat aggressors are but one threat to our security. In the words of James Baldwin, novelist and civil rights activist, ""The most dangerous creation of any society is the man who has nothing to lose."" Endemic diseases in many resource-poor settings are a cause of instability. Each year, more than 1.6 million people die from diarrheal disease, 800,000 from malaria and 20,000 from dengue fever [18] [19] [20] . This burden of known endemic diseases imposes an economic toll and resulting instability. In contrast, emerging infections, whether naturally occurring or the result of human introductions, can result in social unrest and instability on a scale quite out of proportion to the level of risk they introduce [21] . Though new agents have the potential for high morbidity and mortality, fear can have an even greater impact. One example is the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) that rapidly spread around the world in 2003. By midyear, 8,098 individuals were known to have been infected with SARS, resulting in 774 deaths. In the scope of international infectious diseases, this toll on human life was minor. However, the economic impact is estimated at between $40 billion and $52 billion [22] . Likewise, 17 infections and five deaths were attributed to the intentional anthrax attacks in 2001. These small numbers do not adequately speak to the crippling disruption of services or huge economic losses incurred. According to a recent IOM report, ""Global health and national security are inexorably intertwined"" [23] .

Considering these facts, the enormous importance of early identification and mitigation of infectious disease threats is a critical component of a national defense strategy to ""deter war and protect the security of our country.""

The GEIS system functions on a model of ""priority pillars"" and ""strategic steps"" (Figure 2 ). The priority infectious disease pillars include respiratory, gastrointestinal, febrile and vector-borne, antimicrobial-resistant, and sexually transmitted infections. The strategic steps include surveillance and response; training and capacity building; research, innovation and capacity building; and communication of value added. Through integrated implementation of the strategic steps, a comprehensive yet flexible program is created which recognizes the needs of host and partner countries.

Funding for global surveillance initiatives in 2009 was approximately $52 million; $40 million of this was for pandemic/avian influenza initiatives (respiratory pillar), with the remainder available for surveillance in the other EID pillars. In preparation for distribution of these funds, a request for proposals was circulated among partner laboratories in the third quarter of fiscal 2008. A total of 198 proposals were received and evaluated by an internal review board of AFHSC staff. Each proposal was evaluated based on a) potential to fill a critical gap in public health programs, b) likelihood of tri-service or DoD-wide benefits, c) facilitation of timely public health actions, d) responsiveness to critical operational theater or regional needs, e) quality of epidemiology and science, f) leveraging of existing strengths, and g) accessibility of nonfiscal resources needed for execution. In addition, prior performance of the requesting organization and principal investigator was taken into consideration. Proposals were ranked based on scores received, and a cutoff level for funding was assigned based on score and available funding. An external review board, not associated with AFHSC-GEIS and representing all three major uniformed services, reviewed overall funding decisions and provided recommendations. Finally, GEIS and AFHSC directors were briefed and given the opportunity for input. Of the 198 proposals received, full or partial funding was available for the top-ranked 66 percent (130 of 198 proposals), and 56 percent of requested funding was allocated.

Communication within and outside the network was conducted in a variety of ways: required quarterly reports, monthly conference calls with awarded partners, consolidated DoD influenza reports (with variable frequency from daily to weekly during the emerging 2009 H1N1 pandemic), site visits with program reviews, peerreviewed publications, and presentations at multiple DoD and civilian international conferences. Results were reported only with local-host or partner-country notification and concurrence. In general, the information requested and shared by the GEIS network was aggregate in nature. GEIS does not archive extensive data sets from partners or host countries. Analysis and interpretation is largely done by the partner conducting the work, in collaboration with the host country, and with ultimate consideration of national sovereignty and transparency in the process. The central coordination of this global DoD surveillance system afforded multiple opportunities for enhanced utilization of partner capabilities, as well as concise information sharing with other DoD organizations and external agencies ( Table 2 ). The many examples share a central theme of leveraging global visibility and connecting needs with capabilities.

Communication with the World Health Organization (WHO) and CDC is a priority, with a DoD liaison positioned in both organizations to facilitate bilateral information exchange. The value added to these two organizations by the GEIS network is clear in the examples of the WHO reference laboratory status of Naval Medical Research Unit Number 3 (NAMRU-3) in Cairo, Egypt, and U.S. Army Medical Research Unit-Kenya (USAMRU-K). Both laboratories were highly leveraged in training and laboratory capacity building during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic [24] . Numerous influenza contributions to the WHO's Global Influenza Surveillance Network through CDC is another example. These contributions have resulted in numerous examples of viruses isolated by DoD's surveillance network being used as reference strains and the virus seed strain for seasonally available influenza vaccines [25, 26] .

This global DoD surveillance network should not and does not operate in a vacuum. A review of the DoD-GEIS influenza programs by IOM in 2007, conducted after the first year that the network received avian influenza/pandemic influenza (AI/PI) supplemental funds, commented: ""DoD-GEIS should further strengthen its coordination and collaboration on pandemic influenza … with all U.S. partners … These partners include HHS [U.S. Department of Health and Human Services], CDC,…"" [27] . The rapid communication to CDC of the novel H1N1 strains identified by two GEIS partner laboratories before any other public health laboratory (see Table 3 ) is evidence of the implementation of this recommendation. Though funded partners clearly understand the need for timely processing of samples and expeditious communication, it must be continually reinforced throughout the global surveillance network. Personnel turnover is high, and communication of these ongoing needs is a priority.

In its entirety, this special supplement of BioMed Central outlines many of the extensive accomplishments of the global GEIS partner network in 2009. Tables 3 and 4 outline the ""Top 10 accomplishments of the global network,"" and the ""Top 10 specific localized accomplishments.""

Another metric for success is the number of publications in peer-reviewed journals and presentations given by network partners. An accurate count is difficult because the independent network partners leverage funding from various sources for their initiatives. Nevertheless, 112 manuscripts associated with projects partly or wholly supported by AFHSC-GEIS were published in 2009; the number of poster sessions and presentations at various public and private conferences was far higher. Broadly speaking, 33 peer-reviewed publications encompassed febrile and vector-borne infections and other infectious diseases; 25 were in the realm of respiratory infections, including influenza; 19 described emerging infections; 18 were associated with malaria; nine were about gastrointestinal infection; seven described antimicrobial-resistant organisms; and one was related to sexually transmitted infections. Though populations under surveillance were often a mixture of military and civilian, 28 of these publications were directly related to U.S. or foreign military populations.

These numbers attest to the scientific rigor with which partners conduct their work, their ability to leverage funding to create a relatively balanced portfolio covering all five pillars of infectious disease threats of military importance, and their emphasis on military populations.

The WHO International Health Regulations, established in 1969, were originally intended to identify several specific diseases of concern (plague, yellow fever, cholera and smallpox) among travelers entering a given country. The events of the past few decades have made it clear that a new paradigm was needed to minimize the global impact of an emerging pandemic and its toll on human life. To this end, the International Health Regulations (2005), or IHR (2005), were formally adopted by the WHO 58th World Health Assembly on May 23, 2005 , and took effect on June 15, 2007 [28] . The focus of these new guidelines changed from specific diseases of concern to any event that could be considered a ""public health emergency of international concern."" Assessments of current capabilities in countries throughout the world were completed in 2009, and compliance with minimum standards of detection and reporting is required by 2012. Building local capability and infrastructure for compliance is the clear goal in IHR (2005) , and the regulations acknowledge and encourage countries and organizations that are able to assist resource-poor countries in their compliance process.

Considerable coordination and communication with in-country ministries, academic institutions and other in-country government assets is done by AFSHC-GEIS global partners. However, collaboration and capacity building conducted by DoD partners is being reexamined to comply with a broader U.S. government response, the National Strategy for Countering Biological Threats, and the IHR (2005) framework. The White House National Security staff is playing an active role in this U.S. government coordination. By conducting our program in coordination with this whole of US Government, then our capacity building, outbreak assistance and facilitating in-country diagnostic capabilities with host countries will meet the objectives of all by a) reinforcing amiable relationships between host-country Table 3 Top 10. Supported partners tested more than 72,000 respiratory samples, of which more than 17,000 (24 percent) were influenza-positive and more than 10,000 (15 percent) were novel A(H1N1). government public health assets and DoD partners; b) developing the capability to report ""public health emergencies of international concern,"" whereby the entire global community and DoD learns, and world preparations to minimize impact can proceed in a unified and transparent manner; and c) improving DoD's situational awareness through close, transparent, trusting relationships with host countries, even if an actual public health emergency of international concern does not occur.

As briefly discussed in the biosurveillance landscape section of this paper, many U.S. government organizations are becoming involved in global biosurveillance. The mission of DoD's overseas laboratories necessitates continued engagement with in-country public health authorities. However, with rapidly increasing involvement of other U.S. government agencies, a unique niche that U. S. uniformed officers throughout the world can and should expand engagement is with their global uniformed counterparts. In many cases, militaries are the major providers of health care in their countries, with abilities that far exceed their civilian programs. Despite political agendas, remarkable progress in facilitating open lines of communication can occur when two researchers or public health professionals, regardless of cultural or economic background, establish mutual rapport for a mutual interest: optimal health of their uniformed service members.

Although many military-to-military lines of communication and collaboration currently exist (Table 5) , another mechanism AFHSC used to facilitate increased activities in 2009 began with an expanded relationship with the International Committee of Military Medicine (ICMM). ICMM was established in 1921 by Belgian and U.S. medical officers (Commander Medical Officer Jules Voncken and Captain William Bainbridge) after World War I ""revealed the importance of closer cooperation between armed forces medical services worldwide"" [29] . With 104 member countries, ICMM is an unbiased, transparent organization with the goals of maintaining and strengthening the bonds between all medical services of member states, promoting medico-military scientific activities, and developing and participating in humanitarian operations.

Because of its unbiased membership policy, ICMM is the only military organization with a formal in-force memorandum of agreement with WHO. Through direct engagements or indirect facilitation and empowerment with ICMM, opportunities are being explored to work with foreign militaries, to further facilitate IHR (2005) compliance, and to facilitate force health protection and global public health in concert with WHO. Joint initiatives include co-sponsoring a forum titled ""Emerging 

U.S. DoD has a long and impressive history of infectious disease research and product development. The GEIS program was developed at a time of need by DoD-sponsored U.S. and overseas research laboratories. The wisdom of establishing improved global DoD EID surveillance capabilities is reinforced by numerous contributions to global outbreaks, most recently the 2009 H1N1 pandemic. The greatly increased interest by other DoD organizations and the U.S. government as a whole also reinforces this wisdom.

For optimal preparedness, surveillance is an ongoing process, not one that is implemented only in times of public health emergency. Sustaining these programs also avoids negative perceptions by foreign governments of U.S. involvement only with the ""surveillance priority du jour."" The right mix of empowering surveillance activities with capacity building is important to mitigate perceptions of taking but not giving. With the framework of current U.S. government guidelines, such as the National Strategy for Countering Biological Threats and IHR (2005), the world is closer than ever to truly working together on surveillance and control of infectious diseases without consideration of borders.

Social media engagement analysis of U.S. Federal health agencies on Facebook,"Background: It is becoming increasingly common for individuals and organizations to use social media platforms such as Facebook. These are being used for a wide variety of purposes including disseminating, discussing and seeking health related information. U.S. Federal health agencies are leveraging these platforms to 'engage' social media users to read, spread, promote and encourage health related discussions. However, different agencies and their communications get varying levels of engagement. In this study we use statistical models to identify factors that associate with engagement. Methods: We analyze over 45,000 Facebook posts from 72 Facebook accounts belonging to 24 health agencies. Account usage, user activity, sentiment and content of these posts are studied. We use the hurdle regression model to identify factors associated with the level of engagement and Cox proportional hazards model to identify factors associated with duration of engagement. Results: In our analysis we find that agencies and accounts vary widely in their usage of social media and activity they generate. Statistical analysis shows, for instance, that Facebook posts with more visual cues such as photos or videos or those which express positive sentiment generate more engagement. We further find that posts on certain topics such as occupation or organizations negatively affect the duration of engagement. Conclusions: We present the first comprehensive analyses of engagement with U.S. Federal health agencies on Facebook. In addition, we briefly compare and contrast findings from this study to our earlier study with similar focus but on Twitter to show the robustness of our methods.","An increasing percentage of the population uses various social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, and Tumblr for reasons varying from casual conversations to debating social issues. Around 68% of U.S. adults use Facebook [1] which has over 180 million daily active users in the U.S. and Canada [2] who spend around 40 min per day on this medium [3] . A recent study by PricewaterhouseCoopers showed that in the United States, 24% of adults post about their health experiences on social media with 16% of them posting reviews of medications, treatments, doctors or health [4] . A survey on social media preference among medical students showed 77% of first year medical students and 80% of graduating medical students use Facebook and prefer online media as their primary source of information [5] .

Facebook, the most popular social networking website [1], has invigorated a wide range of health sciences studies. Facebook use for disease surveillance [6] or public health issues [7] [8] [9] shows its broad scope for improving public health. Researchers have also used Facebook to address specific health concerns. For example, studies have been conducted to assess Facebook's potential in engaging smokers in smoking cessation treatment [10] and to evaluate it's scope in recruitment and retention of young adult American veterans into an online alcohol intervention study [11] . While most Facebook based health studies focus on information dissemination to individual users, surprisingly few have focused on how health agencies are involved in Facebook based communications [12] [13] [14] . This paper addresses this gap.

We ask the general question: How can health agencies be more engaging on social media? We perceive 'engagement' as interactions designed to promote some common goal as seen for example in [15] . In the context of this study the interactions between the U.S. Federal health agencies and Facebook users are meant to promote better healthcare knowledge through successful information dissemination and consumption.

The importance of social media for communicating to a broad audience is well acknowledged in journalism [16] , politics [17] , marketing [18] , entertainment [19] , etc. Healthcare organizations such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) or Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have a crucial responsibility to inform the public of critical pandemic events like the spread of H1N1 [6, 20] or Coronavirus [21] and about drug recalls [22] and sexual health information [23] . Interestingly, while the two organizations differ significantly in the number of Facebook posts they are quite similar in the response (activity/post) generated. Like the CDC, the National Cancer Institute of National Institutes of Health (NIH) also has several thousand posts, but their response is quite low compared to the other two organizations. While it may be that the intent behind a post is to inform rather than to generate a response, differences in engagement are notable. We do not yet understand if there are factors associated with these differences. The nature of public engagement with an organization's messages is an active focus of research in health sciences and in marketing [24] . This is traditionally studied by surveys of healthinformation seekers [25, 26] . Studies on engagement can inform organizations about topics of public interest [27] or strategies to increase public reach [28] . In contrast to surveys, our study of engagement on social medial is 'observational' where we assess public activities in response to posts by U.S. Federal health agencies.

We address two specific questions with respect to Facebook posts from U.S. Federal health agencies and the responses they generate. First, which Facebook account and post features are associated with the level of engagement, i.e., level of public response in the form of Facebook activity (likes, shares, comments)? Second, which Facebook account and post features are associated with the interval length between an agency's Facebook post and the last activity it generates?

We analyze an almost comprehensive set of Facebook posts from 72 Facebook accounts of 24 U.S. Federal health agencies. We explore associations between various features and level of activity using hurdle models. We explore the features related to our second question using survival models. Features we examine include standard ones such as the number of page likes as well as less studied features relating to the semantic content of a post.

We selected health agencies through the Health and Human Services (HHS) Social Hub website [29] which lists all Facebook accounts affiliated to various U.S. Federal health agencies.

The Facebook Graph API [30] was used to collect all posts from an account's timeline as of late January 2013. For each post, we recorded its unique identifier, number of likes, shares, comments and other metadata as described below.

We included features that are generally used in Facebook-based studies [12, 31, 32] as well as those that are seldom considered (see Table 1 ).

The number of page likes shows the number of users endorsing an account. A page like is different from a post like which is considered an engagement activity. Users liking a page receive all posts from the account in their news feeds [33] . It seems reasonable to expect page likes to associate with engagement.

The Facebook Graph API provides information about the type of a particular post. Posts are classified into six selfexplanatory categories, namely link, music, photo, question, status (a post is an uncategorized status if it is simply textbased and does not belong to any of the other categories), and video/Adobe's ShockWave Flash format (SWF). 

We hypothesize that the sentiment of a Facebook post may be associated with engagement. Perhaps more positive sentiment is linked with greater activity, or maybe the reverse holds. We analyze sentiment using a state-of-the-art lexicon-based sentiment classifier, SentiStrength [34] . SentiStrength has been widely applied to social media postings [35] and has been shown to outperform other lexical classifiers [36] . SentiStrength classifies each Facebook post into positive and negative on a scale of +/−1 (neutral) to +/−5 (extreme).

One aspect of Facebook analysis that is often overlooked is post content. We hypothesize that some topics are more attractive to a wider group than others. For example, a post about information dissemination of the outbreak of West Nile virus (""West Nile virus is a potentially serious illness. What you need to know: http://go.usa.gov/r9g4"") generated far more activity compared to a job posting from U.S. Public Health Service Nurses (""National Park Service has a Registered Nurse Manager position open in Yosemite, CA. This position closes on November 19. If interested, please send a cover letter and CV to S**** C**** at email@nps.gov."").

We use the National Library of Medicine's Medical Text Indexer (MTI) [37] to assign Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) [38, 39] recommendations to each post. MTI is commonly used to recommend MeSH terms to titles and abstracts of biomedical literature and has been shown to be useful in other domains such as clinical text [40] . As an aside we show a novel application of MTI in the social media domain. The semantic types of the MeSH terms are mapped to the fifteen higher level semantic groups by the National Library of Medicine [41] . For example, the high level semantic group ""Disorders"" comprises of 12 semantic types, namely, Acquired Abnormality, Anatomical Abnormality, Cell or Molecular Dysfunction, Congenital Abnormality, Disease or Syndrome, Experimental Model of Disease, Finding, Injury or Poisoning, Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction, Neoplastic Process, Pathologic Function, and Sign or Symptom.

As shown later, around 20% of Facebook posts have zero activity (i.e. they receive no likes, shares or comments). This type of distribution of data where the variance (of activity count) is much greater than the mean implies overdispersed data [42] with zero-inflation [43] . Typically linear models such as Poisson or negative binomial regression are used to model count data. However the zero-inflation and overdispersion (p < 0.001) requires using two-part count data models such as the hurdle regression model [44] . Hurdle models have two separate components: a zero-portion used to fit the sizeable portion of zero counts in the data and a count-portion to fit the non-zero counts of the data. The zero-portion models whether a count is zero (no activity) or not using a binomial probability model. The count portion determines the conditional distribution of the non-zero counts using a zero-truncated negative binomial or Poisson model. Previous studies on social media engagement [10, [45] [46] [47] have shown the power of hurdle models for modeling data with similar characteristics.

We compared different count data regression models (namely, the Poisson, negative binomial, hurdle Poisson and hurdle negative binomial (HNB)) using standard goodness-of-fit measures. The HNB model had the lowest AIC value (297667.3) compared to the Poisson (1,443,334), negative binomial (304590.7) and hurdle Poisson (1,292,709) models, signifying a better fit. The Vuong statistics signifies that hurdle negative binomial model has a better fit compared to the other models. Our comparison of full and nested models such as hurdle negative binomial and negative binomial using the likelihood ratio test also indicates that the former model fits our data best. Variance inflation factor (VIF) yielded VIF scores for all independent variables in our regression analysis that were within the range of zero to five indicating no multicollinearity issues.

The temporal characteristics of a post are also of interest. We use methods from survival analysis [48] , the branch of statistics dedicated to modeling such temporal behavior. Similar to other social media based studies [49, 50] , we use the Cox proportional hazards regression model [51] , specifically, to predict how the different features (see Table 1 ) associate with the time duration between the Facebook post and the last activity in response.

Seventy two Facebook accounts corresponding to 24 health agencies were identified. Seventeen are NIH division such as NIH/NIDA, NIH/NIMH and NIH/ NICHD. Some agencies have quite a few accounts such as NIH/NLM (6 accounts: Women's_Health_Resources, NLM_4_Caregivers, etc.), CDC (10 accounts: CDC_Tobacco_Free, Health_Hazard_Evaluation_Program, etc.), OS (16 accounts: HealthCare.gov, Medi-cal_Reserve_Corps, etc.) while several others have just one account such as ACF, FDA, NIH/NCCAM, etc. Table 2 lists the various agencies, the number of accounts for each and of accounts.

As shown in Table 3 Table 4 shows the top 10 accounts ranked by activity per post. We note, for example, that one of the six NLM Facebook accounts is in the top 10 list. Let's Move affiliated to the Office of the Secretary has the highest activity per post (246.2) when excluding posts with no activity. CDC's official account, with the most number of posts (2867), also leads in total number of activities (285,347). (115,940) .

Post types Table 6 shows the various types of post as well as their counts. Links are the most common (28,830) while questions are the least common (74).

In Table 7 , we see that Facebook posts are generally positive (percentage of moderate to extreme positive is 61.89% while for negative this percentage is 47.04%). Modeling activity using hurdle model Table 9 presents results from the hurdle regression model. Regression coefficients in the zero-portion are exponentiated as odds ratios (OR) while the exponentiated regression coefficients in the count portion are treated as incident rate ratios (IRR) [52] . When we interpret the results of a particular variable we consider all other variables to remain constant.

The coefficients of the logit regression in the zero portion of the model indicate how the features relate to crossing the 'hurdle' of obtaining at least one activity (i.e. either a like, share or comment). 

We now analyze the coefficients of the negative binomial regression in the count portion of the hurdle model (Table 9 ). This allows us to focus on posts that cross the 'hurdle' of getting at least one activity.

Given a unit increase in the log-transformed count of page likes, the rate of activity is expected to increase by a factor of 6.033, while holding all other variable in the model constant. For sentiment, a unit increase in positive sentiment increases the rate of activity by a factor of 1.126 while a unit increase in negative sentiment decreases the rate of activity by a factor of 0.934, with all 

The median number of days between a date of posting and date of last activity is zero. Almost 80% of posts have their last activity on the same day as the post date, but there are posts garnering attention for months or even years. Regression coefficients from the Cox proportional hazards model are exponentiated as hazard ratios (HR) and used in the interpretation of the survival models. It is important to note here that a longer interval is desirable for the time to last activity. Thus features with negative coefficients are beneficial. Interpreting the coefficients is as follows. For continuous variables such as log-transformed counts of page likes, a unit increase in these values may change the time to last activity with all other variables remaining constant. For binary variables (each post type or each semantic group) the time to last activity may increase or decrease based on the presence of a feature compared to its absence in a post. In Table 10 we find that a unit increase in the number of log-transformed page likes increases the time to last activity by 34.6% with all other variables remaining constant. A unit increase in positive sentiment increases the time to last activity by 2.1% while a unit increase in negative sentiment has no significant association with the time to last activity. Of the various post types, the presence of photos or videos are both linked to an increase in the time to last activity. The other post types are not significantly associated with the time to last activity. Amongst the 15 semantic groups, only eight are significantly related to the time to last activity. Posts containing semantic groups ' Activities & Behavior' , 'Concepts & Ideas' , 'Genes & Molecular Sequences' , 'Phenomena' and 'Procedures' are positively related by 2.9, 2.3, 13.6, 6.5 and 2.7% respectively. 'Devices' , 'Organizations' and 'Occupations' are the only ones that decrease the time to last activity by 14.7, 4.3 and 5.6% respectively.

Our results show that there is considerable difference between levels of Facebook use and public engagement among organizations. OS and CDC have the most Facebook posts while NIH/NINDS and NIH/NIGMS have less than 200 posts. In terms of engagement, CDC with more than 7000 posts generates the most Facebook activity among agencies. Overall, less than 5% of Facebook posts get more than 100 total shares, likes or comments. We also found that an account's page likes have strong positive relationships with Facebook activity. This is in line with previous research where page likes have been used as proxy for engagement with specific health condition pages on Facebook [53] . While it is not an easy task for agencies to increase the number of users liking a page [54] , it is still an easy metric to follow. Results also show that the photos, videos or interactive links may increase the likelihood of getting [31, 55, 56] , which show that media content and links are key to engaging Facebook users. Quite surprisingly, questionrelated posts, which are typically posted to encourage public participation or interaction, are apparently not useful in engaging the public. As observed in previous research [31] , it can be argued that while questions might encourage user comments, they are unlikely to encourage likes or shares. Probably the organizations can look into more innovative ways to frame questions that would encourage user engagement. The presence of positive sentiment in posts from these government agencies is associated with higher activity. We speculate that positive posts generate greater readership and thus higher engagement compared to negative posts on Facebook, especially in the healthcare domain. This is in contrast to previous research, albeit in a different domain, which show that users participate more in discussions regarding problems or concerns in political posts with negative affect [57] . Semantic groups have not been previously studied in the context of Facebook activities. We found that posts about activities and behaviors, and phenomenon are positively associated with level of engagement. In contrast, posts about organizations and occupations tend to lower engagement. It may be that such posts are meant to be more informative than engaging.

With goals similar to this research (i.e. to identify factors associated with engagement), we previously published an article where we analyzed tweets from 130 U.S. Federal health agency Twitter accounts [47] . Nineteen out of the 24 Facebook agencies studied here also had accounts on Twitter. Here we compare and contrast the findings from our previous Twitter-based study to our findings from this study. Comparison of accounts from same agencies but across the two platforms shows that Twitter-based accounts post more than Facebook-based accounts. This is likely due of the relative simplicity of Twitter postings. However, Facebook posts on average get more likes, shares or comments than retweet for tweets. In fact, around 27% of Facebook posts get more than 15 total likes, shares and comments, compared to only 10% of tweets that get more than 15 retweets. Comparison of the results of the statistical models from the two platforms reveals many interesting findings. As in Facebook, the use of URLs in tweets translates to higher engagement. Interestingly, while positive sentiment in Facebook posts correlate to higher engagement, it has negative or no association with the level of engagement in Twitter. The reasons for this are not quite obvious and we would like to investigate this in future research. In terms of semantic categorization, we find that across both social media platforms posts about activities and behaviors, and phenomenon are positively associated with level of engagement. In contrast, posts about organizations and occupations tend to lower engagement across both platforms. Overall, we find our results to be consistent and our methods to be robust for engagement analysis on Facebook and Twitter.

Our research has a few limitations. First, the social media landscape is extremely dynamic. We captured the number of likes, shares and comments as well as the time to last activity of a Facebook post as a snapshot within this dynamic system. Hence the recorded numbers may have changed over time. While our longitudinal data analysis shows that for four out of five posts all activities are generated on the date of the posting itself, we cannot guarantee that a post won't gather any activity after months or years. This limitation, however, is bound to affect almost any social media based research conducted at a specific point in time and that uses these counts or similar ones as metrics. Second, our study focused only on U.S. Federal health agencies and thus our findings may not be generalizable to other organizations. While we find ample evidence where our findings mirror those of Facebook studies in other domains (as shown in the Discussion section), we would like to investigate the generalizability of our approach in future studies. Third, the intent behind a post is only known to a posting agency. It could be to encourage discussion or to disseminate information. Engagement may not always be the primary motivation of every post or every agency. Hence our results should not be interpreted as general performance metrics for these agencies. Finally, we studied a specific set of features and their correlation to the extent and duration of engagement. While we included many commonly used features as well as some novel ones in this study, there could be other features such as post frequency [58] or posting time [59] that also have correlation to engagement.

While some previous studies (referenced earlier) have focused on engagement of health departments at a local level, to the best of our knowledge, we present the first comprehensive analyses of engagement with U.S. Federal health agencies on Facebook. Examination of over 45,000 Facebook posts from 72 Facebook accounts belonging to 24 U.S. Federal health agencies reveals a wide range of activity across these accounts. We find that a very small fraction of the 45,000 posts get more than 100 likes, shares or comments, while one-fifth of posts see no activity at all. Content analyses of the posts show, for example, that the majority of posts contain links and are generally positive in sentiment. Statistical analyses show that the number of page likes of an account is associated with higher engagement. We also find that posts containing media or links and expressing positive sentiment correlate with higher or longer engagement. Depending on their goals and objectives, these findings may be used as recommendations by the U.S. Federal health agencies for communications on Facebook.

BMC Public Health Reliability of case definitions for public health surveillance assessed by Round-Robin test methodology,Background: Case definitions have been recognized to be important elements of public health surveillance systems. They are to assure comparability and consistency of surveillance data and have crucial impact on the sensitivity and the positive predictive value of a surveillance system. The reliability of case definitions has rarely been investigated systematically.,"between countries. One of the first case definitions used for national disease reporting was the case definition for AIDS published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in 1982 [2] . In 1985 Sacks published a survey among all 50 US states, Puerto Rico, and Washington, DC, that revealed important variations in the case definitions between the different states, and concluded the necessity to unify case definitions if surveillance data between states are to be compared [3] . In 1990 the CDC in collaboration with the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists published an edition of case definitions for public health surveillance [4, 5] .

Since then case definitions have become an important tool of other national surveillance systems and international surveillance networks. Koo and colleagues have analyzed surveillance data for Cholera in Latin America and have described the importance of uniform case definitions to make data comparable between countries [6] . In 2003 the European Union (EU) case definitions for the European networks have reached obligatory status for the member states reporting to the EU [7] . During the SARS epidemic the case definition had a major impact on whether and how countries were considered affected or not, resulting in severe political and economic consequences for a number of countries [8] .

Coggon and colleagues have demonstrated the difficulties of determining optimal case definitions if a satisfactory diagnostic gold standard is lacking [9] . In sharp contrast to the importance of case definitions hardly any research has been published on the performance of surveillance case definitions. Studies are rare on how local health departments and other health professionals are able to understand case definitions and to what extent case definitions are unambiguous enough to really assure reliability. To our knowledge, the only publication investigating this issue was focused on case definitions for nosocomial infections: Gastmeier and colleagues had investigated how uniform the case definitions of the nosocomial infections surveillance system in Germany had been applied by different investigators using a set of 60 case studies [10] . Due to the general importance of case definition for public health surveillance and the current need for harmonization in international surveillance systems we conducted a systematic evaluation of the national case definitions with the objective to identify general as well as specific criteria and recommendations for improvement of case definitions.

Germany is a federal republic with 16 states subdivided into 440 counties. As in many countries the local (county) health departments (total number: 425) are the primary recipients of infectious disease notifications made by physicians and laboratories. Local health departments verify the incoming notifications and assess the need for public health action. Local health departments use one of five software products on the market to classify the case reports according to the national edition of case definitions and to report these cases electronically to the state health department. From there the report is being forwarded to the Robert Koch Institute (RKI), the federal institution in charge of national infectious disease surveillance in Germany [11] .

The edition of national case definitions for all notifiable infectious diseases was introduced in Germany in 2001, following the implementation of a new law to control infectious diseases (Infektionsschutzgesetz, IfSG) [12] [13] [14] . The IfSG determines the set of diseases and pathogens to be notified by physicians and laboratories throughout the Federal Republic of Germany. The five eastern states, which formerly belonged to the Democratic Republic of Germany (East Germany) and the State of Berlin have enacted complementary rules that make certain diseases additionally notifiable within the state jurisdiction, that are not notifiable in all of Germany.

The case definitions were developed by the RKI, using the delphi method including the expertise of state epidemiologists, national reference laboratories and medical and scientific associations for the specific diseases. The case definitions for infectious conditions under public health surveillance published by the CDC were also taken into account [5, 15] . After having published the IfSG case definitions in the fall of 2000 to be implemented with the beginning of 2001 the RKI also published additional case definitions in January 2002 for some of the diseases exclusively notifiable in the eastern states jurisdictions [11, 16] . From June 2002 to September 2003 we had conducted a systematic evaluation of the case definitions with the purpose to revise them by the end of 2003.

The German case definitions are divided into three types of evidence: Clinical picture, laboratory detection, and epidemiological confirmation. The types of evidence are specifically defined for each disease (see table 1 ). Based on whether or not requirements for these three types of evidence are fulfilled a case is classified into five categories. In the revised 2004 edition of case definitions these categories are named: A) clinically diagnosed illness (neither epidemiologically nor laboratory-confirmed), B) clinically and epidemiologically confirmed illness (not laboratory-confirmed), C) clinically and laboratory-confirmed illness, D) laboratory-detected infection not fulfilling clinical criteria, E) laboratory-detected infection with unknown clinical picture. (In the 2001 edition of case definitions these five categories were named slightly differently) For most notifiable diseases only categories B, C, D and E are reportable from the local health department to the next level, requiring at least laboratory detection of the pathogen or epidemiological confirmation. For some exceptions (e.g. tuberculosis, polio, measles, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease), cases are also reported from the local health department to the next level if category A -the clinical picture alone -is fulfilled.

In June 2002 we conducted a Round-Robin test in analogy to the established quality control procedure of laboratories and other testing units [17] . Round-Robin tests are mainly used in proficiency tests in order to determine laboratory performance by means of comparing tests on identical items by two or more laboratories in accordance with predetermined conditions [18] .

We asked each local and state health department to classify a selection of 68 written case examples on the basis of the case definitions that were implemented in 2001 (2002 respectively for disease only notifiable in East German States). While proficiency tests generally intent to assess the ability of laboratories in finding identical results, we applied this method to assess to which extend the case definitions were unambiguous enough to assure identical classification by the health departments.

We applied four different outcome variables in our analysis: 1) Disease identification: A disease was defined as being correctly identified if the participant of the Round-Robin test was able to identify the correct disease of the case example.

2) Case categorization: A case example was considered correctly categorized if the participant classified the case example with the correct disease and the correct case definition category as defined in the gold standard.

3) Reporting: The decision on reportability was considered correct if a case that should have been reported to the Clinical picture: Clinical picture compatible with salmonellosis, characterized by diarrhea, abdominal pain, malaise, vomiting, fever. Salmonella can also cause infections outside the intestinal tract (for example: arthritis, endocarditis, pyelonephritis, septicaemia). Laboratory diagnosis: Isolation (culture) of pathogen from stool or other clinical material (e.g. blood, urine). The identification of serogroup has to be attempted.

Clinical picture • Clinical picture of acute salmonellosis, defined as at least one of the following four symptoms: diarrhea* • cramp-like abdominal pain • vomiting • fever* additional information: Samonella can also cause generalized (septicemia) and localized infections outside the intestinal tract (for example: arthritis, endocarditis, pyelonephritis). These should in case of an acute infection also be reported. The reactive arthritis, which may also be caused by Salmonella infection, is not to be reported. Laboratory diagnosed Positive finding using the following method: • Direct detection of pathogen: isolation of pathogen (culture) Additional information: Results of identified serogroup and lysotype should also be reported. Epidemiological confirmation Epidemiological confirmation, defined as at least one of the following three constellations while taking into account the incubation period (about 6 to 72 hours):

• Epidemiological link to another laboratory-diagnosed human infection through ❍ Person-to-person transmission OR ❍ Same source of exposure (e.g. animal contact*, food*) • Consumption of food (including drinking water), for which Salmonella spp. was laboratory-detected in non-consumed food.

• Contact to animal (e.g. poultry) with a laboratory-detected infection, or contact to its secretions or consumption of its products (e.g. eggs). * terms marked with an asterix are defined in more detail in a glossary of the case definitions next level would have been forwarded according to the case definition category, given that the correct disease was identified. Inversely decision on reporting was also seen to be correct if a case that should not have been reported to the next level was in fact classified in a way that the case would have been held back. However, cases forwarded with wrong disease identification (see above) were a priori considered incorrect. Thus reporting was based on the question whether the case needed to be forwarded to the state level or not, which is a direct result of the disease identification and the case definition category. Sensitivity of reporting was defined as the number of cases that would have been correctly forwarded divided by the number of cases that should have been forwarded according to the gold standard. The positive predictive value of reporting was defined as the number of cases that should have been forwarded among those that would have been forwarded. Precision of reporting is defined as the number of cases that would have been either correctly forwarded to the state level, or would have been correctly held back at the local health department level, divided by the total number of case examples. Unless stated otherwise, reporting precision was the outcome parameter used in the following analysis.

To specifically assess the effect of different styles in formulating case definitions, a fourth outcome variable was used. The clinical classification was considered correct if the part regarding the clinical picture was classified according to the gold standard, regardless whether other parts of the case definition were correctly classified or not. This analysis was done to compare case definitions with narrative description of the clinical pic-ture (as in all former IfSG case definitions) to case definitions with a more explicit check-list format of clinical criteria, that was implemented for diseases additionally notifiable in specific states and for the new IfSG case definitions.

The case examples consisted in facsimile excerpts of one or more of the following sources: laboratory report form, physician form, and protocol of the patient interview [see additional file 1]. The case examples were created based on real cases that have come to the attention of the RKI in the quality control process and in the information service hotline that the RKI is offering to the health departments.

The case examples were pre-tested among epidemiologists within the RKI and among epidemiologists and public health nurses in the state and local health departments. 

After the data of the respondents had been analyzed, the classification originally intended while creating the case definition, was challenged with the results of the respondents. Three epidemiologists then reassessed each individual case example and re-examined whether the classification originally intended was still justified. Based on this process the gold standard was defined for each case example.

We compared the responses to the established gold standard and stratified by the following variables: health department being in an East German versus a West German state, disease of the case example, whether or not physicians participate in routine quality control of case reports (versus this being done exclusively by public health nurses), institutional level (local health depart-ment, state health department, RKI), acceptance and style of case definitions (check-list vs. text) and software used at local health department. Because of the selection and distribution of case examples described above, we conducted the individual analyses for each group. After univariate analysis we conducted a multivariate analysis using SPSS 13.0 for Windows (Version 13.0.1).

The distribution of the classifications was compared to the gold standard, in order to identify common discrepancies. Based on these discrepancies we identified which part of the case definition was affected and identified specific aspects of the case definitions that had repeatedly been interpreted differently by the participants, indicating failure of the case definition to be unambiguous and reliable. These aspects were then summarized in order to deduct commonalities which could then lead to specific recommendations on how to improve this particular case definition and also on how to improve formulation of case definitions in general.

In May 2002 -simultaneously with the Round-Robin test -we conducted a written survey addressed to all 425 local health departments in Germany. Among various questions on the structure and equipment of the local health departments, and their experiences with the new IfSG, we also asked about the profession of the person who had actually filled the questionnaire and about his or her attitudes and experiences towards the case definitions. 

The multivariate analysis was limited to data from the local health departments and without additional case examples for the East German states (n = 5995). Only statistically significant associations are mentioned in the following.

The disease of the case examples was for all groups significantly associated with reporting (p < 0.001 in group 1, 2 and 4, p = 0.022 in group 3).

Local health departments using the RKI-software showed a higher chance to identify the disease (disease identification) of the case example according to the gold standard compared to health departments using any of the commercially available software programs (group 2: OR = 

The administrative level at which the respondents worked, was significantly associated with the outcome reporting.

For the analysis we used all cases of set A and set E (without the additionally diseases for the East German States, n = 2213). Adjusted for the diseases the chance of correct reporting to the next level was 1.5 times higher in cases done by state level staff compared to those done by local health department staff (OR = 1.52, CI: 1.14 -2.02).

The following observations have been made in the qualitative analysis of the responses:

• The concept of epidemiological confirmation was not well understood. For example travel in endemic countries was equivocally seen as an epidemiological confirmation (e.g. haemorrhagic fever and travel to Egypt). Re-evaluation of the case definitions showed that in fact there was only a vague definition of the epidemiological confirmation.

• Participants appeared to have difficulties in deciding whether all clinical signs and symptoms mentioned in the case definition had to be existent in a case, or whether they were only listed as descriptive examples.

• Case examples of diarrheal disease without any evidence of a specific pathogen, were frequently classified as salmonellosis.

• Laboratory findings with only one elevated antibody value in serum were repeatedly classified as laboratory detection although the case definition required a rise in antibody level.

• In some case definitions detection of the pathogen is only accepted if the detection was done in specific materials (normally sterile material such as blood for detecting N. meningitidis). This limitation was frequently neglected.

• Some of the information in the case definition intended to serve as additional background information was mistakenly used as selection criteria (e.g. statement that clinician described rash as ""very typical"" for measles, but fever was missing).

When asked about the availability of the case definitions, 395 (99%) of 398 local health departments responded that the case definition were accessible at the work place.

The case definitions were seen as useful by 377 (95%) of 397 health departments who answered this question and not useful by 20 (5%). The clarity of the individual sections of the case definitions was rated differently: The section on the clinical picture of the case definitions was seen as unambiguous in all case definitions by 72 respondents (18%), in the majority of case definitions by 305 (76%), in the minority by 20 (5%), and in none of the case definitions by one (0.3%) of the respondents (n = 398 respondents). The section on the laboratory confirmation of the case definitions was seen as unambiguous in all case definitions by 137 respondents (34%), in the majority of case definitions by 248 (62%), and in the minority by 11 (3%) (n = 396).

Three-hundred and three (87%) of 347 health departments stated that case classifications were done exclusively or primarily by public health nurses. With respect to the case examples presented to the participants, 220 (55%) of 396 respondents (from the local health departments) stated that the case examples were realistic.

The results of our evaluation have shown that although case definitions may appear to be clearly defined, they may be interpreted quite differently by their users, which may result in severe misclassifications and reduced sensitivity and positive predictive value. This study is believed to be the first to systematically assess these effects Also the complexity of the case definition itself is likely to affect reporting precision. Unfortunately much of the complexity of the case definition is a result of methodological limitations of available laboratory tests and cannot be influenced. The case definition system with its three different types of evidence leading to five different categories may appear very complex and less intuitive that the classical categories of ""suspect"", ""probable"" and ""confirmed"". The detailed differentiation of the German case definitions however enables us to apply computer algorithms in order to translate these to the EU case definitions and thus make the data compatible to the standards of various European surveillance networks and to WHO reports.

Reassessment of the gold standard after receipt of the responses resulted in modifications of 5 of the 68 case examples. This procedure took place in an initial review process of gold standard before the actual analysis was done. We believe it was legitimate and necessary in order to correct for biases caused by unforeseen ambiguity of the case examples.

The software used at the local health department was significantly associated with the quality of the data in only some subgroups and outcomes. Apparently the software is not a very strong determinant in the given study design, although our experience in implementing the electronic surveillance system in Germany showed that commercially available software products often do not fully implement the standards published by the RKI for data transmission software or they do so with a delay of several years [21] .

The other interesting finding is that the administrative level of the participants was significantly associated with the outcome: Participants from state health departments had a significantly higher rate of agreement with the reporting gold standard than the participants from local health departments. This might be explained by the fact that staff at the state level is generally higher trained in epidemiology and infectious diseases than local health department staff and they are routinely involved in quality control of incoming case reports and also training and supervision of local health departments' staff. 

All the observed quantitative effects and their propagated explanations merge into the one main conclusion: Case definitions must be very carefully formulated in order to assure their unambiguous interpretation by local health department personnel. The detailed evaluation of our study has resulted in a substantially revised edition of the German case definitions [23,24]:

• We rephrased the case definitions in a check-list format indicating clearly how many of the symptoms and signs had to be fulfilled in which combination.

• Some diseases previously jointly described in one case definition were defined separately (Dengue was separated from other haemorrhagic fever; hemolytic uraemic syn-drome was created new, separately from EHEC and Shigella.)

• We rephrased the definitions in a way that for serologic confirmation the necessity for two samples is clearly apparent at the beginning of the phrase.

• The material in which the pathogen has to be detected is now highlighted and is only listed if it is relevant for the case definition.

• A glossary now defines the expressions that are being used repeatedly in the case definitions

• The case definitions are now limited to criteria relevant for the decision process. All additional explanatory information is clearly indicated as such in a separate section of the case definition • The evidence type ""epidemiological confirmation"" was completely redesigned and replaces the previously used term ""epidemiological link"". The accepted types of epidemiological links are now specified individually for each case definition.

One practical implication, that is supported by this analysis is, that software used at the local health department must be designed with strict accordance to the case definitions using identical terminology and structuring which would have been more easily archived if all local health departments had been equipped with one identical software system developed within or under supervision of one institution. Possibly other countries in the process of developing or implementing new electronic surveillance systems might want to learn form this experience [21,25].

The case example book, which resulted from this study, constitutes a detailed feed back for the participants of the study and is now being used as training material for public health nurses.

We have demonstrated that rigorous reduction of case definitions to testable yes/no-criteria in a check-list format is likely to improve their reliability. Reducing the differential diagnostic complexity of a disease to a limited number of yes/no-criteria, is a major challenge, but it also carries the benefit of facilitating computerized testing algorithms for quality control and for case classifications.

As the reliability of epidemiologic surveillance largely depends on the reliability of its case definitions, it is essential to create and revise case definitions based on systematic evaluations [9] . Most of the basic principles for the revision of the German case definition edition deducted from this analysis may also be applicable for case definitions in other countries (such as the United States, Ireland, Sweden, Mexico) or international networks (EU, WHO) as they share the same structural and editorial characteristics that we identified to be problematic in the first edition of the German case definitions [4, 7, 8, 26, 27] . We therefore believe that our findings are highly relevant for many national and international surveillance systems.

Determinants of emergency response responsibility perceptions in the local public health workforce after China's health sector restructuring,"Background: Local health departments are the backbone of public health emergency (PHE) response plans. The front line of emergency response preparedness is people. Role perceptions of individual staff members of a given organization strongly affect response probability and performance. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine local public health employees' perceptions of emergency response responsibilities, identify factors that influence their perception, and indicate the challenges and bottlenecks of PHE response in the Health Inspection Institution (HII) after its separation from China's multiple Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Methods: We used a stratified randomized sample survey to examine HII workers' knowledge of their own duties concerning PHE response in 17 facilities in Heilongjiang, a province in northeastern China. Data were collected from May to July 2010 using a 9-item combined question inquiring about the workers' statutory duties. Results: Of 348 administered surveys, 309 were returned for an overall response rate of 88.8 %. Overall, the correct recognition rate of PHE responsibilities was low. Some HII workers were confused about their responsibilities required by law, regulations, and emergency response plans. A quarter of all the respondents had the lowest knowledge for PHE responsibilities. Factors influencing their perceptions of responsibilities were department, work experience in a CDC, and PHE response experience. Conclusions: To improve preparedness for a PHE, efforts are needed to train, support, and monitor the workers' knowledge and competencies in PHEs as part of an organizational change; the worker's knowledge of their responsibilities should be measured and used as an indicator of preparedness for a PHE, and training should be undertaken where there are deficiencies. Management should also encourage workers in the departments of food hygiene/school health surveillance to be more involved in PHE preparedness and response issues.","Recent years have witnessed a number of microbial threats that have greatly jeopardized public health in many areas of the world. One of the most publicized cases is severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), whose outbreak and rapid spread in more than 25 countries in early 2003 claimed numerous lives and caused tremendous economic losses. It is predicted that new pathogens-originating naturally or from bioterrorism-will continue to emerge and cause new public health emergencies (PHEs) [1] [2] [3] [4] . Response to PHEs should be regarded as a global issue and particular attention should be paid to developing countries that have relatively fewer resources to deal with PHEs [1] .

The outbreak of SARS exposed a fundamental shortcoming not only in China's public health system but also in China's limited ability to detect and respond to emergencies in a timely and effective manner [1, 5] .

Realizing the weakness of its public health systems, China is undertaking extensive efforts to improve its public health system by establishing and strengthening its ""one mechanism and three systems"" approach: the PHE response mechanism, disease control and prevention, medical treatment, and the health inspection and health law enforcement system. As one of the newest responsibilities assigned to public health agencies after SARS, PHE response is at the forefront of public attention and involves numerous players; the major providers are in healthcare sectors such as health bureaus, hospitals, multiple Centers for Disease control and Prevention (CDCs), and Health Inspection Institutions (HIIs).

Local health departments are considered the backbone of public health response plans for any and all PHEs [6] . The PHE response during the Ebola epidemic that occurred in West Africa in 2014 reiterated this position. The HII has been established as a new branch of China's public health system after separation from the CDCs under China's health sector reform and subsequent organizational transformation in 2010. Increasing HII preparedness for disasters-especially local preparedness-is a significant concern of public health planners because several studies suggest that the initial response to a PHE would generally begin at the local level [7] [8] [9] .

The front line of emergency response preparedness is people [10] . Role perceptions of individual staff members of a given organization will factor strongly into response probability and performance [11, 12] . Job responsibility awareness has always been imperative for people to perform tasks effectively [13] . We define job responsibility as a state in which the individual perceives an obligation for a situation or event [14] .

The shortage of job knowledge and job responsibility might decrease job performance, because job knowledge predicts job performance [15] . Daniel and his colleagues at the Johns Hopkins Center for Public Health Preparedness identified specific barriers to adopting an emergency response culture in local health departments. These barriers include public health employees' fear for their personal and family safety in emergencies, coupled with a lack of insight into how valuable they are to crisis response efforts [16, 17] . Differences in perceptions of responsibilities in PHE preparedness across administrative levels is another barrier, because different public health information, programs, and distribution channels may be required to increase preparedness among different subgroups. Thus, understanding each individual's role in response to a PHE is considered key for competent response [18] .

However, with the separation from the CDC and the addition of PHE response as a new function came many challenges for the HIIs in terms of implementing the work: the current health supervision system model is not uniform and personnel status is not clear, among other issues. The most critical challenge is the absence of clearly defined duties and responsibilities. The assignment of responsibility and the response procedures have not been specified in detail [19] . Several overlapping roles and responsibilities between the CDC system and the HII system have hindered their interagency cooperation. The CDC possesses techniques for public health surveillance, while the HIIs have the authority to conduct surveillance. In practice, some staff complain that they always feel embarrassed because they cannot decide how, where, when, or how frequently to conduct surveillance. Many projects have to be delayed owing to poor cooperation [3, 14] .

Previous studies have shown that during extreme scenarios, a majority of healthcare workers may be unable or unwilling to report to duty [16] . This may be true even for local health departments. Little is known about administrative differences in HII preparedness-especially after the separation of the HII from the CDC [18] . Few studies, however, have focused on the preparedness and competent response of local HIIs in China for policy makers. One reason might be that HII only recently became a separate agency from the CDCs.

As the major provider in dealing with PHEs after the 2003 SARS crisis, do HII workers clearly know their duties related to the PHE? What factors influence their perception? What are the challenges and bottleneck problems? The solution to these essential questions will be effective in generating a competent PHE response. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess local public health employees' perceptions of emergency response responsibilities after China's health sector restructuring, and to uncover the variables that affect these outcomes, thus providing much needed evidence for health departments' training efforts. In this study, we demonstrate that the CDCs and HIIs have not yet formed a closely coordinated relationship after the sector restructuring. Further, HII workers still do not clearly understand their PHE responsibilities and this lack of understanding could also occur during reforms of health sectors in other countries.

The present study used a quantitative approach, analyzing HII workers' perception of responsibilities associated with a PHE and the determinants to indirectly assess the development and status of HII emergency preparedness capacity at the individual level in Heilongjiang. We developed the study objectives and questionnaire in collaboration with representatives of the Heilongjiang Public Health System (Health Bureau, CDC, HII, and public hospital) and piloted it in Harbin, the capital city of Heilongjiang province.

The study protocol was reviewed and approved by the Research Ethics Committee of Harbin Medical University. All participants indicated their willingness to take part, both verbally and in consent forms signed before the commencement of interviews.

This study was undertaken in Heilongjiang province, northeast China. Heilongjiang has 13 cities. The questionnaire survey was conducted with the stratified-cluster sampling method. Considering the geographical and jurisdictional diversity, we first divided Heilongjiang's 13 cities into three subgroups according to 4 indicators: [20, 21] . Then, three cities-Harbin, Mudanjiang, and Yichun (and their counties or districts)-were selected from these three subgroups on the basis of the other two indicators, which was the number of PHEs per 10,000 population (≥0.75, national average level) and the coverage rate of health supervision (≥80 %, national average level) [22] . These three cities have a total of 48 agencies for HIIs. After providing a detailed description of the purpose of the survey, 17 facilities expressed an interest to participate in the survey (1 provincial, 3 municipal, and 13 county and district HIIs).

Subsequently, the researchers visited these 17 agencies to conduct the face-to-face interviews. All the staff at each agency participated in the survey except those on leave. Finally, we obtained 309 completed questionnaires (response rate: 88.8 %) from health inspectors (with inspector licenses granted by China's Ministry of Health); data collection occurred during May to July 2010.

Dependent variables indicated the outcome of staff perceptions of their job responsibilities associated with a PHE. The response duties of staff from healthcare sectors (health bureaus, hospitals, CDCs, and HIIs) have been summarized in 4 clauses [1, 5] , which are further classified into 9 categories (Table 1) . We assessed the perception of job responsibility among HII practitioners using a 9-item combined question inquiring about these statutory duties (SD; items 1, 3, 5, 7, and 8): ""Among these 9 items, which are the SDs of your health inspection institution? (1) Under the direction of local health administrations, conduct an inspection of the PHE response measures of hospitals, (2) Conduct epidemiologic investigations, (3) Conduct an inspection of the PHE response measures of CDCs, (4) Public information release, (5) Supervise the PHE response process; (6) Organize/conduct a mass vaccination campaign, (7) Conduct an inspection of the enforcement of laws and regulations related to PHE, (8) Assist the local health administration to carry out investigations into irregularities of the PHE response, (9) Supervise the PHE response process at health administrations."" Allowed responses were ""yes,"" ""no,"" or ""don't know."" Item 2, 4, 6, 9 are the responsibilities of other health sectors: CDCs or health bureaus; the correct answer for these items was ""no.""

We selected independent variables based on discussions with representatives of the Heilongjiang Public Health System. The variables included gender, age, educational level and background, job content, work experience in a CDC, PHE training/drills experience, PHE response experience, and administrative levels: provincial, municipal, or county/district HIIs. PHE training/drills experience was defined as a positive response to the following question: ""Have you participated in any PHE training, exercise, or drill?"" Allowed responses were ""yes,"" ""no,"" or ""don't know."" Work experience in a CDC was defined as a positive response to the following question: ""Have you ever worked in a CDC?"" Allowed responses were ""yes,"" ""no,"" or ""don't know."" PHE response experience was defined as a positive response to: ""How many times have you participated in PHE responses?"" Allowed responses were ""0 = never participated"" or the number of times they had participated.

Finally, the variable job content was defined as whether the respondents engaged in the following 6 items: (1) medical institutions inspection, infectious disease supervision, and mother and baby care surveillance; (2) food hygiene and school health surveillance; (3) health inspection of public facilities, cosmetics, and drinking water; (4) occupational health and radioactive surveillance; (5) health law enforcement and supervision; (6) health inspection and enforcement information management. Allowed responses were ""yes"" or ""no.""

Data were analyzed using SAS version 9.1. We analyzed the responses of 309 participants after excluding 39 participants with responses of ""don't know"" or who refused to answer any of the questions. Descriptive statistics were calculated to describe the demographic characteristics. Differences among the provincial, municipal, county/ district groups were determined using chi-square and two-tailed t-tests for categorical and continuous variables, respectively. Fisher's exact test was used if subgroups included less than 10 subjects.

The staff 's correct recognition of SDs and the proportion of ways to recognize their own job responsibilities related to PHE response were detected using chi square tests (χ 2 ). Univariate analysis was performed to characterize the sample, followed by bivariate analysis to determine the relationship between dependent and independent variables.

Finally, multiple variable logistic regression analyses were performed with the correct recognition of PHE responsibilities as the dependent variable. We derived a dichotomous indicator for the dependent variables: coded ""1"" if the responses to all 5 SDs were ""yes,"" and coded ""0"" if otherwise. All regression models generated adjusted odds ratios (AORs) and 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) that measured the independent relationship of each covariate to the outcome variables, after we adjusted for confounding by the other covariates. Statistical significance was defined as P < 0.05.

Characteristics of the sample by provincial, municipal, and county/district levels are shown in Table 2 . Of the total sample (n = 309), most participants (74.76 %) were 30 to 50 years of age; most of the respondents (45.95 %) reported having a college or graduate degree, but with notable differences between the groups: 74.14 % of the provincial group, 61.11 % of the municipal group, and 27.33 % of the district/county group (P < 0.0001). Overall, approximately a quarter of the respondents' job content involved food hygiene/school health surveillance (26.86 %) and health inspection for public facilities/cosmetics/drinking water (24.27 %).

In the county/district HIIs, more people had undergone PHE training or drills, and more people had work experience in a CDC (all P < 0.001; Table 2 ). Overall, 50.49 % of respondents underwent PHE training/drills, with the county/district group having the highest reported frequency (72.05 %), followed by the municipal group (58.89 %) and the provincial group (31.03 %). When asked whether they had work experience in a CDC, over half of the respondents (53.72 %) reported they had worked in a CDC before the separation of the HII from a CDC; the county/district group had the highest reported proportion of participants with work experience in a CDC (65.22 %) compared to the provincial group (55.17 %) and municipal group (32.22 %). Furthermore, 50.49 % of the respondents reported that they had participated in some kind of PHE response; there were no significant group differences.

Overall, 54.37 % (n = 309) of respondents picked out 5 SDs from the 9-item combined question. Among the three groups, the municipal group had the highest correct recognition rate (57.78 %), followed by the county/district group (55.28 %) and provincial group (46.55 %); the differences were significant (P <0.05).

Different correct recognitions of SDs by level are shown in Table 3 . SD 3 (supervise the PHE response process) had the highest correct recognition rate (94.50 %) and SD 2 (conduct an inspection of the PHE response measures of the CDC) had the lowest recognition rate (69.90 %).

There were notable differences among the three levels in the correct recognition rate of SDs 1, 3, and 5; the responses showed a similar trend: the correct recognition rates of the municipal and county/district groups were better than those of the provincial group. Table 4 shows the observed frequency of responses to the question, ""How do you recognize your job responsibilities related to a public health emergency?"" Overall, the job description was the main method through which the workers recognized their PHE responsibilities: it had the highest percentage of ""yes"" responses (58.90 %), followed by the emergency plan (57.93 %), and the official written assignment (54.05 %). However, the assignment had the highest ""yes"" responses in the provincial group: more than half of the respondents (53.45 %) reported that they knew their responsibilities through the assignment; in the municipal and county/district groups, the predominant ways to recognize one's responsibilities were the emergency plan (75.56 %) and job description (58.39 %). There was no group difference with respect to the assignment (P = 0.8925) or job description (P = 0.3021). Conversely, there was a group difference with respect to the emergency plan and self-learning: these had the greatest effect on the municipal group (75.56 % vs. 41.38 % on the provincial group and 54.04 % on the county/district group, P < 0.0001), followed by the provincial group (22.41 % vs. 9.32 % on the county/district group and 7.78 % on the municipal group, P <0.05) and county/district group (4.97 %, P <0.05).

Multivariate logistic regression revealed that job content, work experience in a CDC, and PHE response experience factors were independently related to an increased correct recognition rate of job responsibilities associated with PHE responses (Table 5 ). Respondents whose job content involved supervision of medical institutions/infectious disease/mother & baby care (AOR = 5.031, 95 % CI = 2.235-11.323), public facilities/cosmetics/drinking water (AOR = 2.255, 95 % CI = 1.129-4.505), occupational/radiation (AOR = 3.450, 95 % CI = 1.542-7.716), or administrative enforcement (AOR = 4.413, 95 % CI = 1.711-11.378) were more likely than those with a job content involving food hygiene/school health surveillance or information management/other to exhibit correct knowledge of their PHE responsibilities. Respondents with work experience in a CDC were more likely to know their PHE responsibilities better than persons without CDC work experience (AOR = 1.886, 95 % CI = 1.094-3.249); respondents who reported PHE response experience exhibited knowledge of their PHE responsibilities more 

Although a decade and a year has passed since the 2003 SARS outbreak and subsequent separation of the HII from the CDC with the Chinese public health system rebuilding and restructuring, HII staff members still do not clearly understand their job responsibilities associated with PHE response. Our data showed that almost 55 % of respondents identified the 5 SDs from the 9-item combined question. Among them were respondents who chose more responsibilities from the 9-item question (items 2, 4, 7, 9 are the responsibilities of other health sectors: CDCs or health bureaus) as SDs. Thus, only 10.03 % answered the question accurately; namely, after the separation of the HII from the CDC, only one-tenth of respondents not only knew what their functional role requirements were in a PHE response as required by regulations, laws, and China's National Public Health Emergency Planning, but they also knew what were not their duties (some of them are duties of the CDC). Furthermore, the item ""Conduct an inspection of the PHE response measures of the CDC"" had the lowest correct recognition rate (69.90 %, Table 3 ) among the 5 SDs. This result is consistent with those of one study showing that the relationship between the CDC and HII had not yet been coordinated since the Chinese public health system was divided into the multiple CDCs and the HII. The CDCs possess techniques for public health surveillance, while the HII possesses the authority to conduct surveillance [19] . However, many HII workers still confuse the HII's responsibilities with the CDC's. Combined with the actual situation in China, in theory, when a PHE occurs, according to the needs of the event itself, the Ministry of Health will set up an emergency squad composed of health professionals from the CDCs, HIIs, and other emergency agencies [20] . For example, the HII and cosmetics and drinking water departments may be temporarily called to participate in emergency work and would be required to fulfill the emergency duties planned. However, in reality, if a large-scale PHE does occur in China, special department personnel are not enough. These situations, for example, a large-scale drinking water contamination, call for increased manpower; whenever possible, staff from the food sector will be transferred to offer temporary support. When the emergency squad needs a health supervisor, the department's most experienced employees may take precedence, but this selection of department staff may not strictly depend on the nature of the epidemic. Therefore, the duties prescribed in the plan are macroregulations for an overall HII. In China, the PHE responsibilities do not involve correspondence with other departments [21] . Therefore, staff from each healthcare sector do not have specific responsibilities, which results in overlapping responsibilities between the HII and CDC and other healthcare sectors as well as between the departments in the HII. This in turn causes delays in PHE response and reduced response efficiency when the HII has to conduct an inspection of the PHE response measures of the CDC or assist the local health administration to investigate irregularities in PHE responses. The existence of poor communication between these departments was observed in the present survey conducted: SD 2 and SD 5 were associated with the poorest responses.

In comparison, health sectors in Canada and the United States have clearly outlined roles, with no cross-functional associations and relatively independent work [22] . In Australia, the existing health supervision and management systems were adopted from the British. Here, health supervision and other regulations have implementation details, and are founded by strong operational regulations, system, and hierarchy. We can learn and implement much from the Federal Emergency Management Agency in the United States: increase tasks not agencies, but feel free to adjust the goals, focus, and department in accordance with the actual situation to improve emergency response capabilities in China [23] [24] [25] [26] .

We initially thought that the provincial group would have had the highest correct recognition rate because it had the highest educational level of the three groups [27, 28] . However, in the present study, the respondents' educational level was higher than that of the general educational status of China's HIIs: 45.95 % of participants reported college or above education levels compared to the 27.1 % reported across the nation [29] [30] [31] . Our results also demonstrated that educational levels do not explain the difference between PHE responsibility recognition rates in these groups. Overall, the PHE responsibility recognition in municipal and county/district groups was better than the provincial group's-this was unexpected because the provincial group had higher educational levels than the other 2 groups, and, because the provincial HII was located in the capital city, the workers were theoretically more likely to access PHE response information and be exposed to high-end technology [32] [33] [34] [35] .

Also important is the notable difference in PHE training/ drills; lower-level HIIs reported a higher frequency of training/drills. That might explain the higher PHE recognition in the lower HIIs. That fact also highlights the necessity of organizing multisector response drills. The other reason may be that lower-level HIIs have fewer workers and have to play multifaceted roles. There are about 10 workers in each county/district HII and their jobs will vary with needs; thus, they had some general knowledge in different areas.

Low PHE responsibility-recognition levels among food hygiene/school health surveillance workers As previously suggested by Benatar (1997 Benatar ( , 1998 [36, 37] , the duty to care must be placed in a wider context to include considerations that transcend individual obligations. As Bensimon's study illustrates, the broader institutional and societal context must be taken into account.

This finding suggests that interventions need to target workers in the departments of food hygiene/school health surveillance. At the same time, since the job content of over a quarter of the respondents in our study was food hygiene/school health surveillance, such interventions might be the most effective way to enhance the levels of PHE responsibility recognition. Job content, having work experience in a CDC, and having experience with previous PHE response factors influence the correct recognition rate of job responsibilities associated with a PHE.

More than a quarter of the total respondents were food hygiene/school health surveillance workers, but their PHE responsibility recognition level was the worst. Increasing the food hygiene/school health surveillance workers' recognition of PHE responsibilities is significant for improving PHE preparedness and response, especially since China's Ministry of Health announced that the top two major PHE causes are food poisoning, with the high-risk location being schools-especially primary and middle schools in rural areas [38] .

Most food hygiene/school health surveillance workers used to be food hygiene supervisors before HII became an independent agency of the public health system. At that time, their job responsibility focused on inspection of food hygiene, and they adhered to outdated working practices: the job content did not require inspection of hospitals and CDCs. The workers were, therefore, not familiar with the new requirements such as supervising PHE response measures of hospitals regarding the PHE response process or assisting local health administrations investigate irregularities in the PHE response. If left unresolved, this situation might pose a weak link in China's PHE response chain.

Finally, multivariate logistic regressions revealed a strong association between responses involving correct recognition rates for the 5 SDs and job contents, work experience in a CDC, and having PHE experience. Workers in the department of food hygiene/school health surveillance and information management/other had decreased recognition of their correct PHE responsibilities. They had the lowest correct recognition rate of the 5 SDs. Having work experience in a CDC and having personal experience in disaster response, however, were associated with increased recognition of PHE responsibilities. This result was consistent with that in a study wherein personal experience with disasters was associated with increased adoption of protective behaviors [39] .

This may require innovative training, severe punishment, and organizational development methods, such as those in place in Canada and Australia, to enhance preparedness skills and create a culture of organizational readiness among public health workers through a process of ""syntonic"" organizational change [40] . In the syntonic model, organizational change is a nonthreatening, natural growth process that is more likely to be embraced by employees than resisted; key factors in syntonic change include anticipatory guidance and experiential learning [40] . Although the assignment of responsibility and response procedures have not been specified in detail, overall, the job description (58.90 %) was the most powerful way to help HII workers to recognize their duties associated with a PHE response, followed by the emergency plan (57.93 %) and the assignment (54.05 %). The emergency plan is the fundamental structure in municipal HIIs; three-fourth of municipal respondents reported that they recognized their PHE responsibilities through the emergency plan, compared to 4 of 10 provincial HII workers and half of the county/district workers. The assignment also played a critical role, and there was no difference between the 3 groups; over 50 % of the workers perceived their responsibilities through the assignment.

This study has several limitations. First, data were collected using self-assessment tools, and therefore, the general level of emergency preparedness may be overestimated. Second, the study's time and resource restrictions confined the investigation to 17 agencies in one province, the data for which may not be generalizable to other geographic areas. However, the findings of this research could be used in emergency response procedures in the future. Through the examination of HII workers' knowledge of their own duties, it may be possible to improve the efficiency of the workforce in the HII during PHE response.

The circumstances surrounding the SARS crisis made it both possible and desirable to explicitly address the question of duty to care. Our study demonstrates that after the sector restructuring in China, the CDCs and HIIs have not yet formed a closely coordinated relationship. Our study reveals that HII workers still do not clearly understand their PHE responsibilities and that this lack of understanding could also occur during reforms of health sectors in other countries.

The outcome of our study also highlights the complexities of organizational restructuring, which may decrease PHE preparedness and response capacity. A lack of standard and basic requirements for PHE response-such as general tasks, functions, and responsibilities in routine job descriptions-will ultimately hinder efficient behaviors during the PHE response process. To improve preparedness for a PHE, perceptions of responsibilities should be used as an additional indicator of preparedness. Furthermore, from the perspective of globalization significance, China is facing the same problems, including delayed initiation and slow development of the PHE response, such as many other developing countries. These results may be useful to guide preparedness interventions in developing countries and future research.

Digital Surveillance: A Novel Approach to Monitoring the Illegal Wildlife Trade,"A dearth of information obscures the true scale of the global illegal trade in wildlife. Herein, we introduce an automated web crawling surveillance system developed to monitor reports on illegally traded wildlife. A resource for enforcement officials as well as the general public, the freely available website, http://www.healthmap.org/wildlifetrade, provides a customizable visualization of worldwide reports on interceptions of illegally traded wildlife and wildlife products. From , publicly available English language illegal wildlife trade reports from official and unofficial sources were collected and categorized by location and species involved. During this interval, 858 illegal wildlife trade reports were collected from 89 countries. Countries with the highest number of reports included India (n = 146, 15.6%), the United States (n = 143, 15.3%), South Africa (n = 75, 8.0%), China (n = 41, 4.4%), and Vietnam (n = 37, 4.0%). Species reported as traded or poached included elephants (n = 107, 12.5%), rhinoceros (n = 103, 12.0%), tigers (n = 68, 7.9%), leopards (n = 54, 6.3%), and pangolins (n = 45, 5.2%). The use of unofficial data sources, such as online news sites and social networks, to collect information on international wildlife trade augments traditional approaches drawing on official reporting and presents a novel source of intelligence with which to monitor and collect news in support of enforcement against this threat to wildlife conservation worldwide.","The true worth of the illegal wildlife trade is unknown. This multi-faceted and clandestine industry has disrupted fragile ecosystems and facilitated the spread of pathogens and novel infectious diseases in humans, domestic animals, and native wildlife [1, 2] . The trade includes live and dead wildlife of multiple species that are captured, poached, and sold for food, medicine, pets and trophies [3] . While some data exist on the volume, scope and scale of the global wildlife trade, the current understanding of the network is largely inferred from data on legal import and exports recorded by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) treaty, which requires member nations to document global trade in endangered wildlife [4] . The vast illegal trade remains largely unmonitored and underground.

Not only is the true global scale of the illegal wildlife trade unknown, but also regional and local levels of wildlife trade are difficult to assess [5] . Quantifying all global wildlife trade would be a herculean task, as illegal trade routes range in scale from local to international levels and are often conducted through informal networks [2] . Confiscation records provide much of the only available data on the scope of this illegal network. A 2010 study conducted by Rosen and Smith assessed the scope and scale of the worldwide illegal wildlife trade by examining 12 years of seizure records compiled by TRAFFIC, an international wildlife trademonitoring network. The study found 967 documented seizures of illegal wildlife and wildlife products representing vast species diversity and geographic scope. Factors such as inadequate infrastructure, corrupt officials, international crime networks, and a shortage of environmental conservation law enforcement officers affected individual nation's seizure activity [6] .

Previous attempts to monitor the illegal wildlife trade have had mixed results. In 2002, the Invasive Species Internet Monitoring System was implemented to track Internet trade of invasive species using a semi-automated process of searching for these species sold online. Refining the search parameters within semi-automated queries allowed the system to monitor Internet sales of CITES listed species. While the system provided excellent results supporting proof of concept, it only captured Internet sales, which may not be representative of the greater illegal trade picture. In addition, the query parameters had to be well-defined for each species of interest in order to obtain relevant search results, and query results had to be consistently reviewed by subject matter experts in order to determine if further action needed to be taken [7] . The sacrifice of sensitivity for specificity combined with its labor-intensive approach limited its scalability.

A second study employed wildlife trade market surveys, which were administered repeatedly to more accurately estimate the number of illegally traded animals [8] . While repeat market surveys may improve the estimation of a particular species being illegally traded in specific regions or localities, obtaining a more accurate estimate of internationally illegally traded wildlife would require a much more robust system built to survey a multitude of markets worldwide for a wide array of species [5] .

Illegal wildlife trade can be intercepted and reported by both official (e.g. government agencies, non-profit organizations working with local officials) and unofficial sources (e.g. news media). A surveillance system that collects both unofficial and official data may offer a more complete picture of the trade by providing up-todate, highly localized information on the illegal commercialization of wildlife, providing a picture of the illegal wildlife trade that until now has not been visualized on a global scale. To the best of our knowledge, an automated, real-time, comprehensive, global system monitoring official and unofficial reports of illegal wildlife trade activity has not previously been put into practice. Such a system would undoubtedly be useful to wildlife authorities in tracking illegal wildlife trade. Herein, we introduce an automated digital surveillance system that was developed to monitor reports on illegally traded wildlife and wildlife products.

An automated digital surveillance system was developed that utilizes natural language processing and machine-learning algorithms to combine unofficial and official reports of wildlife trade events obtained from the Internet in an effort to establish an automated web crawling surveillance system of the wildlife trade, similar to those used for infectious disease events (e.g. GPHIN, HealthMap) [9, 10] . The underlying architecture of the Health-Map system has been previously described [11] . Briefly, the system addresses the challenge of scouring the Internet for pertinent outbreak information through automated querying, filtering, and visualization of reports through the utilization of automated text processing algorithms that classify alerts by location and disease [10] . This flexible system has been adapted for use in other nondisease surveillance settings [12] .

Available at http://www.healthmap.org/wildlifetrade, the digital wildlife surveillance tool is freely available and displays realtime reports of illegal wildlife trade activity worldwide as an interactive visualization (Figure 1 ). The system collects reports based on the keyword search strings described below and utilizes text-mining algorithms to classify reports on the illegal wildlife trade by location and species prior to overlaying this information onto an interactive mapping tool. Reports were gathered from around the world but were limited to English for this proof-ofconcept development. The resulting system continually aggregates, organizes, and disseminates near real-time information to provide insight into the global wildlife trade network. We focus our analysis on one year of illegal wildlife and wildlife product confiscation data collected between August 1, 2010 and July 31, 2011.

Valuable information about the illegal wildlife trade is available via the Internet through official and unofficial sources. Official sources from freely available RSS feeds were utilized and included TRAFFIC, WildAid, The Coalition Against Wildlife Trafficking (CAWT), World Wildlife Fund (WWF), and the International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW). In addition, reports from unofficial sources were automatically collected utilizing key search terms from freely available websites, discussion forums, mailing lists, news media outlets, and blogs. Information was obtained only from publically available sources to respect privacy issues. Standard Internet citation was practiced by including a brief excerpt from the original article and then linking to the source for additional detail. Overall, the system capitalizes on news indexers that draw from over 50,000 possible web-based resources [13] .

The development and utilization of key search terms allows information on the global wildlife trade network from disparate unofficial sources to be monitored in near real-time. Upon reviewing historical reports on the illegal wildlife trade, we created a small set of candidate keywords that were both relevant and fairly specific to the illegal wildlife trade. We tested the potential of those keywords as queries to retrieve reports within the Google Reader tool (which allows the retrieval of a Google News query as an RSS feed). New keywords were added as determined by browsing for relevant reports that our system was missing. These new keywords were used to increase the amount of results yielded or to improve the specificity of the query. In order to collect reports most relevant to the illegal wildlife trade, there were several rounds of query improvements.

As an example, the word ''poaching'' would often appear, and was therefore used as an initial keyword. However, used alone, the term brought in reports unrelated to the wildlife trade. We added inclusion and exclusion terms to narrow the focus such as ''in title: poaching wildlife'' and ''in title: poaching -bank -egg.'' This process was conducted repeatedly, building on our initial set of candidate keywords, to obtain relevant and specific information on the wildlife trade. A total of 18 search terms were selected to gather the reports analyzed here.

For each report yielded by the selected keywords, the system extracted specific details including the species involved in the report, the specific geographical location where interception of illegal wildlife product occurred ( Figure 2 ), a link to the original information source, and the date of source publication. Due to reporting inconsistencies (e.g. time of occurrence was sometimes reported as ongoing or as specific as a year, month, or week), the time of illegal wildlife trade activity was not included in statistical analysis.

Each report collected was reviewed manually by an analyst to ensure the most accurate information was displayed on the website. The analyst added precise geographical details for interception location and species information as needed. In addition, the analyst ensured that duplicate reports were hidden from display and that reports were correctly tagged. Category tags were applied to improve filtering [11] , and include Breaking, for articles pertaining to live animal or wildlife product seizures with specific information on species, date, and location; Warning, for articles with details about historically known illegal wildlife trade activity, articles describing increasing levels of illegal trade over a period of time, or regarding illegal wildlife trade routes commonly utilized; and Context, for alerts on policy, law, or collaborations involving the illegal wildlife trade without specific incident information on product seizures or trade routes used. Reports tagged as Breaking or Warning appear on the wildlife trade website, while reports tagged as Context do not appear on the site to minimize information overload. Our analysis focused on Breaking alerts only.

To avoid confusion, commonly traded wildlife species were displayed on the website as shown in Table 1 , broken down into common names and broad categories instead of listed by scientific names. When possible, detailed scientific names of species were recorded in an internal database in order to determine each species' red list status (the conservation status determined by the International Union for Conservation of Nature). Transportation methods used were also recorded when information was available.

Locations of wildlife interception points were visually displayed on the website along with a link to the original information source. Last, a geographical layer featuring international airports was added, as previous studies have highlighted airports as being important points of entry of illegal wildlife products [14] [15] [16] . For example, one study estimated that five tons of bushmeat was smuggled per week into the Paris Roissy-Charles de Gaulle airport alone [14] . Showing airports may allow officials to identify major transportation hubs for the illegal wildlife trade.

To confirm the underlying assumption that the volume of wildlife traded illegally is not accurately reflected through the legal trade of wildlife products, we examined the CITES database of legally traded, threatened or potentially threatened species. The CITES database is ''based on a system whereby permits or certificates are issued for international trade in specimens of species listed in one of three Appendices, each of which provides a different degree of trade control [17] .'' CITES data on gross imports of elephants (both the Elephas and Loxodonta genera), which were the most commonly intercepted based on our findings, were analyzed for 2008, 2009, and 2010. Data from 2011 was not yet available.

From August 1, 2010 to July 31, 2011, 858 reports of illegal wildlife trade were collected for analysis. Reports on illegal wildlife crime were reported from a total of 89 countries. Countries with the highest number of reports on wildlife trade included India (n = 146, 15.6%), the United States (n = 143, 15.3%), South Africa (n = 75, 8.0%), China (n = 41, 4.4%), and Vietnam (n = 37, 4.0%). Species from 118 categories were recorded. The species traded or poached were recorded, with mammals being the most commonly reported. Specifically, elephants (n = 107, 12.5%), rhinoceros (n = 103, 12.0%), tigers (n = 68, 7.9%), leopards (n = 54, 6.3%), and pangolins (n = 45, 5.2%) were the most commonly intercepted mammals. Reasons for wildlife product trade ranged vastly ( Table 2) .

CITES data showed that Elephas genera imports averaged 13,661 from 2008-2010, and were comprised of both live animals and animal products ranging from ivory carvings to meat and hair. The Loxodonta genera averaged 89,523 from 2008-2010 comprised of live animals in addition to products such as bone carvings, ears, feet, hair, ivory carvings, meat, skins, skulls, and teeth [18] . It should be noted that according to CITES, gross import data is often an overestimation of the quantity actually traded, as where different quantities have been reported by the importer and the exporter, the program selects the larger of the two quantities [17] .

The HealthMap Wildlife Trade website is a comprehensive digital surveillance system for aggregating, organizing, and displaying illegal wildlife trade reports from official and unofficial sources. By providing a unified platform of both official and unofficial information, users are able to quickly and easily view a plethora of information (whether by species or location) from one application. From August 1, 2010 to July 31, 2011, 858 reports of illegal wildlife trade were collected from 89 countries illustrating the global extent of this lucrative industry.

Previous methods that have attempted to estimate the enormity of the illegal wildlife trade have focused primarily on traditional data sets of legally traded wildlife. However, substantial amounts of information may be obtained through the utilization of unofficial digital media sources, as demonstrated by the number of reports collected, highlighting just one of the benefits of considering this methodology. Additionally, the data collected may prove useful to both conservation and public health officials by providing real-time and detailed information on whereabouts of threatened species and species capable of transmitting zoonotic diseases.

There are several other organizations that apply a variety of methods for monitoring illegal wildlife trade activity, but due to differences in scope and purpose, direct comparisons are difficult. The WWF, in partnership with TRAFFIC, created the Law Enforcement Management Information System (LEMIS) tracker that plots official data and flows of wildlife products seized upon entry into the United States (http://wildlifetradetracker.org/). As compared to LEMIS, the HealthMap wildlife trade system covers wildlife products seized worldwide and includes unofficial sources of information. It also allows users to view original media reports on seizures made, where LEMIS does not provide access to source information. The HealthMap wildlife trade map does not show wildlife product flows at this time.

The Tiger Tracker, also created by WWF and TRAFFIC, plots official data on seizures of tigers and tiger parts within Asia. Lastly, the use of submissions from the general public is an important feature that distinguishes our system from most others. Citizen science data has been shown to have the potential to detect and track disease events and trends earlier than official data sources [19, 20] . While Freeland allows the general public to contribute information on suspected wildlife trafficking in Southeast Asia, it likely receives a different subset of information from the public. Their website states, ''we will act,'' suggesting that all publically submitted reports are thoroughly investigated and therefore it is likely to elicit eyewitness reports of illegal trade rather than the web-available news articles, press releases, and government statements on the wildlife trade events that our users report. Submissions to the HealthMap wildlife trade site are later reviewed by trained staff to check for duplicates, and to ensure removal of any personally identifying information. If a submitted alert warrants further investigation, our protocol is to refer it to collaborators at WCS.

The International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) provides a list of species at risk of extinction called the Red List of Threatened Species. Threatened species may be poached or caught live and sold for a high value because of their novelty in the market. The system detected reports involving numerous species of concern including the near-threatened pangolin for its scales, the critically endangered black rhino for its horn, the endangered Javan slow loris for the exotic pet trade, the vulnerable mandrill for bushmeat, and many others [21] . The presence of IUCN Red List species in our digital surveillance underscores the need to prevent illegal trade.

When compared to the CITES database, illegal wildlife trade reports collected through our website included 107, or 12.5%, reports involving illegal interceptions of elephant products. However, just one interception in our database may involve many products from many different species. As an example, one report collected from December 2010 involved the confiscation of 105 pieces of jewelry made of elephant ivory [22] , while another 2 tons of elephant ivory, or 247 tusks, were intercepted in April 2011 [23] . This would therefore make these two reported interceptions of elephant products equivalent to 352 products if listed in the CITES database, as the CITES database counts each product individually (i.e. an elephant carving, hide, or skull). It is difficult to make a direct comparison to the CITES data due to the difference in wildlife product categorizations, however further research is being conducted to obtain a better understanding of the scope of the illegal wildlife trade.

Surveillance of illegal wildlife trade activity may also bring insight into the spread of zoonotic diseases as an early detection system, as the trade has been shown to play an inarguable role in the facilitation of disease transmission [24] . Jones et al. found that a majority of emerging infectious diseases were caused by zoonotic pathogens, and that over 70% originated in wildlife, with the number of events increasing significantly over time [25] . The wildlife trade contributes to the potential for increasing numbers of emerging diseases, as humans are directly exposed to wildlife and wildlife products through the many varying aspects of this lucrative industry (e.g. via hunters, salesmen, consumers) [2] . History has shown the dangers of zoonotic disease transmission through commercialization of live wildlife and their products [16, 26] . Examples of past outbreaks from wildlife trade include monkeypox, which was imported into the United States in 2003 when infected Gambian pouched rats (Cricetomys gambianus) were transported with pet prairie dogs (Cynomys ludovicianus) [27] . Other cases of zoonotic diseases have also occurred and include rabies from mammals, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) from small carnivores, highly pathogenic avian influenza from avian species, and chytridiomycosis from amphibians [2, 28, 29] . In light of these threats the USAID's Emerging Pandemic Threats Program: Predict Project strives to build a global early warning system for emerging diseases that are transmitted between wildlife and people. Surveillance of illegal trafficking is inherently limited by the clandestine nature of the activity; underreporting is unavoidable. Additional biases may occur by selection of key search terms, media reporting biases, and restriction to the English language. For instance, a wealthy country may have more resources (such as Internet access, higher regulation standards, and freedom of press) than a less economically developed country. This lack of resources may prevent the detection and reporting of illegally traded wildlife despite the possibility of more trade occurring in underdeveloped areas.

The search for illegally traded items is also limited by the key word search terms utilized. Although a sample of queries was repeatedly tested to select for the most appropriate search terms, selection bias may have still resulted. There may also be additional biases towards certain terms selected or species reportedly traded. Only events reported through media outlets, or announced through official channels in which RSS feeds are being followed (CAWT, IFAW, TRAFFIC, WildAid, and the WWF), are shown on the website. Therefore, a bias exists towards stories that appeal to each media outlet's target audience and stories deemed to be particularly ''newsworthy'', such as those concerning particularly large seizures or that focus on charismatic megafauna like elephants, rhinoceros, and tigers. To the degree that media biases result in underreporting of lesser-known species that are important to the eco-system at large, this system will suffer from mirrored underreporting.

The system does attempt to capture reports regardless of species involved through its utilization of specific key word search terms. Terms like ''seizure'' or ''illegal wildlife trade'' are not synonymous with specific species. If our key search terms are actually used more often in stories for certain species of animals, then those animals may be better represented than others.

Lastly, media reports may not accurately reflect the true legality of each event reported. It may later be determined during legal proceedings that a transport of a wildlife product reported as illegal was actually being legally conducted. For products involving endangered species however, where any transport or sale is prohibited, the number of reports incorrectly categorized is likely minimal.

Further, using only one language (English) may have caused an over-reporting in English speaking countries, such as India (n = 146, 15.6%), the United States (n = 143, 15.3%), and South Africa (n = 75, 8.0%). Previous literature has shown Asia to be a focal point of illegal wildlife trafficking, and these past findings were more in line with the next highest-ranking countries, China (n = 41, 4.4%) and Vietnam (n = 37, 4.0%) where English is not the main language [30] . Our preliminary results show that it would be beneficial to include non-English language reports from additional RSS feeds to obtain a more complete picture of the illegal wildlife trade. We have therefore begun to monitor reports in Japanese and plan to add Chinese, Malay, and Indonesian languages next. Adjustment for English-language Internet news sites per country was not possible under the scope of this pilot study.

Additionally, it would be useful to look into biases of species considered when conducting surveillance of illegal wildlife trade. For instance, in the United States deer and elk were often confiscated but not typically discussed by wildlife trade organizations due to their current status of ''not threatened.'' The higher activity level within the United States in our automated system may have been due to the inclusion of deer, elk, bear, and moose being illegally poached or traded. Monitoring the trade in species not currently classified as threatened or endangered should be considered, as they may be at heightened risk for future threat. In addition, zoonotic diseases may be transmitted regardless of a species' conservation status.

Future work may also concentrate on analysis of media outlets, funding for enforcement, and user demographics. In addition, work may be conducted to display wildlife trade routes to and from a location, transportation methods used, and wildlife red list status of species confiscated. Additional geographical layers such as animal densities and transportation hubs may aid in further understanding the illegal wildlife trade and its associations with geographical factors. Additional work linking species traded with zoonotic diseases may also be conducted to identify potential hotspot regions for emerging zoonotic diseases.

Last, methods used to transport wildlife were documented when available, but not included in our results due to the low proportion of reports providing transportation information (19%). Insight into transportation methods could aid regulators in intercepting illegal wildlife trade before it reaches its final destination, and therefore as the dataset grows we hope to identify useful patterns. From the subset of reports that did include transportation methods of illegal wildlife trade (n = 163), modes of transportation utilized varied greatly and included land vehicles (trucks, buses, and cars), airplanes, boats, and trains. Some also utilized the Internet to purchase wildlife products that were then shipped through the mail (via ground and air postal services). The use of the Internet as a resource for obtaining illegal wildlife products is not new, however as Internet access becomes more readily available this may be an area to monitor closely. The wildlife trade website may aid in highlighting trends such as the utilization of the Internet for illegal wildlife trafficking in addition to shedding light on interceptions in areas not typically emphasized.

Despite the limitations to a digital surveillance system, the HealthMap Wildlife Trade website is currently the most comprehensive and freely available tool for monitoring the illegal wildlife trade and may help improve our understanding of a clandestine market. The illegal wildlife trade continues to grow, and new challenges are consistently emerging, such as an increased number of online sales of illegal wildlife with limited regulation [31, 32] . The problem continues to receive limited resources and political attention, as it escapes detection through an underground economy [33] . Further, this illegal industry is worsened by urbanization and global development that commercializes subsistence hunting and fishing and over-exploits terrestrial and marine ecosystems [34] . To keep up with these advances, global digital surveillance of the illegal wildlife trade is necessary to protect biodiversity, prevent endangerment of species, and control the introduction of infectious diseases [35, 36] .

Malware and Disease: Lessons from Cyber Intelligence for Public Health Surveillance,"Malicious software and infectious diseases are similar is several respects, as are the functional requirements for surveillance and intelligence to defend against these threats. Given these similarities, this article compares and contrasts the actors, relationships, and norms at work in cyber intelligence and disease surveillance. Historical analysis reveals that civilian cyber defense is more decentralized, private, and voluntary than public health in the United States. Most of these differences are due to political choices rather than technical necessities. In particular, political resistance to government institutions has shaped cyber intelligence over the past 30 years, which is a troubling sign for attempts to improve disease surveillance through local, state, and federal health departments. Information sharing about malware is also limited, despite information technology being integral to cyberspace. Such limits suggest that automation through electronic health records will not automatically improve public health surveillance. Still, certain aspects of information sharing and analysis for cyber defense are worth emulating or, at the very least, learning from to help detect and manage health threats.","D iscourse about cybersecurity is riddled with biological analogies and metaphors. We describe malicious software in terms of ''viruses'' and ''worms,'' in part because some of their similarities are significant for security. Most important, contagion of either kind can threaten the community at large. Infectious diseases can spread through travel and trade, as illustrated by the Ebola outbreak in West Africa, Middle East respiratory syndrome, and the H1N1 pandemic, among countless other examples. Like the human ecosystem, the internet is another kind of global network, and malware ranging from Conficker and Zeus to Stuxnet has spread through cyberspace in recent years.

To the extent that malware and infectious diseases are analogous threats, they may warrant similar solutions. In particular, several policy analysts claim that ''cyber public health'' and ''cyber hygiene'' would be improved by creating a ''cyber CDC,'' mirroring the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), or even a ''cyber WHO'' modeled on the World Health Organization. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] ''Both public health and cybersecurity aim to achieve a positive state (health or security) in a loosely affiliated but highly interdependent network.'' 9(p77) While the details differ, some of the functional requirements for achieving cyber and health security are similar as well. Among others, these functions include collecting data about threats to the population (eg, malware or disease), analyzing this information, and reporting to inform action-in a word, surveillance.

What insight does cybersecurity offer for improving public health surveillance, given their family resemblance? Can public health learn from its younger, digital cousin? To answer these questions, this article compares disease surveillance with what is now called cyber intelligence, specifically as it relates to malicious software. The research methodology is described first. Important similarities between malware and infectious disease are identified next, followed by the functional similarities between disease surveillance and cyber intelligence. The organizational histories of these fields are then compared and contrasted at the local, national, and international levels.

Despite roughly analogous threats and functional requirements, there are striking differences in how these fields are organized. Cyber intelligence is more decentralized, private, and voluntary than disease surveillance in the United States. These differences inform at least 3 lessons for public health policy: (1) the prevailing politics of the time have changed to the detriment of health agencies inside government; (2) electronic health records will not automatically improve disease surveillance; and (3) the CDC could adopt aspects of information sharing and analysis from cyber defense to help improve its image and data exchange. The logic of each lesson is examined in the final discussion.

This article provides a qualitative, historical analysis of cyber intelligence and disease surveillance. It compares and contrasts the actors, relationships, and norms at work in each field. The empirical evidence draws on more than a dozen semistructured interviews with practitioners in public health and cyber defense (30 to 120 minutes in length, tape recorded or written notes, most not for attribution), as well as archival research and existing literature (grey and peer reviewed). While the primary focus is on the United States, international cooperation is also addressed.

Cybersecurity would be important for public health even if malware and disease were unrelated. The confidentiality, integrity, and availability of health information are vital to this profession and threatened by security challenges ranging from medical data breaches to ransomware targeting hospitals. Of course, it is important to note that malicious software and infectious diseases are not the same. Malware is computer code processed by digital electronics, whereas diseases and their hosts are biological organisms. Malware is not lethal, while infectious diseases kill millions of people each year. Usually, malware is created with malicious intent (as its name implies), but the vast majority of infectious diseases are naturally occurring and lack hostile motives (with the rare exception of biological weapons). 10 Nevertheless, these threats are similar in several ways that are significant for security. First and foremost, both malware and infectious disease can be contagious and widely spread. Transmissibility varies: Not all cyber attacks are broadcast or intended to spread beyond a specific computer, and not all infectious diseases are contagious. Yet, the potential for spread means that the threat to any individual or computer depends in part on the health of the overall population or network. This interdependence also means that securing either kind of system through intelligence or surveillance depends in part on local, national, and international cooperation.

Second, both malware and disease have nonkinetic effects that can be difficult to detect. 11 This difficulty complicates surveillance and source attribution because symptoms can be delayed, hidden, or nonspecific, leaving victims and vectors unaware. Detection, diagnosis, and treatment can therefore require specialized knowledge and tools:

Just as medical researchers have to study a virus before they can create a vaccine, antivirus makers must capture a computer virus, take it apart and identify its ''signature''unique signs in its code-before they can write a program that removes it. 12 Here again, cooperation is helpful for developing these countermeasures. For example, antivirus companies now share malware samples to improve detection, and the vaccine industry has long benefited from the virus samples shared through the Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS). 13, 14 Both the advantages of cooperation and difficulties of detection are compounded by the variety of malware and disease. New pathogens are always emerging (eg, through antigenic drift and shift in influenza). New malware is also common. According to Symantec, ''there were more than 317 million new pieces of malware created'' in 2014, ''meaning nearly one million new threats were released into the wild each day.'' 15(p7) Finally, some of the specialized knowledge and tools used to detect and treat malware and disease are dual use. This means that they can be used for both benefit and harm, or, alternatively, for both military and civilian applications. Cyber intelligence and disease surveillance are both conducted by military and civilian agencies because malware and disease are both interpreted as threats to national security. 16 Furthermore, knowing how to detect malware can be used to help remove it or to hide the code and cause harm. Disease surveillance is rarely thought of in terms of potential harm, since the information it provides is intended to help reduce morbidity and mortality. But this information can also be used to stigmatize and discriminate against individuals and groups, as well as restrict travel and trade. Fear of misuse has fueled resistance to disease surveillance, including popular opposition to name-based reporting of HIV and government opposition to reporting outbreaks such as SARS and H5N1. [17] [18] [19] One consequence of these dual-use dilemmas is that cooperation is not inevitable, even when it would be advantageous for cyber or health security.

Just as malware and infectious disease are roughly analogous threats, so too are certain aspects of acquiring, interpreting, and communicating information about them. According to the CDC, ''Public health surveillance is the ongoing, systematic collection, analysis, interpretation, and dissemination of data regarding a health-related event for use in public health action.'' 20 Similar terminology is used to define ''cyber intelligence''-namely, ''the acquisition and analysis of information to identify, track, and predict cyber capabilities, intentions, and activities that offer courses of action to enhance decision making.'' 21(p2) Malware is one kind of cyber capability subject to intelligence, as infectious disease is one kind of health-related event-along with noncommunicable diseases, injuries, medical services and devices, and the like-subject to surveillance, biosurveillance, or ''health intelligence.'' 22 And both fields differ from espionage. Following revelations by Edward Snowden, associating the word ''cyber'' with ''intelligence'' or ''surveillance'' may bring to mind warrantless wiretapping, bulk collection of metadata, and other controversial programs conducted by the National Security Agency (NSA). But clandestinely gathering intelligence for counterterrorism differs from collecting, analyzing, and sharing information with consent to improve internet security, just as disease surveillance differs from spying.

As shown in Table 1 , similar kinds of information can be collected, analyzed, and shared through cyber intelligence and disease surveillance. First, information about malware includes the source code (human readable) and binary files (machine readable). These files can be summarized as signature or hash functions to help automate detection; they can also be analyzed to identify other indicators of compromise and clues about their author or origin. Second, data on susceptible, infected, and exposed hosts can provide information about vectors and vulnerable computers in the population. Third, cyber intelligence, like disease surveillance, relates to action. Information about defensive action includes the actors involved, as well as how they detect, contain, and remediate threats using patched or recon-figured software, firewalls, blacklists, access controls, and other countermeasures.

To be clear, computer forensics is not the same as shoe leather epidemiology. At an abstract level, however, cyber intelligence is sufficiently similar to disease surveillance that comparing their respective histories and policies can provide useful insight into each field. Since cyberspace is a relatively new domain, the organizations that have been created to defend it are more sensitive to recent trends in politics and technology than many older institutions in public health. Therefore, cyber intelligence may serve as a sentinel case for the forces that stand to reshape disease surveillance in the years ahead.

Comparative Analysis: Local, National, and International Organizations

The basic structure of disease surveillance at the local, national, and international levels is familiar to many public health professionals. But neither the organizations involved nor their future should be taken for granted. These actors, relationships, and norms look different from those in cyber intelligence, despite similar threats and functional requirements. In addition, politics have had a profound impact on both fields, and the prevailing politics have changed over time.

American public health consisted mostly of local, uncoordinated, and episodic sanitation and quarantine measures until the bacteriological revolution. [23] [24] [25] These local roots are still evident in the design of many health departments across the United States. The modern practice of public health surveillance also reflects important political compromises, quite distinct from the germ theory of disease.

Local laws about infectious disease date back to the colonial era, but the proliferation of modern regulations for surveillance coincided with the new science of bacteriology in the 1880s and 1890s. For instance, one of the first bacteriological laboratories in the United States was 27(p3) Bacteriology ''brought professionalism to disease control,'' and laboratory diagnosis provided these professionals with newfound ''status and authority.'' 17(p3) However, the political power afforded by this status and authority was insufficient to overcome countervailing interests. ''Public health . sought to expand the role of government as a guardian against disease,'' 17(p256) but many physicians in private practice opposed surveillance as a ''demand for unpaid labor'' and threat to their clinical authority. 17(p13) To win or defuse conflicts of interest over reporting tuberculosis and venereal disease at the turn of the century, public health officials-including outspoken proponents of surveillance such as Hermann Biggs-conceded that they would not encroach on the health care provided through private practice in exchange for notification.

This concession was a political compromise. While it was expedient, limiting the actions that might otherwise have been informed by disease surveillance is hard to justify in terms of maximizing technical efficiency. Nevertheless, this compromise was one of many, and it endures to this day as a practical constraint on the relationship between disease surveillance and local intervention.

Germ theory revolutionized biology, but cyberspace is manmade and thus somewhat less mysterious (eg, malware was never blamed on miasma or treated with leeches, although scam and snake oil solutions are not uncommon). John von Neumann theorized about self-replicating automata as early as 1949, and Fred Cohen coined the term ''computer virus'' in 1984, years before malware became a common threat. 28, 29 Instead of a new scientific theory, organizations for civilian cyber defense emerged in response to communication and coordination problems highlighted by the Morris worm.

In November 1988, the Morris worm exploited flaws in the Unix operating system to quickly spread, infecting and slowing about 10% of the 60,000 to 80,000 computers that constituted the entire internet at that time. A few weeks later, another hack compromised the US military's network. Postmortem reviews of these incidents concluded that response was hampered by limited communication and coordination. 30 To address these problems, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) funded the Software Engineering Institute at Carnegie Mellon University to establish the Computer Emergency Response Team Coordination Center (CERT/CC).

Naming the CERT/CC a ''coordination center'' did not mean that the collection, analysis, or dissemination of data about malware and software vulnerabilities were centrally coordinated. The CERT system was a decentralized approach to cyber intelligence. From the beginning, ''other agencies and constituencies were encouraged to create and sustain their own teams.'' 31(p19) These teams typically serve narrow and discrete constituencies (eg, a single company), unlike the local, municipal, and state health departments that serve the entire population in a given location. The result is a loosely coordinated ''mosaic of hundreds of independently operating CERTs across the world.'' 32(p92) The CERT/CC is not a government agency, in contrast to the health departments that conduct most disease surveillance. Nor can it make or enforce rules. ''From the very beginning,'' according to one founder of the CERT/CC (interview October 2015), ''DARPA stressed . that we had no authority.'' Moreover, little capacity for cybersecurity was developed inside local, municipal, or state governments. Even now, fewer than half of local law enforcement agencies have a cybercrime unit. 33 Therefore, unlike other threats to public health and safety, the only recourse that most malware victims have is through a commercial service provider, such as an antivirus vendor like Symantec or McAfee. In sum, in addition to being more decentralized, the United States chose a more private and voluntary approach to cyber defense compared to public health at the local level.

Disease surveillance in the United States is a patchwork of state systems, developed through a long political process rather than an inevitable response to contagion. Congress created the US Marine Hospital Service in 1798, but control was not centralized until John Woodworth was appointed the first Surgeon General in 1871. Woodworth ''adopted a military model for his medical staff'' that was later institutionalized as the commissioned corps of the Public Health Service (PHS). 34 He also aimed ''to expand the service into a national quarantine agency'' and ''gather information about the spread of contagious diseases throughout the world.'' 23(p162) Despite political resistance, the Marine Hospital Service eventually gained control over quarantine through bureaucratic empire-building within the federal government.

Here, as elsewhere, federal authority can be seen as constrained by the Tenth Amendment to the Constitution or empowered by the General Welfare Clause and the Commerce Clause. 35 Either way, deference to states' rights remained the norm for disease surveillance. The PHS appointed epidemiologists to serve in state health departments in 1914, but the federal government did not establish an agency dedicated to disease surveillance until 1946. 27 

Even then, when the CDC was built on a wartime campaign against malaria, its bureaucratic survival was not assured. ''The CDC sometimes encountered opposition from better-established wings of the Public Health Service that resented the intrusion of a newcomer,'' and ''the National Institutes of Health [NIH] . also resented the upstart institution in Atlanta,'' 36(p28) so ''the possibility that CDC would be dismantled and merged with NIH was very real.'' 36(p49) To survive, the CDC sought to distinguish its fieldwork in service to the states from research at NIH. Similarly, Alexander Langmuir cited the threat of biological weapons during the Korean War to justify CDC's Epidemic Intelligence Service, which was also used to support state and local health officials. 11 Service to the states therefore became gospel at CDC, helping it become an authoritative federal agency while still deferring to states' rights. Prompted by Langmuir at CDC, the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists (CSTE) created an annual list of notifiable diseases in 1951. Reporting through the National Notifiable Disease Surveillance System is voluntary and somewhat variable; however, notification is compulsory at the state level, and, ''in practice, states do notify the CDC.'' 35(p1038) Disease surveillance is conducted by other federal agencies as well (eg, the Department of Agriculture, the Food and Drug Administration, and the Department of Defense), but CDC is the dominant authority in this field. It is also the biggest source of public health grant money, and this funding gives the CDC considerable power over the state health departments that it serves (interview with local public health official and former EIS officer, July 2015).

There is no national institution for cyber intelligence with the same authority and resources as the CDC. Instead, the CERT system spread alongside a global marketplace-now worth almost $100 billion-for cybersecurity products and services. These products and services include various forms of threat data and analysis, as well as hardware and software to limit the damage caused by cyber attacks (eg, patches, antivirus, firewalls, encryption, intrusion detection and prevention systems, etc).

How effective is this organizational ecosystem? Paradoxically, while the internet has drastically decreased the cost of communication, limited information is shared about threats to information technology. 2,3,37-39 Reporting is often ad hoc and idiosyncratic, depending more on interpersonal trust than institutional affiliation. Data collection and analysis are also balkanized. 40 Unlike epidemiology, where there is some consensus over CSTE case definitions, different vendors and CERTs use different nomenclature to name malware and count its frequency. Consequently, ''comparing incident statistics across teams is difficult and often meaningless,'' which diminishes the value of what little information is shared. 31(p83) Proposals for the federal government to establish authoritative standards and agencies have gained little traction. In 1989, the General Accounting Office (GAO) argued that internet security required a focal point. It proposed that the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) establish this focal point, but to no avail. 30 In 1991, the National Research Council recommended that the government help establish a nongovernmental organization to serve a similar function-again, with no apparent impact. 41 CERT/CC even pitched a similar proposal in 1997, which, by implication, was a concession that the CERT/CC had failed to establish itself as the single clearinghouse for cyber intelligence. 42 In 1998, President Bill Clinton issued Presidential Decision Directive 63 (PDD-63), 43 calling for ''A Public-Private Partnership'' to reduce the vulnerability of critical infrastructure to cyber attack. PDD-63 encouraged the private sector to create an Information Sharing and Analysis Center (ISAC), modeled on the CDC: As ultimately designed by private sector representatives, the ISAC may emulate particular aspects of such institutions as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that have proved highly effective. . 43 However, unlike the CDC (ie, a federal agency with police powers, informed by compulsory reporting at the state level), this ISAC was to be private and voluntary. Moreover, ''the single ISAC-the one PDD-63 calls for-was never built'' (interview with former US National Security Council staff, September 2015). Rather than establish a single clearinghouse, building separate ISACs became a business opportunity. 44 At least 19 sector-specific ISACs were subsequently established for financial services, energy, healthcare, and other parts of critical infrastructure. While reasonable, this outcome was not inevitable, especially since variation inside a given sector (eg, small and medium enterprises versus multinational corporations) may be just as significant for security as variation across sectors (eg, finance versus energy or healthcare).

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) was created in the aftermath of September 11, and it built capacity for cyber intelligence through the United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT) and the National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center (NCCIC). In the future, the NCCIC or US-CERT may come to resemble the CDC. Yet, the CDC started out with hundreds of employees. 45 US-CERT started out with a few dozen people and a small room, ''with one table and one chair in one corner'' (interview with CERT/CC staff, October 2015). 46 Today, the CDC provides more than $3 billion per year in grants for domestic public health, along with more than $400 million for global health. 47, 48 The Homeland Security Grant Program provides more than $1 billion to help states counter terrorism and other hazards, but most of this money is spent on physical rather than cyber security (interview with SMITH former MS-ISAC staff, November 2015). In addition, US-CERT was intended to play an international role, and yet it focuses on domestic agencies, with less global engagement than initially imagined (interview with former US-CERT staff, September 2015). Analogous functions and threats aside, national cyber intelligence is structured differently from disease surveillance.

Less than a year after the Morris worm, the CERT/CC helped the US Department of Energy and the National Air and Space Administration respond to the Wank worm, an early attempt at antinuclear hacktivism that protested the plutonium-powered Galileo spacecraft in 1989. Initial signs pointed to France and then Australia, and this incident fueled interest in international information sharing. 49 CERT/CC therefore helped create the Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams (FIRST) in 1990.

FIRST provides ''access to best practices, tools, and trusted communication.'' 50 It started out as a small club (except for 1 French team, the other founding members were all American). 31 It has since grown into an international forum for more than 300 national and industry teams from around the world. Given this international membership, FIRST can be compared with the World Health Organization. As with comparisons between CERTs, ISACs, and the CDC, however, FIRST is no WHO.

Unlike the WHO, FIRST did not build on previous international organizations. FIRST was the first of its kind. In contrast, the WHO was preceded by several international organizations and false starts, including the Pan American Sanitary Bureau (PASB), the Office International d'Hygiene Publique, and the Health Organization of the League of Nations. The structure of WHO reflects the politics of this legacy. For example, PASB leveraged its existing status to maintain autonomy and resist full integration into the WHO in 1948, a political precedent that helped other regional offices lock in similar arrangements and authorities. 51, 52 Furthermore, FIRST did not build on international law. In contrast, WHO administers the International Health Regulations (IHR), the origins of which trace back to the 19th century. After decades or more of noncompliance with these legally binding regulations, the IHR were revised in 2005. The revised IHR require member states to report all public health events of international concern, and they authorize WHO to acknowledge unofficial information about these events. In theory, WHO can use this authority to ''name and shame'' noncompliance (even though it rarely does so, bowing instead to political pressure from member states, and noncompliance persists). 52, 53 However, ''FIRST exercises no authority over the organization and operation of individual member teams.'' 54 It does not pretend to be an operational agency or wield international law.

FIRST merely consists of a small board, a few committees, and an annual conference. It is dwarfed by WHO, which has a $4 billion budget and oversight of surveillance through programs such as GISRS and the Global Public Health Intelligence Network (GPHIN). As small as FIRST appears in this comparison, it is still more prominent than other international organizations involved with cyber intelligence. For instance, the International Multilateral Partnership Against Cyber Threats (IMPACT) is supposedly ''modelled after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . to enhance the global community's capabilities in dealing with cyber threats.'' 55 But IMPACT has little following or credibility in advanced industrialized countries (interview with former AusCERT staff, May 2015). Here again, this international ecosystem looks very different from disease surveillance.

The institutional differences between disease surveillance and cyber intelligence are striking. On balance, cyber defense is more private, voluntary, and decentralized than public health. Which field is more effective is beyond the scope of this study, and ''there is no simple relationship between central control and effective surveillance.'' 22(p1071) Nevertheless, the chorus of criticism surrounding cyber defense suggests that public health may have the advantage. Either way, the history of cyber intelligence provides at least 3 important lessons for disease surveillance.

First, both fields reflect political choices at least as much as any technological imperative. For example, in public health, the power and interests of physicians in private practice constrain the potential for local intervention informed by disease surveillance. The CDC's service-or federal deference-to states is a political choice as well, as is the patchwork of different state systems. ''US public health law and policy are inescapably political,'' and they have been ''from their very inception.'' 56(p46) The same is true for global health governance.

Cyber intelligence is also shaped by politics, particularly the American ideology of ''anti-statism.'' 57 Ideological opposition to government institutions and interventions was ascendant during the 1980s and 1990s, at the same time that cyberspace and network threats were coming online. Anti-statism was bipartisan: The debate was less over whether to cut government and more over how much to cut. Thus, it was politically infeasible to provide cyber intelligence as a public good or service through government. This ideology helps explain why civilian cyber defense is now more decentralized, private, and voluntary than public health. Things could have been different. After all, the internet was born on public infrastructure with military funding. The United States could have built a focal point for cyber intelligence inside the government, like the CDC. For better or worse, it could have worked through an intergovernmental organization such as the International Telecommunications Union, which, like the WHO, is part of the United Nations (UN). Instead, the United States chose to rely on CERTs, ISACs, FIRST, and other private sources for cyber intelligence. The 1980s and 1990s were not the 1940s, when the United States had been willing to build government agencies at home (eg, CDC) and abroad (eg, the UN and the WHO). The ideological pendulum had swung towards anti-statism, and cyber intelligence reflects this shift in the marketplace of ideas.

Cyber intelligence therefore provides a cautionary tale for public health. As underfunded and uncoordinated as disease surveillance may be, it could be worse. If the CDC did not already exist, it would be difficult to build this kind of government agency in this day and age. Building the WHO would be even harder. Path dependency suggests that the CDC and the WHO will survive, but they should not be taken for granted. More important, if these agencies are going to help improve disease surveillance, then their policies and actions must be politically sophisticated, given the prevailing ideology in the United States. Without this kind of leadership, progress is unlikely.

A second lesson to learn from cyber intelligence is that information technology does not guarantee information sharing. Electronic records are native to the internet, as are the means to share them (email, listserv, web portals, etc). But information sharing about malware and other cyber threats remains limited, which, in turn, limits how much ''big data'' is available and amenable to analysis. Sometimes, critical information is not even shared with potential victims. For example, IP addresses infected by the Conficker worm are routinely identified without informing the users of these compromised systems or removing the malware. 13 This practice may break with sound medical ethics for diagnosing and treating disease (although it pales in comparison to the infamous Tuskegee experiments). Either way, the lack of information sharing is not due to any lack of information technology.

Therefore, as revolutionary as information technology and electronic health records may be for disease surveillance, they are no panacea. The technical challenges of moving from manual to automated data management are easy when compared to the political barriers to sharing information through interoperable systems. These barriers range from conflicts between public and private interests to privacy and liability concerns derived from the dual use of data, all of which have contributed to the balkanization of cyber intelligence.

Public health officials should work to avoid similar fragmentation. To this end, it is important to recognize how the design and implementation of electronic records are not merely functions of technical efficiency but rather choices with distributional consequences (ie, there are winners and losers). One potential advantage for public health agencies is that disease surveillance is ''hierarchical and relatively simple in structure.'' 58(p2) This structure places CDC and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) in a strong bargaining position to promote open standards for information sharing (including common nomenclature and data types). If harmonized, these standards can create network effects-namely, positive externalities-that substantially increase the volume and value of information available. So, in addition to modernizing the National Electronic Disease Surveillance System (NEDSS), the CDC and HHS should aggressively push the development and adoption of data standards, as well as ''meaningful use'' criteria for electronic health records to include public health. 59 

Finally, while cyber intelligence leaves much to be desired, some aspects of this field may be worth replicating. After all, the relatively hierarchical system whereby state health departments report information to the CDC is not above reproach. The CDC can be criticized for being a black box into which information flows ''but does not come back.'' Ironically, this criticism echoes what some cybersecurity experts say about sharing information with intelligence agencies like the NSA. Given that the politics of American anti-statism resist increasing federal administration of public health surveillance, alternative approaches for improving collection, analysis, and reporting also warrant consideration.

Because ISACs for cyber intelligence failed to actually emulate the CDC, one alternative approach would be for the CDC to sponsor an ISAC for public health surveillance. 60 The CDC Office of Public Health Scientific Services could seed this public-private partnership, which might look like the National Health Information Sharing and Analysis Center (NH-ISAC) for cybersecurity in the healthcare sector. Ideally, it would combine the lessons learned from NH-ISAC with experience from CDC's pilot fusion center, BioPHusion. 61 Likewise, private sector participation may help this ISAC avoid some of the problems suffered by the DHS National Biosurveillance Integration Center. 62 The goals would be consistent with the CDC's surveillance strategy. 63 The ISAC could help make surveillance ''more adaptable to the rapidly changing technology landscape'' by allowing tech vendors and users to engage in an operational environment on an ongoing basis. 63 It could help make surveillance ''more versatile in meeting demands for expanding knowledge about evolving threats to health'' 63 by providing a sanctioned forum for stakeholders to share and SMITH evaluate heterogeneous data alongside internet-based surveillance (GPHIN, HealthMap, ProMED, etc), official sources (eg, NEDSS, Epi-X), and similar systems. The ISAC could also help make surveillance ''more able to meet the demands for timely and .

[specific] information''especially demands from outside the CDC-by broadening participation. 63 Of course, the devil is in the details, and an ISAC cannot replace surveillance by local, state, and federal authorities (a lesson that may be dawning on cybersecurity experts). This article provides a foundation for further research, and an ISAC for public health surveillance may be found to complement the existing architecture. Even if the CDC rejects this particular approach, it can still learn from the successes and failures of cyber intelligence. This field is in touch with information technology, by definition. It is sensitive to contemporary politics, lacking the longer legacy of public health. Therefore, while cyber intelligence and disease surveillance are not the same, the threats and functional requirements are too similar to ignore when crafting better policy.

The evidence base of primary research in public health emergency preparedness: a scoping review and stakeholder consultation,"Background: Effective public health emergency preparedness and response systems are important in mitigating the impact of all-hazards emergencies on population health. The evidence base for public health emergency preparedness (PHEP) is weak, however, and previous reviews have noted a substantial proportion of anecdotal event reports. To investigate the body of research excluding the anecdotal reports and better understand primary and analytical research for PHEP, a scoping review was conducted with two objectives: first, to develop a thematic map focused on primary research; and second, to use this map to inform and guide an understanding of knowledge gaps relevant to research and practice in PHEP.","For more than a decade, there has been substantial attention to and investment in emergency preparedness and response capacity for emergencies with health impacts. The importance of robust emergency preparedness and response systems for health emergencies is highlighted by recent incidents such as the Ebola outbreak in West Africa, the emergence of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus, natural disasters such as floods, and industrial-technical incidents like train derailments [1] [2] [3] [4] . Preparedness for the diversity of events that may impact health is described as an 'all-hazards' approach, highlighting the importance of ensuring the system is prepared for a variety of potential threats. While there are multiple sectors with responsibilities for emergency preparedness and response, actions taken to prepare and respond to the population health consequences of emergencies fall to public health emergency preparedness (PHEP). PHEP has been defined as ""the capability of the public health and health care systems, communities, and individuals, to prevent, protect against, quickly respond to, and recover from health emergencies, particularly those whose scale, timing, or unpredictability threatens to overwhelm routine capabilities"" [5] . Examples of actions of PHEP related to health emergencies include surveillance and epidemiologic activities to monitor, detect, and investigate potential health threats, and the development and communication of information to the public [5] . In the context of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak of 2003, gaps were noted in the Canadian public health system including coordinated surveillance systems for detecting outbreaks and communication to the public [6] .

Despite the investments into operational capacity for PHEP, a persistent challenge is a paucity of evidence to inform and guide practice [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] . Evidence-based approaches to public health practice have been recognized as crucial [12] , alongside established practice in related fields of evidence-based medicine and health decisionmaking [13] [14] [15] [16] . Evidence-based or informed practice in public health encompasses incorporating scientific evidence in selecting and implementing programs, developing policies, and evaluating progress [12] . In the PHEP field, however, anecdotal responses to recent events are typically used as the best available science [10] . A review of the emergency planning literature focused on the United Kingdom (UK) noted that the published literature for emergency planning is dominated by event reports [11] . This can be problematic in that outcomes and conclusions may not be generalizable to other populations, settings, exposures or interventions [12] [13] [14] . Public health in general aims to be informed by the best available evidence and there is an appetite to have more rigorous forms of evidence to inform PHEP practice [12, 16, 17] .

While the PHEP knowledge base is dominated by event reports and narrative reviews [11] , PHEP research of a more analytical nature has been undertaken in some recent emergencies [10] . This review focuses on primary and analytical research in PHEP in order to better inform research priorities for the field. Our objectives in undertaking this scoping review are therefore twofold: first, to develop a thematic map of the PHEP evidence base, focused on primary and analytical research; and second, to use this map to inform and guide an understanding of knowledge gaps relevant to research and practice in PHEP.

We conducted a scoping review of published research literature in the field of public health emergency preparedness. The scoping review methodology is particularly relevant to fields which have an emerging and diverse knowledge base, which makes the method wellsuited to the PHEP literature [18] [19] [20] . Scoping reviews may be undertaken for four reasons: to examine the extent, range and nature of research activity; to determine the value of undertaking a full systematic review; to summarize and disseminate research findings; and to identify research gaps in the existing literature [18] . This scoping review addresses three of the four reasons: to examine the extent, range and nature of research for PHEP; to summarize and disseminate research findings; and finally to identify existing gaps in the field that can be addressed through ongoing research. The six steps of the framework articulated by Arksey and O'Malley and further described by Levac et al. were applied in the review protocol [18] [19] [20] . As outlined by Levac et al., to maximize the rigor of the review, we implemented an iterative process throughout the six steps that incorporated knowledge from expert stakeholders.

Step 1: Identifying the research purpose and scope of inquiry

The first purpose of the review is to create a map of the major themes in the PHEP evidence base to inform an understanding of the extent, range and nature of PHEP research. The second purpose is to identify potential knowledge gaps relevant to research and practice in PHEP by summarizing research findings and identifying existing gaps in the field. 'Public health' was defined for this review as the scope of public health activities relevant to Canadian public health agencies and departments; this scope includes activities such as surveillance, epidemiology, food and water safety, public information and communication, and laboratory services but notably excludes the provision of mass health care or hospital and institution-based emergency preparedness that may be included in PHEP in other countries [5] . Emergency preparedness research focused on all aspects of the emergency management cycle (prevention/mitigation, preparedness, response and recovery) was considered. An all-hazards approach was used including literature related to a range of hazards such as infectious disease, natural disasters, terrorism and technological events. The settings of complex humanitarian emergencies and conflict were out of scope. The focus was on peer-reviewed or grey literature and included studies of primary research, either quantitative or qualitative [21] , and research examining standards or best practices (Table 1) . Secondary research or knowledge syntheses such as literature reviews were excluded from the final group. Computer simulation studies were excluded for feasibility purposes and in order to focus on the scope of applied, real-world PHEP research.

Step 2: Identifying relevant studies A library specialist-assisted search was employed that addressed the concepts of public health, emergencies or disasters, emergency preparedness or emergency management and evidence or evaluation. The databases searched were Medline, Embase, BIOSIS, PsycInfo and EBSCO (CINAHL, Academic Search Premier, Health Business Elite, Environment Complete and SocINDEX) from 1998 to 2013 to include important events in the emergency management field such as SARS, 9/11 and Hurricane Katrina internationally and the 1998 ice storm in Canada (Additional file 1). In addition, reference lists of included articles were reviewed. Non-indexed sources of evidence were examined (grey literature) and a custom Google search was created to examine key government, agency and non-governmental organization websites for an international sample of organizations practicing in the PHEP field.

Step 3: Study selection Study selection was an iterative process that included screening first by title only, second by abstract, and finally, by full-text review. Initial search results were screened by title for their relevance to: (1) health, health consequences or health systems and (2) emergency preparedness or management actions. We conducted an initial pilot using 10% of studies reviewed by two reviewers to ensure consistency in applying the title screening criteria. After this pilot, the remaining initial search results were reviewed for relevance by title by one reviewer.

The second phase of study selection applied the inclusion criteria for relevance by abstract (Table 1) . These criteria were developed in relation to the research purpose and refined based on consensus by members of the research team. The inclusion criteria were applied by two reviewers to the abstracts of title-screened search results and differences resolved by consensus. Table 1 criteria were applied again to the screening of full text articles that were examined by two reviewers. A final group of selected articles was identified after full-text review; this group comprised the 'primary research' studies of interest. Themes identified from excluded simulation studies were cross-referenced with the themes from the final group of articles to ensure there were no notable elements or themes missed.

Step 4: Charting the data

The descriptive-numerical summary approach described by Levac et al. was used for charting the data [19] . The data charting form was developed by consensus with the research team, piloted with two team members, and adapted iteratively in refining the final categories. The final table categories included were: research question/ objective, category of study design (e.g., descriptive or analytical), specific study design, study population, intervention or exposure of interest, control group, study outcomes, study conclusions, hazard category, specific hazard, year of emergency event, scope of emergency event (e.g., local, provincial/state, federal or international support required), phase of emergency management cycle (e.g., prevention and/or mitigation, preparedness, response, recovery) [22] , country of emergency event, country of study authors, and finally, additional notable elements or themes. If fields could not be completed or were not applicable for a given study, they were left blank. Assessment of quality of evidence beyond research design was out of scope for this review. The data charting form was completed by two reviewers and differences resolved by team consensus.

The category of study design allowed for the identification of a final group of articles that were primary research and evaluative or evidence-based in nature. This group was assessed using a thematic analysis approach Table 1 Inclusion criteria for assessment of studies Criterion 1 Does the article specifically include the actions of Public Health (local, province/state or national level)?

Does the article include public health actions in some aspect of emergency management (prevention/mitigation, preparedness, response, and/or recovery)?

Does the article include an evaluation of public health actions during an emergency event (whether based on qualitative or quantitative data)

OR does the article propose emergency management-related standards or best practices that have been derived from a process with clear methods?

which allowed for the capture of emergent themes in a more inductive method, rather than classifying the studies deductively based on previously described categories [19] . Thematic analysis was initiated by two reviewers and iteratively developed with the research team. Specifically, each reviewer examined papers by full-text and noted key themes for the study. Themes identified were discussed with the larger research team and noted in the final data charting form based on consensus.

Steps 5 and 6: Collating, summarizing, reporting results and consultation

The consultation step is described by Levac et al. as essential and adding methodological rigor [19] . The objectives of the consultation phase were to share preliminary findings with stakeholders as knowledge translation, validate the evidence map of themes, and identify additional sources of information, meaning and applicability [18, 19] . Collating and summarizing results was therefore done in phases related to these objectives. In the first phase of data collation and summary, numerical or quantitative in nature were summarized using Microsoft Excel™ 2010. The key themes from the final group of primary research studies were used to create groupings of similar studies by theme and summarized in table format. These initial results and themes were sent to stakeholders to elicit their feedback through a survey. For the consultation step process, we used a sample of stakeholders invited to participate in a working group meeting funded by a Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) Planning Grant awarded to conduct a scoping review and engage stakeholders in setting research priorities for PHEP. The sample was identified in a purposive manner to be international and interdisciplinary in nature and represent a diversity of perspectives from within PHEP as well as closely related fields responsible for working with the public health system in emergencies. Participants represented the fields of public health, health care, emergency medical services, government, and were distributed across research, academic and policy environments. The number of participants was 26. Consultation was carried out via electronic survey administered using FluidSurveys™. Ethics approval was obtained by the Public Health Ontario Ethics Review Board. For each theme, the survey participants were asked whether additional evaluative literature exists, and if they were aware of any gaps relating to practice, based on their knowledge and expertise. In addition, participants were asked to note any additional themes or topics not captured in the review (Additional file 2).

The second phase of data collation and summary involved analysis of the results from the survey. Dichotomous (yes/no) responses were summarized using Microsoft Excel™ 2010. Qualitative data from open-ended questions were coded and summarized based on themes and relevant sub-themes. The results of the survey for suggested additional studies were assessed for inclusion using the same criteria from Table 1 to determine whether they met consistent criteria for inclusion in the review; while all additional suggested themes were included in the final list of themes.

The last aspect of consultation occurred during an inperson working group meeting with the stakeholders. The themes resulting from the review and survey were presented to participants who were given the opportunity to offer final comment and confirm the themes and sub-themes.

The total number of citations retrieved through the search of indexed databases after duplicates removed was 3015. A flowchart of the article selection process is displayed in Figure 1 . Three hundred articles met our criteria after title and abstract screening including additional sources from reference lists and grey literature. Reasons for exclusion of citations were predominantly related to emergency preparedness or management activities that did not meet the criteria of public health actions, based on the established definition. For example, hospital-based preparedness; mass casualty preparedness, triage or health care; and preparedness for institutions such as long-term care.

Data charting by descriptive numerical summary was undertaken for the 300 articles that were selected after abstract screening. The types of disaster were: all hazards or disaster type unspecified (39%); infectious natural hazards (31%); and non-infectious natural hazards or natural disasters (24%) (Figure 2 ).

The largest proportion of articles related to the response phase of the emergency management cycle (42%) and the second largest to the preparedness phase (34%). The prevention/mitigation phase accounted for 21%, while recovery was represented by only 3% of articles. The majority of studies were published by United States (US)-based authors (197, 66.3%), with Canada ranking second (23, 7.7%). The largest number of emergency events described in the published literature was from the US (126, 42%), with the second largest from Canada (18, 6.0%).

The majority of studies, 186 (62%), were non-primary research or descriptive articles. Thirty-seven (12%) were analytic epidemiology studies and 45 (15%) were descriptive primary research studies, such as surveys (Figure 3 ). Of the group of non-primary research or descriptive articles, 50% were emergency event-related descriptions such as ""lessons learned"", event reports or case studies; 37% were literature reviews that did not employ systematic review methodology; 6% were commentaries; 3% were systematic reviews and another 3% were practice guidelines. A final 1% consisted of media or magazine reports that were captured in the search.

Eighty-two primary research and analytic epidemiology studies were selected for further review; these were reduced to 58 articles after exclusion of computer simulation studies. The final group of 58 articles related specifically to the research question. No grey literature met the criteria of being evidence-based or evaluative in nature. Within the final group, the most common study design was survey methodology (60%) including crosssectional population surveys, surveys using qualitative methods such as key informant interviews, and surveys conducted after training exercises as an evaluation tool. The cohort studies were largely retrospective administrative 

The first iteration of thematic analysis resulted in the identification of ten major themes ( Table 2 ). The key findings for the initial themes are described below, with additional detail provided in Additional file 3.

Attitudes and beliefs [23] [24] [25] : A key sub-theme in the literature relating to attitudes and beliefs is the willingness of workers to respond to a public health emergency. In identified studies, willingness to respond to particular emergencies varies by type of disaster and practice setting [23, 25] . In addition, studies concluded that willingness as an attitude is important to consider in emergency response training [23, 24] .

Capacity assessment and capacity-building [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] : A study in this theme reports that surveys at the local health department level can provide information to guide development of capacity [31] . Evaluative information that relates to emergency preparedness and response can inform a deeper understanding of the capabilities important to preparedness [27] . Another study notes the importance of funding on the preparedness capacity of local public health [29] .

Collaboration and system integration [32] [33] [34] [35] : Several studies highlight the importance of collaboration and integration in relation to public health emergencies. Collaborating on exchanging plans and protocols was identified as an important and feasible goal for agencies [34] . Roles exist in the health system that can facilitate linkages between health care and public health settings; for example, epidemiologists that link with hospitals [35] . Newer methodologies, like network analysis, present opportunities for examining the role of inter-agency networks in promoting prepared public health systems [33] .

Communicable disease control [36, 37] : This theme is a well-understood core function of public health. Studies on this theme found relating to PHEP research indicate the utility of specific emergency plans to inform public health strategies such as vaccination and examining the role of interventions such as school closure as mitigating measures in responding to a public health incident [36, 37] . Communication [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] : The third highest number of studies was identified in this theme. Sub-themes noted for this theme relate to the focus of communication as externally-facing (to the public), internally-facing (within the system), and high-risk populations. Externally-facing communication examined aspects of the adoption of public health guidance by the public. For example, concern or risk perception may not translate automatically to higher uptake of guidance and skepticism regarding institutions may influence public uptake of recommended actions [39, 45] . Internally-facing communication that occurs within the system included findings that stakeholders have preferences on how information is received and note the importance of trust in the agency delivering the message [40, 43] . Principles of trust are also important when communicating with high-risk populations [46] .

Education, training and exercises [47] [48] [49] [50] [51] [52] [53] [54] [55] : This theme contained the second highest number of studies. Subthemes were developed that related to the audience of the education or training intervention such as public health practitioner, clinician and leader. Public health practitioner studies found that blended learning approaches had good outcomes for both satisfaction and knowledge [52] . Studies also found that criteria or tools can be used to facilitate evaluation of training and exercises [51, 53] . Leadership-specific training was reported to result in increased overall knowledge and positive change [55] .

Public health considerations for sheltering and evacuation [56, 57] : Studies identified in this theme describe the importance of the planning process to address the health needs of sheltered populations [57] . In addition, public health training in shelter operations was noted as a gap [56] .

Quality improvement and performance standards [58] [59] [60] [61] [62] : This theme included studies that explore models for improving public health preparedness as well as frameworks and tools that can be used to measure preparedness and promote quality improvement [61, 62] . Processes for team debriefing were also found to be helpful to evaluate performance [58] .

Surveillance, epidemiology and public health information [63] [64] [65] [66] [67] [68] [69] [70] [71] [72] [73] [74] [75] : This theme was associated with the largest proportion of studies (13/58, 22%). Within this theme, methodologies applied in epidemiological data collection and analysis were identified. Specific sub-themes included studies on rapid needs assessments, which is a method that can provide valuable information to authorities on the needs and health status of affected communities [65, 70, 75] . Risk assessments using surveys can provide information about exposure risk to populations [69] . In addition, other studies described the use of a diversity and adaptability of data sources that can be applied to public health surveillance; for example, medical dispatch data and mobile phone data [63, 73] .

Vulnerable populations [76] [77] [78] [79] [80] : Sub-themes identified for this theme included methods for vulnerability assessment, such as heat vulnerability index, and high-risk populations in general. For high-risk populations, the challenges of identifying and prioritizing vulnerable populations were noted and strategies for integrating diverse communities into emergency planning and response were explored [76, 77] .

A list of the initial themes along with summarized key findings from the relevant articles was disseminated to stakeholders. Of 26 participants invited to participate in the survey, the response rate was 62%.

Four additional themes were noted by stakeholders: ethics, gender considerations, psychosocial considerations, resilience and planning. Ethics, gender, resilience and psychosocial considerations had been noted in the evidence reviewed but had not been captured as themes.

Planning was a theme that was identified as important based on experience, rather than literature. In addition, wording refinements for themes were suggested based on participants' expertise. For example, ""high risk"" or ""at-risk"" populations was suggested instead of ""vulnerable populations"". Although the majority of the studies were conducted in the US, 88% of survey respondents felt the themes were applicable to PHEP in Canada.

There were 29 total additional citations that were suggested by stakeholders as potential evidence for inclusion in the review. It was determined by the research team that 2 additional articles would have met the inclusion criteria applied in the review [81, 82] . Reasons for exclusion included: articles that were not related to public health actions (E.g. hospital or emergency responder actions), not representing primary research, or outside the date criteria. The additional articles and survey results were used to revise the original PHEP themes. A number of themes were cross-cutting in nature, while others stood on their own. The synthesized list of themes included 4 cross-cutting themes and 12 standalone themes (Table 3 ).

In the final stage of stakeholder consultation, the synthesized and revised results consisting of cross-cutting and stand-alone themes were presented to the survey participants in a face-to-face format. This step resulted in the confirmation of the themes as presented in Table 3 without further suggested revisions.

This review aimed to identify knowledge gaps for PHEP relevant to research and practice in the field. Primary research from non-US settings was identified as a general gap, consistent with previous reviews [11] . The results of the survey questions pertaining to participants' sense of knowledge gaps, for the initial ten themes, is described below with additional detail provided in Additional file 4.

Attitudes and beliefs: Gaps pertained to the ethical values involved in assessing willingness to respond; the importance of psychosocial supports to foster willingness to work; and volunteer characteristics.

Capacity assessment and capacity-building: Gaps for this initial theme related to building capacity to address a need for psychosocial supports for workers and building capacity for hospital surge. General capacity-building also noted the importance of poverty reduction in mitigating the impact of emergencies on populations.

Collaboration and system integration: Gaps pertaining to this theme related to cross-jurisdictional collaboration as well as across sectors of the health system.

Communicable disease control: A gap that was noted relating to SARS was the labour issues involved for front line health care workers in the setting of communicable disease outbreaks.

Communication: Communication as a strategy to promote integration with other sectors such as primary care was noted as a gap. In addition, emerging information technologies such as social media have had limited exploration to date.

Education, training and exercises: A number of gaps were identified in the survey pertaining to this initial theme. These ranged from specific capabilities such as Incident Management System implementation to more complex concepts such as flexibility and emergency decision-making for public health practitioners.

Public health considerations for sheltering and evacuation: Gaps in this initial theme related to understanding the logistics and implementation challenges for public health measures such as evacuation. In addition, the potential for public health to benefit from skillsets found in other disciplines, which could promote improved public preparedness levels. Quality improvement and performance standards: Within this theme, the challenge of understanding the components of preparedness was noted. Psychosocial supports was again noted as a gap in this theme.

Surveillance, epidemiology and public health information: Elements of integration to promote public health information were noted, such as the interfaces of public health with primary and emergency care. The value of technologies such as electronic health records was described as a gap in relation to this theme. The concept of resilience was also raised as a gap.

Vulnerable populations: A number of gaps pertaining to vulnerable populations were noted. The ethical values and considerations inherent in exploring issues of ""vulnerable"" populations were described. In addition, methods for promoting community engagement for public health preparedness were noted and for addressing the needs of specific populations and potential vulnerabilities.

The following specific quotes relate to qualitative data collected on knowledge gaps, with relevant associated theme:

""What are the main methods and coping strategies used by individuals, stakeholders and their organizations to get back to normal life?"" (resilience); ""How do we answer the frequent question: ""Are we prepared?"" (quality improvement and performance standards); ""There is more focus on recovery needed in the literature, whether physical or psychosocial impacts"" (resilience, psychosocial impacts, capacity assessment and capacity building); ""There is a need for collaboration and networking across disciplines to scope beyond PHEP/public health"" (collaboration and system integration).

Based on thematic analysis and synthesis of the initial themes with survey results, we identified five key knowledge gaps that were important areas of interest to stakeholders but where evidence is sparse or non-existing. These are depicted along with the cross-cutting themes identified from the consultation (Table 4 ).

Previous reviews of PHEP evidence base documented the largely descriptive and anecdotal nature of the literature and found it challenging to draw conclusions as a result [7, 11] . Rigorous and analytical research needs to be conducted to strengthen the PHEP evidence base to respond to practice and policy-related questions for the field [9, 10] . This review focused on the body of primary research that has been conducted in the PHEP field and aimed to map important themes, for the purpose of furthering understandings of existing PHEP science and revealing potential knowledge gaps for future research. This scoping review is novel for the PHEP field in that it utilized published scoping review methodology with the identification of themes as they emerged, without applying a pre-existing framework [19] . In addition, the study included expert stakeholder consultation to validate and confirm the themes identified by the review, a knowledge translation step that is sometimes omitted in scoping reviews but considered essential [19] .

The iterative identification of themes using the literature and survey methods resulted in the recognition of important cross-cutting themes for PHEP. To our knowledge, this is the first time that the cross-cutting nature of some PHEP themes has been documented. Based on these results, consideration of the themes of at-risk populations, gender and equity should be recognized as integral to planning and implementing PHEP research [83] . Although these themes may be viewed as similar they each have unique characteristics: at-risk populations vary depending on the hazard and risk, gender differences cut across virtually all population health issues, and equity speaks more broadly about disparities that may pre-exist within a given community. Resilience was the fourth cross-cutting theme [84] . Resilience is described as the intrinsic capacity of individuals, populations and infrastructure to resist and rebound from shocks and to then rebuild to a stronger state [84] . In national-level emergency management policy, resilience is established as the overall objective of all-hazards preparedness and capacity-building activities in order to reduce the impact of emergencies on a given population [22, 85] ; hence its inclusion in this category.

In addition to cross-cutting themes, the stand-alone themes with the largest number of papers included in the review were Surveillance, Epidemiology and Public Health Information, Communication and Education, Training and Exercises. Surveillance, Epidemiology and Public Health Information was the theme with the largest number of studies. This is not surprising given the integral nature of surveillance and epidemiology to public health, as well as the manner in which quantitative data are used for analytic processes to assess risk or measure outcomes of public health emergency events. Efforts in the US to identify key domains for PHEP are consistent and have similarly identified 'health surveillance' [86] . Communication is an area that has been noted to be problematic in post-emergency event assessments; thus, it is positive that research is emerging under this theme [6, 87] . The social behavioural facets of communication relating to PHEP have recently been explored in the literature. For example, concepts of trust and preferences for certain characteristics of messaging highlight the contextual aspects that are emerging from PHEP communication research [40, 43, 45] . Important knowledge gaps were identified for communication in PHEP relevant to the use of emerging technologies. Education, Training and Exercises was another theme in which preliminary study on approaches to training for 'hard skills' such as technical skills and 'soft skills' such as leadership has been undertaken [53, 54] . Nonetheless, attention to training as it relates to emergency decisionmaking in public health was highlighted as a gap in this review.

The complexity of PHEP is reflected in the knowledge gaps that emerged. For example, Collaboration and System Integration sub-themes pertain to multiple health-care stakeholders. Multi-sectoral partnerships and engagement has also been noted as important domains for PHEP operations in the US [86] . Opportunities for generating knowledge to examine complexities such as system integration could address knowledge gaps and inform operational activities and policy. Another notable knowledge gap relates to the theme of Quality Improvement and Performance Standards. Multiple publications have noted the importance of quality improvement and development of standards or metrics for PHEP [5, 9, 88] . Despite this, little research was identified that has empirically examined the development of standards and metrics. Research in PHEP that advances empirical knowledge in this area would be valuable. This review has several limitations. First, this study specifically focused on research that was relevant to the actions and activities of public health as defined for the Canadian setting. The findings therefore may not translate to other countries that have differing scope of public health responsibilities. As was noted in the emergent themes, the importance of integration and collaboration within the health system is key for PHEP, and it is possible that this review did not capture the extent of public health connectedness to the rest of the health system, as found in the literature. This focus on public health was carefully defined, however, with the purpose of identifying themes and relevant knowledge gaps that specifically pertain to public health agencies and departments. Second, as with all systematic reviews, there is a possibility that literature was missed, which may have resulted in a lack of recognition of key themes or gaps. We used a rigorous search strategy for the indexed and grey literature to minimize this. In addition, we conducted stakeholder consultation in order that experts in the field would provide information and contribute knowledge that was missing. As a result of this iterative approach, additional articles were included in the final thematic analysis. Third, computer simulation studies were excluded due to scope of the current study, with a focus on the field-derived primary research studies. An attempt to account for themes that resulted from datacharting of this group was done and compared with the final emergent themes. In general, these studies pertained to vaccination and outbreak management, which were captured under themes of Communicable Disease Control or Surveillance, Epidemiology and Public Health Information. Finally, quality of research studies was not assessed beyond research design in this review and for this reason, the themes identified in the literature and the knowledge gaps do not take into account specific methodological strengths and weaknesses of the included studies. While quality assessment is ideal to include, we addressed the varying quality in the PHEP literature by focusing on identifying a group of articles that did not include event reports or 'lessons learned' commentaries, and focused on primary research studies.

A question that has been posed in a review of the emergency planning literature focused on the UK is whether ""the traditional hierarchy of evidence applied to clinical research is appropriate in this field"" [11] . The challenge of using the traditional evidence hierarchy to inform evidence-based decision-making in health has been raised outside the PHEP field [21] . The hierarchical approach to evidence is quantitatively oriented and does not elaborate on how context may modify the relevance of evidence [21] . Upshur et al. suggest that an inclusive definition of evidence includes both quantitative research that involves measurement as well as qualitative research that examines context and meaning [21] . This review included the breadth of evidence described in this taxonomy, and identified qualitative research in PHEP that attempts to capture meaning. The themes identified in this review for PHEP would support that both quantitative and qualitative methodological approaches will be valuable in generating knowledge to understand the complexities of gaps such as communication, collaboration and integration, and attitudes and beliefs. However, as noted by Upshur et al., such research will benefit from having a sufficient theoretical base that will allow it to have solid 'scientific' standing in the eyes of proponents of evidence-based practice. This is important given the high proportion of anecdotal event reports which share experiential and contextual knowledge but generally lack a sufficient theoretical base. In addition, there are recent studies highlighting that participatory and community-based approaches to research may have an important role in addressing some of the cross-cutting and stand-alone themes noted in this review [89, 90] . Participatory methods hold promise for promoting inclusiveness across a community and examining the meaning that may underlie the complexities of the emergency [89] . These methods also model a collaborative approach that may promote resilience, enabling both research and community-building, thereby fostering the translation of knowledge to action [89, 91] .

Fading vision: knowledge translation in the implementation of a public health policy intervention,"Background: In response to several high profile public health crises, public health renewal is underway in Canada. In the province of British Columbia, the Ministry of Health initiated a collaborative evidence-informed process involving a steering committee of representatives from the six health authorities. A Core Functions (CF) Framework was developed, identifying 21 core public health programs. For each core program, an evidence review was conducted and a model core program paper developed. These documents were distributed to health authorities to guide development of their own renewed public health services. The CF implementation was conceptualized as an embedded knowledge translation process. A CF coordinator in each health authority was to facilitate a gap analysis and development of a performance improvement plan for each core program, and post these publically on the health authority website. Methods: Interviews (n = 19) and focus groups (n = 8) were conducted with a total of 56 managers and front line staff from five health authorities working in the Healthy Living and Sexually Transmitted Infection Prevention core programs. All interviews and focus groups were digitally recorded, transcribed and verified by the project coordinator. Five members of the research team used NVivo 9 to manage data and conducted a thematic analysis.","There is longstanding unease in Canada about the adequacy of public health infrastructure to address major public health concerns [1, 2] . In the early 21st century, several public health emergencies highlighted the need for public health reform. In particular, water contamination events [3] and the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak in Toronto [4] drove home the need for public health renewal [5] . The centerpiece of the province of British Columbia's (BC) approach to reform is a Framework for Core Functions in Public Health (CF Framework) [6] . It identifies the basic public health services and supports that Health Authorities (HA) are expected to provide to their communities (see Additional file 1).

The launch of this Framework provided the impetus for developing a research program, Core Public Health Functions Research Initiative (CPHFRI) [7] , to study the implementation and impact of public health system renewal in BC and beyond. CPHFRI includes the Renewal of Public Health Systems (RePHS) project in which we study the implementation of the CF Framework in BC and the Public Health Standards in Ontario (ON), through two exemplar core public health programs: sexually transmitted infection prevention (STIP) and chronic disease prevention, known in BC as healthy living (HL). The findings reported in this paper are derived from RePHS BC phase one data on the introduction and early implementation of the CF Framework and the two core programs from the perspectives of public health managers and practitioners.

Implementation has been generally studied as a component of a larger change process, such as the diffusion of innovations [8, 9] . Implementation refers to a process of translating intentions into action with many possible outcomes, including degrees of both successful and unsuccessful implementation [10, 11] . These intentions are reflected in policies, plans, technologies, programs, and innovations. In public health, like other areas of healthcare, there has been movement toward evidencebased practice, programs, and policies [12] , and several terms have emerged to describe the process by which evidence is translated into practice, such as knowledge translation (KT), knowledge transfer, and knowledge exchange [13] .

The KT literature, which has grown considerably since 2000, overlaps with older implementation literature. Both KT and implementation theory are about putting knowledge into practice, but KT is explicitly focused on research evidence and the relationship between researchers and knowledge users. The older implementation literature focuses more on implementing innovations, policies, and programs, and influences on that process. Both bodies of literature inform our analysis.

From their meta-narrative systematic review of the diverse literature across 13 research traditions on diffusion of innovations in healthcare organizations, Greenhalgh et al. [8] developed a comprehensive conceptual framework of factors influencing dissemination, adoption, implementation, and sustainability. The main categories of influence on these include: the nature of the innovation; system antecedents for innovation; communication and influence; the outer context; the inner context; system readiness for innovation; characteristics of the adopters; and the implementation process. In this framework, implementation is one stage in the entire diffusion process, but factors influencing each stage are not distinct and influence all stages.

There is widespread acknowledgement of the importance of evidence-based practice and policy, yet the research-practice gap remains a significant problem [14, 15] . Theories, frameworks, and models have been developed to guide and explain the implementation and KT process [8, [15] [16] [17] [18] . KT is a process of closing the gap between the evidence generated in research and its application for frontline health systems delivery [19] . Here, 'application' or what we call 'implementation' is considered part of the KT process. Unfortunately, implementation and KT frameworks have not been used widely by organizations prospectively to plan implementation of new policies or programs [16, 18] . We know that few policies and programs in the 'real world' are fully implemented as intended [20] , but we do not know how the use of KT or implementation frameworks might improve the process.

In recognition of this challenge, the BC Ministry of Health developed a Core Functions Implementation Process [21] to guide the implementation of the Core Functions Framework [6] in BC, which can be understood as an embedded KT process. In other words, KT was integrated into the policy intervention itself as illustrated below.

The core functions implementation process-embedded knowledge translation A provincial steering committee was created to develop, oversee, and guide the CF framework implementation. This committee, composed of Ministry and HA representatives, commissioned and approved evidence reviews for each of the core programs. Provincial teams, which included HA representatives, used the evidence reviews to develop 21 model core program papers (MCPP). At this point, responsibility for implementation was turned over to HAs. Leaders within each HA were identified for each core program and they convened working groups to conduct gap analyses in which existing services were examined in relation to the evidence-informed practices described in the MCPPs. The working groups were to develop performance improvement plans (PIPs) to implement the MCPP strategies that addressed identified gaps in service. If the HA was already implementing some of the best practices described, they could continue to offer those services if other priorities were not identified and implement new services to address gaps.

Expectations for Framework implementation were communicated to the HAs via a General Letter of Expectation (GLE) from the Ministry. Given that public health services represent only a small part of services provided by HAs, they were not the major focus of the GLE. Once HAs conducted their gap analyses and developed PIPs, these were to be made publically available on each HA's website.

The implementation of this major policy initiative was expected to have a significant impact on public health practice in the province, in part through its embedded KT process.

Few implementation studies have focussed explicitly on developing a qualitative understanding of the experiences of those who are actually involved at the front lines. In this paper, we focus on presenting the perspectives of those responsible for implementation on the ground. Specifically, we explore the collective experiences of HA managers and front line staff with the early implementation of the CF Framework within the STIP and HL exemplar programs in BC. An analysis of the differences between HAs and specific subgroups of participants is beyond the scope of this paper and will be presented in subsequent publications. First, we present a thematic analysis, and then discuss findings in relation to key influences on implementation drawing on Greenhalgh et al.'s framework on the diffusion of innovations in health service organizations [8] . Knowledge about the implementation experience and the challenges encountered by practitioners and managers may help inform improvements in both the policy intervention and the implementation process.

The data used for this paper were obtained during phase one of the larger RePHS project (see Additional file 1 for a description of the overall research project and its methodology). We conducted interviews and focus groups with BC public health practitioners and managers involved in STIP and HL about their early implementation experiences. Consistent with most qualitative research methodologies, we used purposive sampling [22] . A key representative within each HA extended an invitation to participate to managers and front line staff who had experience with planning or delivery of STIP or HL. If interested, representatives contacted the research team directly.

Questions were based on sensitizing concepts from Greenhalgh et al.'s framework as described previously [8] and reviewed for relevance and wording with knowledge user partners. Topics included: knowledge about the CF Framework and STIP/HL implementation, how evidence informed practice, integration of an equity lens into STIP/HL activities, public health governance, leadership, partnerships, and contextual influences on each of these. Interviews lasted approximately 90 minutes. Similar interview guides were used for both interviews and focus groups.

For pragmatic reasons (e.g., HA size and staff workload), as suggested by knowledge user partners, we conducted focus groups with front line staff, and individual interviews with managers. From November 2010 to June 2011, individual interviews (n = 19) and focus groups (n = 8) were conducted with a total of 56 HL and STIP managers and front line staff from four of five regional HAs and the provincial HA. Data collection was conducted in-person (five interviews, six focus groups) or by teleconference (14 interviews, two focus groups) based on HA preference. Ethics approval for the larger project was received from the University of Victoria and each participating HA. A review of interview and focus group data suggest that the data were similar in depth and scope, although individual focus group responses were shorter than interview responses. However, focus group participants built on other participants' responses, resulting in a collective response to each question similar in detail to those of individual interviewees.

Interviews and focus groups were digitally recorded, transcribed verbatim and verified. We conducted a thematic analysis using NVivo 9.0 to manage the data. The team listened repeatedly to audiotapes, and read transcriptions of the interviews and focus groups [23] . We inductively coded the data using the constant comparative method [22, 24] beginning with line-by-line coding, ultimately aggregating codes at higher levels of abstraction. Analysts wrote memos throughout, recording insights and making notes about relationships among the emerging categories, later verifying these in the data. Several coders analyzed the same interviews and developed an initial coding framework to be used by the whole team for coding subsequent interviews. The coding framework evolved as analysis progressed, facilitated by regular team meetings to discuss and agree on emerging themes and resolve discrepancies in coding.

Knowledge users on the research team provided feedback throughout the process which helps to ensure that findings are accurate and credible [25] . The themes described below have been presented to and discussed with HA team members and research participants in several venues.

Four main themes emerged regarding participant experiences with implementation of the CF Framework and the two core programs. The themes were: 'you've told me what, now tell me how'; 'the double bind'; 'but we already do that'; and 'the selling game. ' We discuss each of the themes with illustrative quotations. We applied gender-neutral pseudonyms to quotations to protect confidentiality and edited quotations slightly to enhance readability and meaning (e.g., removal of instances of um and repetitive phrases).

The CF Framework was designed to be a guide, not legislated. The public health renewal process was collaborative involving representatives from government, HAs, and other stakeholders. The government acted in a stewardship role, responsible for overseeing but not directing the process. Because the HAs in BC operate as independent organizations, the vision was that each would implement programs according to their unique governance structures, population needs, and resources. HAs were asked to conduct gap analyses and develop PIPs for each of the core programs, using the evidence reviews and MCPPs. Shifting responsibility for implementation from the provincial to the HA level meant involving more, and different, individuals in the CF process. Some people assisting at this point were not involved in earlier stages of the framework process, yet were now being asked to assess the current state of services and develop new plans. Many claimed not to have a clear understanding of the vision, intent, or meaning of the Framework or the implementation process. Their focus was on completing the gap analysis and PIP without really knowing how these activities fit into the larger vision of the framework. They felt as though they were going through the motions of implementation without understanding why, as reported by this manager:

'I don't know, maybe because in the past I've been involved in doing their [the Ministry's] research and pulling this together and being very specific about why we're doing something. Whereas this way, the papers are already written and you are just sort of relying on what you get. I know this sounds really odd. But if someone else is doing it for you and then you're rolling it out.' (Chris, Manager) This participant is suggesting that there is something inappropriate about practitioners who are not involved in the development of the plan being responsible for rolling out someone else's plan. In such a situation, it is possible that the commitment needed to implement as intended is missing. Without an understanding of the larger vision, more questions than answers arose in determining how to operationalize programs. For example, participants raised questions such as: 'Is my staff responsible for this? What are common indicators across the region and province and shouldn't we be working towards these? How are other HAs doing this? Some of the activities that we do, cross into other core programs, so how do we deal with that? If we can't do everything in the MCPP, where should we focus our attention?' They perceived a lack of guidance in answering their questions. As one participant put it:

' And it just seemed crazy to me that the provincial government was unrolling something without consultation with them [front line staff]. And so they [the staff] have to wait to see what they are doing but how, if they haven't consulted with them. I mean they've never consulted with us to see what they do for obesity prevention in schools and, you know, you just think-who's actually on the ground?' (Charlie, Front-line staff ) Clearly, some staff felt left out of the process despite their belief that they had important contributions to make. Although participants thought a few front line staff may have been involved in the process, there was concern that this was inadequate because of the variety of roles and the inability of one person to reflect accurately the diversity of front line perspectives.

Some participants reported that many people in their organization had never heard of the CF Framework. For example, one participant said, .'…what was interesting, you know, talking about model core programs and people didn't know what I was talking about' (Cameron, Manager). It appeared that the philosophical vision and intents were not adequately communicated throughout the organization, nor were these staff members engaged in a process to develop a shared vision. Thus, the 'how' of implementation became somewhat irrelevant in relation to the vision of the Framework. Instead, they focussed on what they thought they needed to do rather than understanding how or why.

Those working in HAs were asked to implement 21 core programs with few, if any, additional resources to support the endeavour. If additional resources were available, this was not evident to all managers and front line staff. Initially, people felt overwhelmed by the enormity and complexity of the Framework's implementation and struggled to find strategies to make it more manageable. Most HAs responded by clustering core programs into related groups. For example, in one HA, infant and child health was bundled with reproductive health, while HL and healthy communities were clustered with mental health promotion and preventing the harms of substance use. Others clustered programs into age-related groupings. The intent was to reduce the number of programs to a manageable number or to consolidate services provided to specific population groups.

In struggling to comprehend the scale of the public health renewal project, some participants searched for supports and resources to help them. Many stated that public health budgets (and departments) were cut, resulting in job losses, non-replacement of vacant positions, and shrinking programs, rather than the hoped-for expansion and renewal of public health. As one manager noted, it was a challenge implementing core programs in light of organizational cost cutting measures at the same time that other public health crises were emerging:

'But then all these things in the past year and a half have happened that make that process [i.e., implementation] so much harder and make things take so much longer. So instead of, 'it's no problem to get a gap analysis and performance improvement plan done in a year, ' now things can take quite a bit longer. There is just kind of one impact after another. So right after I started there was fiscal restraint because of the economic times we were in, so we had quite a lot of budget cuts so people lost their jobs and we couldn't travel. So that hampers getting teams together when you can't travel and then people are losing their positions that were maybe a lead for a core program or who were a significant personnel on that team and that changes the make-up of your team and the ability to get it done. And then H1N1 happened....' (Casey, Manager) Participants perceived that with budget cuts there was little hope of HAs putting into place an effective implementation strategy and that this magnified the inadequate surge capacity of the system to deal with public health emergencies, such as the H1N1 epidemic. In the face of such crises, other public health programs got put on hold.

Without access to financial and other resources, many did not find administrative support for the CF process, seeing a mismatch between the stated intentions of the Ministry and the means for implementing public health renewal. Being responsible for changes without having the means to enact them put managers in a double bind and left people feeling frustrated and burdened. Many felt that public health, in particular, was being unfairly targeted for budget cuts, as reflected below:

'But I think for me, one of the issues has been the pressure on the limited resources and I'm still not clear why they always pick on the little guy right? And that seems to be, whether people believe that the money is more available [in public health], I don't know why you'd pick on the area that has the least amount of dollars. I can remember when one of my directors, I said to him, 'Instead of just taking little bits from me, why don't you just take the whole program because you're talking about, you know, if we have deficits of a program, this may be 5 or 6 million. Well if you have to cut that much just wipe it out 'cause that's what you're doing on a gradual basis. You're letting us kind of haemorrhage. You may as well take it away."" (Jamie, Manager) Even in places where implementation began well, and the gap analyses and PIPs were completed in a timely fashion, not having adequate resources to see it through hampered the process and demoralized practitioners.

Some sought direction regarding which, if any, of the 21 programs were a priority within the HA, but did not find much guidance. Many respondents suggested that they were unable to determine priorities because these were shifting within government. At the time the CF framework was introduced and people in HAs were awaiting a government announcement on the HL core program, people talked about the negative impacts of the H1N1 pandemic, a provincial election, an economic downturn, and restructuring within HAs. The 'change fatigue' they reported was a significant barrier to implementation. Although work on core functions continued in some HAs, in other cases the implementation of some core programs was put on hold while waiting for guidance about priorities and the necessary resources to carry through with it.

As a consequence, staff in some HAs made their own priority assessments. In the perceived absence of Ministry and HA leadership and funding in support of core functions, they believed that full implementation of the vision of the CF Framework was severely hampered, as implied by this front-line staff member:

'Just in terms of the core functions, we would hope that there's some bite to the actual functions. Like, just putting up policy is not helpful. There needs to be dollars attached to the policy and there needs to be buy in from management. Then it's helpful to us. Then they feel the impetus to give us the information and knowledge translation is improved.' (Reese, Front-line staff)

Although the vision of the framework was to define the core public health functions that HAs should be addressing, as well as to provide relevant evidence and guidelines for what should be included within each core program, to many participants, the framework meant starting from scratch and implementing a new program. The Ministry and steering committee never envisioned that all current programs would cease and new ones begin and yet, that message never filtered down to many of those engaged in gap analyses or program implementation. In talking about this problem, on participant said:

' The information, it hasn't been very clear and it hasn't been big picture, and I think a lot of people have been, need the big picture to get the small picture' (Quinn, Front-line staff ).

Some staff questioned the intent of core functions because to them CF implementation meant that the good work they were already doing was not being acknowledged. For example, one participant noted,.'I would argue that we were already implementing best practices' (Eden, Manager). Although some participants did recognize that the intention was about making sure the gaps were covered and, if necessary, services were enhanced, they did not believe that others understood this, as reflected below:

'I think what was missing was a strong awareness of how core functions is a part of everything that we do in the HAs and how the core functions evidence can be used to support planning and decision-making and how it doesn't have to be a project that's separate from all of the other work. It's actually integrated with all the other work and supporting the other work and vice versa. So that to me was kind of the big thing.' (Sidney, Manager) Many participants did not recognize the connection between their current programming and the intentions of the CF Framework. Repeatedly, we heard participants say that they were already providing the services outlined in the MCPPs without understanding that the intent was never to start from scratch. For example, in reference to STIP, one manager noted:

' And you know, while sitting here and thinking, like, why haven't we focused on this with our core function work that we have done, I think it is because it is a good program already in place. So I think that is probably one of the reasons why STIP probably hasn't made it into any of the implementation plans of core function groups.' (Morgan, Manager)

The theme 'But we already do that' suggests that many participants believed that best practices were already in place and thus could not understand why a new framework or core program was needed. Clearly, the intent of the CF Framework was neither understood by, nor explicitly communicated to, all staff and this led to lack of commitment to the entire process by some staff.

A major challenge to implementation noted by participants was competing HA priorities. When decisions had to be made, some participants said that everything associated with the CF Framework fell to the bottom of the list. This was because they perceived no consequences from the Ministry for non-implementation and that ongoing resources beyond the initial funding were not provided either by the Ministry or the HAs. The political will within the HA to implement the Framework was not always there, as this participant explained:

'So they [HA employees], so they like that [the vision of the CF Framework] in principle.

[They] like, the concept of it, being able to show that we're all in this together. But I think that people recognize that change is political, and the political will wasn't there, you know, in the organization. So there was always scepticism as to whether it would be implemented.' (Pat, Manager).

The process thus became a marketing exercise for those responsible for implementation in which they 'polished the rhetoric' to produce buy-in from others to work on the program, be committed to the process, and move forward despite all of the odds stacked against them. This participant explains her experience:

'It's already kind of a selling game. You have to [tell them], you know, why is this important? Why are we doing this? And yes we are mandated to do the core programs, but why is this actually going to help your work and improve our services to our clients? You kind of have to sell that because everyone is so busy and people are not going to give up another part of their job to do this work. It is an added on part of their work right, so it's making that sell and then we can work on this for six months and not sure where it will go, right?' (Leslie, Manager)

The purpose of the selling game was to generate support in HA areas outside of public health for a policy that did not appear to carry the same political weight as other government or HA initiatives. Participants saw no guarantee that work done now would still be relevant in six months. Thus, getting buy-in in an ever-changing environment was a challenge. For some, it was a matter of selling the work associated with the program. To make it work, however, participants believed that there needed to be strong leadership at all levels in the organization, not only in supporting CF implementation, but also in advocating for the role of public health within the HA. One participant summed this up well:

'I think that the leadership style needs to be collaborative and inclusive and then what I mean by that is reaching out to other programs outside of public health and making the links for them. Like why core programs is important. How it can help support them in the work they are already doing. Why it benefits the populations we serve to be integrating this evidence and these practices into our work. So, it needs to be someone who understands the importance of that and who is willing to make time for that. Cause it's timeconsuming. It's about conversations really, and relationships.' (Jessie, Manager)

Communicating a vision is an important leadership tool for implementation. In some instances, the managers' sales pitch to front line staff may not have included the vision, but instead focused on the gap analysis and the PIP. Without understanding the vision, it was difficult for mid-level managers and front-line staff to understand or buy into the significance of these activities. In other instances, however, there was no sales pitch, so people were left to implement activities without understanding why.

In summary, four themes emerged from the analysis that explained participants' experiences with implementation of the core programs. Although some participants did report positive aspects of the CF process and framework, overall, the introduction and early implementation of the CF Framework was not wholeheartedly embraced by many participants and resulted in what appeared to be a rocky start to the CF process.

The CF Framework was a comprehensive, evidenceinformed, collaborative initiative intended as an embedded KT process to renew public health in BC. Many participants saw value in this framework and acknowledged the importance to public health. Nonetheless, we found that many factors known to impede successful implementation were present at the time the CF Framework was introduced in BC. Without addressing these challenges, the vision for public health renewal in this province may not be realized.

One limitation of our analysis is that it draws only on a subset of data being gathered to study the implementation of this policy intervention. We recognize, however, that implementation is often a long and protracted process and that what influences the adoption and implementation of innovations may change at different points in the process [8] . Additional data gathered during phase two (interviews with senior executives in the HAs) and phase three (follow-up interviews with front line staff and managers) may reveal that influences may change as the implementation process evolves over time.

Greenhalgh et al. argue that 'the success of implementation (and the chances of sustainability) are critically dependent on the attributes of the innovation, the behaviour of individual adopters, the nature of communication and influence, and various structural and sociological features of the organization and its wider environment' [8, p. 176 ]. In our discussion, we focus on our empirically derived findings in relation to these elements of their framework.

The important characteristics of the intervention that appeared to influence early implementation include the intervention source, relative advantage, complexity, and reinvention. Perceptions that an intervention is developed externally, or is seen as centrally driven, can negatively affect implementation success, particularly if there is not a transparent decision-making process or there is limited input from users [16, 26] . Despite HA involvement in developing the CF framework, some participants were not aware of this and did not perceive that there had been sufficient consultation with those responsible for implementation. This appeared to result in a low level of commitment to development and implementation of new practices from the MCPPs. Some perceived the Framework as a directive from above, as reflected in the theme 'you've told me what, now tell me how.'

There must be a relative advantage of an innovation to all stakeholders for successful implementation [8, 9] . Many participants did not see a clear benefit of the CF framework or MCPPs over current practice. In fact, they believed the MCPPs reflected what they were already doing (but we already do that!). The seeming similarity of the MCPPs to what was already going on led some participants to dismiss the MCPPs as redundant. Relative advantage alone, however, is not sufficient for implementation. Innovations often go through a long period of negotiation, meaning-making, contestation and reframing, all of which may influence the perceived advantage of an innovation and thus its adoption and implementation [8] .

Because participants were at the beginning of this protracted process, there are still opportunities for improving implementation over time.

The perceived complexity of an intervention will negatively influence implementation [8] . If the innovation can be reinvented (i.e., adapted or modified) then implementation is more likely to occur [9] . In 'the double bind' many participants felt overwhelmed by the complexity of the CF Framework and managed this by clustering programs to reduce the demands of implementation. Whether this adaptation will improve the success of implementation over the longer term remains to be seen.

Factors in the outer context influencing implementation included: incentives and mandates at the provincial level, and environmental stability. As described in 'the selling game, ' participants identified few incentives in support of implementation. There was no strong mandate or political directive to ensure implementation and evidence suggests that such mandates are most effective when accompanied by a dedicated funding stream [27] . Overall, there was limited accountability for action, no perceived consequences for lack of implementation, and no funding to support implementation. The requirement to post the PIP publically was not tracked by the Ministry and not enforced. Although a requirement for public reporting can motivate compliance with directives in an organization [28] , not if there are adversarial relations between the reporting entity and the organization to which it is responsible [10] . Some participants perceived the relationship between the Ministry and their HA as adversarial.

Environmental stability or uncertainty can influence the implementation process, although the evidence is limited [29, 30] . Changes in the external environment have a much smaller influence than structural characteristics of the organization [29] . Nonetheless, participants talked about instability in the external environment created by significant organizational restructuring in some HAs, shifting policies and priorities of the provincial government, a provincial election that put CF implementation on hold, and the H1N1 pandemic that diverted both the resources and the practice of public health away from CF implementation.

In the inner or organizational context, influences on implementation include: system antecedents for innovation, i.e., structural characteristics of the organization and a receptive context for change; and system readiness for innovation, including tension for change and innovation-system fit. Structural characteristics relate to such things as functional differentiation or internal division of labor, and the centralization versus dispersion of decision making [8, 26] . Devolved decision making in the organization to teams on the ground contributes to successful implementation [30] . In this study, although there were working groups who conducted gap analyses and developed PIPs, they did not necessarily have decision making authority around program implementation. Front line staff, in particular, did not believe they had decision making authority in this regard.

Prior to regionalization in BC in the 1990s, public health units operated independently of the healthcare system at large with strong public health leadership [31] . Public health budgets could never be raided by the acute care system. Currently, public health is subsumed by the regional HAs, each of which structures public health somewhat differently [31] . That structure influences the power and authority of public health leaders, as well as the visibility and priority given to public health functions. For example, in some HAs, there is no public health representation at the senior executive table to bring a public health voice to decision making. Medical health officers in some HAs have no line authority or control of budgets, nor do they make decisions about core program implementation and the deployment of public health staff. Participants perceived that, without this, public health was marginalized and often invisible within the system, and that public health was unfairly targeted for cost cutting measures. This perception was evident in the themes 'you've told me what, now tell me how' and 'the selling game.'

If an organization has a receptive context for change, then it is more likely to embrace new ideas and support the implementation of innovations [8, 32] . Key components of this context include strong leadership and a clear and strategic vision [32, 33] . Many participants perceived a lack of strong public health leadership within the organization. The lack of resources to implement core functions adequately was seen by participants as a concrete reflection of the lack of leadership to advocate for the role of public health, and consequently the low priority of public health in the system. Many participants did not perceive that there was a strategic vision for CF implementation in their HAs. If senior executives did have a strategic vision, it was not well communicated to front line staff and managers.

When practitioners believe they are already engaged in best practices (but we're already doing that!), leadership may be important to push staff 'to break out of the convergent thinking and routines that are the norm in large organizations' [8, p. 13] . It may encourage staff to reflect critically on whether they are truly implementing best practices, or just engaged in business as usual.

Elements of system readiness for innovation included tension for change, innovation-system fit, and relative priority. Tension for change is the extent to which those involved perceive the current situation as intolerable or requiring change [34] . This can be fostered with effective communication strategies that create dissatisfaction with current practice, cultivate commitment, and reduce resistance. A tension for change was not reflected in most participants' experiences and we found no efforts to cultivate tension. In fact, many believed that they were already engaged in practices outlined in the MCPPs (but we already do that!). Furthermore, participants were already experiencing change fatigue with many new initiatives and rapidly shifting priorities, as reflected in the theme 'you've told me what, now tell me how.' Commitment to implementation was hard to muster when people believed that six months down the road another initiative would be announced, requiring yet another change in their work.

There is strong evidence that when there is a good fit between the innovation and organizational values and norms, people are more likely to embrace the innovation [9, 10, 34] . Participants believed that they were already engaged in best practices outlined in the MCPPs, and they saw value and strength in the CF framework. This suggests that there was already a good innovationsystem fit. Clearly, this was not sufficient for participants to embrace wholeheartedly the CF framework. A shared perception of the importance of the intervention's implementation within the organization and its relative priority predicts implementation effectiveness. When staff members perceive that implementation is a key organizational priority, and it is promoted, supported, and rewarded, then a climate in support of implementation is strong [10, 35] . In 'the selling game', participants made it clear that they did not perceive core program implementation as a priority in the organization, relative to competing priorities.

Intra-organizational networks and communications are important influences on successful implementation. Social networks support knowledge circulation in an organization. Support for teamwork is therefore important to facilitate the development of shared meaning, values, and vision in regard to the innovation [8] . This requires stable teams over time. In the theme 'you've told me what, now tell me how, ' it is evident that teams were not stable and that staff changes greatly affected how people understood the intervention and their role within it.

It is possible that effective communication strategies might have mitigated these effects. We know that communication across the organization is essential for effective implementation [36] . In general, staff members need to be well-informed, and to understand the mission and goals of an intervention if implementation is to be successful [8] . It is evident that many participants did not have an understanding of the vision, intent, or meaning of the CF framework or the implementation process. A more consistent and organization-wide communication strategy might have better set the stage for subsequent implementation, perhaps by helping to create tension for change. There is some evidence to support a narrative approach to communication across the organization [37] in which a 'purposive construction of a shared and emergent organizational story of 'what we are doing with this innovation' can serve as a powerful cue to action' [8, p. 15] .

Greenhalgh et al.'s framework identifies the following leadership and management factors as important in enhancing implementation: top management support and advocacy of the implementation process, alignment of the innovation with the goals of top and middle management, and active engagement of leaders in the process. As reflected in 'you've told me what now tell me how', 'the double bind', 'and the selling game', it was clear that many participants did not perceive top management support of, advocacy for, or engagement in the implementation process. Participants suggested that the goals of upper level management in the HAs do not align with the goals of public health or the CF Framework. Some participants believe this is because of public health's marginal position in the larger healthcare system, or because of the lack of a public health voice at the executive table. The minimal emphasis on public health deliverables in the General Letter of Expectation from the Ministry supports this contention. Implementation is enhanced by early and extensive involvement of staff at all levels supported by formal facilitation efforts [8] . These might include, for example, high-quality training materials and on-the-job training [34] . Our data illustrate that there was almost no involvement of front line staff in the CF development process and limited manager involvement. No one mentioned training for implementing HL and STIP programs; perhaps because 'they were already doing that', they did not feel a need for training.

There is limited evidence to support specific KT interventions, but we know that change is more likely when KT and implementation interventions are planned and targeted to specific programs and audiences and are implemented systematically and consistently across the organization [14, 38] . Although some HAs may have used KT strategies to support core program implementation, we could not identify these for HL and STIP. If KT interventions were developed, participants were not aware of them, they were not widespread across the organizations, nor did they appear to be planned and implemented in a systematic and comprehensive way.

The CF Framework was implemented in a complex, dynamic environment that presented significant challenges. It seems that insufficient accountability and inadequate leadership beyond public health prevented many of those responsible for implementation from doing that work and made it difficult to make it a priority. Without adequate resources, the CF Framework was perceived as a low priority, and in a chaotic environment with many competing priorities and decreasing budgets, the CF Framework became marginalized. The lack of consequences for the HAs in not implementing the programs reinforced this. Because there was no senior public health decision maker represented at the executive table in some HAs, it was difficult to promote public health renewal and secure adequate resources when higher priority was accorded to acute care and other institutionally-based health services. There were no implementation plans developed at the health authority level for such a major intervention, resulting in poor communication of the vision and intent of the Framework among staff at or near the front lines. There appeared to be no opportunities for staff and managers to consult on, or participate in developing a shared vision for the CF Framework, thus they did not feel particularly invested in the process.

The lesson to be learned is that implementation is the Achilles heel of innovation. While the Ministry of Health invested significant resources in conducting evidence reviews for all the core public health programs, they did not synthesize the evidence on factors influencing effective implementation of a complex policy intervention like the CF Framework. Unfortunately, available implementation frameworks [8, 14, [16] [17] [18] are rarely used prospectively to plan for implementation [16, 18] . Rather, they are used primarily as we have used Greenhalgh et al.'s framework-retrospectively to analyze the influences on implementation.

Our main recommendation is that the implementation of any intervention requires a well developed implementation plan, guided by a comprehensive implementation framework to identify and address potential barriers and facilitators for the process. This includes involvement of staff that will be responsible for implementation in the process. Evaluation is essential to determine whether the prospective use of an implementation framework will influence successful implementation. There must be an investment of sufficient resources, not just for the activities of the intervention, but also to support the implementation process. The return on this investment is likely to be substantial.

A systematic review and evaluation of Zika virus forecasting and prediction research during a public health emergency of international concern,PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases | https://doi.org/10.,"Epidemic forecasting and prediction tools have the potential to provide actionable information in the midst of emerging epidemics. While numerous predictive studies were published during the 2016-2017 Zika Virus (ZIKV) pandemic, it remains unknown how timely, reproducible, and actionable the information produced by these studies was.

To improve the functional use of mathematical modeling in support of future infectious disease outbreaks, we conducted a systematic review of all ZIKV prediction studies published during the recent ZIKV pandemic using the PRISMA guidelines. Using MEDLINE, EMBASE, and grey literature review, we identified studies that forecasted, predicted, or simulated ecological or epidemiological phenomena related to the Zika pandemic that were published as of March 01, 2017. Eligible studies underwent evaluation of objectives, data sources, methods, timeliness, reproducibility, accessibility, and clarity by independent reviewers. a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111

Zika virus (ZIKV) is a positive-sense RNA flavivirus primarily transmitted through the Aedes aegypti mosquito [1] [2] [3] . While the majority of ZIKV infections are asymptomatic or present as a self-limiting febrile illness, strong evidence links ZIKV infection with microcephaly and a range of other birth defects, including limb deformity and retinopathy [4, 5] . ZIKV is also associated with Guillian-Barré syndrome, and a spectrum of other neurological disorders including meningoencephalitis and acute myelitis [6] [7] [8] [9] . ZIKV was discovered in Uganda in a febrile non-human primate in 1947 [10] , and the first human case was detected in Nigeria in 1953 [11] . ZIKV outbreaks were detected in Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands in the early 21 st century [12-16] followed by wide spread epidemics in the Americas from late 2014 onward, with a cumulative count of 583,144 suspected and 223,336 laboratory-confirmed Zika cases reported across 49 countries and territories by the end of 2017 [17, 18] .

The Director-General of the World Health Organization declared the ZIKV pandemic a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) on February 1, 2016 [19] . The urgency for immediate coordinated global response was further accelerated by the Olympic and Paralympic games set to take place in Rio De Janeiro, Brazil during August 2016 [20] . As public health and medical research efforts for Zika increased across the Americas, scientists developed mathematical models to anticipate further outbreak spread, evaluate possible control measures, and gain insight into outbreak dynamics. These models used a range of data sources including case counts, relative vector abundance and distribution, population age structure, human mobility, climate information, viral sequence and serological data, and internet 'big data' streams. A range of statistical and mathematical models predicted the spread and other epidemic dynamics of ZIKV, as well as the burden of its complications [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] .

While the WHO PHEIC status was lifted in November 2016 and the neotropical Zika pandemic has waned, the forecasting activities during the pandemic have not been systematically examined, particularly whether the studies were published in a manner and time-frame that was actionable during the Zika pandemic [27] . Such an exercise is critical, not only due to the ongoing risk of Zika globally [28] , but also to inform modeling efforts for future major epidemics. We therefore undertook a systematic review to identify all published ZIKV prediction and forecasting studies during a time period which encompassed the PHEIC period and the peak and waning phase of the epidemic in the Americas. The first aim of this systematic review was to identify all published models that predicted, forecasted, or simulated any ecological or epidemiological phenomenon about the Zika pandemic and describe the predicted phenomena, the range of data sources used, and the modeling methods employed. This first aim sought to characterize the methods and data employed to answer key questions during the epidemic and to identify potentially underutilized data or methods. The second aim was to evaluate key scientific characteristics of these studies, including (i) accessibility and timeliness of the publication, (ii) reproducibility of the methods and access to the statistical code and data, and (iii) clarity of the presentation of the prediction results, including uncertainty in prediction estimates. The third aim was to describe the funding structure and major contributing sectors, such as government, industry, non-governmental organizations, or academia, behind these publications.

The PRISMA and Cochrane systematic review guidelines were adopted [29] . A panel of 12 investigators developed the systematic review protocol including the eligibility criteria and the data abstraction tool. No formal protocol was published for this systematic review.

We conducted a literature review using EMBASE and MEDLINE (PubMed) to identify all potentially eligible studies, which predicted or forecasted phenomena of the ZIKV pandemic.

In MEDLINE we performed a highly sensitive search solely using the term ""Zika."" A complementary search in EMBASE used a more specific ontology: ""Zika AND (forecasting OR prediction OR model OR modeling OR modelling OR risk OR estimating OR dynamics) NOT mouse."" Both database searches were limited to articles published as of March 1, 2017, and the MEDLINE searches were restricted to publications released between February 1, 2016 and March 1, 2017. We used this end date to capture those models published during a time-frame of major operational relevance (that is, during the early, peak, and waning phase of the Americas epidemic). We complemented these database search results with 'grey literature,' including hand-searched bibliographies of major Zika epidemiological review articles [17, 30, 31] and contacting experts in the field of Zika modeling to identify any studies which may have been missed by the above search strategies.

Using a two-reviewer system (with consensus for disagreements and conferral with a 3 rd party adjudicator if a consensus was unable to be reached), all articles identified through the above literature search were screened by reviewing the title and abstract to remove all articles that clearly did not meet the eligibility criteria (below). The full text of the remaining articles was reviewed by two reviewers, with a third reviewer if a consensus was not reached by the first two reviewers. Eligibility was based on the following inclusion and exclusion criteria:

We included studies that forecasted, predicted, or simulated any epidemiological or ecological phenomena about the Zika pandemic (including studies regarding previous outbreaks and epidemics, and regions outside the Americas), including but not limited to spatial spread risk, host and ecological range, disease and complication burden, economic impact transmission, and other epidemic dynamics. We didn't require studies to explicitly present a future phenomenon risk, and we included time agnostic estimations of key epidemic parameters (for instance R 0 ) and other phenomena.

• Did not include original analyses (e.g. review articles, perspective pieces, editorials, recommendations, and guidelines)

• Duplicated studies

• Animal and mosquito in-vivo pre-clinical models (e.g mouse, non-human primates)

• In vitro studies • Descriptive epidemiological publications (e.g. describing case positive proportions, total case numbers, descriptive mapping of incidence by geographic information systems)

• positive proportions, total case numbers, descriptive mapping of • incidence by geographic information systems)

• Models which only examined causality of ZIKV in Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS) or microcephaly (rather than estimating risk or burden, for example)

• Studies which only modeled non-ZIKV arboviruses, unless the central aim of the study was to explicitly forecast or predict ZIKV phenomena based on the known dynamics of other arboviruses

Data were abstracted from the full texts by 12 reviewers (single-reviewer abstraction) across the domains of (i) objectives and study population, (ii) methodology and reproducibility, (iii) accessibility, timeliness, and other bibliometrics of eligible studies, and (iv) author affiliation and funding sources (S1 Table) . In addition, the availability of preprint manuscripts was assessed using the pre-print search webtool search.bioPreprint [32], a server which identifies preprints from arXiv, bioRxiv, F1000Research, PeerJ Preprints, and Wellcome Open Research. Additionally, we manually searched arXiv and bioRxiv archives to confirm pre-print availability. These pre-print repositories are distinct from the advanced electronic publications made available by most journals after acceptance and peer review. Such 'grey literature' review extended beyond the cut-off date for the main literature database searches. A two-reviewer approach was used to ascertain whether eligible studies were made available as pre-print. From the abstracted data, descriptive analyses (medians, IQR, ranges, and proportions), and limited hypothesis testing were performed using Stata version 13.0 (StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA).

Of 2034 studies identified, 73 articles published predominantly from 2016 to 2017 met the inclusion criteria (Fig 1) [20-26, 28, 33-97]. The most commonly predicted phenomena were spatial spread (34%), followed by R 0 (basic reproductive number) or R E (effective reproductive number) (29%), epidemic dynamics (peak size/timing, final size and trajectory) (28%), microcephaly burden (15%), and vector competence and ecology (12%) ( Only 40% of studies made all relevant source data entirely accessible, while more than 20% of the eligible studies did not make any source data available either directly (e.g. an associated data repository) or indirectly (e.g. a citation or web-link) ( Table 2 ). The visual display of model output was at least partly clear and accurate in 95% of the studies. Over a third of the studies did not present estimates of prediction uncertainty. Approximately half of the studies did not entirely present methods with a level of detail to allow reproducibility. Over 60% of the studies did not provide any computational code used for the analyses. We classified more models as deterministic (76%) as opposed to stochastic. It should be emphasized we only ultimately evaluated whether a model was deterministic versus stochastic.

The large majority of published manuscripts were freely accessible (e.g. without a paywall), although 4% were published with paid access only (Table 3) . Less than one third of manuscripts were posted on rapid preprint servers (e.g. bioRxiv) [99], prior to publication in a peer-reviewed journal. The median time from journal submission to e-journal publication was 93.5 days, with the maximum time greater than 1 year. This included delays after manuscript acceptance, 25% of the studies had delays of more than 24 days between acceptance and publication ( Table 3 ). Most of the prediction studies were published late in the epidemic, well after the peaks in reported Zika cases (Fig 2, Fig 3) . Submitting manuscripts to preprint servers made results available earlier by a median of 119 days (maximum 331 days, IQR 30-177 days) (Table 3 ). This shift led to more results being available close to the time of the 2016 South America and Central America epidemic peaks and prior to the epidemic peak in the Caribbean and the 2017 peak in Central America (Fig 2, Fig 3) . Comparing the impact factor of journals accepting studies which were posted as preprints (versus the impact factor of those journals accepting studies which were not posted as pre-prints), there was no significant difference (median impact factor 4.37 vs. 4.45 respectively; p = 0.84 by Mann-Whitney U test).

Over 90% of the studies included authors with academic affiliations (Table 4) . Government affiliated authors participated in a minority of studies, although this may simply reflect ""inhouse"" operational models not being published through journals. Among studies with identifiable funding sources, funding was divided among several sources, though the most common was the United States government, which funded or partially funded 50% of the studies (Table 4 ). However, many of those studies and others had a variety of funding sources, 85% had at least one non-U.S. government source. Non-governmental organizations were the second most common source, being included in 35% of the studies.

Public health agencies, policy-makers, and other stakeholders are carefully examining the response to Zika. Such 'lessons-learned' exercises have been fruitful for prior pandemics and outbreaks, including Ebola, SARS, MERS-CoV, pH1N1, and chikungunya viruses. These exercises have included introspection, analysis, and recommended action with respect to research, public health, and policy agendas [100] [101] [102] [103] [104] [105] . To date, public health 'lessons-learned' activities related to the Zika PHEIC have focused on improved ethics preparedness for rapid research during public health emergencies [106] , identification of other high-epidemic-risk pathogens with relatively inadequate countermeasure investment [107] , expedited approaches to vaccine and other medical countermeasure development [108] , rapid data-sharing and material transfer [109] [110] [111] , and enhancing the role of media communication during epidemics [112] . In contrast to existing reviews on models developed during the ZIKV pandemic, which described specific contributions of modeling [113] or validated analytical assessment of results [114] , this systematic review focused on capturing lessons that could improve the functional use of mathematical modeling in support of future infectious disease outbreaks. Extending an approach used by Chretien et al. in their evaluation of Ebola models, we focused on aspects of the studies that likely are particularly relevant to their usefulness during an outbreak [104] . This included modeling methods and input data, timeliness and accessibility of the publications, reproducibility (e.g. provision of data and code), and the communication of uncertainty.

Our systematic review identified a large number of Zika models that predicted a wide range of epidemiological and ecological phenomena. The most commonly predicted phenomena were spatial spread, R 0 , epidemic dynamics, microcephaly burden, and vector competence. Notably few of the studies modeled the impact or cost-effectiveness of interventions, sexual transmission risk, or GBS burden. Not surprisingly, the majority of the studies were set in the Americas where most of the cases were reported during the pandemic. Notably one of the global gaps for understanding ZIKV dynamics is Africa, where ZIKV was discovered, is endemic, and poses a risk of future epidemics [115] [116] [117] .

The leading data types for the examined studies were conventional case counts, vector, demographic, climate, and transport data. This finding reflects not only the availability but also the importance of such data. Case count data in particular are often hard to access but critical to many modeling approaches. Rapid sharing of case count data during international public health emergencies, as well as open, curated, rapidly accessible baseline demographic, human mobility, climate, and environmental datasets are essential to quickly leverage modeling and forecasting efforts [110] . Our review also identified several relatively underused data streams. First, socioeconomic and behavioral data were conspicuously absent. The lack of behavioral components in these models is concerning given the importance of these factors on disease dynamics [118] . Second, real-time internet-based data-streams, such as social media and internet search engine data, were used in a minority of ZIKV prediction studies identified in this systematic review. The limited use of internet 'big data' in the models suggests that either these data are of lower value for epidemic forecasting or that methods have yet to be developed to efficiently extract important information from them. Such data streams may be more commonly used in forecasting in the future as their strengths and weakness become clearer [119] . Genomic data were absent from these published models. During the pandemic, sequencing platforms were employed to generate data critical to diagnostic and countermeasure development [120] , but our systematic review revealed that these data were not incorporated into prediction frameworks during the first year of ZIKV pandemic. This may reflect that early molecular epidemiology studies aimed to reconstruct the invasion and evolution of ZIKV rather than forecasting future changes [121, 122] . Some phylodynamic studies were published after the time period of the systematic review, with interesting results highlighting the possibility for phylogenetic data to provide unique insight into epidemic dynamics and possibly forecasting [122] [123] [124] . The relative delay of these studies (relative to those using other data sources) echoes a similar time lag of phylogenetic studies during the 2015 Ebola epidemic [104] . The lack of phylogenomic studies captured by this review also suggests that substantial bottlenecks still exist in using these data sources in epidemic response, despite advances in mobile near ""real-time"" sequencing technologies [120] . In the future, as new methods are developed, and genomic data become more readily available, the use of these data will likely become more common in prospective forecasting frameworks.

Our systematic review did not delve deeply into modeling approaches, but did identify a preponderance of deterministic as opposed to stochastic models. Both categories of models have pros and cons and their use is often informed by the specific question being addressed, in addition to data availability [125] . Deterministic models may generally be easier to produce, but they may have limitations for intrinsically stochastic processes like epidemics, such as underestimating uncertainty, although deterministic models can also be implemented to estimate uncertainty [126] . Uncertainty is particularly important in this context where uncertainties are generated by the epidemic itself, data collection, and analytical approaches. Moreover, forecasts are ideally used to inform the mobilization of resources to save lives, a context in which clearly characterizing uncertainties is paramount. This is also a clear area for improvement in model output reporting; only 43% of studies entirely reported estimates of uncertainty. However, studies which did not present, say a credible interval around a forecasted phenomenon, may still have incorporated uncertainty in other ways which were not captured by the data abstraction tool, for instance a scenario analysis or incorporating uncertainty around parameters in a deterministic model.

Our review also provided a unique evaluation of the more functional aspects of published predictions and forecasts. We determined that the visual clarity of model output was high but indicates room for improvement in publishing datasets used for model fitting and validation, and methodological detail to allow the study to be reproduced.

Our results also identified the need for improved sharing of computational code to permit full result reproducibility. Shared model code could also be adapted by other researchers during time-sensitive epidemics. An important caveat here is that appropriate expertise and rigorous validation should be exercised before the use of model code developed by others, in the same fashion as other biomedical research fields which frequently disseminate code-based research tools in their publications (for instance, pathogen genomics and bioinformatics).

The variable quality in sharing model code and methodological detail shown here does suggest that epidemic model reporting consensus guidelines, which establish a minimum standard for the reporting of epidemic modeling, may be valuable. A recent review of the modeling efforts for the Ebola epidemic also called for standardization of modeling practice [104] . Many other fields of biomedical research have established reporting guidelines to improve research quality and implementation [127] [128] [129] [130] . While reporting guidelines have been proposed for population health modeling on a broader scale [131] , none have been established for epidemics. This review also indicated that a majority of studies (60%) did not completely disclose the data they used. To the extent permissible with ethical and privacy constraints, publishing the aggregated data used to fit and validate models is critical. Not only would sharing data support full reproducibility, but sharing would also enable other researchers to use data in their own complementary modeling efforts. Modelers could therefore help answer calls for increased data sharing during public health emergencies [104, 110, 132] . Exploring how data can be shared more openly and quickly during a public health emergency would be useful, as this remains a challenge.

Many studies identified in this review were published on a time-scale that was relevant to the Zika response. However, a large number of predictions were published well after the epidemic peaks, limiting their ability to inform the response. Nonetheless, those studies may well be used to inform other preparedness activities and contributed to the general knowledge of the biology, epidemiology and/or ecology of ZIKV. Further, results may have been informally shared with public health officials or other relevant decision makers prior to publication. Similar delays to publication have also been noted in an analysis of modeling efforts during the 2015 Ebola epidemic, which noted a median publication lag of around three months [103] .

We identified two modifiable bottlenecks in the dissemination of results. First, delays from acceptance to journal publication were generally minimal (median 15 days), but a quarter of the evaluated studies had greater than 24 days delay from journal acceptance to publication. Immediate posting of accepted papers, as practiced by many journals, could cut this time down substantially. Second, we found that only 30% of studies were made available as preprints prior to peer review despite endorsements of preprints by major public agencies, funders, and journals. Those posted were available a median of 119 days prior to peer-reviewed publication. An analysis of preprints for all Zika publications over a similar time period found similar publication delays but much lower overall preprint use compared to the studies analyzed here (3.4% versus 30%) [133] . This greater adoption may indicate a changing preprint culture which was also reflected by our finding that preprint posting did not have a demonstrable effect on the impact factor of the journal in which the study was published, and we suggest that pre-prints be more frequently used in future public health emergencies, echoing other similar recent arguments [133] .

Our review also provided a unique analysis of the funding sources and author affiliations of the published ZIKV prediction and forecast efforts across the ZIKV pandemic. These results indicated a range of stakeholders, and a diverse source of funding streams, including NGOs. We note that while academia contributed to the greatest volume of published studies, our search strategy would not have captured in-house models developed by US federal agencies or other unpublished models which may have provided direct operational support. Our data also suggested that the Government sector was the leading funder of all Zika prediction and forecasting studies during this period. Despite being a major stakeholder in ZIKV forecasts (e.g. prediction of whether it may have been feasible to plan a Phase III vaccine study in Latin America), we did not find evidence of pharmaceutical industry funded forecasting studies, although our search would not have identified unpublished models.

This systematic review has three important weaknesses. First, due to scale, a completely independent two-reviewer system was not used for abstracting most of the data and for evaluation of aspects such as reproducibility. Second, we did not formally search for preprint manuscripts as part of the literature searching phase of the systematic review, only assessing whether eligible manuscripts had corresponding preprints. We may have therefore missed important research that had been posted but not yet peer-reviewed. Lastly, we had to restrict the time frame for publications to consider in the review. This restriction again led to missing studies, some of which may have already been published but not yet posted in EMBASE or MEDLINE. An additional challenge with our systematic review was that we did not provide a specific definition of ""forecasting"" and ""prediction"" to reviewers (to avoid an overly strict eligibility criteria). This led to collection of data on phenomena such as R 0, which is an estimate as opposed to a forecast or prediction that could be potentially validated with data.

Overall, the review identified several areas of improvement such as providing data and code, developing reporting standards, posting preprints, and communicating uncertainty. Addressing these areas can improve our understanding of Zika and other outbreaks and ensure that forecasts can inform preparedness and response to future outbreaks, epidemics, and pandemics.

Reporting ethics committee approval and patient consent by study design in five general medical journals,"Background: Authors are required to describe in their manuscripts ethical approval from an appropriate committee and how consent was obtained from participants when research involves human participants. Objective: To assess the reporting of these protections for several study designs in general medical journals. Design: A consecutive series of research papers published in the Annals of Internal Medicine, BMJ, JAMA, Lancet and The New England Journal of Medicine between February and May 2003 were reviewed for the reporting of ethical approval and patient consent. Ethical approval, name of approving committee, type of consent, data source and whether the study used data collected as part of a study reported elsewhere were recorded. Differences in failure to report approval and consent by study design, journal and vulnerable study population were evaluated using multivariable logistic regression. Results: Ethical approval and consent were not mentioned in 31% and 47% of manuscripts, respectively. 88 (27%) papers failed to report both approval and consent. Failure to mention ethical approval or consent was significantly more likely in all study designs (except case-control and qualitative studies) than in randomised controlled trials (RCTs). Failure to mention approval was most common in the BMJ and was significantly more likely than in The New England Journal of Medicine. Failure to mention consent was most common in the BMJ and was significantly more likely than in all other journals. No significant differences in approval or consent were found when comparing studies of vulnerable and non-vulnerable participants. Conclusion: The reporting of ethical approval and consent in RCTs has improved, but journals are less good at reporting this information for other study designs. Journals should publish this information for all research on human participants.","R esearch on human participants, which includes identifiable human material or identifiable data, requires ethical protection. According to the Declaration of Helsinki issued by the World Medical Association, 1 research on human participants should be clearly formulated in experimental protocols and these should be submitted to independent ethical review boards (ethics committees and institutional review boards) for approval. Additionally, every potential participant should be informed about the ''aims, methods, sources of funding, any possible conflicts of interest, institutional affiliations of the researcher, the anticipated benefits and potential risks of the study and the discomfort it may entail'' and should give consent to participate.

In the UK, the Central Office for Research Ethics Committees (COREC) (http://www.corec.org.uk) has stated that ethical advice from the appropriate National Health Service research ethics committee is required for any research proposal on any of the aspects listed in box 1.

Journal editors have an important gate-keeping role to check that research submitted and published in their journals conform to these regulations. According to the Declaration of Helsinki, publishers have the obligation to reject research reports that are not in accordance with the guidelines. 1 Numerous biomedical journals have joined the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors, which has developed guidelines on ethical principles related to publication. 2 These guidelines explicitly require that …when reporting experiments on human participants, authors should indicate whether the procedures followed were in accordance with the ethical standards of the responsible committee on human experimentation (institutional and national) and with the Helsinki Declaration of 1975, as revised in 2000.

Previous studies assessing the extent to which journals adhere to the suggested guidelines have generally found poor compliance, but there have been improvements over time (table 1) . [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] These studies have largely focused on reporting of ethical protection either exclusively in clinical trials or in single specialties or patient populations. It is, however, important and indeed a requirement of most biomedical journals, that authors of all investigations on human participants state whether the study was approved by an ethics committee and how consent was obtained. Following on from the work of Ruiz-Canela et al 6 and Yank and Rennie, 10 we assessed the reporting of ethical approval and patient consent in five top general medical journals in 2003, by study design. All of these journals have signed up to the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors requirements for ethical protection and explicitly state in their guidance to authors that both ethical approval and consent should be reported.

A consecutive series of original research papers published in five general medical journals were reviewed for the reporting of ethics committee approval and patient consent. The 

An electronic version of each paper was obtained and the study design identified and assessed for eligibility in the study. Papers in which ethics committee approval and informed consent were not considered to be necessary by the study investigators were excluded. These included the following types of articles: review articles, systematic reviews, meta-analyses, ecological studies, papers describing outbreak analysis (eg, papers on severe acute respiratory syndrome), secondary analysis of published data, laboratory-based studies not using patients or patient material, and clinical audit or quality improvement.

The paper was then read in detail and the information in box 2 was extracted and recorded for each eligible paper. Papers were categorised as one of eight study designs (box 3).

Papers describing more than one study design were defined according to the type of study that was the main focus of the paper. Follow-up papers were categorised according to their original study design-for example, analysis of 5-year followup data on a large randomised controlled trial (RCT) would be categorised as an RCT. Vulnerable populations were defined using the definitions previously described by Yank and Rennie 10 and the General Medical Council 13 -that is, children, frail elderly people, pregnant women, adults who lacked decision-making capacity (eg, those with severe dementia, prisoners, patients with HIV infection, an intensive care unit level of disability, psychiatric disease or genetic risks or disease).

To test the validity of the data extraction, data were extracted by two independent researchers for a sample of n = 260 and the level of agreement was assessed using the k statistic. We present the data extracted by the primary N Whether the ethics committee or IRB was named N How the authors obtained consent researcher (RP). Papers failing to report both protections were further reviewed to see if they had common characteristics-for example, type of study, characteristics of population under study and publishing journal.

We used multivariable logistic regression to examine differences in failure to mention study approval and failure to mention consent. The independent variables were the study design, the journal and whether the study included a vulnerable population. We tested for an overall difference between study designs and between journals by using likelihood ratio tests. We report odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals using randomised controlled trials and the BMJ as the reference categories for study design and journal, respectively.

In the study period, 370 research papers that met the inclusion criteria were published across the five journals. We found high inter-rater agreement for whether ethical approval and consent were mentioned (k = 95.5 and 92.6, raw agreement 98.5% and 96.9%, n = 260).

Overall, ethical approval was not mentioned in 31% (104/ 333) of the articles ( Reporting of neither protection 27% (88/321) of the papers failed to report either approval or consent, of which less than half (44%) referred to another article where these details may be found (table 2) . All of the RCTs and qualitative studies that did not report either protection provided a reference to another article. 83% (10/12) of the papers published in JAMA that did not report either protection provided a reference to another study, but the other journals did so less often.

Of the studies not mentioning either protection and not providing a reference to another article, 98% (48/49) articles were reporting on the collection of new data (ie, not just using data reported elsewhere) and in 25% (12/49) this included collecting data directly from the patient, mostly in cross-sectional studies (9/12, 75%; table 3). 39% (19/49) of the papers described studies on vulnerable patients.

Authors used a range of phrases to indicate how consent was obtained. Most studies (63%, 119/189) reported that ''written informed consent'' was obtained from participants (table 4) . ''Informed consent was given'' was the next most frequently reported statement (18%, 34/189).

We found that overall ethical approval and consent in the ''top'' general medical journals is better reported than previously observed. 10 We found that both protections were better reported in papers describing RCTs than those describing other study designs and this pattern was consistent across the journals. Bauchner and Sharfstein 9 also found that the reporting of ethical approval was better in RCTs than in other study designs in a review of papers on child health published in American journals.

N Randomised controlled trial: A study in which participants are recruited and randomly assigned to groups to receive (study group) or not receive (control group) an intervention N Case-control: A study of people with the disease (or other outcome variable) of interest and a suitable control group of people without the disease N Cohort study: A study in which patients who presently have a certain condition or receive a particular treatment are recruited and followed over time and compared with another group who are not affected by the condition under investigation or did not receive the treatment *Excluding all case reports, case series and analysis of routine data in which we would not expect both protections to be reported. ÀThe paper was reporting a new study and not just reporting further information on a previously reported study. Some data were collected directly from the patient. 1Vulnerable population included children, elderly people, pregnant women, adults who lacked decision-making capacity-that is, prisoners, patients with HIV infection, an intensive care unit level of disability, psychiatric disease or genetic risks or disease.

It is important for information about ethical protection to be readily available for the reader and this information should be documented for all research on human participants. This study provides further evidence of the need for stronger direction on ethical issues in publication. Researchers may be more likely to attach importance to ethical considerations if the institutions they deal with value ethical behaviour. Such institutions, including journals, have a role in providing an environment that emphasises the importance of ethical behaviour in research. Journal editors are gate keepers for the integrity of the scientific record. They should try to enforce requirements for authors to meet ethical standards and, as stated in the Declaration of Helsinki, reject research not meeting these requirements. By upholding high standards and explaining to readers and researchers the importance of ethical protection, editors can show researchers that they attach importance to these issues and will publish only those papers that take them into consideration. Although many journals, including those in this study, now provide guidance on including information on ethical approval and obtaining consent in their instructions to authors, many do not enforce these requirements effectively. Journal editors should introduce effective mechanisms to ensure that this information is reported for all research on human participants. Ethics committees and granting bodies can also play a part in improving the standards of reporting by requiring the inclusion of a statement about ethical approval and consent in all publications arising from projects they approve and fund.

Journals are increasingly using the web for additional material and informative statements about ethical protection would be a good use of this space. Brief statements or symbols could be used in the printed journal. Making it clear to the reader (which may include the patients and their relatives) that consent was appropriately obtained has its advantages. A published statement can acknowledge that the patient participated in the whole process. Authors use a range of statements to indicate that consent was obtained from patients. More precise use of language would help the reader understand whether the patient simply agreed to participate in the study or gave fully informed consent.

This study is the most recent in a series looking at the reporting of ethical protection in published papers in biomedical journals. Its strengths are that it reviews papers recently reported and it does not focus purely on one study design, medical specialty or patient population and is large enough to evaluate differences between journals.

With RCTs as the reference category for study design, a sample of 80 in a comparison category provided 80% power to detect a twofold difference (20% and 40% failure) at twosided a = 0.05. For the BMJ as the reference category for journals, a sample of 70 in a comparison category provided 71% power to detect a similar difference. Some caution is needed in interpreting the statistically non-significant findings for case-control and qualitative studies because of the small sample sizes and the wide 95% CIs.

Previous studies largely excluded case reports and case series, but we included these because although formal ethical approval may not be appropriate, it is important that the patient has given consent to take part in the research and to document that ethical issues have been considered. Clearly, case studies differ from other research study designs and the practice of reporting ethical protection may be different for each journal. The BMJ, for example, routinely checks that the patient has consented but rarely reports this information owing to limited editorial space in the print journal. Arguably, it may be more important to ask and declare consent for case reports and case series as patients with rare conditions can be easily identified by readers.

As with the earlier studies, the validity of the data may have been affected in several ways. Authors reporting additional analysis of a previously reported study often made reference to another paper, implying that details about methods and ethical protection may be reported there. Although we recorded whether authors made reference to another paper, we did not follow up and check whether that paper contained all the necessary information. It is important to make statements in every paper to help avoid publishing unethical research. 9 It is also possible that authors may have submitted this information to the journal, but that owing to word restrictions this information was omitted during the publishing process. Where this information was not reported, this does not mean that the journal did not check with the authors that they had obtained approval and consent.

The generalisability of the findings are limited as we included only the five top general medical journals, which often take the lead in setting editorial policies. These journals may also be better resourced than smaller more specialised journals and thus more able to check for the reporting of ethical protection. Thus, the failure to report ethical protection may be greater outside the journals in this study, although some specialties will be more sensitive to this issue than others.

The reporting of ethical protection in major general medical journals has improved in recent years. If we accept that All participants gave written consent 6 (3) 6 (7) 0 (0) 0 (0) 0 (0) 0 (0) 0 (0) 0 (0) Informed oral consent given 5 (3) 1 (1) 0 (0) 1 (3) 1 (3) 0 (0) 0 (0) 2 (40) Oral consent given 2 (1) 0 (0) 0 (0) 1 (3) 1 (3) 0 (0) 0 (0) 0 (0) Informed consent given 34 (18) 9 (10) 4 (24) 10 (27) 9 (24) 0 (0) 1 (50) 1 (20) Consent given 12 (6) 5 (6) 1 (6) 4 (11) 2 (5) 0 (0) 0 (0) 0 (0) Investigators received approval from their institutional review boards to use deferred consent 8 (4) 3 (3) 1 (6) 2 (5) 2 (5) 0 (0) 0 (0) 0 (0) Consent not needed 3 (2) 1 (1) 1 (6) 0 (0) 0 (0) 0 (0) 0 (0) 1 (20)

Values are n (%). RCT, randomised controlled trial. *Excludes studies reporting the analysis of routine data (n = 12) where consent was not considered necessary.

authors who made reference to another paper provided appropriate information about ethical protection in these, then the picture is a positive one. Further research should be conducted to determine whether these manuscripts do contain sufficient information about ethical protection. Details about ethical protection are sometimes not reported in print journals because of space constraints, but there is no reason why this information cannot be reported on the web for all study designs, including case studies, and a brief statement in the printed journal. We would also encourage a more standardised approach to the language used to describe how consent was obtained.

China's position in negotiating the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control and the revised International Health Regulations,"IHR FCTC Negotiations a b s t r a c t This paper examines China's position in the negotiations of the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control and the revised International Health Regulations. In particular, it explores three sets of factors shaping China's attitudes and actions in the negotiations: the aspiration to be a responsible power; concerns about sovereignty; and domestic political economy. In both cases, China demonstrated strong incentives to participate in the negotiation of legally binding international rules. Still, the sovereignty issue was a major, if not the biggest, concern for China when engaging in global health rule making. The two cases also reveal domestic political economy as an important factor in shaping China's position in international health negotiations.","Global health governance relies on formal and informal rules, norms, and processes to address transnational health challenges. While there has been a dramatic increase in the number and variety of global health agreements in the past decade, only two have established new and formal binding rules in global health governance: the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC) in 2003 and the revised International Health Regulations (IHR) in 2005. 1 The FCTC is the first use of the World Health Organization's (WHO) constitutional treaty-making power to negotiate a legally binding international convention, and it has helped to create an unprecedented, worldwide tobacco control movement. Likewise, the revised IHR establish rules and processes that enable the WHO and its member states to identify and respond to international public health emergencies more effectively.

Due to the critical role China has played in the dynamics of health, development, and security, its participation was essential to successfully negotiating major international health agreements. China is the world's largest tobacco producer and has the world's largest smoking population. With 1.2 million people dying from smoking annually, China is also the country worst affected by tobacco use. 2 In addition, China plays a crucial role in global health security: many major disease outbreaks that had significant epidemiological, economic and political implications worldwide have originated in China. Indeed, it was the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003 that highlighted the need for a new international legal framework for infectious disease control.

This paper examines China's position in the negotiations of the FCTC and the revised IHR. By drawing upon existing literature and key informant interviews, 3 it explores three factors that shaped China's attitudes and actions in negotiations: the aspiration to be a responsible power, concerns about sovereignty, and domestic political economy.

Available online at www.sciencedirect.com Public Health jo urn al ho mep age : www .e lse vi er.co m/ pu he p u b l i c h e a l t h 1 2 8 ( 2 0 1 4 ) 1 6 1 e1 6 6 Negotiating the FCTC The idea of having a framework convention protocol for tobacco control originated from a group of academics and antitobacco activists, but it did not gain momentum until it received strong support from the newly elected WHO Director-General Gro Harlem Brundtland in 1998. In May 1999, the World Health Assemblydthe governing body of the WHOdunanimously passed WHA52.18, a resolution to establish an intergovernmental negotiating body (INB) to draft and negotiate a framework convention on tobacco control and a working group composed of WHO Member States to undertake preparatory work for the INB.

From the very beginning, China had been ambivalent towards the negotiation of a multilateral treaty limiting tobacco use. Starting in the 1990s, China aimed to redefine its place in the international system; it now wished to be viewed not as a rule breaker or a challenger, but as an internationally responsible power that actively engages in international affairs, even though moving in this direction entailed acceptance of more restraints on its sovereignty. 4 Driven by the new sense of accountability and commitment, many Chinese officials and scholars supported the 'sacrosanct principle' that public health concerns should be given precedence over tobacco-related trade. 5 Secondly, China was also hoping to use the FCTC to maintain the dominant status of domestic tobacco firms by blocking trade liberalization in tobacco production and curtailing tobacco smuggling by transnational tobacco companies. 6 Both of these factors might explain why China was among the 59 countries pledging financial and political support for FCTC while the Member States were voting for WHA52. 18 .

On the other hand China was concerned that the FCTC negotiation might undermine its sovereignty. Internally, because the tobacco industry was considered an important contributor to the state coffer, China worried that an internationally binding treaty might restrict its policy options in promoting economic development (upon which the regime's legitimacy hinges). Externally, because the convention would be a treaty, which only state actors can join by definition, China was concerned that Taiwan, which it considers a renegade province, might use the negotiations as an way to expand its international space and pursue a 'two China' or a 'One China, One Taiwan' agenda. According to a US negotiator, 'the biggest issue' China had with WHO at that time was 'ensuring that Taiwan did not get observer status at the organization or any other UN agency.' 7 The need to balance these multiple interests and concerns was reflected in the four seemingly contradictory principles that the Chinese government set for the negotiation: 1) the treaty should not undermine the important status of tobacco industry in China's national economy; 2) China should explicitly support tobacco control; 3) treaty making should respect state sovereignty; and 4) China should not concede on matters of principle, but could be flexible on minor issues. 8 China's deep aspirations and concerns underscored the importance for it to engage actively in the treaty-making process. When the WHO convened the first meeting of the intergovernmental negotiating body (INB1) in October 2000, China sent a large delegation consisting of representatives from 13 central ministries. 9 From then on, China participated in all six INB sessions. The Ministry of Health (MOH) was the primary central ministry supporting strong tobacco control. It had a champion at the WHO to support its tobacco control cause e a Chinese public health expert named Yang Gonghuan e who happened to be working in the WHO's Tobacco Free Initiative. But to the surprise of all the other participating countries, which did not allow the tobacco industry to officially participate in the negotiations, the Chinese delegation included a representative from the State Tobacco Monopoly Administration (STMA). Unlike its regulatory counterparts in other countries, STMA shares its management staff with the China National Tobacco Corporation (CNTC), a state-owned manufacturer of tobacco products and also the world's largest cigarette maker. This unique governance arrangement made STMA the de facto representative of China's giant tobacco industry.

With the involvement of multiple bureaucratic agencies from different functional domains, consensus building became less likely in the policy process. Furthermore, in the single-minded pursuit of economic growth in post-Mao China, public health has often been relegated to a backburner issue. As a result, the MOH is bureaucratically weak and often has to rely heavily on interagency cooperation to accomplish its policy goals. 10 By contrast, the economic clout of the STMA/ CNTC have placed it in a strong position to lobby and influence policy. Beginning in 1987, tobacco has provided the biggest single source of tax revenue in China. In 2002, the tobacco industry generated 8% of China's annual fiscal revenue through taxation; in Yunan Province, the share was as high as 49%. 11 The head of delegation was theoretically responsible for the negotiations. Xiong Bilin, an official from the National Development and Reform Commission, was the head of the Chinese delegation between INB3 and INB6. He was keenly aware of the importance of balancing different bureaucratic interests. On the one hand, he stressed the importance of the tobacco industry, saying that 'For a long time, Chinese economic development will depend on the tobacco industry to accumulate fiscal revenue and to partially solve the employment issue.' 8 On the other hand, he noted that as a responsible power, China should support tobacco control. Yet, a compromise between the MOH and the STMA/CNTC was difficult to reach not only because of the tobacco industry's fundamental conflict of interest with public health, but also because of the MOH's lack of leverage in the interdepartmental bargaining process. Perceiving the FCTC as a threat to China's tobacco industry, the STMA formed a working group to study the treaty and proposed counterstrategies for the Chair's Text from INB3 through INB6 in early July 2001. 12 The conflict between the MOH and the STMA/CNTC first surfaced in INB1. The STMA representative found fault with the FCTC wording concerning 'the devastating health, social, environmental and economic consequences of tobacco consumption' and insisted that the word 'devastating' be removed. 13 His frequent speeches at INB1 gave the WHO officials the impression that China was not serious about p u b l i c h e a l t h 1 2 8 ( 2 0 1 4 ) 1 6 1 e1 6 6 tobacco control. 13 Within the delegation, the STMA representative did not hide his hostility toward tobacco control. On one occasion, an STMA official even allegedly accused an MOH official of being 'traitorous' for advocating tobacco control and claimed that 'one tenth of your salary comes from us.' 14 The deadlock would eventually have to be broken by the top leadership.

In a move to clarify China's positions, the State Council prior to INB2 explicitly instructed the delegation that it should 1) work proactively toward the success of the treaty making; 2) not be too critical over the wording of the text; and 3) not allow the negotiation to become a forum for Taiwan to pursue a 'two China' agenda. 15 From then on, China became more cooperative in negotiations. 'China was not a big vocal player,' noted a US negotiator, but it 'did go along with the public health issues, especially if they were not trade or commerce related.' 7 China was praised for supporting some key FCTC provisions, for which it won an Orchid Award from the NGO Framework Convention Alliance (FCA). Indeed, China was considered the least vigorous opponent of the FCTC among the 'big four' (China, Japan, Germany, and the United States). 16 Despite the attitude change, China continued to prefer a more generic FCTC, which would leave implementation guidelines to future protocols and domestic laws, and there was no indication that the STMA was willing to soften its opposition to certain provisions. During INB3, the STMA representative opposed having pictorial warning labels on tobacco packages, contending that doing so would be against Chinese traditional thinking and its domestic laws. 8 During INB5 in October 2002, China received an FCA Dirty Ashtray Award after the STMA representative made lengthy remarks seeking to water down the provisions on 'responsibilities and liabilities' (which initially would allow people to use the convention to sue tobacco industries for compensation). Upset about the activities of NGOs in the negotiation during INB6, China joined the United States in seeking to deny NGOs' access to the informal sessions.

Throughout the negotiations, the STMA's opinion carried significant weight in the Chinese delegation's deliberation and decision-making process. Toward the end of INB6, the STMA's refusal to enact graphic warning labels that cover at least 30% of tobacco package forced the Chinese delegation to reopen the negotiations. 17 Lack of Chinese support for some key provisions contributed to a less robust and more generic FCTC, especially over issues such as the use of pictorial warning labels and responsibilities and compensation.

China signed the treaty in October 2003, and in 2005, the Standing Committee of the National People's Congressd-China's top legislative bodydratified the treaty.

The process of revising the IHR began in 1995, although significant progress was not made until 2003, when the SARS outbreak provided a 'powerful rationale and catalyst' for accelerating the process. 18 In May 2003, while the world was still combating the virus, the 56th World Health Assembly (WHA) requested that the WHO director-general establish an Intergovernmental Working Group (IGWG) for the revision of the IHR. Starting in March 2004, the WHO convened regional meetings and two IGWG meetings to negotiate the IHR revisions. The work was completed in May 2005, immediately prior to the 58th WHA, which adopted the revised IHR by acclamation. According to David Fidler, the new IHR 'constitute[d] one of the most radical and far-reaching changes in international law on public health since the beginning of international health cooperation in the mid-nineteenth century.' 19 Different from its predecessors, the revised IHR not only covers a larger number and broader array of public health threats, but also expands the scope of participation. In addition to the involvement of non-state actors in disease surveillance, the IHR introduces the universality principle, which states that the implementation of the regulations 'shall be guided by the goal of their universal application for the protection of all people of the world from the international spread of disease' (Article 3.3).

In part because of China's slow and secretive handling of SARS and the huge damage the virus' transnational spread has caused internationally, China had strong incentive to repair its tarnished international image. Meanwhile, the crisis also provided an opportunity for China to update its conception of national sovereignty. One important lesson China learned was that it could no longer handle a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) without the involvement of regional and international actors. Premier Wen Jiabao, for example, admitted that the cross-boundary spread of a disease like SARS could 'only be effectively countered by cooperative efforts at the regional and international levels.' 20 Even though it was considered one of the most ardent supporters of state sovereignty, China, especially in the later stage of the SARS outbreak, appeared to have acquiesced to WHO's leadership on global health governance. 21 These developments prompted China to actively participate in the IHR revision. In sharp contrast to India, which sent only three delegates to each of the three IGWG meetings, China sent 12 delegates in November 2004, 15 in February 2005, and 17 in May 2005. 22 The relatively large delegation size enabled China to have enough negotiators to cover concurrent sessions, 'corridor negotiations' and other processes.

Unlike the Chinese delegation to FCTC talks, the delegation to the IHR revision was represented by only three central agencies: the MOH; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA); and the General Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine (AQSIQ), which made coordination and consensus building much easier. Further, none of the agencies appeared to stand to lose from the revised IHR. For the MOH and the AQSIQ, the new requirements of building core surveillance and response capacities might lead to increased workload, but they could also be used to justify significantly more central budgetary investments, which would boost their morale and status in the bureaucratic hierarchy. Equally important, the MOH was entrusted to 'take the lead' (qiantou) in the negotiations. Neither of the other two members were bureaucratically strong enough to challenge the MOH's lead role, especially over technical issues; the AQSIQ had a lower bureaucratic rank than the MOH and the MFA, and the MFA traditionally has little autonomy in the foreign policy process. 23 The delegation of the first two IGWG meetings, however, was headed by Sha Zukang, the Chinese ambassador to p u b l i c h e a l t h 1 2 8 ( 2 0 1 4 ) 1 6 1 e1 6 6 the United Nations office in Geneva, who was noted for his outspoken nationalist tones.

While domestic politics did not prevent China from acting constructively and responsibly in the revision process, the focus of the negotiations highlighted the importance of balancing the traditional emphasis on state sovereignty against the universalistic ambitions inherent in addressing the global spread of infectious diseases. Prior to the revision of the IHR, the reporting of disease outbreaks and the nature of responses to them was solely the domain of sovereign states. However, individual states were incentivized to suppress the flow of information regarding endogenous epidemics that are of international concern. For example, the Implementing Regulations on the State Secrets Law regarding the handling of public-health related information classified any occurrence of infectious diseases as a state secret before it was announced by the Ministry of Health or organs authorized by the Ministry. 24 China initially argued vehemently against the proposal to include a formal list of specific infectious diseases for fear that it might be compelled to reveal information that would hurt its national interests. China also resisted the idea of sending WHO investigative teams to countries without consent. 25 This emphasis on state sovereignty led to a state-centric approach to domestic health governance that excludes the participation of NGOs. In spite of the growing recognition of the importance of nonstate actors in disease surveillance (which the revised IHR acknowledges), China maintained that sovereign states should remain the primary actors in implementing the IHR. Similar to what its stance in the FCTC talks, China, along with many other Asian countries, also sought to limit the role of NGOs in the IGWG meetings.

Concern about infringement of its state sovereignty also affected China's position on Taiwan in negotiations. Lest Taiwan took advantage of the revision process to become a signatory member of the IHR, China welcomed Taiwan to join the Chinese delegation prior to negotiations, as Hong Kong and Macau did. It also expressed interest in talking with Taiwan to find a solution for the latter to participate in the WHO activities. During the IGWG meetings, however, China continued to block Taiwan's request to become a signatory party of IHR. In November 2004, Nicaragua proposed an amendment that would allow non-member states to participate as signatory parties to IHR, but this amendment was rejected by Member States. At the closing plenary session of the first IGWG meeting, Ambassador Sha made it clear that 'health is a very important issue, but sovereignty and territorial integrity are more important to a sovereign state. China will firmly defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity at all cost.' 26 Playing China's sheer population size as a trump card, he further warned that 'the future IHR has no universality without China's participation.' 26 But Beijing's insistence on blocking Taiwan from participating in the WHO activities would leave gaps in the global surveillance and response network, which was against the universality principle in implementing the new IHR. Indeed, Taiwan's request for participation elicited widespread international sympathy. 27 Concerned that Taiwan used the principle to justify its direct interaction with the WHO without China's involvement, China pushed for the incorporation of additional three principles including 'respecting sovereignty of all countries' and 'abiding by the United Nations Charter and the World Health Organization (WHO) Constitution.' It also refused to include the universality principle in the WHA resolution without referring to other principles after the conclusion of the negotiations. In May 2005, China signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the WHO Secretariat in which it agreed that Taiwanese medical experts could enjoy 'meaningful participation' in WHO-related activities. While allowing the WHO to interact with Taiwan, the implementation memo set out clear restrictive procedures on such contact. 28 In hindsight, China's emphasis on sovereignty did not impede its flexibility in revising the IHR. China dropped its opposition to the universality principle when the chair of the draft committee substituted 'all countries' with 'all people' in the new text. 29 Similarly, China, a country which attaches utmost importance of socialepolitical stability, showed flexibility by allowing the WHO to take into account sources of information provided by non-state actors in making decisions. Its negotiators indicated that China preferred WHO to deal with these 'rumors' and found it acceptable when the wording was changed to 'sources other than notifications or consultations.' 29

An examination of the two cases helps us to better understand China's new health foreign policy dynamics since the 1990s. In both cases, China demonstrated strong incentives to participate in the negotiation of legally binding international rules. This growing interest in global health governance has been driven by its aspiration to be a responsible power as well as the need to defend its core national interests in international relations. This interest in global health governance, coupled with the recognition of its role as a critical stakeholder in addressing major global health challenges (i.e., tobacco use and PHEIC), also exerted sufficient normative pressures for China to be more flexible and constructive in global health rule making. This is especially true after the 2003 SARS outbreak, which reinforced the incentives for China to accept restraints on its state sovereignty and become more cooperative in handling transnational challenges. Such normative pressure may explain why China has ratified both FCTC and the revised IHR despite their potential negative impact on state sovereignty.

Still, sovereignty issues are a major, if not the biggest, concern for China when engaging in global health rule making. In both negotiations, there was inclination to allow sovereignty trump public health. In the negotiating of IHR revisions, the sovereignty issue became the only major issue China had with the WHO. While the issue may have become less sensitive with Taiwan obtaining its WHA observer status in 2009, China's growing international influence may encourage its pursuit of an increasingly individualistic and state-centric approach that narrows the space for future international health cooperation.

The two cases also uncover domestic political economy as an important factor in shaping China's position in international health negotiations. Compared with its overwhelming concern over Taiwan in IHR revisions, China seemed to be p u b l i c h e a l t h 1 2 8 ( 2 0 1 4 ) 1 6 1 e1 6 6 more concerned about the ability to pursue its own development options in the FCTC talks. The inclusion of the powerful tobacco industry in the Chinese delegation not only changed the discourse from protecting public health to protecting the interests of the tobacco industry, but also effectively undermined the bargaining power of the MOH, making China a 'spoiler' in negotiations. In contrast, 'big tobacco' appeared to have played a less prominent role in influencing US positions in the FCTC talks, even though it might have contributed to the US failure to ratify the treaty. 30 Domestic political economy was not found to be a significant factor when China was negotiating IHR revision. Indeed, it can be argued that it was precisely the lack of the interference of powerful special interests that made the issue of sovereignty a dominant concern of the Chinese delegation in negotiating the IHR.

In short, while sovereignty concerns will continue to be a major facet of China's engagement in future international health negotiations, domestic political economy issues have strong potential to determine the direction and discourse of such engagement.

Web-based infectious disease surveillance systems and public health perspectives: a systematic review,"Background: Emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases are a significant public health concern, and early detection and immediate response is crucial for disease control. These challenges have led to the need for new approaches and technologies to reinforce the capacity of traditional surveillance systems for detecting emerging infectious diseases. In the last few years, the availability of novel web-based data sources has contributed substantially to infectious disease surveillance. This study explores the burgeoning field of web-based infectious disease surveillance systems by examining their current status, importance, and potential challenges. Methods: A systematic review framework was applied to the search, screening, and analysis of web-based infectious disease surveillance systems. We searched PubMed, Web of Science, and Embase databases to extensively review the English literature published between 2000 and 2015. Eleven surveillance systems were chosen for evaluation according to their high frequency of application. Relevant terms, including newly coined terms, development and classification of the surveillance systems, and various characteristics associated with the systems were studied. Results: Based on a detailed and informative review of the 11 web-based infectious disease surveillance systems, it was evident that these systems exhibited clear strengths, as compared to traditional surveillance systems, but with some limitations yet to be overcome. The major strengths of the newly emerging surveillance systems are that they are intuitive, adaptable, low-cost, and operated in real-time, all of which are necessary features of an effective public health tool. The most apparent potential challenges of the web-based systems are those of inaccurate interpretation and prediction of health status, and privacy issues, based on an individual's internet activity. Conclusion: Despite being in a nascent stage with further modification needed, web-based surveillance systems have evolved to complement traditional national surveillance systems. This review highlights ways in which the strengths of existing systems can be maintained and weaknesses alleviated to implement optimal web surveillance systems.","Despite medical advances and increased vaccine availability, emerging and re-emerging epidemics continue to pose tremendous threats, based on reported cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome, influenza A (H1N1), avian flu, Ebola virus, and the recent Middle East respiratory syndrome [1] . To avoid the repercussions of an epidemic, early detection and immediate response are emphasized to manage infectious diseases. Many online surveillance systems that function based on real-time data have been developed involving a wide range of technologies and data sources to prevent the occurrence of infectious diseases; these systems are continually being added to and evaluated [2] . Traditional passive surveillance systems typically rely on data submitted to the relevant public health authority by various healthcare providers [3] . This process is often expensive and inefficient, as substantial delays between an event and notifications are common, resulting in an incomplete account of disease emergence. Such limitations of traditional surveillance systems are a shared concern worldwide. The Internet has revolutionized efficient health-related communication and epidemic intelligence [4] . The increased frequency of Internet use for acquiring health information has contributed to the rise of web-based early detection systems for infectious diseases through various methodologies [5] . The principal concept is that diseaserelated information is retrieved from a wide range of available real-time electronic data sources, which play critical roles in the identification of early events and situational preparedness by offering current, highly local information about outbreaks, even from remote areas that have been unapproachable by traditional global public health efforts [6] . These systems not only monitor and predict disease outbreaks but also provide a user interface, and aid in visualization for an easier understanding and maneuvering of the operation. These new systems for early detection of epidemics are still in the nascent stage, but the concept and relevant promising mechanisms have been adopted and tested by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) with positive indications for efficiency and feasibility [7] . In fact, several web-based surveillance systems are affiliated with the CDC from which they are granted funding and technical assistance [8] .

Previous studies have suggested that these new systems exhibit remarkable potential for expansion and for enhancing the capacity of traditional surveillance systems for emerging infectious diseases [9] . It is of great importance to discuss the possible directions in which these new surveillance systems are headed in the context of public health by thoroughly examining areas of improvement for such systems. In addition, the absence of a system for predicting and monitoring epidemics in some countries with strong information communications technology (ICT) capability should command the attention of their national public health sectors, as there is an imminent need to implement such a mechanism. The objective of this systematic review was to investigate well-established web-based infectious disease surveillance systems that focus on infectious disease occurrence and the early detection of outbreaks. Our investigation can serve as an overview and starting point for readers interested in the topic and as a useful reference for the design of prospective infectious disease surveillance systems in countries that lack such tools.

A systematic review was performed and reported in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses checklist (Additional file 1).

Literature from multiple journal sources was obtained by searching with relevant search terms, and appropriate articles on web-based disease surveillance systems were reviewed extensively. The literature search was conducted using the PubMed, Web of Science, and Embase databases. Articles written in English published between 2000 and 2015 were searched for a more refined outcome. The following key words were used in the search process: syndromic surveillance (""syndromic"" [All Fields] AND ""surveillance"" [All Fields]), digital disease detection (""digital"" [All Fields] AND ""disease"" [MeSH Terms] AND ""detection [All Fields]), biosurveillance (""biosurveillance"" [MeSH Terms]), infoveillance (""infoveillance"" [All Fields]), infodemiology (""infodemiology"" [All Fields]), online surveillance (""online"" [All Fields] AND ""surveillance"" [All Fields]), outbreak forecast (""outbreaks"" [All Fields] AND ""forecasting"" [MeSH Terms], and web surveillance systems (""web"" [All Fields] AND ""surveillance"" [All Fields] AND ""systems"" [All Fields]). The initial search strategy developed for PubMed was that some of the vague terms were re-sorted into ""medical subject headings"", which brought forth more specific and relevant results.

The first task was to systematically search the three databases PubMed, Web of Science, and Embase. Second, the 4,650 articles identified after the removal of duplicates were meticulously checked for relevant information on web-based infectious disease surveillance systems. Third, those web-based infectious disease surveillance systems which were mentioned in at least five studies were further considered. Lastly, all identified evidence was further complemented with the authors' expert knowledge and personal archives. The last step also included the consultation of the CDC website and the inclusion of the ""GET WELL"" system, which was only mentioned in four studies (see Fig. 1 ) and would have been omitted without this last step. Other web-based infectious disease surveillance systems that were mentioned in only a few studies and thus were not considered in this systematic review are as follows: Argus, Electronic Surveillance System for the Early Notification of Community-based Epidemics (ESSENCE II), International system for Total Early Disease Detection (InsTEDD). The studies included provided a comprehensive review for understanding existing web-based surveillance systems aimed at detecting infectious diseases early.

Typical terms associated with conventional systems have evolved following the emergence of new online-based infectious disease surveillance systems. The merging of public health and ICT has brought forth several recently coined terms and unprecedented word combinations, both of which are essential for understanding the fundamentals of the new disease detection systems. These new terms reflect the complexity of the convergence. The most commonly appearing terms and their descriptions are shown in Table 1 .

Across the three databases and the CDC website, 4,650 articles were collected, and duplicates were removed within the same database and across the different databases, resulting in 2,080 articles. Subsequently, these articles were further screened by assessing whether the title or abstract contained the exact search terms or if the content itself was relevant to the subject matter. After a meticulous assessment of full-text articles for eligibility, and exclusion of those with insufficient and inadequate information for analysis, 60 studies were filtered for the final qualitative analysis. Eleven web-based surveillance systems were analyzed, based on the selected literature, with regard to their development, various characteristics, and mechanisms, including their methods of data collection and delivery of service. The flow chart (see Fig. 1 ) illustrates the literature selection process for this systematic review.

As newly emergent and resurgent infections have progressively become a significant threat to the global community, a more systematic approach is needed to respond to these challenges [12] . Web-based reporting and surveillance systems first originated to strengthen global capacity for disease surveillance [20] . The forerunner was the Program for Monitoring Emerging Diseases (ProMED-Mail), which was established in 1994 under the auspices of the Federation of American Scientists, with the aim of rapidly disseminating disease-related information to a wide audience and allowing for informed discussion in real-time. However, it has been operated by the International Society for Infectious Diseases since 1999 [21] . Subsequently, the World Health Organization (WHO) established an effectively organized infrastructure called the Global Outbreak Alert Response Network (GOARN) for the very first time, which served as a ""network of technical partners and other networks with the capacity and expertise to contribute to an international coordinated response to outbreaks of epidemic-prone and novel infectious diseases"" [22] .

Following the information revolution and the rise of web 2.0, active and frequent use of the Internet triggered the creation of more surveillance systems [5] . While earlier network-based infrastructure focused on news reports as the primary data source, recently created surveillance systems use various sources for early warning systems, developed in several countries, which include query data from online search engines and social media such as Twitter [23] . Moreover, some Internet-based surveillance systems have been selected to be part of a national security system and are managed at the national level. Such a phenomenon is most often apparent in developed countries, as in the United States and Sweden. CDC funds feasible and effective surveillance systems to enhance the technical aspect, and the Generating Epidemiological Trends from Web Logs, Like (GET WELL) system has been officially accepted by the Swedish government and is in regular use at the Swedish Institute for Infectious Disease Control, providing a complementary aid to the daily surveillance performed by epidemiologists [24] . Over the last decade, these systems have progressed dramatically, as evidenced by the transformation in data collection and dissemination (Fig. 2) .

Web-based surveillance systems have been developed to monitor news reports and to rapidly spread information on disease outbreaks with the aim of detecting an infectious disease at the onset of the outbreak. Figure 3 shows the classification of standard disease surveillance systems. Event-based surveillance systems are based on the organized, rapid capture, and reporting of information about outbreaks or events that can be a risk to public health [25] [26] [27] . However, rather than relying on official reports, this information is retrieved directly from witnesses of real-time events or indirectly from reports transmitted through various communication channels, such as social media, and information channels including news media and public health networks [28] . A great deal of attention from the public, and media interest, are associated with an epidemic [29, 30] . Health information monitored via the Internet and social media is a pivotal part of event-based surveillance and is most often the source emphasized by many existing surveillance systems [18] . Event-based disease surveillance systems can be classified into three main categories of news aggregators, automatic systems, and moderated systems. Moderated systems function so that information is processed by human analysts or is processed automatically before being analyzed by human analysts [31, 32] . These systems screen for epidemiological relevance of the data extracted within the information prior to being presented to the user [26] . Examples of this system include ProMED-Mail, GPHIN, GOARN, and Bio-Caster. The process by which automatic systems collect data is complex; it adds a series of steps for analysis, but differs in the levels of analysis performed as well as in the scope of information sources, language coverage, speed of delivery, and visualization methods. EpiSPIDER, Health-Map, EpiSimS, MedISys, and GETWELL are examples of automatic systems [33] [34] [35] . Finally, news aggregators include Google Flu Trends, which collect reports and articles from sources screened by language or country; by such means users can easily access many sources via a common portal but they are required to view each article individually [26] .

Most new surveillance systems have been applied worldwide, as seen through the structured table of the systems The systematic process of data collection and analysis to detect and characterize disease outbreaks in humans and animals in a timely manner [10, 11] .

The process of gathering, integrating, interpreting, and communicating essential information that might be related to activity and threats to human, animal, or plant health [12] . Biosurveillance activities range from standard epidemiological practices to advanced technological systems, utilizing complex algorithms [13] . The focus is on the use of early disease indicators to identify outbreaks before definitive diagnoses are made [14] .

Information epidemiology; the science of the distribution and determinants of information in an electronic medium, specifically the Internet, or in a population, with the ultimate aim to inform public health and public policy [15, 16] .

Infoveillance Information surveillance; longitudinal tracking of infodemiology metrics for surveillance and trend analyses [16] [17] [18] .

Digital surveillance Attempts to provide knowledge of public health issues by analyzing health information stored digitally, as well as the distribution and patterns governing access to these data [18] .

Encompasses alerting public healthcare practitioners during the early phases of an outbreak, enabling them to promptly institute control measures and case finding and to ensure adequate access to treatment, thereby reducing morbidity and mortality [19] .

categorized according to the origin, area of service, language coverage, data source, data access, user interface and format and arte offered in different languages, except EpiSimS and GET WELL [36] . BioCaster, EpiSPI-DER, and HealthMap are disseminated on a geographical map. MedISys and ProMED-mail are disseminated through websites or news aggregators in the public, whereas GOARN and GPHIN are disseminated through a secured or restricted portal accessed by entities with monitoring responsibility, who respond to and mitigate emerging public disease threats [37, 38] . Influenzanet is a unique system, as it obtains data directly from the population; this participatory system monitors the activity of influenza-like illnesses in realtime with the aid of volunteers with certain symptoms and via internet questionnaires comprised of various medical, geographic, and behavioral questions [39, 40] . Table 2 below summarizes the various characteristics of 11 of the most often used and/or recognized web-based surveillance systems.

The development of and access to telecommunications, media, and the Internet marked the starting point for Restricted/ Subscription [22] Boolean and metadata query system [35] Website/e-mail alert [ An unprecedented increase in the number of Internet users was observed during this period, followed by growth of social network services and the introduction of big data. These changes were sufficient to spark integration between the ICT and public health issues, leading to the rise of web-based disease surveillance systems. The first systems were regarded as pilot trials at the exploratory level, and were often based at, or in cooperation with, universities or institutions (BioCaster, HealthMap, and GETWELL), non-governmental organizations (GOARN, MedISys, and ProMED-Mail) and a few governmental agencies (EpiSPIDER and GPHIN). Since the initiation of these web-based surveillance systems as trial programs, many have evolved and become renowned over the past few years. Several general trends are observed among the characteristics of the 11 web-based surveillance systems. Most of the web-based surveillance systems were first developed in North America, particularly the United States, with abundant infrastructure and technological resources, when integration of ICT and syndromic surveillance for early detection and response to diseases was at a preliminary phase. As time progressed, other regions, such as Asia and Europe, have caught up by launching similar but distinct web-based surveillance systems, spreading the notion of early detection of disease outbreaks by real-time scanning and collecting, and analyzing unstructured information from diverse internet sources [62] . English was the only language in service in the earlier systems but, subsequently, the collection and analysis of data began to be published in different languages based on the service area. The scope of data sources has also expanded as newer surveillance systems extract information not just from secondary news reports but also from social media, web search queries, and various organizations such as the CDC, Central Intelligence Agency, and the WHO.

The terminology has changed among the many elements of the web-based surveillance systems that have evolved and become sophisticated. The fusion of epidemiologic intelligence and ICT has produced newly coined terms that describe the core functions and characteristics of web-based surveillance systems. This new terminology is essential for depicting the underlying importance of digital technology as a public health tool. Future webbased surveillance systems will produce additional new terms to highlight the collaborative characteristics of these systems.

The best recognized use of novel technologies and health surveillance data together is that of estimating the range and magnitude of health problems in a community to rapidly detect the outbreak of an epidemic at its onset [63] . It is evident that web-based surveillance systems have huge potential to enhance traditional systems, as opposed to merely being an alternative, as they have added benefits and capacities, such as a large quantity of relevant data, increased accessibility, and timeliness [63, 64] .

Strengths and future challenges of newly emerging surveillance systems

Internet-based systems are intuitive, adaptable, inexpensive to maintain, and operate in real time [3] . Advanced computational capabilities involving Internet searches enable automated and rapid collection of large volumes of data, referred to as ""big data"", and provide the public with ""real-time"" detection and improved early notification of localized outbreaks [65] . In addition, a system based on web queries can easily be applied to various infectious diseases, as the underlying mechanisms are very similar [66] .

Some groups, such as the WHO, CDC, and other governmental and multi-lateral bodies, have begun to recognize the added value of these tools through the use of technologies, such as HealthMap and other new initiatives [52, 67] ; such acceptance serves as a valuable lesson for developing countries shaping the future of their public health systems. Developing countries that are particularly prone to the spread of infectious disease should seek ways to emulate the strengths of existing web-based surveillance systems and broaden the group of users directly accessing and utilizing such systems [68] .

However, the new Internet-based surveillance systems are not without limitations, thereby provoking skepticism. First, due to the unstructured nature of the data sources, interpreting the information may require highly complex techniques to effectively implement the system initially [69] . The recent closure of Google Flu Trend was partially due to its failure to provide a swift and accurate account of flu outbreaks [70] . Although the quantity of information was thought to be reliable for monitoring and predicting the occurrence of a flu outbreak, the lack of methodological transparency for data extraction, processing, and analysis led to inaccurate prediction in detecting an influenza outbreak [71] . Second, Internet use and health-seeking behavior vary among individuals, and between different sectors of the community and environment. Thus, the limited environments in which these tools are useful must be considered along with the demographics of the population [72] . Large discrepancies occur between availability of the Internet and active seeking of healthcare information that account for unequal use and access [73, 74] . Third, data sharing permits more and better quality data to be used to monitor public health and potential outbreaks [75] . However, use of data with precise information connected to individuals could be a privacy concern. Careful and appropriate decisions need to be made to avoid any further privacy intrusion on personal information. Last, forecasting health and disease-related phenomena is very likely to provoke accuracy issues because health fluctuates in every individual, and how people perceive their health status is very subjective. Although monitoring trends in disease outbreaks and health outcomes is possible, forecasting them is subject to false predictions. Thus, data sources must be evaluated extensively, particularly to identify gaps in coverage and false decisions [76] . The expectation now is that the accuracy of these systems will be enhanced through iterative procedures and that the scope of search-term surveillance will be more inclusive to other diseases [69] . The precedent of the Google Flu Trend failure illustrates the importance of a balance between traditional data and big data to maintain these systems. It is probable that future challenges will remain with regard to data integration, compatibility issues, and evaluating surveillance systems, all of which are underdeveloped and lacking in the current research. More research addressing these issues will be necessary.

Two major elements should be thoroughly considered when implementing a prospective web-based surveillance system. First, one of the potential problems in countries with a high Internet penetration rate is that many people share their personal experiences, perceptions, and distinct individual health conditions via social media, which may not always be a true reflection of the occurrence of a disease activity or an epidemic [3] . In other words, selfreporting and media-driven actions may be a chief confounder of web surveillance systems [3] . Thus, relying solely on data based on lay people's web queries and post frequency must take into consideration possible inaccurate interpretations.

The majority of the existing web-based surveillance systems work on the premise that disease incidence correlates with the frequency of information-seeking using specific terms [3] , which are query data most often analyzed in English. The primary language used to operate these web-based surveillance systems is also English, which limits the frequency of use and monitoring among many people worldwide, and can cause a compatibility problem if the same platforms are used in non-English speaking countries. Repercussions of the language barrier issue will likely affect the accuracy of detecting an outbreak. Several language-related intricacies, including cultural tone, language shifts, and the use of colloquialisms [3] are factors that cannot be easily recognized by technical aspects of web-based surveillance systems as opposed to traditional, conventional surveillance systems maneuvered by human analysts. This is another reason why data accuracy might be heavily affected and constitutes an area for improvement.

Traditional disease surveillance systems are feebly structured but at the same time require high management costs and excessively complex network operation. The most challenging task will be to implement a standardized web-based surveillance system that can be accessed and utilized universally and efficiently at low cost. In high-income, developed countries where the Internet penetration rate is high, the ""real-time"" feature of these web-based surveillance systems will overcome the limitations of traditional systems with regard to the speed of response and data dissemination. As well, the immediate effect of these systems in developing countries that lack technologies and an efficient public health system will be powerful and innovative. The introduction and amplification of these web-based systems in public health will remedy the shortcomings of traditional systems. Ultimately, the aim is to safely prevent the spread of an infectious disease at early onset by placing timeliness as the utmost priority, so that health consequences of a disease outbreak will be reduced significantly.

This review has several limitations despite employing a systematic review approach and aiming at providing a well-structured overview of web-based infectious disease surveillance systems. Due to limited article accessibility, the literature search was restricted to published articles from a limited number of selected sources. However, as a consequence, we cannot rule out a certain selection and reporting bias in our review. Nevertheless, the here reported work may serve as a good overview and starting point for readers interested in web-based infectious disease surveillance systems. Our hope is that future efforts will further complement and advance our work and provide a continuously updated, more comprehensive and at the same time more detailed picture of the currently existing web-based infectious disease surveillance systems.

Despite being in a nascent stage, with much modification needed, web-based surveillance systems demonstrate the capacity to complement national traditional surveillance systems [61] . However, the failure of Google Flu Trends shows that continued effort at the national level is required to develop more elaborate web-based surveillance systems. The aim of the present study was to systematically review a compilation of web-based infectious disease surveillance systems to provide the necessary groundwork for developing prospective surveillance systems. Future studies should be diversified and intensified, and involve an expanded scope of research, integration of a wider range of data sources, and the application of advanced methodologies.

Funding: The State Major Infectious Disease Research Program (China Central Government,"Acute Respiratory Infections (ARI) are some of the most common human diseases worldwide. However, they have a complex and diverse etiology, and the characteristics of the pathogens involved in respiratory infections in developing countries are not well understood. In this work, we analyzed the characteristics of 17 common respiratory pathogens in children (#14 years old) with ARI in Guangzhou, southern China over a 3-year period using real-time polymerase chain reaction. Pathogens were identified in 2361/4242 (55.7%) patients, and the positivity rate varied seasonally. Ten of the 17 pathogens investigated showed positivity rates of more than 5%. The most frequently detected pathogens were respiratory syncytial virus (768/2361, 32.5%), influenza A virus (428/2361, 18.1%), enterovirus (138/2361, 13.3%), Mycoplasma pneumoniae (267/2361, 11.3%) and adenovirus (213/2361, 9.0%). Co-pathogens were common and found in 503 of 2361 (21.3%) positive samples. When ranked according to frequency of occurrence, the pattern of co-pathogens was similar to that of the primary pathogens, with the exception of human bocavirus, human coronavirus and human metapneumovirus. Significant differences were found in age prevalence in 10 of the 17 pathogens (p#0.009): four basic patterns were observed, A: detection rates increased with age, B: detection rates declined with age, C: the detection rate showed distinct peaks or D: numbers of patients were too low to detect a trend or showed no significant difference among age groups (p. 0.05). These data will be useful for planning vaccine research and control strategies and for studies predicting pathogen prevalence. Citation: Liu WK, Liu Q, Chen DH, Liang HX, Chen XK, et al.

PLoS ONE 9(5): e96674.","Acute respiratory infections (ARI) result in the death of an estimated 4 to 5 million children each year in developing countries [1] [2] [3] [4] . Most of these deaths are among children with pneumonia. Respiratory tract infection etiology is complex and diverse. In developed counties, the major causes of ARI in children and adults are influenza A and B viruses (infA, infB), parainfluenza virus type 1 (PIV1), PIV2, PIV3, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), adenovirus (ADV) and rhinovirus [5] [6] . However, there is a lack of data on the characteristics of ARI in developing nations. Over the past decade, a number of new pathogens have been reported, including human metapneumovirus (HMPV) [7] and human bocaviurs (HBoV) [8] , thus increasing the urgency for the study of epidemiology of respiratory tract pathogen infections in developing countries.

Over the past two decades, virus isolation and serology have been the mainstay of clinical laboratory diagnosis for respiratory virus infections. The introduction of molecular-based detection methods has made diagnosis quicker and cheaper and increased the ability to detect more than one virus simultaneously. In this work, the epidemiological features of 17 respiratory pathogens in children with ARI were studied in Guangzhou, southern China. This study should serve as a valuable resource for information on ARI and provide useful data for future research and development of vaccines.

The study was approved by The First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University Ethics Committee for research on human beings, and all participants or their guardians gave signed informed consent for participation in the study.

Pediatric patients (#14 years old) who presented with at least two of the following symptoms: cough, pharyngeal discomfort, nasal obstruction, snivel, sneeze, dyspnea or who were diagnosed with pneumonia by chest radiography during the previous week, were enrolled in this study. Chest radiography was conducted according to the clinical situation of the patient, and pneumonia was defined as an acute illness with radiographic pulmonary shadowing (at least segmental or in one lobe) by chest radiography.

Throat swab samples were collected from the enrolled patients at three hospitals in Guangzhou, southern China between July 2009 and June 2012. The samples were refrigerated at 2 to 8uC in viral transport medium, transported on ice to State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Diseases and analyzed immediately or stored at 280uC before testing.

Each sample was tested simultaneously for the following 17 respiratory tract pathogens: influenza A virus (infA), influenza B virus (infB), four types of parainfluezna (PIV1, PIV2, PIV3, PIV4), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), adenovirus (ADV), enterovirus (EV), human metapneumovirus (HMPV), four strains of human coronavirus (HCoV-229E, OC43, NL63 and HKU1), human bocavirus (HBoV), Mycoplasma pneumoniae (MP), and Chlamydophila pneumoniae (CP). The testing procedure has been described in previous reports [9] [10] .

Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS statistical software (version 19.0; SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). For comparisons of categorical data, the x 2 test and Fisher's exact test were used as appropriate. All tests were two-tailed and p,0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Samples from a total of 4242 pediatric patients were analyzed over three years from July 2009 to June 2012 in Guangzhou, southern China. Male to female ratio of the patients was 1.92:1. Median age was 1.5 years (interquartile range, 0.67 to 3.00), with a range from one day to 14 years old, and with 3713/4242 (87.5%) patients being less than 5 years old. Pathogens were detected in 2361/4242 (55.7%) patients with a median age of 1.42 years (interquartile range, 0.67 to 3.0). Male to female ratio was 2.04:1 (p = 0.076) in the positive patients and 1.82:1 in the negative patients.

The most frequently detected pathogens in this study were RSV (768/2361, 32.5%), infA (428/2361, 18.1%), EV (138/2361, 13.3%), MP (267/2361, 11.3%) and ADV (213/2361, 9.0%), followed by HMPV, infB, PIV3, HCoV-OC43, HBoV all with the detection rates higher than 5.0%. The positivity rates of the remaining seven pathogens were lower than 5.0% (Table 1) . Copathogens were common and found in 503 of 2361 (21.3%) positive-samples ( Table 1 ). The frequency of detection of the copathogens followed almost the same ranking order as that of the primary pathogens with the exception of HBoV, HCoV-OC43 and HMPV (Figure 1 ).

In this study, patients were divided by age into seven groups. There was no difference in pathogen positivity rate (p = 0.338) and co-pathogen detection rate (p = 0.117) among the age groups. However, significant differences were found in age prevalence between infA, infB, RSV, EV, ADV, PIV2, PIV3, HBoV, HMPV, MP infections (p#0.009, Table 2 ). In general, four age/prevalence patterns could be distinguished among children in this study; A: Detection rates increased with age as illustrated in infA and infB ( Figure 2A) ; B: Detection rates declined with age, as shown in RSV ( Figure 2B ); C: The detection rates peaked at different ages as in EV (peak age 1-2 years, 10.9%), ADV (peak age 3-5 years, 9.0%), PIV2 (peak age 4-6 months, 2.8%), PIV3 (peak age 4-6 months, 6.1%), HBoV (peak age 7-12 months, 5.1%), HMPV (peak age 3-5 years, 5.5%) and MP (peak age 6-10 years, 20.1%) ( Figure 2C and 2D) and D: the number of samples was too small to analyze or no significant pattern was present (p.0.05), as in PIV1, PIV4, HCoV-OC43, 2229E, -NL63, -HKU1 and CP.

In general, sample positivity rates increased when seasons changed as is shown in Figure 3 . In this study, RSV, infA, EV, MP and ADV formed the bulk of the positive sample ( Figure 3 ). In seasonal distribution, RSV and infA, PIV, and human coronavirus infection mainly occurred at the change from winter to spring and summer to autumn; MP and infB increased as RSV and infA declined, respectively. ADV mainly occurred in summer and autumn, although it was generally distributed all year round; HMPV occurred at the change of season from spring to summer and from winter to spring; EV and HBoV occurred mostly in summer and HBoV was prevalent in winter ( Figure 4 ). Few CP positive samples were found, and so a seasonal pattern could not be determined.

ARI is one of the most common human diseases, and the heaviest burden of viral respiratory illness is carried by children. Studies using viral culture diagnosis have estimated that, in developed countries, infants and preschool children experience a mean of 6-10 viral infections annually and school-age children and adolescents experience 3-5 illnesses annually [11] [12] . RSV, infA and infB, PIV1, 2, and 3, and ADV are considered to be the most common causative viruses for ARI, especially for lower respiratory tract illness [5] [6] 13] . MP and CP are the causative agent of atypical pneumonia and have been studied widely in developed countries. However, the characteristics of respiratory pathogens in the etiology of ARI in developing countries are not well studied. In this work, we analyzed the characteristics of 17 common respiratory pathogens from throat swab samples which were collected from children with ARI in Guangzhou, southern China over a 3-year period. Although the best recovered samples should be bronchial alveolar lavage fluid (BALF) in the location of pulmonary infection. However, it is hardly carried out in clinic for harvesting BALF in illness kids. Throat swab is practically clinical behavior for taking the specimen in patients with ARI so far.

Among pediatric patients with ARI in this study, 55.7% (2361/ 4242) patients were positive for one or more of the 17 pathogens studied, and the positivity rate would have been higher if rhinovirus and bacteria had been included. 10 of the 17 pathogens showed positivity rates greater than 5%, demonstrating the wide diversity of pathogens contributing to ARI ( Figure 1 ; Table 1 ). In general, the distributions of pathogens vary among different countries and regions because of climatic and other variables. In southern China, RSV, infA, EV, MP, ADV were the predominant pathogens in this study and thus were the major influence on the structure of our analysis (Figure 3 ). Seasonal distributions of most of the pathogens rose during the change of seasons ( Figure 4) . RSV (32.5%, 768/2361) was the most frequently isolated virus occurring mainly among children less than 2 years old. This distribution is consistent with previous reports of RSV in both developed and developing countries [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] (Table 1, Table 2 ). RSV is known to occur in well-defined recurrent epidemics during the cold season in temperate climates [6, 19] . In tropical and subtropical areas, RSV infections have been reported to peak more often in the wet season, but locations close to the equator show a less consistent pattern, some with almost continuous RSV activity and with varying seasonal peaks [19, 21] . In this study, two seasonal peaks of RSV were found at the changes of season from winter to spring and from summer to autumn. This pattern is similar to that reported in Nepal [18] . Influenza virus is one of the major causative agents of respiratory disease in humans, and leads to a more severe disease than the common cold which is caused by a different type of virus [23] . Influenza occurs worldwide with outbreaks during the winter season in temperate countries [24] [25] . In this study, infA (428/ 2361, 18.1%) was the second most frequent pathogen-isolated, and showed a seasonal distribution that was similar to RSV, except for the period of the pandemic of H1N1 in 2009 and 2010 [26] [27] [28] (Table 1, Figure 4 ). infB occurred less often than infA and was the sixth most frequent pathogen found.

EV, MP and ADV were also important pathogens in our study. EV is frequently isolated from the throats of people with respiratory infection and many studies have supported the role of EV in ARI [29] [30] . In a seven-year study in Rio de Janeiro EV was found less frequently than RSV, ADV and influenza viruses in patients with ARI [31] .

MP is the causative agent of atypical pneumonia and is also responsible for other respiratory tract infections such as tracheobronchitis, bronchiolitis, croup, and less severe upper respiratory tract infections in older children and young adults [32] . Epidemics generally occur at intervals of 4-7 years [33] . In our study, MP was the fourth most frequent pathogen isolated and tended to increase when RSV was declining (Figure 4) , in contrast with a previous report [34] . However, both pathogens could be found all year long.

ADV infection usually causes symptoms of low respiratory illness (LRI) in children, and can occur all year round. In Guangzhou, ADV was mainly found in summer and autumn, but was also present all year long (Figure 4 ).

PIVs are important causes of ARI, especially in children [35] [36] . An estimated five million LRI occur each year in the United States among children under 5 years old, and PIVs have been isolated in up to one third of these infections [37] [38] [39] . However, a total of 11.4% (269/2361) of patients in our study were PIV positive, and PIV3 which is the most frequent PIV isolated was found in only 5.9% of patients, which is lower than that found in the United States study.

In the past decade, at least six new viruses associated with respiratory infection have been identified, including HMPV, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, human coronavirus NL63 and HKU1, PIV4, and HBoV [5, 41] , demonstrating the diversity of ARI pathogens. Many viruses like rhinovirus and human coronavirus have been largely ignored by the medical community because their clinical impact was considered to be minor. It is now clear that these viruses, once thought to cause only a common cold, can also cause pneumonia in adults [42] . All these viruses are common causes of sporadic cases or outbreaks of community-acquired infections and can be fatal in immunosuppressed patients and the elderly [43] . Thus, there is still much work that needs to be done in characterizing the effects of these new pathogens.

Over the past two decades, virus isolation and serology have been the mainstay of clinical laboratory diagnosis for respiratory virus infections. Because of the limited sensitivity of these methods, co-pathogen rates have generally been low. As expected, with the development of new diagnostic methods based on real-time PCR many more co-pathogens are being detected. Co-pathogen infections were found in 503 of the 2361 (21.3%) positive patients, and the frequency of the causative pathogens was similar to that among the primary pathogens with the exception of HBoV, Table 2 . Distribution of pathogen-positive patients among different age groups. HCoV-OC43 and HMPV (Figure 1) , with HMPV occurring less as a co-infection than HBoV and HCoV-OC43. The clinical relevance of detection of co-pathogens in pneumonia, and the association with severe illness, is uncertain [44] [45] [46] [47] . Viral-viral interaction in vivo is poorly understood. Viruses might interact indirectly or directly with each other, resulting in complementation or inhibition. In one study, children with pneumonia caused by co-pathogenic infection with HBoV and other viruses suffered more wheezing than those with viral pneumonia associated with only one pathogen [48] . In general, ARI occurs mostly in children under the age of 5 [6, 47] . In our study, 87.5% (3713/4242) of the patients were less than 5 years old. No significant difference was found in positivity rate (p = 0.338) and co-pathogen rate (p = 0.117) among different age groups (Table 2) . However, most pathogens showed significant differences in age prevalence with the exception of PIV1 (p = 0.239), HCoV-OC43 (p = 0.077), and pathogens for which there were too few positive samples to analyze such as PIV4, 229E, NL63, HKU1 and CP. Four age group distribution patterns could be observed as shown in Figure 2 . In general, influenza virus (infA and infB) increased with age, while RSV declined as age increased (Figure 2A and 2B) . The attack rate of influenza virus was typically highest in school-age children and daycare populations as has been shown in previous reports [49] [50] [51] [52] . This probably represents the higher intensity of transmission behavior in this population coupled with a relatively low rate of immunity. RSV is a cause of pediatric hospital admissions for LRI in most areas of the world. Most severe disease occurs in children aged under one year, with a peak occurring between 2 and 5 months of age, as indicated previously [52] [53] [54] . In addition, evidence suggests that RSV LRIs are associated with persistent diminished airway size in part owing to altered regulation of airway tone.

Significant differences in age distribution were seen in influenza and RSV (p,0.001), also in seven other pathogens EV, ADV, PIV2, PIV3, HBoV, HMPV and MP (p#0.009) ( Table 2) , and different age groups showed different distribution peaks ( Figure 2 ). This was consistent with previous serologic and epidemiologic studies of these pathogens [20, 22, 31, 33, 40, [55] [56] [57] . For the seven remaining pathogens no statistical differences in age distribution or few positive samples were found to analyze.

ARI is a complex and diverse group of diseases; it is difficult to identify the pathogen from clinical symptoms. Despite many advances, further studies are still needed to better understand the role of different pathogens in the cause and pathogenesis of ARI, especially in developing countries. The data from this work might be useful for advance warning of ARI and for development of effective vaccines.

A Consensus Action Agenda for Achieving the National Health Information Infrastructure,"A b s t r a c t Background: Improving the safety, quality, and efficiency of health care will require immediate and ubiquitous access to complete patient information and decision support provided through a National Health Information Infrastructure (NHII).","and maintaining balance with their personal lives. The current practice of medicine ''. . .depends upon the decisionmaking capacity and reliability of autonomous individual practitioners, for classes of problems that routinely exceed the bounds of unaided human cognition.'' 1 Medical errors and suboptimal quality of care are an inevitable consequence of a health care system based on these unrealistic expectations. Recent reports from the Institute of Medicine (IOM) 2,3 and others 4,5 document safety and quality problems and clearly indicate that major improvements will require the application of information technology (IT) to provide physicians with immediate and effective access to both information about individual patients and current medical knowledge at the point of care. 6 For example, computerized physician order entry (CPOE) reduced charges in one institution by 12.7% and costs by 13.1% 7 and decreased serious medication errors by 55%. 8 A recently published estimate of the potential benefits from universal use of ambulatory CPOE projected substantial improvements in quality of care along with national savings of $44 billion per year. 9 The National Health Information Infrastructure (NHII) concept has evolved over several decades as medical informatics professionals implemented individual and enterprise-wide clinical information systems and explored the implications of extending such systems throughout the entire health care continuum. The widespread application of computer-based records in health care was recommended as early as 1991 by the IOM, which called them ''an essential technology for patient care.'' 10 This report was updated in 1997 11 and followed by the IOM's ''To Err Is Human'' report in 1999, which focused the nation's attention on the problem of medical errors. 2 Since then, several additional national expert panels have advocated widespread application of health IT. 3, [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] Health IT should deliver complete medical information immediately for patient care when and where needed, including both patient-specific information and relevant decision support based on the latest scientific findings and guidelines. The set of organizing principles, systems, standards, procedures, and policies needed to achieve this vision, known as the NHII, would allow care providers to concentrate their efforts on applying judgment and experience to the clinical problem at hand based on complete information, rather than depending on potentially fallible memory applied to incomplete patient data. With presentlyavailable Internet and encryption technologies, patients with chronic illnesses can be monitored at home and can seek information to educate themselves about their problems. Also, facilitating access to electronic patient records by public health authorities and legitimate researchers under appropriate privacy protections could enable the development of population-based strategies to improve primary care as well as surveillance for diseases such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) or bioterrorist events.

The National Committee on Vital and Health Statistics (NCVHS), the statutory federal advisory committee to the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) for information policy and strategy, described a vision and plan for the NHII in its 2001 report, ''Information for Health,'' which asserts that ''implementation of the NHII will have a dramatic impact on the effectiveness, efficiency, and overall quality of health and health care in the United States.'' 14 More recently, the IOM reported that future improvements in the quality of health care depend on the development of NHII, which therefore should be ''the highest priority for all health care stakeholders.'' 16 To accomplish the goal of ''anytime, anywhere medical care information and decision support,'' at least five requirements must be met at any point of care: (1) immediate availability of the complete medical record (compiled from all sources); (2) up-to-date decision support; (3) selective reporting (e.g., for public health); (4) use of tools to facilitate care delivery (e.g., e-prescribing); and (5) patient consent for access to information. 17 The NHII therefore includes not only electronic health record (EHR) systems for all providers, but also the ability to exchange information among them and their patients to ensure that all the data for a given patient are available at the point of care at the time of decision.

While the NHII concept is not novel, recent developments in IT and successful demonstrations of community-wide health information exchange clearly indicate that it is now both feasible and realistic. The continued improvement in the price/performance ratio of computer systems, the transition of the Internet from a largely academic communications network to a nearly ubiquitous utility used daily by millions, and the growing sophistication of clinical information systems have all helped to transform NHII from an appealing but far-distant prospect to a near-term achievable goal. Indeed, in at least two communities, Indianapolis, Indiana, 18 and Santa Barbara County, California, 19 community health information exchange systems are now operational and beginning to deliver the benefits of widespread timely access to patient information. In another setting, the New England Healthcare EDI Network (NEHEN), a regional exchange processing more than one million administrative transactions per month, is producing significant savings for participating providers and payers. 20 The NHII vision is increasingly important in light of the current nationwide efforts to improve public health preparedness. The same infrastructure that facilitates improved patient care can also be used to provide the information needed for earlier detection of bioterrorism and other adverse health events, as well as to monitor the results of remediation efforts. The United Kingdom's National Health Service is investing eight billion pounds to accomplish such an objective. 21 Other nations, such as Canada and Australia, are on a similar path.

Based on testimony from a wide spectrum of health care industry representatives, NCVHS recommended a voluntary approach to NHII development 14 -the approach DHHS is taking in its efforts to promote and encourage NHII. Consistent with this approach, DHHS convened key health care system stakeholders to develop a national consensus action agenda at the NHII 03 meeting held in Washington, DC, from June 30 to July 2, 2003. We summarize the results of that meeting in this report.

Each of the eight members of the organizing committee, convened and chaired by one of us (WAY), assumed responsibility for one of the specific topic areas (or tracks) identified for consideration (Table 1 ) by first recruiting other experts to assist in developing draft recommendations and facilitating the discussions at the stakeholder meeting. Each track developed a draft document that the organizing committee circulated in advance to meeting participants. These documents included a statement of the present situation and a vision for the future, and suggested recommendations or a framework for recommendations to make the transition to the desired state. While the background documents were used as the basis for initial discussions at the meeting, they were not necessarily adopted by the participants as part of the final recommendations. Participants included both the dissemination of clinical information systems and the interoperability among those systems in the definition of NHII, but these two concepts were not clearly differentiated.

At the meeting itself, participants self-selected into one of the eight tracks and met for five one-hour breakout sessions consisting of facilitated discussions leading to development of final recommendations. In addition to the facilitators, each breakout session included several ''invited experts'' selected by the track chairs. Because of the large number of participants (more than 580), six of the eight tracks were divided arbitrarily into two separate groups that independently developed recommendations. Each breakout group presented its report at the final sessions of the NHII 03 meeting. The organization of the meeting followed a previously used model. 22 Subsequent to the meeting, each track chair developed a summary of the recommendations from that track in consultation with the facilitators. The authors reviewed all the recommendations and reassigned them to meaningful categories based on their contents. We then organized these final categories into a reasonably coherent set of programmatic recommendations designed to facilitate the development of the NHII.

The attendees generated 102 recommendations for the NHII action agenda. As anticipated, recommendations from each breakout track were not limited to the topical focus originally identified for that track, but reflected the interdependence of key issues. The final clustering of recommendations resulted in 12 categories in four major topic areas: (1) management; (2) enablers; (3) implementation strategy; and (4) domains ( Table 2 ).

The attendees endorsed a collaborative governance model based on a public-private partnership, with specific foci in the areas of privacy, patient safety, and architecture. This model is favored to support voluntary cooperation among government and private-sector representatives. Participants also recommended the same public-private partnership model for communities developing local health information infrastructures (LHIIs) to make complete electronic medical records available within a specific jurisdiction.

The attendees clearly recognized the need to educate and communicate with both health care professionals and the public about NHII. The transition to a health care system based on electronic information will require changes in expectations and create varying degrees of confusion as new patterns of practice are developed. The availability of substantially complete information about patients at most clinical encounters will be a dramatic change from current practice, for example, and is likely to require significant adaptations in the methods that physicians use to review and evaluate patients. Clear understanding of NHII including its benefits and progress will be essential to address the anxieties that will naturally arise from this change process. Concerns about privacy are particularly sensitive. Since clinical practice will change, training programs for health professionals must also incorporate modern information systems to prepare trainees for practicing with NHII. There will also be substantial demands for health informatics professionals to lead and coordinate NHII development activities, so steps must be taken to strengthen and expand specialized training programs to assure an adequate supply. The critical need to increase our public health preparedness makes these educational issues even more urgent.

The attendees recommended the creation of a variety of shared information resources (e.g., knowledge about building community health information exchanges) to assist in the NHII development process. The objective of these is to facilitate rapid progress by effectively disseminating tools, techniques, and knowledge gained in each community throughout the nation. Some of the recommendations would require only the establishment of shared electronic communication facilities, while others await the establishment of specific standards (e.g., practice guideline dissemination).

Several groups indicated the need for metrics and goals to assess ongoing progress in the development of NHII, with funding closely tied to achievement of predefined milestones (such as participation of a substantial proportion of providers in a community). A theme of the recommendations was the application of uniform measures by LHIIs across the nation to enable consistent progress assessment. While improvements in patient safety, quality of care, and efficiency are the ultimate goals of NHII, implementers may need to rely on intermediate process measures in the early stages of its development.

Five of the eight breakout groups recommended the establishment of financial incentives. These recommendations fell into two major categories: funding for the initial investment in health IT to create NHII, and financial incentives to ensure its sustainability. The group concluded that the current reimbursement system does not provide sufficient incentives for acquisition and use of health IT and suggested multiple approaches to address this problem. Participants recognized that modernizing reimbursement policy would be key to sustainability of health IT, especially since substantial savings from improved efficiency are expected from the application of this technology. Since payment incentives for quality care depend on measurements most easily derived from EHR systems, quality incentives alone may be problematic prior to EHR system availability to provide those measures. Attendees identified linking financial incentives of all kinds to the use of standards as a key policy to promote interoperability.

Virtually every breakout group-regardless of topicproduced at least one recommendation related to data standards. This reflects both the centrality of standards to the NHII and the desire to move rapidly to build on recent progress in designating U.S. standards and in providing federal support for the maintenance and free dissemination of clinical vocabularies. Attendees placed high priority on increasing the use of designated standards-not only to enhance data exchange and aggregation, but also to generate the broad feedback needed to improve the standards. There were recommendations to promote early adoption of standards by federal agencies and to provide standard identifiers and codes as close as possible to the source of data, e.g., devices or test kits. Participants also agreed on the need to continue the existing standards designation processes, i.e., the Consolidated Health Informatics (CHI) Initiative 23 and implementation of the patient medical record information recommendations of the NCVHS 24 ; to provide adequate ongoing funding for standards development; to bolster standards maintenance processes to respond to feedback from increasing use; and to ensure that designated vocabulary and messaging standards work together as a coherent set.

Four of the breakout groups recommended attention to removing legal barriers to the development of NHII. For example, the anti-kickback and Stark statutes that may prohibit hospitals from giving technology to their referring physicians (to prevent improper influence on referrals) can impede certain desirable investments in health IT. Specifically, state and federal laws that could affect the architecture, development, and/or implementation of NHII need to be evaluated. Guided by this evaluation, legal barriers that constrain investment and information sharing should be removed. The legal infrastructure should be updated to facilitate NHII, rather than inhibiting its development.

Seven of the eight breakout groups recommended the establishment of community demonstration projects. The primary reason for this local/regional approach is that medical care itself is primarily a local service, with the exception of cross-country consultations. The community approach provides a manageable implementation project with participants who have the shared motivation of improving health care in their own geographic area. The sometimes difficult compromises required for agreements to facilitate sharing of health information (e.g., between competitors) are also more easily made at a community level, where all involved have a common and easily perceived interest in improving health care for themselves and their neighbors. The attendees suggested that regional steering committees would be the best organizational entities to build these community health information infrastructures. An incremental approach to data exchange and interoperability was recommended to minimize disruption from overly rapid change. Linkages among these regional steering committees should be established to promote sharing of lessons learned so that best practices can be developed and disseminated.

These demonstrations should be built on the standards and architecture coordinated by an Architecture Task Force (ATF). Demonstrations would serve several purposes, including (1) feedback to the ATF that will help evolve the standards and architecture; (2) organizational and implementation models that other communities can follow; (3) operational LHIIs that will become the foundation for the NHII; and (4) test beds for experimenting with more advanced functions and approaches. These demonstrations would start with reference implementations of standards and architectural approaches that would eventually be reviewed and adopted by the ATF. Reference implementations that work ''on the ground'' in real environments are critical tests of standards and architecture. The scope of the demonstrations will need to be carefully managed to ensure that the needs of all constituencies, including consumers and public health, are addressed.

The group recommended creating an ATF to encourage and guide the adoption and evolution of relevant standards and establish the models LHIIs will use to meet the requirements of all community stakeholders. This task force's role is not envisioned as defining the standards or architecture, but rather coordinating and formally adopting or approving the work of volunteer groups that will create the standards and architecture. These functions will be based on architectural principles it develops (e.g., as proposed in Table 3 ). Evaluating and refining these models will also be a critical ATF task because the totality of uses and demands for the NHII is not yet completely understood.

The issue of unique identifiers was the subject of recommendations from four of the breakout groups. All NHII activities require the ability to identify information that relates to specific individuals, particularly when linking data from multiple sources into a single record for delivery at the point of care. The congressional prohibition against creation of a national unique health care identifier reflects the substantial concern in the general population that use of such an identifier would increase the risk of privacy violations. The recommended approaches to solving this problem varied among the breakout groups. The architecture group recommended that NHII development proceed without a unique national health identifier for individuals, but that mechanisms used for effective patient identification be reviewed. The consumer health group asked for resolution of the patient identification issue, without being specific about how the problem should be solved. The research group asked for the establishment of patient linkage variables and methodology for research purposes, but noted that less than 100% accuracy would be adequate for most clinical research. Finally, the safety and quality group specifically recommended a new unique national patient identifier and asked for the implementation of a national unique identifier for providers (as already being implemented as part of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act [HIPAA]) to ensure proper authentication of health care professionals requesting patient information.

Three of the breakout groups made consumer health recommendations in three categories: (1) creation of the personal health record (PHR), a basic platform for personal access to NHII information; (2) development of associated tools to increase the usefulness of the PHR; and (3) evaluation of the usefulness of the PHR. It was recommended that PHRs be available at no charge to consumers from a trusted authority. Efforts should be made to promote the development of e-health tools, for example, to link the PHR to relevant electronic health information resources (e.g., MEDLINE). The PHR should support both health alerts (e.g., warnings and notifications of newly available relevant information) and decision support (e.g., information resources to assist consumers in evaluating their treatment options) for consumers, with linkages to their health care professionals. Efforts to support the health information needs of consumers should be accompanied by ongoing evaluation of the role of individuals in controlling and managing their own health information.

Clearly, the availability of health information in electronic form could provide substantial benefits for clinical research in general, dramatically improving both efficiency and effectiveness by eliminating the need to create expensive customized information systems to capture clinical data for every individual clinical research protocol. However, the recommendations from the attendees in two of the breakout groups primarily focused on research about methods, approaches, and results of activities related specifically to the NHII itself, e.g., measuring the costs and benefits of EHRs. The attendees recommended that $1 billion of funding per year be allocated for research relating health IT to quality of care and patient safety. Such research would include evaluation of the impact of information systems on safety and quality; improved methods of adverse event detection using electronic medical records; evaluation of existing published studies of privacy in relation to NHII; assessment of individual perceptions and perspectives on the privacy of health information; and development of methods for communicating medical knowledge within the NHII to ensure its timely and effective use in patient care. This includes development of effective methods for representation and distribution of care guidelines. Attendees also recommended the establishment of an ongoing ethical, legal, and social issues (ELSI) program for NHII, analogous to that for the Human Genome Project, to ensure ongoing attention to issues such as privacy.

Significant improvements in the quality and efficiency of health care are achievable if physicians and other providers are supported with readily accessible information about their patients and the most current medical knowledge through the NHII. The availability of information alone is not sufficient; it must be in a form that allows clinicians to interact with it easily and efficiently in their day-to-day practice. The recommended approach to NHII through the development of community health information exchanges provides physicians with substantial opportunities to participate locally in the transition to a health care system enhanced with modern IT. The immediate availability of patient information and medical knowledge at the point of care will allow clinicians to exercise their judgment more effectively than ever before for the benefit of their patients.

There are several limitations in the methodology used to develop this report. First, of necessity, the authors analyzed and reorganized the recommendations subsequent to the meeting and without additional input from the participants. Also, in the interest of clarity, the authors excluded some very specific recommendations that are subsumed by those described. The authors alone organized the recommendations into the 12 categories and four major topic areas. Therefore, while the input for this report came from the broad spectrum of stakeholders present at the meeting, additional feedback from stakeholders at subsequent NHII meetings will test the validity of the organized synthesis presented.

Despite these limitations, the recommendations from NHII 03 represent the best information now available regarding the approach to NHII implementation desired by the health care and health IT community. Taken as a whole, the recommendations delineate a relatively coherent program consisting of establishment of key organizations, development of metrics and goals, use of standards, and extensive community-based demonstration projects. The stakeholders also stressed the need for financial incentives, shared resources, and education to facilitate the development of the NHII.

Since the NHII 03 meeting, issues relating to NHII development have received increasing attention in both the private sector and government. In April 2004, President Bush issued an Executive Order creating the new position of National Coordinator for Health Information Technology reporting to the DHHS Secretary. 25 The National Coordinator is responsible for developing and implementing a strategic plan that will ''guide the nationwide implementation of interoperable health information technology in both the public and private health care sectors that will reduce medical errors, improve quality, and produce greater value for health care expenditures.'' 25 In early May 2004, DHHS Secretary Thompson announced the appointment of David J. Brailer, MD, PhD, as the National Coordinator. 26 It is anticipated that these actions at the highest levels of government and the focus brought to these activities by the new National Coordinator in DHHS will accelerate progress towards the NHII.

The recommendations of the health care stakeholders from the NHII 03 meeting are already providing valuable guidance to current NHII development activities. For example, the focus of current federal funding for NHII demonstration projects uses the local and regional approach recommended by attendees. Subsequent national meetings will serve to further refine and modify these consensus views, as well as develop specific implementation strategies. Continuing collaborative efforts toward NHII should maximize the ability to achieve a safer, more effective, and more efficient health care system rapidly through the widespread adoption of health IT.

Risk Management and Healthcare Policy Dovepress Critical role of ethics in clinical management and public health response to the West Africa Ebola epidemic,"The devastation caused by the Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in West Africa has brought to the fore a number of important ethical debates about how best to respond to a health crisis. These debates include issues related to prevention and containment, management of the health care workforce, clinical care, and research design, all of which are situated within the overarching moral problem of severe transnational disadvantage, which has very real and specific impacts upon the ability of citizens of EVD-affected countries to respond to a disease outbreak. Ethical issues related to prevention and containment include the appropriateness and scope of quarantine and isolation within and outside affected countries. The possibility of infection in health care workers impelled consideration of whether there is an obligation to provide health services where personal protection equipment is inadequate, alongside the issue of whether the health care workforce should have special access to experimental treatment and care interventions under development. In clinical care, ethical issues include the standards of care owed to people who comply with quarantine and isolation restrictions. Ethical issues in research include appropriate study design related to experimental vaccines and treatment interventions, and the sharing of data and biospecimens between research groups. The compassionate use of experimental drugs intersects both with research ethics and clinical care. The role of developed countries also came under scrutiny, and we concluded that developed countries have an obligation to contribute to the containment of EVD infection by contributing to the strengthening of local health care systems and infrastructure in an effort to provide fair benefits to communities engaged in research, ensuring that affected countries have ready and affordable access to any therapeutic or preventative interventions developed, and supporting affected countries on their way to recovery from the impact of EVD on their social and economic lives.","The magnitude of the recent Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in West Africa has been unprecedented in many ways. This is the first time an EVD outbreak has occurred in West Africa although EVD outbreaks in Africa have been documented since 1976. This outbreak is unique in its size, duration, and spatial extent. 1 It has generated intense debates on appropriate international responses to infectious disease emergencies, the processes of researching new treatments and vaccines during an epidemic outbreak, and standards for prevention and care. These debates have also focused national and international attention on disparities in health care standards between developed and developing countries, on differing applications of ethical standards governing the right to health between developed and developing countries arising from these disparities, and the ethical responsibilities of various agencies in the current and future infectious disease outbreaks.

In this paper, we analyzed the ethical considerations that arose from the clinical management and public health responses to EVD outbreak in West Africa, identified the similarities and differences in the application of these ethical standards in developed and developing countries, and considered the implications of our findings for future global health emergency responses. Our analysis is based on a reflection of the social-ecological model widely used in health behavior research and practice to assess the multiple levels that influence a health issue. More specifically, this model is unique because it allows the researcher or practitioner to identify the individual, interpersonal, organizational, community, and public policy factors that contribute to a particular health issue or event so that health professionals and/or researchers may identify the best intervention or research methods. Therefore, we will detail the ethical issues that impact the Ebola epidemic from a social-ecological model analysis.

The West African EVD epidemic resulted in the death of five times as many people as every other known EVD outbreak combined. 2 It is also the largest ever emergency operation in the 70 year history of the World Health Organization (WHO). 3 Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Guinea bore the brunt of the epidemic, though cases were also reported in Nigeria, Mali, Senegal, the United States, and Spain. Only three infections occurred outside West Africa (two in the US and one in Spain). At the time of the EVD epidemic in West Africa, another EVD epidemic caused by an unrelated EVD strain occurred in the Democratic Republic of Congo in August 2014, with 66 cases and 49 deaths. This was contained, and the country has remained EVD free since November 2014. The West African region had been on the brink of being declared EVD-free several times but for instances of new case identification in Sierra Leone 4 and Liberia. 5 The region was finally declared EVD free on January 14, 2016. 6 There are, however, potentials for multiple flare-ups in the region as some survivors could sexually transmit infection. 7, 8 The West Africa epidemic was different in many respects to past EVD epidemics. First, it is the largest and longest EVD outbreak in history, 3 involving several developed and developing countries. Fears of cross-border transmission resulted in over 50 countries around the world issuing travel restrictions to and from EVD-affected countries. 9 Second, the epidemic garnered international support, including significant investment in the research and development of vaccines 10 and therapies 11, 12 for EVD infection, although the response was slow and arguably inadequate. 13, 14 Third, it stimulated debates at many international, regional, and national fora about compassionate access to experimental regimens for therapy during epidemics and alternative clinical trial designs to test the efficacy and effectiveness of vaccines and therapies. The debates resulted in guidelines being developed, 15 and considerations for revised ethical guidance on clinical trial design and sharing of biospecimens and data. 16 Actions are also being taken to institute structural measures for improved emergency response capacities around the world. 3 One of the ethical debates was the overarching moral problem of severe transnational disadvantage, which has very real and specific impacts upon the ability of citizens in Liberia, Guinea, and Sierra Leone to proactively exercise their right to health under normal conditions, let alone when their countries were in the grip of an epidemic. 17 Of note, Liberia had 51 doctors for its population of 4.3 million people. 18 The drastically under-resourced health care structures and systems in these countries constitute moral problems in themselves and both heighten and complicate the other ethical issues that arose in relation to the epidemic. Accordingly, we reviewed the literature and discuss ethical considerations in the West African EVD outbreak from a perspective that is grounded in a critique of the social and structural elements that contributed to the deprivation of the individuals and communities that bore the brunt of the epidemic. These include ethical analysis of public health measures such as quarantine, isolation, protection of health care workers, and travel restrictions. We also analyzed the debates that had taken place regarding research ethics, including the conduct of research during public health emergencies, the ethics of randomization, standards of care both within and outside research studies, and the sharing of biospecimens and related data internationally. Finally we considered the ethical issues surrounding the topic of EVD survivors.

Three months elapsed (from December 6, 2013 to March 10, 2014) between the first death now attributed to the West African outbreak, and the first notification of national health authorities. By this time, there were clusters of infection in four districts. 19 The recent histories of civil war, unstable government, and political violence in the affected countries negatively impacted the ability of the health systems to meet the care and containment demands of an exploding public 

Ethics, Ebola, and public health health crisis. Also, the civil distrust of and misgivings toward the government, due to long years of neglect of health services and systems, slowed down the public response. 18, 20, 21 At the time of the outbreak, many international donor agencies that had handled past emergency health problems were establishing fledgling transitional systems intended to reduce donor dependence in the region and were therefore not operating at maximum potential. [22] [23] [24] [25] Also, individuals had grown to depend on alternative health care providers in view of the dilapidated health care structures and systems. 25 Thus, the initial calls by the government to take precautions against EVD infection were treated with levity. The disease was unknown in the region, and the public health messages stigmatized cherished traditional practices as ""risky behaviors"", arising from the logical clinical and epidemiological framings of contagion. 26 For example, the cultural practice of burial rites, which were designed as a means of parting with the dead through a show of dignity and respect, were now labeled ""bad"", and people were requested to make immediate and extensive changes in their core practices and ways of relating and interacting to curb EVD spread. 26 Also, the sudden urgent need for clean water for regular hand washing brought with it its own challenges as access to regular clean water was limited. 27 Public myths and misconceptions soon grew from the government actions, with many believing that the government was merely interested in sourcing for new foreign aid for further personal enrichment. 28 With increasing cases of EVD infection, poor standards of care in health facilities, 29, 30 high case fatality, 31 and large numbers of people turned back from treatment centers, 32 many individuals also had to become personally responsible for their individual care. Care of the sick at home became the backup for managing many cases, 33, 34 and in such situations, individuals had to learn to provide care for infected and affected loved ones while ensuring personal protection.

Quarantine helps to contain new infections during an infectious disease outbreak. 35 One of the criticisms of the initial outbreak response was that the quarantine was poorly managed. Koch 35 and Barbisch et al 36 argue that quarantine of whole communities could be ethically justified, particularly if the containment area included the entire area within which individuals from a community would usually travel. Koch 35 describes this as a spatial focus for quarantine rather than one focused on a targeted population. It allows for better concentration on humanitarian medicine for the infected, as far greater concentration of resources would be available for a smaller pool of infected people. A call for ""spatial"" quarantine for EVD containment may be at odds with the ""principle of least infringement"", an ethical principle applied in public health contexts to curtail the use of liberty-restricting interventions to the least restrictive action required to meet a public health goal. But when the public health goal is containment of an infectious disease to meet the dual goals of enabling the best possible care for the sick within the quarantine zone, as well as to reduce the spread of infection, such a measure could be ethically justified. Restrictions should therefore be done in a way that is relevant, legitimate, and necessary, and stakeholders should be fully informed about the risks and benefits, especially as they affects their health, well-being, and personal liberty. 37 Those quarantined should also not suffer unfair economic penalties. 37 The tension between quarantine as a public health measure and individual rights to privacy, liberty, and freedom of movement is well recognized, and the need to strike a balance between the utilitarian aim of promoting public health, on the one hand, and libertarian aims of protecting privacy and freedom of movement on the other hand, have been widely discussed. [37] [38] [39] There is a reasonable expectation that when people are asked to surrender their liberty through quarantine, there is a reciprocal obligation to provide adequate care for individuals who have complied. When such care is not forthcoming or when it is inadequate, it can be argued that the individual, who is legally required to report for quarantine, does not have a moral obligation to do so.

For a situation like the EVD epidemic where scientific uncertainty about the disease was pervasive, respect for the rights and dignity of affected persons required commitment to planning to address the associated challenges. 38, 39 The lack of consideration for the needs of the most affected individuals when quarantines were instituted during the EVD epidemic affected the success of quarantines measures to quickly contain the epidemic: 3 the associated unmet basic needs and economic constraints resulting in the need for food were common reasons given for the breach when affected cities were ""shut down"", 35 thereby limiting the effectiveness of instituted quarantine.

As part of the ""fear"" response to EVD in the USA, asymptomatic health care workers returning from West Africa were required to be quarantined for 21 days. 9 This form of quarantine is similar to one proposed by American law Risk Management and Healthcare Policy 2016:9 submit your manuscript | www.dovepress.com

Folayan et al professor Gostin 39 who, in another infectious disease context, suggested that citizens may be forcefully excluded from returning to their home for a period of time when an infectious individual poses a risk to others on international conveyances. We consider, however, that the probable benefits of a restrictive measure for health care workers returning to their home country are not sufficient to justify any burden placed on individuals through the restriction of their liberty, taking into consideration any probability. 40 Subsequently, the quarantine order for health care workers returning to their homeland from the EVD zone was deemed counterproductive and ""morally wrong"" by the President's Bioethics Commission. 41 The action was also not evidence based, infringed the right to liberty of affected individuals, 42 fueled stigma, 43, 44 and constituted a roadblock to the ongoing EVD response. 45 It imposed barriers to the movement of health care workers to and from affected areas and impeded their ability to contribute their skills to the management of the public health emergency. 45 

Isolation of individuals sick with EVD during the period when they could transmit infection is an appropriate public health response. Confinement should, however, be in safe places, and isolated individuals should have access to adequate health care, food, clothing, and means of communication with families and friends. 39 The appalling state of many isolation units 46 and the poor treatment of infected persons in West Africa 47 was a disincentive for anyone to self-report at EVD treatment units. Sick patients in West Africa may not be morally obliged to seek isolation, regardless of the law, knowing that isolation likely implies dying alone without family and friends. WHO 3 noted this as one of its main challenges for EVD containment: people continued to stay at home and secretly bury their dead even when sufficient treatment beds and burial teams were available. Sick patients in developed countries will, however, be morally obliged to seek isolation, since optimal care will be provided in well-equipped care centers.

For a situation like the EVD outbreak where no curative medicine was available and where access to a reasonable standard of supportive care was the best that treatment facilities could offer, equitable distribution of such care is of great ethical importance, given the public health imperative for people to show up at treatment units. No preferential treatment should be offered on the basis of profession as a show of respect for the rights and dignity of infected persons.

Concerns about the potential for EVD to travel across borders resulted in travel restrictions in many countries, and screening for fever was recommended at the airports in Liberia, Guinea, and Sierra Leone and instituted in many airports worldwide. 9 The possibility of Ebola being used for bioterrorism intensified concern about cross-border movement of people who may have been exposed to EVD. 48 Instituting travel bans far from the Ebola epicenter, however, defies the public health ethics principle of least infringement, which recognizes the need to respect and protect individual and community needs, interests, rights, and liberties and to ensure that these are curtailed to the minimum degree required to curtail a public health threat. 41 The international laws recognize the right to freedom of movement to leave and return to one's country of origin. 49, 50 While restricting travel of persons infected with EVD may seem intuitively right to contain the epidemic, such restriction would reduce the opportunity for medical evacuations, which was demonstrated to increase rates of survival. 51 In addition, allowing travel in and out of Ebola-affected nations facilitated the movement of humanitarian workers and supportive materials for EVD prevention, care, and infection control.

Ethical dilemmas that informed health care workers' response to the epidemic Health professionals of all kinds, from a village midwife to hospital doctors, featured in the transmission chains. 52 The poor infrastructure and support systems for sick persons 53 resulted in health care workers in some facilities being afraid to provide care 54 -a reasonable fear, given the high number of infections affecting the health force. 55 Yakubu et al 56 recognized the fundamental issues that underscored health workers concerns and possible reluctance to offer services during the epidemic in West Africa and advocated that health care workers are under no obligation to provide medical care for patients with EVD when the government cannot provide them with required personal protective equipment and training to play their role safely and effectively.

For health professionals working outside the West African region, the risk of exposure was remote, but nonetheless did occur due to people with EVD either traveling while ill 57, 58 or being medically evacuated. 57, 59 Some of the health professionals who handled patients' care were not adequately trained to provide care for patients with EVD and were left vulnerable to infection. 60 The infection of foreigners who traveled to the West African region resulted in considerable debate about which categories of health care workers are obliged to provide care and which are not, and whether there are particular medical procedures that should be barred for patients with EVD because of the risk posed. 63, 64 In addition, public concerns focused on the obligation of employers to ensure provision of adequate equipment for health care workers faced with the risk for EVD infection. Debate over the optimal design of protective equipment 65 resulted in protocols recommending different levels of respiratory protection 66 and detailed training on the use of personal protective equipment.

The EVD outbreak catalyzed a flurry of scientific activity to consider investigational compounds under development and to hasten their pathway into human trials. In 2014, the Ethics Advisory Committee to the WHO met and issued a statement that supported the use of unregistered interventions in the EVD epidemic. 15 This gave credence both to EVD research efforts and to compassionate use of unproven agents. There were intense debates about the appropriate design and conduct of EVD vaccine and drug trials. Much of this debate centered on the ethics of randomization in the midst of an epidemic with high case fatality. [67] [68] [69] [70] [71] Those in favor of randomized clinical trial argued that EVD clinical trials present a situation of genuine uncertainty, and therefore justified randomization to experimental treatment versus placebo. [72] [73] [74] Also, drug registration for licensure would require data generated through randomized clinical trials. 70, 71 Those in favor of alternative trial designs 67,68,75-78 noted that ethical standards guiding therapeutic research should be flexible enough to give the dying ""a chance at rescue"". 78 Also, alternative research designs facilitated access of persons to experimental products to reduce the risk of fatality, especially with promising experimental products. 67, 78, 79 The Ebola ca Suffit trial provided evidence on the suitability of an alternative vaccine trial design to generate evidence on the effectiveness of a vaccine. 80 Ethical dilemmas informing policy response to the epidemic Within a public health emergency, values defined by public health ethics -an overriding priority afforded to ""greater good"" considerations 57,81 -should take precedence over individual concerns, according to ethicist Dawson. 82 Dawson was particularly concerned that the WHO Advisory Panel meeting held in September 2014 83 focused on ""individualistic"" values -the use of unregistered interventions for clinical care or prevention -rather than on the ""old fashioned public health methods"" such as quarantine, contact tracing, and social distancing. 82 In response, Haire and Folayan 79 argued that access to treatment, whether experimental or not, should not be separated from ""public health ethics"", given that community support for and compliance with public health containment measures requires some reciprocity. Also, some hope of an effective treatment, however remote, could assist individuals and communities in accepting otherwise unwelcome public health measures.

Some scholars argued that developed countries have an ethical obligation to support countries in the EVD zone. 20 Countries in the EVD zone were in dire need of support to control an outbreak that was out of hand, and such support would be at minimal cost to the developed country. 84, 85 As sponsors of EVD therapeutic research, the developed countries had an ethical obligation to contribute to the containment of EVD infection by strengthening local health care systems and infrastructure in an effort to provide fair benefits to communities that are engaged in research. 20 Also, recognizing that relationships with others will inevitably require mutuality and reciprocity implies that developed countries need to provide support for affected West African countries at their time of need. 45 The strengthening of the health care systems to enhance EVD response and support current and future research should be considered a social response to the needs of developing countries by developed countries. 20 Ethical considerations on sharing of data and biospecimens for EVD response

The collection of biospecimens is critically important for advancing research into treatment and preventative interventions and for improving understanding of the pathogenesis and genetic variation of EVD. 86 As such, specimens must necessarily be collected during an outbreak and shared with other researchers working on developing treatment and vaccines long after the epidemic is over. This raises ethical issues about informed consent. While informed consent ought to be obtained before taking any specimen, caring for very ill people focused on survival in often suboptimal treatment units makes this difficult. Also, there are concerns about obtaining informed consent from minors who may not have parents or guardian present while quarantined, or the parents may have died as a result of the epidemic. In 

Folayan et al the case of deceased people, the USA regulations do not require consent before taking biospecimens. It is, however, recognized that deceased people may have had interests and values regarding the use of their specimens that should be respected. 86 Similarly, the USA does not require consent for use of deidentified specimens, but the ethical concerns still hold, since genomic research, where data cannot truly be deidentified given that every human genome is unique, is possible. 48 Jecker et al 87 therefore identified the need for additional guidance on the challenges of obtaining informed consent for collecting and sharing biospecimens in the context of a public health emergency.

Concerns about sharing of benefits accruing from biospecimen and data sharing has been raised in view of the competitive and privatized nature of EVD research and drug development and the reality that most of the EVD-related research would need to be conducted in high-tech Biological Safety Level-4 laboratories found more readily in developed countries. 88 Lessons from the 2009 influenza A (H1N1) vaccine development process, and how financially empowered economies bought up manufactured vaccines, are recent examples that cause concern about future access to EVD treatments and vaccine. 89 It is proposed that before data sharing of any kind occurs, there should be clear and equitable benefit sharing arrangements created through legally enforceable contractual obligations to ensure that people in EVD-affected countries have ready and affordable access to any therapeutic or preventative interventions that result from research. This proposal is in line with the principles enshrined in the 2011 Pandemic Influenza Preparedness Framework 90 and respects the principle of reciprocity. 91

For EVD survivors, a different set of dynamics come into play. Many survivors are left impoverished. EVD infection means that personal property is confiscated with little or no support to replace these assets upon recovery. 92 Misconception about the likelihood of contagion of EVD post-recovery gives rise to stigma and discrimination resulting in many survivors not being able to retain their jobs or get new jobs. 93 The high demand for the blood of EVD survivors for therapeutic purposes meant that selling of blood, even in the black market, was a good means of income generation for many survivors. 94 The sale of blood and blood in exchange for income by the poor is a well-recognized practice in many countries, including those affected by the Ebola outbreak. 95 This consideration posed an ethical dilemma for the Global Emerging Pathogens Consortium when considering how to compensate blood donors for their research on use of EVD survivors' blood for EVD therapy research, recognizing that EVD survivors have a right to the income they make from sale of their blood. 96

The EVD epidemic resulted in extensive loss of life and property. Altogether, 26,350 persons were managed for EVD infection and 11,315 lives were lost. 97 The extensive casualty and the embargoes on travels and movements during the outbreak also affected trade and agriculture, resulting in food insecurity in affected countries. 98 The impact of the epidemic on education remains unmeasured, yet the fact that schooling was extensively disrupted would have short-, medium-, and long-term consequences at the individual, family, and community/national level. Extensive donor investment in the EVD response also has implications for funding of other research in the region as research funds were moved away from other disease areas to address the EVD emergency response needs. 99 The instituted infection control measures also affected social interactions, although the scope of impact of EVD epidemic on the social dynamic of affected countries remains largely unknown and would be difficult to measure because pre-epidemic data are rarely available due to the unpredictable nature of disease outbreaks. However, it is known that infectious diseases have severe impact on biodiversity. [100] [101] [102] The WHO's report on lessons learned from the 2014 EVD outbreak in West Africa 3 identified four big lessons all related to the structural interventions provided during the epidemic. The report failed to recognize the immense changes in the dynamics of life and livelihood of affected individuals, communities, and the country and the need to support affected countries on their way back from recovering from the social, environmental, cultural, and economic tolls of the epidemic. Such support would involve long-term commitment from international partners and donors. Unfortunately, the outcomes of such long-term support are difficult to measure. Yet, the people in West Africa impacted by EVD outbreak need such long-term support.

At the individual level, support is needed to help survivors resume normal lives and to address challenges such as emotional distress, health issues, loss of possessions, and difficulty regaining their livelihoods. 103 

Ethics, Ebola, and public health face stigma, rejection, loss of jobs, 104 and have to deal with posttraumatic stress disorders and health challenges associated with EVD. 105, 106 If affected countries organize their EVD surveillance systems in line with WHO requirements, 3 it will be possible to organize the provision of support for survivors in need. However, surveillance systems as an epidemiological measure and a potential tool for intervention come with ethical challenges. First, it limits privacy as names of persons with EVD diseases will need to be reported. The use of namebased surveillance for HIV infection 107 set the precedent for this public health measure. Such surveillance systems must however, be less intrusive. Affected communities need to be consulted on its importance, design and use, and the data must be used for legitimate purposes 39 only, such as providing relief materials for interested individuals, as we have identified.

While confidential handling of data may not be a challenge in developed countries, this will likely be so for countries in the EVD zone, which have poorly developed health systems in general and surveillance systems in particular. 108 This once again highlights the need for support to build the health systems in affected countries not just to be able to respond to the EVD epidemic but also respond appropriately to the management of infectious diseases in general. The absence of basic essential elements of public health is a recognized vector for EVD in affected countries. 28, 38 The call to strengthen health care systems in EVD-affected countries is an ethical and moral call.

Effective EVD responses require extensive consultations and discussions with communities on appropriate measures of and support for instituted mechanisms to respond to the epidemic. The privacy-limiting nature of name-reporting associated with the operations of surveillance systems to monitor EVD requires that the public be educated about this measure and consulted on how best to undertake contact tracing. EVD survivors should also be consulted about how best to institute surveillance and contact tracing systems that reduce the risk for stigma. 39 Social interventions at the community level include galvanizing support for members of the extended families who have adopted children orphaned by EVD. 109 The possibility of supporting prompt adoption of orphaned children by qualified persons should also be explored. International support programs or projects should not seek to subsume these community practices of orphaned and vulnerable chil-dren's support with attractive alternatives. Rather, safe local practices of child care should be promoted. 110 Ethical obligation for EVD response at the country level At the country level, it is the ethical obligation of governments and appropriate authorities to ensure that hospitals maintain resources and adequate health care professionals to isolate and treat new patients with EVD. With depleted numbers of experienced health care workers in EVD-affected countries resulting from the high case fatality rate (as high as 59%), 111 affected countries will need regional and international support to augment health care delivery for citizens beyond providing support for those infected with EVD. The global community needs to continue to support medical personnel to travel to affected countries to help provide medical care for the short and medium term while the country makes effort to train more medical staff. There have been such past practices between national governments through North-South Collaborations and South-South Collaborations. 112 Public policies on management and control of epidemiccausing infectious diseases in general, and EVD management and control specifically, need to be developed. For example, in the wake of the EVD outbreak in Nigeria, the national research ethics code was revised to allow for country access and use of experimental drugs on compassionate grounds for the management of EVD. The absence of this policy was a disincentive for the use of experimental drugs for Dr Sheik Humarr Khan in Sierra Leone. 113 Public health policies in developing countries would also need to be revised to address the obligations of health care personnel to work in the time of an infectious disease outbreak. Policies that can guide the scientific and ethical conduct of research at the time of a national emergency would also be helpful and a welcome development. Policies on isolation of infected persons and quarantine of affected persons need to be based on robust legal and ethical justification. For EVD, where the probability of transmission and severity of harm justifies the need to restrict movements of people for public health purposes, consultation and communication with affected communities on ""why"" and ""how"" to implement measures is an ethical imperative. The options for practicing quarantine and isolation should not create divides between social classes and result in unjust treatment of the poor, such as creating food insecurity. 38, 39 Resources should also be committed to providing support for those who lose income through isolation and quarantine, as equity requires that those who 

Folayan et al forgo their freedom for the public good through quarantine and isolation should be compensated. 39 A broad public debate in each country is, however, required on how best to achieve equity. The outcome of the debate should inform policy and guidelines development.

Ethical obligation for EVD response at the global level While travel advice and warnings about EVD-affected countries are welcome and appropriate global EVD public health responses, travel bans are not an effective response, but rather have significant negative consequences. Global solidarity for responding to a regional crisis can make significant difference to a health crisis at the individual, community, and national levels, as lessons from the field of HIV studies have demonstrated. The success of the US response to global HIV epidemics through its PEPFAR (President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief) program is a testimony to this. 113 US funding for the global HIV response is less than 1% of the annual budget. 114 Yet, this minor budgetary allocation has had tremendous impact on the epidemic in developing countries. The same could be done for EVD-affected countries in West Africa.

As we go into the future, one of the ethical responsibilities of the global community is ensuring prompt unconditional access of low-income countries to developed therapies for EVD management. EVD outbreaks could still occur in the future. In view of the health and social development challenges of countries affected by EVD, the focus of the EVD response in West Africa should be one that combines genuine respect for the dignity of people with the idea of human development. 115 This, therefore, requires that the global community should plan ahead for future outbreaks. While current EVD therapeutics are being developed by pharmaceutical companies and researchers in the North, plans need to be instituted for future access of these therapies by affected communities in the South. The WHO and appropriate entities like Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization need to start discussing modalities for future access to developed therapeutics ahead of product licensure and future outbreaks.

A global response to the EVD epidemic in West Africa is an ethical requirement of national, regional, and international governments in view of globalization and the diminishing relevance of national boundaries. The EVD outbreak dem-onstrated the magnitude of what can be achieved within a short time with global solidarity. We live in a time of fluid borders brought on by ease of travel, technological innovations, and an aggressive global media. This denies us the intellectual luxury of viewing global issues such as HIV infection, global warming, and, now, EVD from the narrow lens of a domestic crisis. It is a global crisis with impact at the individual, community, national, and international levels associated with ethical responsibilities for individuals, collectives, governments, and donor agencies.

"Regulatory Underpinnings of Global Health Security: FDA's Roles in Preventing, Detecting, and Responding to Global Health Threats","In February 2014, health officials from around the world announced the Global Health Security Agenda, a critical effort to strengthen national and global systems to prevent, detect, and respond to infectious disease threats and to foster stronger collaboration across borders. With its increasing global roles and broad range of regulatory responsibilities in ensuring the availability, safety, and security of medical and food products, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is engaged in a range of efforts in support of global health security. This article provides an overview of FDA's global health security roles, focusing on its responsibilities related to the development and use of medical countermeasures (MCMs) for preventing, detecting, and responding to global infectious disease and other public health emergency threats. The article also discusses several areas-antimicrobial resistance, food safety, and supply chain integrity-in which FDA's global health security roles continue to evolve and extend beyond MCMs and, in some cases, beyond traditional infectious disease threats.","I n February 2014, health officials from around the world announced the Global Health Security Agenda, a collaborative effort of governments and international organizations to protect citizens from the global threat of infectious diseases. 1 This agenda represents a critical effort to strengthen national and global systems to prevent, detect, and respond to infectious disease threats and to foster stronger collaboration across borders. 2, 3 Priority issues in the agenda include the threats of antimicrobial resistance, food safety, and biosecurity. 4 The concept of global health security is not a new one; it dates back centuries, with approaches to governance evolving over time. 5 In 2001, for example, the World Health Organization (WHO) World Health Assembly passed a resolution supporting the revision of the International Health Regulations (IHR), thus associating the concept of health security with infectious disease threats and IHR compliance. 6 The current agenda, announced over a decade later, reinforces the IHR (2005), encouraging countries to deepen their capacities to detect threats early, with the goal of keeping the impact of threats to a minimum, and to enhance their collaboration with others to mobilize resources and responses when needed. 7 In recent times, the global community has faced serious infectious disease threats, including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS); novel influenza virus strains such as H5N1, H1N1, and H7N9; Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV); and Ebola. The forces of globalization-travel, trade, migration, and modern livestock production, to name a few-are well-recognized as contributing to such health security threats, creating ecosystems in which new pathogens emerge and global connectivity through which they can spread rapidly. 8 These outbreaks, and the forces that contributed to their emergence, have prompted and sustained greater investments in disease surveillance capacity, new models for transnational collaboration, and medical products to mitigate such threats.

Although the full scope of its increasing global efforts is not often well understood, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is among the many players in the global health security field, given its numerous roles in ensuring the availability, safety, efficacy, and security of medical and food products. Given the growth in imports, and the complexity of the global marketplace, FDA is adapting from an agency with primarily domestic responsibilities to one that achieves its mission in a global context. New legislation such as the Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA; Public Law 111-353) and the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act (FDASIA; Public Law 112-144) have provided the agency with new authorities that will help to secure the safety and integrity of food and drugs, respectively, imported into and sold in the United States. FDA's vision is a global product safety net, involving collaboration with multiple stakeholders, that protects the health of consumers and patients in the United States and worldwide.

This article provides an overview of FDA's broad roles in global health security, focusing on its responsibilities related to the development and use of medical countermeasures (MCMs) for preventing, detecting, and responding to global infectious disease and other public health emergency threats. The article also discusses several areas in which FDA's global health security roles continue to evolve and extend beyond MCMs and, in some cases, beyond traditional infectious disease threats as outlined in the Global Health Security Agenda.

As a science-based and public health regulatory agency of the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), FDA is responsible for regulating and ensuring the safety of over $1 trillion in consumer goods in the United States. This equates to products accounting for over 20% of every consumer dollar spent on goods in the US. Among these consumer goods is a wide range of products, including medical (ie, drug, biologic/vaccine, and device), food, and tobacco products and cosmetics.

Ten years ago, FDA's regulatory roles primarily focused on overseeing a largely domestic market of medical products and foods. However, with increased reliance on global supply chains, the US faces a new range of challenges and threats to the safety of its drug and food products. FDA's international roles have thus expanded dramatically, with the number of FDA-regulated imported goods quadrupling over the past decade. For example, in 2013, approximately 29 million shipments of imported medical and food products entered the US, passing through US ports of entry from more than 300,000 facilities in 150 different countries through 130,000 importers. 9 Imports now account for approximately 40% of finished drugs and 80% of active pharmaceutical ingredients (API) in the US market. 9 Significantly, most of the product import increase is coming from countries with limited or inconsistent regulatory oversight. Numerous examples of quality and safety lapses exist. 10 For instance, counterfeit versions of cancer medications have reached the US. In 2012, counterfeit Avastin sold over the internet was found to have no active ingredient, compromising complex treatment regimens. 11 At the core of FDA's domestic and increasingly global responsibilities is a strong legal and regulatory foundation through the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic (FD&C) Act and the Public Health Service (PHS) Act, as amended over time to address evolving drug, food, and other product challenges, including those occurring at the global level. For example, FSMA provides FDA with new authorities to enhance the safety of the US food supply (eg, by modernizing the oversight of imported foods and guarding against intentional contamination), and FDASIA provides FDA with new authorities to protect the global drug supply chain (eg, by partnering with foreign regulatory authorities and strengthening enforcement tools). 12, 13 The medical and food products we consume and use are essential to securing health, ranging from the availability of safe and nutritious food, to vaccines for preventable diseases, pharmaceutical products to prevent or treat illness, and diagnostic devices to detect novel viruses. Well-functioning regulatory systems play an essential role in global health security through securing product supply chains and minimizing threats to product safety and quality, as well as advancing innovations to prevent and treat diseases. Yet, to date, regulatory functions along the continuum of threat prevention, detection, and response have not been central to the global health security dialogue. The following section summarizes FDA's MCM regulatory and other functions that support global health security in the context of emerging infectious disease and other health threats, including chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) threats.

The mitigation of emerging and ongoing public health emergency threats often requires the use of MCMs. Therefore, a critical component of global health security is having available safe and effective MCMs that can counter specific threats and ensuring that countermeasures can be deployed and administered as rapidly as needed before or during outbreaks, epidemics, and pandemics. Medical countermeasures are the THE FDA AND GLOBAL HEALTH SECURITY medical products-the drugs (eg, antibiotics), biologics (eg, vaccines), and devices (eg, in vitro diagnostics, or IVDs)aimed at countering the human health effects of CBRN and emerging infectious disease threats (eg, influenza pandemics), whether naturally, accidentally, or deliberately caused. FDA has long-standing roles in MCM-related issues, ranging from the early stages of product development through MCM stockpiling, use, and surveillance during public health emergencies. FDA's MCM work extends beyond traditional infectious disease threats, with the agency's collective work in these broader areas (eg, anthrax, nuclear and chemical threat preparedness) strengthening its capability to respond from a scientific and regulatory perspective to a broad spectrum of global health threats.

Underlying FDA's MCM work is a strong regulatory framework and a foundation of collaboration with domestic and international partners. FDA is responsible for ensuring that MCMs are safe, effective, and secure through a range of responsibilities aimed at facilitating development and, ultimately, timely access to MCMs during emergencies. For example, FDA engages with product sponsors throughout the MCM development process; approves, licenses, or clears MCM marketing applications that meet applicable standards for safety and efficacy; provides regulatory advice and guidance to MCM product sponsors, Public Health Emergency Medical Countermeasures Enterprise (PHEMCE) partners, the Strategic National Stockpile (SNS), WHO, and national public health and regulatory authorities; works to ensure that FDA regulations and policies adequately support MCM development, preparedness, and response activities; and uses, when appropriate, special legal and regulatory mechanisms to permit certain MCM emergency preparedness and response activities. 14 Ultimately, the goal for MCM products under development is FDA approval, licensure, or clearance. However, attaining approval for an MCM can present unique challenges. Sometimes there are gaps in scientific knowledge that can affect FDA's review of MCMs and hinder regulatory decision making. Even though FDA has the flexibility to grant marketing approval for MCMs based on adequate and wellcontrolled animal studies in situations when it is neither ethical nor feasible to conduct efficacy studies in humans (such as with dangerous pathogens like the smallpox virus), sufficient animal models might not exist and using an animal model might lead to incomplete information on use of the product in humans. 15 Product sponsors also face challenges in knowing what MCMs they should develop or how to develop specific MCMs because of uncertainties about threats to address, a challenge exacerbated when many developers in the MCM field are small companies with more limited experience taking a product through advanced development to FDA approval.

In 2010, to help further address these types of challenges and to further strengthen MCM-related partnerships, FDA's collective MCM roles in addressing CBRN and emerging infectious disease threats were formalized through the establishment of the FDA Medical Countermeasures Initiative (MCMi). 16 The MCMi is coordinated through the Office of Counterterrorism and Emerging Threats in the Commissioner's Office, operating in close collaboration with the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER), the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER), and the Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH), each of which has teams of MCM experts, as well as with the Office of International Programs, the Office of Crisis Management, and other internal partners.

Since the MCMi's establishment, FDA has focused increased resources on promoting the development of MCMs by identifying and resolving complex regulatory science challenges to approval (which also may have application to other product areas) and has enhanced MCM engagement, coordination, and collaboration within FDA and with other partners in HHS, such as the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) through the PHEMCE, and outside of HHS. 17, 18 The MCMi serves as a nexus for FDA's collaboration with interagency, state, and local public health and emergency responders and global partners (eg,WHO). FDA has also been engaged in biosafety and biosecurity promotion (eg, through the National Science Advisory Board for Biosecurity) and in training efforts (eg, related to identifying and sharing best practices for ensuring data quality and integrity in high-containment BSL-3 and -4 facilities for studies being conducted to support MCM development using the Animal Rule).

Further, through the MCMi, FDA has strengthened its legal and regulatory framework for facilitating timely access to MCMs. Public health emergency response circumstances often demand nimble approaches to facilitate MCM stockpiling, dispensing, and use. For example, in some cases, the most appropriate MCMs for a response might not be approved by FDA, or might be intended to be used in ways outside of their FDA-approved labeling, such as for a new age group. In these cases, special legal preparedness tools (eg, an Emergency Use Authorization, or EUA) might be needed to facilitate getting the right MCMs to the right populations without delay, while also ensuring that appropriate patient safeguards and legal protections are provided when needed. 19 Even when approved MCMs are deployed, response challenges can emerge. For instance, to respond rapidly, MCMs might be dispensed to the public by a responder who is not a licensed healthcare professional or with unapproved labeling. Through the Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Reauthorization Act of 2013 (PAHPRA), FDA's legal and regulatory framework for MCM preparedness and response has been strengthened (eg, through EUA flexibilities and establishment of additional authorities). 20 PAHPRA also includes several provisions to enhance COURTNEY ET AL.

MCM product development, addressing efforts that were already under way at FDA through the MCMi.

The following summary provides examples to illustrate how FDA's MCM efforts for emerging infectious disease and CBRN threats intersect with and contribute to global health security. While they are organized by the 3 overarching objectives of the Global Health Security Agenda-prevent, detect, and respond-some of the examples do not fit clearly into a single category. Much of FDA's MCM work is focused on being prepared for and responding to public health threats. FDA efforts for making available for laboratory use an uncleared diagnostic device for detecting a novel infectious disease threat, for example, could be considered a response action, or an action that contributes to helping to detect a threat early, which could in turn serve to help prevent or contain an epidemic. FDA approval for market of an MCM using the Animal Rule mechanism is another example of an FDA action that could fall under preventing avoidable epidemics and under responding rapidly and effectively, since it can facilitate domestic and international availability of MCMs that can be rapidly deployed to prevent or treat infectious disease or CBRN threats, thus potentially mitigating or decreasing their global burden.

FDA engages in a number of efforts that can contribute to preventing or reducing the impact of natural, accidental, or deliberate outbreaks, including through approving MCM products and using and strengthening legal and regulatory authorities to facilitate MCM availability.

Since the establishment of the MCMi, FDA has approved a number of MCMs aimed at early mitigation of the health impacts of infectious disease and other public health threats. In the area of influenza pandemic preparedness, seasonal influenza preparedness is critical for helping to increase and sustain pandemic influenza vaccine production capacity. For example, FDA recently approved several innovative seasonal influenza vaccines, including the first seasonal influenza vaccine licensed in the US using modern cell culture techniques to facilitate faster manufacturing startup; approved the first adjuvanted influenza vaccine for use in adults 18 years of age and older who are at increased risk of exposure to the avian influenza H5N1virus subtype contained in the vaccine; and has collaborated with ASPR, CDC, and NIH on developing H7N9 influenza virus vaccine candidates. 17 FDA has also approved a number of diagnostic devices, as described in the following section, that can in some cases contribute to preventing or mitigating epidemics through detecting threats early.

Legal and regulatory authorizations to facilitate MCM product availability are also vital to early mitigation of disease outbreaks and other public health threats. For example, under PAHPRA, FDA can now clearly issue EUAs for MCMs for preparedness purposes in advance of an actual public health emergency (eg, for IVDs for detecting emerging infectious disease threats like MERS-CoV) and also has several new authorities to facilitate access to approved MCMs during emergencies. Before PAHPRA, FDA issued 2 EUAs for anthrax preparedness purposes; both enable dispensing of anthrax antimicrobials as postexposure prophylaxis to the public under a nonmedical model by various stakeholders immediately following a wide-area anthrax attack. 19 An EUA not only can facilitate a US domestic response, but also can allow, when appropriate, the shipment of a product authorized for use under the EUA from the US to other countries for use in those countries, provided that the authorization's criteria for issuance, scope, and conditions for emergency use are met.

To help detect early, and thus work to mitigate, infectious disease and other health threats in humans, diagnostic devices are essential. In the area of detecting threats early to save lives and for biosurveillance purposes, FDA has approved a number of diagnostic devices and authorized the emergency use of uncleared diagnostic devices for preparedness purposes to address emerging threats. For example, FDA approved a new multiplex nucleic acid assay for the qualitative determination of influenza A, influenza B, and respiratory syncytial virus type RNA in nasopharyngeal swabs from patients with signs and symptoms of respiratory infection; a label modification to the CDC Human Influenza Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel to interpret results that are positive for influenza A H3 and negative for other influenza markers as presumptive positive for H3N2v influenza A virus detection; and modifications of several previously approved influenza assays to improve performance and demonstrate analytical reactivity with influenza A (H7N9) virus and the influenza A (H3N2v) virus. 17 For novel diagnostics that are not yet cleared but that are promising for CBRN and emerging infectious disease preparedness and response purposes, FDA can use its EUA to authorize the use of certain tests to strengthen domestic and, in some cases, international laboratory capacity and public health preparedness. For example, FDA issued EUAs in 2014 for uncleared IVDs for the detection of the novel influenza A (H7N9) (detected in China in 2013) virus and MERS-CoV for preparedness purposes. 19 In 2013, FDA also issued EUAs for uncleared IVDs to strengthen preparedness for the emerging infectious disease threats of novel influenza A (H7N9) virus and MERS-CoV. These EUAs remain in effect. 19 When appropriate, EUAs have also allowed for such IVDs to be used internationally (eg, by DoD Network Laboratories in other countries or by foreign laboratories) as part of the global response to a particular emerging threat. In response to the 2009-10 H1N1 THE FDA AND GLOBAL HEALTH SECURITY influenza pandemic, FDA issued 18 EUAs for uncleared IVDs to detect the novel influenza strain. 21 

Because of its regulatory roles, FDA is involved in a number of efforts aimed at responding rapidly and effectively to biological and other public health threats at the global level, including through international coordination and communication, emergency operations center (EOC) activities, product approvals, legal and regulatory authorities to improve access to MCMs during health emergencies, and surveillance of MCM use.

In terms of collaborations to improve coordination and global access to MCMs during public health emergencies, FDA works closely with HHS and international partners, including WHO, through several partnerships aimed at strengthening and facilitating the sharing of MCM products and expertise. For instance, FDA collaborates with HHS and other US government partners on a variety of MCM issues, such as international requests for MCMs. Through the Global Health Security Initiative (GHSI), FDA works with such partners to strengthen operational frameworks and build regulatory capacity for responding to global infectious disease threats through the sharing of MCMs and expertise (eg, on legal/regulatory approaches) across countries. 22 FDA also works closely with US and Canadian partners through the Beyond the Border Initiative, providing MCM expertise, and collaborates with WHO to help ensure rapid availability of needed medical products by assisting with prequalification of products for deployment to needed areas. 23 To enhance internal and interagency emergency coordination, FDA's Office of Crisis Management serves as FDA's focal point for coordinating emergency and crisis response activities involving FDA-regulated products and manages FDA's EOC, which is linked to the global EOC network through the HHS EOC. 24 In addition to helping to prevent epidemics in some situations, product approvals are often important for responses to public health emergencies when they are occurring. In the area of pandemic preparedness, FDA expanded the approval for use of an antiviral to treat children as young as 2 weeks of age. 17 Other public health threat product approvals include a botulism antitoxin (the first polyclonal antibody approved under the Animal Rule), an antibiotic for treatment of plague, an inhalational anthrax therapeutic (the first monoclonal antibody approved under the Animal Rule), and a next-generation portable ventilator. 17 As mentioned, FDA has special legal and regulatory authorities to help improve access to MCMs during public health emergencies. These include the EUA, other emergency use authorities under PAHPRA (eg, emergency dispensing of approved products), and Investigational New Drug Application (IND) or Investigational Device Exemption (IDE). In direct response to the emerging threats of MERS-CoV and the novel influenza A (H7N9) virus, FDA issued EUAs to facilitate access to new diagnostics to help detect the novel threats in the US and abroad. In response to the 2009-10 H1N1 influenza pandemic, FDA issued 22 EUAs for MCMs (ie, antiviral drugs, IVDs, and personal protective equipment) to counter the novel influenza strain during the response. FDA also has mechanisms to extend the expiration dating of certain properly stored MCMs based on scientific data. When appropriate, this can enable local, state, and federal stakeholders to use their stockpiled MCMs for a period of time beyond the labeled expiration date so as to be ready to respond rapidly during an emergency. 25 While MCM legal authorities can enhance FDA's capabilities to detect, prevent, and respond to health threats domestically, they can also help to address global health threats and facilitate the international sharing of MCMs. In appropriate cases, FDA can, for example, authorize a particular MCM to be used for US government personnel in other countries or by foreign laboratories. In other cases, the EUA or other FDA authorities have helped to inform approaches and planning efforts with global partners related to the sharing of MCMs with international partners during an emergency, or could potentially provide a certain level of assurance or information during a response about an MCM that is not yet approved but is needed for the emergency.

To help better understand how MCMs work after they are administered to patients, FDA is currently engaged in efforts, including with HHS partners, to assess the feasibility of surveillance of MCM product use during public health emergencies. FDA has well-established roles in monitoring the safety of medical products after they reach the commercial market. However, monitoring and assessing MCM use and performance during an emergency, while essential to an informed and effective public health and medical response, can present unique challenges (eg, the product might not yet be approved or might have been approved under the Animal Rule). The nature of the emergency itself, including increased demands on the healthcare system, also might severely limit the ability of healthcare responders to report on adverse events. Therefore, FDA is working with its PHEMCE partners to explore national needs and potential approaches to collecting data on MCM use during emergencies in near realtime. FDA is also involved in a project to assess the feasibility of analyzing data from electronic health records in near realtime to aid in clinical and policy decision making during a response that involves the use of MCMs.

Effectively detecting and mitigating infectious disease threats before and after their emergence is essential to global health security. By nature of its broad regulatory responsibilities, though, FDA's roles in global health security, even in the area of MCMs, extend beyond infectious disease threats. In addition to its MCM work, FDA has many other roles, regulatory initiatives, and programs that are critical to global health security and align with the intent and spirit of the Global Health Security Agenda, even though some of them predate the agenda or might fall outside of the realm of traditional infectious disease threats. As described in greater detail below, examples of FDA's health security roles beyond MCMs include addressing the challenges of antimicrobial resistance, enhancing global food safety efforts, and contributing to global supply chain integrity. This work is often accomplished through strengthening global regulatory systems and capacity.

The judicious use of antimicrobials is critical to ensuring the efficacy of antimicrobial drugs. In the area of antimicrobial resistance, FDA is a key partner in the National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System (NARMS) to track antibiotic resistance in foodborne bacteria, and it has supported the WHO Advisory Group on Integrated Surveillance of Antimicrobial Resistance (AGISAR). Also, FDA's Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM) has introduced a plan to phase out the use of medically important antimicrobials for food animal production uses. 26 Further, the Generating Antibiotic Incentives Now (GAIN) title of FDASIA recognizes the need to stimulate investments in the development of antibacterial drugs intended to treat serious or life-threatening infections. 13 FDA can designate such antibacterial or antifungal drugs as ''qualified infectious disease products,'' which can allow for fast-track designation and an additional 5 years of product exclusivity.

Strengthening regulatory frameworks governing food safety, which is addressed in the Global Health Security Agenda, is another of FDA's key concerns. As long ago as 1983, experts from the United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) and WHO described foodborne illness as the most widespread health problem in the modern world. While the impacts of foodborne illness may have been overshadowed by a host of other emerging infectious diseases in the past 3 decades, the impact of diarrheal disease occurring as a result of contaminated food remains profound. It is estimated that up to 70% of the 1.5 billion episodes of diarrhea occurring in children under 5 every year may be caused by foodborne contaminants. 27 FDA works to address food safety challenges in a number of ways. For example, through regulatory efforts such as FSMA, FDA is focusing on strengthening food safety systems through efforts to ensure product safety, modernize the oversight of imported foods, guard against intentional contamination, implement preventive controls in human and animal food/feed facilities, and ensure the safe transport of food and feed. Under FSMA, FDA has developed the International Capacity Building Plan, which charts a direction for how FDA prioritizes capacity building efforts based on risk and impact on public health, as well as FDA's partnerships with counterpart regulatory authorities, industry, and other organizations to achieve lasting food safety results. 28 Among its regulatory capacity efforts, FDA contributes to, and leverages, other global food safety efforts, including through supporting WHO's Foodborne Disease Burden Epidemiology Reference Group (FERG), which is working on a definitive report on the global burden of foodborne diseases; strengthening surveillance systems, alert networks, and information platforms, such as the International Food Safety Authorities Network (INFOSAN); and working closely in the development and support of the Global Food Safety Partnership (GFSP), a public-private partnership housed at the World Bank that is dedicated to strengthening food safety systems.

Given the increasingly complex, interconnected nature of medical and food product supply chains and the resulting threats to the availability and safety of such products, global supply chain integrity is of increasing significance to FDA. In many cases, the sources of our medical products and food do not originate in countries with the same high level of regulatory standards and authority that the FDA has in the US. Just as pathogens know no borders, neither do food and medical products. These products travel through complex and fragmented supply chains-from producers, repackagers, distributors, and importers-that are increasingly difficult to define, identify, and hold accountable. 29 Today, a typical manufacturing company relies on more than 35 contract manufacturers internationally.

For example, a major threat to global health is falsified, substandard, and counterfeit medical products-in other words, products containing toxic ingredients, contaminants, or insufficient (or too much) active ingredient(s). Recent WHO drug alerts, generated from an emerging global monitoring system for such products, point to the global nature of product threats. In September 2013, for example, authorities in Paraguay notified WHO of 11 pediatric patients suffering from serious adverse events (eg, altered consciousness, cyanosis, respiratory distress, and seizures) within hours of ingesting dextromethorphan. The same ingredient was identified in Pakistan in January 2013 during an investigation of 50 deaths. Both cases traced the ingredient, which contained the contaminant levomethorphan, to the same batch number and manufacturer located in India. The drug alerts prompted authorities in other countries to be vigilant in testing for the presence of levomethorphan. 30 FDA has supported WHO in developing this monitoring system to serve as a rapid alert system for incident reports and contribute to a global body of evidence on the scope and scale of the problem. THE FDA AND GLOBAL HEALTH SECURITY WHO estimates that up to 25% of medicines consumed in low-income countries are substandard or counterfeit and even more prevalent where drug regulatory and enforcement oversight are weak. These cases illustrate that dangerous public health consequences arise when science-based standards and approaches are not used or enforced consistently across nations. Harmful products result from poor quality manufacturing or production, contamination, and even from intentional adulteration, fraud, and counterfeiting. A high prevalence of unsafe, poor quality medicines in the market results in inadequate treatment of patients, poisoning, toxicity, and erosion of public trust in the health system and can even contribute to antimicrobial resistance in some cases. Similarly, poor quality or counterfeit diagnostics can impede public health prevention and treatment efforts when they inaccurately or fail to diagnose conditions. FDA advancement of detection tools such as the WHO surveillance and monitoring system mentioned above and innovative, mobile counterfeit detection technologies, as well as the enactment of stronger regulatory authorities (eg, through FDASIA and the Drug Quality and Security Act), are contributing to global capacity to detect and respond to these threats. 31, 32 FDA's robust regulatory authorities and application of innovative regulatory science to address threats to medical and food product supply chains, and to foster the development of needed MCMs, are employed domestically, are shared internationally, and demonstrate some of FDA's critical contributions to global health security. As the global health threat landscape evolves, so will FDA's roles and regulatory approaches. FDA's ongoing work on MCMs, antimicrobial resistance, food safety, and supply chain integrity is further enhanced by the agency's efforts to build on and achieve key goals related to globalization, including building global coalitions of regulatory and health partners, strengthening global regulatory systems, collecting and sharing intelligence and information, and using global data networks and analytics. Together, these efforts position FDA to continue to contribute to global health security well into the future.

Evaluation of Public Health Emergency Management in China: A Systematic Review,"To summarize the present status of health emergency management assessment in China, a comprehensive search of Chinese databases for research that explicitly mention health emergency assessment indicators and indicator systems was performed. Studies were evaluated using the Ekman quality assessment tool, and data were extracted with an original extraction form. Sixty-one studies were included. There are many types and methods of health emergency management assessment in China, and the dimensions and the indicators involved are complex. Legal, regulatory, and policy bases for such assessment need to be further strengthened. The relevance of the entire assessment process and its practical application should be enhanced. In the occupational practice, appropriate evaluation methods should be selected according to respective evaluation purposes, evaluation objects, and contents. Laws, regulations, and policies in the evaluation of health emergency management should be improved. Finally, further correlational research on health emergency management evaluation system processes should be explored and improved.","In 2003, a sudden outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) occurred in China. More public health emergencies such as the H1N1 flu epidemic in 2009 and the H7N9 avian flu epidemic in 2013 had serious impacts on China's politics, economy, trade, and people's health, among others. Theory and implementation of health emergency systems have evolved worldwide. China has gradually implemented the construction of a comprehensive emergency management system including the use of theoretical models, assessment systems, and response studies. China's health emergency management system is an important component of the comprehensive emergency management system, and health emergency management assessment is an important part of the health emergency management system. China's health emergency management assessment system has experienced many rigorous tests in response to a series of public health emergencies and has accumulated experience in detecting health emergencies and managing the weaknesses of the evaluation system. There are many types of health emergency management assessments and many methods for health emergency management assessment in China, and the dimensions and the indicators of health emergency management assessment are complex. For example, the evaluation system named the ""Disease control agency health emergency capacity evaluation index"" has three dimensions, the system known as the ""Evaluation

Theoretical research that only mentions the word ""indicators of health emergency assessment"" but has no specific evaluation index content or only partial evaluation indicators, epidemiological characteristic analysis, and epidemiological monitoring reports.

There is no valid content literature, or the original language is from non-Chinese literature and the literature cannot be downloaded.

Evaluation results fall within the scope of low quality research after using the Ekman quality assessment tool [1] .

A comprehensive system search of Chinese databases-including the China Knowledge Network (CNKI), the Wanfang Data Knowledge Service Platform (WANFANG DATA), and the VIP (VIP data platform)-was implemented that used a search time limit from the establishment of the database as of March 2019. According to the type, the scope, and the research purpose of health emergency management combined with a preliminary search of China's domestic health emergency management assessment literature, two parts of search strategies were identified. The first part included literature encompassing health emergency, public health emergencies, and health and epidemic prevention, and the second part included evaluation, assessment, monitoring, and performance. Each part of the search terms were connected by the logical symbol ""OR"", and two parts were connected by the logical symbol ""AND"" to obtain the search results. According to this principle, the corresponding search formulas were formulated according to the characteristics and the requirements of each database. The specific search strategy is detailed in Table 1 . Table 1 . Search terms and search strategies.

The literature screening was conducted in two phases. In the first stage, all search documents were found in the form of bibliographies and then exported to the database for review. The searched documents were checked by topic and abstract. In the second stage, the full text was found and read to determine if it should be included. In the above stage, two evaluators independently screened the literature. If any disagreement arose, experts in the field of health emergency and evidence-based medicine were consulted to assist with judgment. The above document screening process was based on NoteExpress.

A self-made data extraction table was used to extract the data. The data extraction content mainly included: (1) basic characteristics of research (i.e., research topic, first author, publication time, region, research field, article type, evaluation content, research institution or research objects, research methods, and main research processes); (2) research evaluation system dimensional characteristics (i.e., name of research evaluation system, classification of research institutions, number of dimensions, and the composition of indicator system); (3) study indicators (i.e., first-level indicator and most frequently used indicator); (4) application of research evaluation system; (5) legal, regulatory, and policy on the basis of research evaluation system [i.e., evaluation system evaluation content, evaluation system, construction laws and regulations, and the system (or other standards)]. The data extraction process relied on NVivo12.

The two reviewers independently screened the literature and conducted a literature quality evaluation. If there were any inconsistencies, they were discussed and resolved first. If any differences persisted, an expert was consulted to assist in the judgment. Ekman's quality evaluation list was used to evaluate the quality of the included studies. The evaluation includes 7 aspects, i.e., research analysis, rationality, methodology, data, goal achievement, results, discussion, and conclusions. Each evaluation indicator corresponds to a score; three ""*""s indicate high quality research, two ""*""s indicate medium quality research, and one ""*"" indicates low quality research performed.

Based on the characteristics of the included studies and the extracted data, qualitative data were used to analyze the collected research data.

According to the search strategy, a total of 9657 articles were obtained in the database, including 2201 CNKI articles, 6218 WANFANG DATA articles, and 1238 VIP articles. Thereafter, 2733 duplicate articles were excluded in NoteExpress, 6924 articles remained, and four references were tracked. According to the inclusion and the exclusion criteria, the reading topics and the abstracts were screened, and 6705 unrelated research documents were excluded, leaving only 223 that were screened. The retrieval process is depicted in Figure 1 . 

All 61 studies (included) were cross-sectional studies with 36 studies from East China (59%), 12 from Central China (19.7%), and 13 from West China (21.3%). In terms of research literature types, 38 studies (62.3%) were journal type documents, and 23 studies (37.7%) were dissertation type documents [seven doctoral theses (30.4%) and 16 masters' theses (69.6%)]. In the research field, there were 39 studies on health emergency response capability (63.9%), one health emergency manpower resource allocation efficiency evaluation study (1.6%- [2] ), one vulnerability public health event vulnerability evaluation study (1.6%- [3] ), three drill evaluation studies (4.9%- [4] [5] [6] ), four comprehensive treatment evaluation studies (6.6%- [7] [8] [9] [10] ), three plan evaluation studies (4.9%- [11] [12] [13] ), one quality of management teaching case evaluation study (1.6%- [14] ), two related department setting and system construction evaluation studies (3.2%- [15, 16] ), two monitoring and early warning evaluation studies (3.2%- [17, 18] ), one epidemiological characteristics and normative disposal of third-party evaluation study (1.6%- [19] ), one social vulnerability assessment study (1.6%- [20] ), one emergency performance appraisal and evaluation study (1.6%- [21] ), one social mobilization mechanism study (1.6%- [22] ), one quality evaluation of network direct report (1.6%- [23] ), and one responders' competency evaluation study (1.6%- [24] ). The representative research of China's health emergency assessment system is mainly distributed in the eastern part of China. The most common type of publication is papers in academic journals, and the main type of research is on health emergency response ability. The research design is primarily cross-sectional. According to the classification of health emergency management, subjects most frequently include research on health emergency management evaluation of health administrative departments, disease prevention and control institutions, medical and health institutions, health supervision institutes, schools, military, and ports.

The quality of the preliminary inclusion studies was assessed using the Ekman quality assessment tool. In terms of methodology, 60 studies (98.4%) clearly described the health emergency assessment research methods, of which 22 studies clearly indicated the time period of the cross-sectional study. In terms of data, 60 studies' data (98.4%) were derived from original data, while only one study (1.6%) used secondary data. The scores indicated that three studies (4.9%) were high quality, and the remaining 58 studies' data (95.1%) were categorized as medium quality research. Overall, most studies were given a rating of 2* according to the Ekman quality assessment tool, which scores between 17 and 21; the research quality of China's health emergency management assessment system is relatively good. The specific results are detailed in Table 2 , and the numbers 1-61 represent the research serial number. 

Fifty-five studies have established health emergency assessment systems. Six studies were based on China's Health Emergency Response Survey and Evaluation Standards, China's Public Health Emergency Report Management Information System, and China's former Ministry of Health's disease prevention and control performance appraisal operation. The manual (2009 Edition) and the Chinese Health Department IHR and other standards conducted a comprehensive health emergency assessment. The health emergency assessment system in 24 studies consisted of three dimensions, such as monitoring capability, plan capability, management capabilities, or similar constructs. Overall, in the health emergency assessment systems, the maximum and the minimum number of indicators were as follows: all indicators (maximum of 214, minimum of 4); primary indicators (maximum of 15, minimum of 2); secondary indicators (maximum of 204, minimum of 0); tertiary indicators (maximum of 84, minimum of 0). The specific results are detailed in Table 3 . work capacity self-evaluation, professional knowledge training effect, work capacity constraints, factors improvement, and work ability prediction.

Health emergency assessment in medical and health institutions is mainly applied in Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, Hebei Province, Heilongjiang Province, the entire country, and Beijing. Health emergency assessment in the military is mainly applied to the entire army. Health emergency assessment conducted at the port is mainly applied to Xinjiang's border ports.

Through this research, we gained a comprehensive understanding of the status quo of China's health emergency assessment and explored the main distribution areas of the representative research of China's health emergency assessment system, research output, research design, main dimensions, high frequency indicators, major application cities, and health emergencies. We further evaluated the subjects of the classification. The study only included Chinese studies, which affects the comprehensiveness of the research. The specific results are shown in Table 4 .

Twenty-seven studies (44.3%) referred to laws, regulations, systems, or other standards during the emergency assessment system construction process. Among them, 18 studies (66.7%) were evaluated for health emergency response, one study (3.7%) on a social vulnerability assessment system for major infectious diseases, one study (3.7%) on an early warning system for influenza outbreaks, two studies (7.4%) on health emergency pre-plan assessments, one study (3.7%) on performance assessment, one study (3.7%) on teaching case assessments (on emergency management), and three studies (11.1%) on health emergency work evaluation.

Health emergency management assessment is an indispensable part of health emergency management. Through proper evaluation, problems and deficiencies in health emergency management can be detected over time to ensure and enhance the efficacy by which such measures can be implemented in time to maximize the likelihood of preventing and controlling public health emergencies.

In health emergency management assessment practice, the types of assessments vary according to different classification criteria such as the purpose, the object, and the content of the assessment as well as the work status [10] . Research clearly indicates that there are a multitude of assessments in China. First, assessments are divided according to purpose, i.e., formative and summative assessments. For example, the evaluation of Yunnan Province's emergency health response capability and core competence assessment index system at district-level control institutions was performed to guide and advance the progress of assessment targets as well as to provide a formative evaluation of management decisions. On the other hand, in Fujian Province, the study is concerned with the state of performance appraisals regarding public health emergencies and other issues, including formulating (such as plan completion rate, emergency material reserve rate, simulation exercises) overall judgments on the purposes of evaluation institutions, including accountability and summative assessment. Second, health emergency management assessment is divided into several stages, including the preparation stage (i.e., pre-emergency evaluation), the disposal stage, the in-process evaluation, and the recovery stage (i.e., post-emergency evaluation). Thus, a preliminary discussion on the early warning index system for influenza outbreaks, the construction of an evaluation index system for hospital nurses' public health emergency response capacity, a weighted analysis of emergency public health emergency response evaluation factors, and the evaluation of emergency drill activities in county-level disease control institutions in Nanchang City are all examples of pre-assessment. In contrast, social vulnerability assessments and analyses of significant factors associated with major infectious diseases are concerned with the assessment of the nature, the type, the extent, and the determining factors of public health emergencies, while epidemiological characteristics studies and normative disposal third-party assessments are all considered post-event assessments that focus on recovery, summarizing, and long-term impact. Third, emergency management work assessment can be divided according to health status, i.e., normal and abnormal assessment. For example, the analysis and the evaluation of the present state of affairs of health emergency work in Qinghai Province was a normal assessment of the state of daily management construction, whereas the comprehensive evaluation of public health emergency implementation in the Fujian Province in 2014 was an assessment of the process and the impact of the emergency response. Fourth, assessment is divided according to the evaluation implementation body, i.e., internal and external evaluation. For example, the evaluation of the public health emergency response capacity of F hospital in Qiqihar City was an internal investigation conducted by an investigation team composed of health emergency management agencies and workers. On the other hand, investigating the epidemiological characteristics of public health emergencies and standard treatment third-party assessments are surveys that involve external evaluation from experts outside the health emergency management and work organization.

Health emergency management assessment is a process of formulating objective judgments on assessment targets based on specific criteria. Qualitative, quantitative, and mixed methods are most commonly used. This review found that the construction of a health emergency management evaluation system is more of a qualitative approach and is appropriately categorized as exploratory research (e.g., literature review, personal interview, Delphi, brainstorming, expert group discussion, expert meeting business law, field inspection). Some studies focus on data collection, detailing the main laws and characteristics by using descriptive methods. The health emergency management evaluation system weight analysis and application falls more in the domain of the Delphi method, while analytic hierarchy process, entropy weight, rank sum ratio, fuzzy comprehensive evaluation, and matter-element extension methods are relatively new methods for health emergency assessment. The application of the health emergency management evaluation involves possibly utilizing questionnaire surveys, factor analysis, principal component analysis, comprehensive scoring, comprehensive indexes, and analytic hierarchy process methods. Recently, scholars have started to pay attention to health emergency resource allocation research using data envelopment analysis methods. Health emergency management systems are extremely complex and large, as they are concerned with numerous variables and complicated mechanisms and structures.

The dimensions and the indicators of health emergency management assessment represent, to some extent, a specific aspect of health emergency management work and represent the constituent elements of health emergency management (e.g., health emergency agencies, manpower, materials, information technology, funds). These elements support health emergency management work and are the foundation for the smooth implementation of health emergency management. This review found that the assessment dimensions predominantly included national and local state health administrative departments' normal emergency management and abnormal emergency command organization management. Assessment dimensions were also concerned with health emergency professional technical institutions, including health emergency level disease prevention and control institutions, professional disposal management, personnel management, materials management, information management, fund management, etc., at various levels of health institutions. Moreover, health emergency assessment indicators are embodied in the duties and the authority of the state in the management of normal/abnormal emergencies, duties of professional technical institutions, classifications and responsibilities of technical and health emergency personnel, emergency materials categories and management methods, information monitoring, source, report, confidentiality, and supervision, and aspects of health emergency fund sources to support policy and supervision.

Due to the differences in organization, system, economy, culture, and history of various countries, the organization, the function, and the structure of their respective national health emergency management and evaluation systems differ. In April 2018, the central and the state institutions of China reformed and established the National Emergency Management Department, equipped with primary functions responsible for the management of natural and accidental disasters. Social security incidents were assigned to the Political and Legal Committee, and public health events became the responsibility of the Health Committee. In the future, more comprehensive, targeted, and operational public health events, social security incidents, natural disasters, and accident disasters related laws and regulations and various policy systems will likely be gradually developed, and corresponding event-related authorities will also enhance the supporting plan, the disposal plan, and the process.

This study found that the main Chinese environmental laws and regulations utilized in the process of constructing a health emergency assessment system included the Emergency Regulations for Public Health Emergencies, the Law of the People's Republic of China on Emergency Response, the Law of the People's Republic of China on the Prevention and Control of Infectious Diseases, ""The disease prevention and control work performance appraisal operation manual"", the State Council Emergency Office ""Emergency Drill Guide"", and so on. In addition, the International Health Regulations (IHR2005), the ""US Center for Disease Control (CDC)"" public health preparation, and the response capacity scale ""Expert Advisory Standards"", in addition to others, were also used. Nonetheless, the research in reference to laws, regulations, systems, or other standards is still marginal, and there persists a lack of detailed studies on legal, regulatory, and policy bases for health emergency management assessment before the establishment of the National Emergency Management Department. After the establishment of the National Emergency Management Department in April 2018, China's emergency management functions were gradually clarified. Laws, regulations, and policies for health emergency management assessment need to be continuously updated, and in-depth research needs to be conducted in order to provide a basis for health emergency management assessment. See the Appendix A.

The various system elements of the health emergency management system are interrelated and are organic as a whole, and the connecting paths between various elements are worth further exploration. This study found that most research is narrowly focused on particular topics; indeed, evaluation research is typically carried out on specific problems. Yet, it is rare to explore the interrelationships and the causal paths among the various elements of the evaluation system. Specific problems should be found in the health system, and relationships and mechanisms of system elements should undergo in-depth analysis to accurately determine the underlying causes of a health emergency problem and fully comprehend the full process management of public health emergencies.

This study found that research on constructing health emergency assessment systems, analyzing and evaluating present systems based on existing standards, and evaluating practical applications based on the construction of management evaluation systems is scarce. In the application evaluation research, the types of application institutions are predominantly from disease prevention and control institutions, medical and health institutions, government and health administrative departments, and military and border ports. Merely building a health emergency assessment system cannot meet the needs to form a comprehensive emergency system, nor can it identify the weaknesses in management efficiently. Practical research on the evaluation of health emergency systems should be conducted rigorously, and attention should be paid to the actual evaluation and application of health supervision institutions, schools, and other institutions.

The study solely included Chinese research, and this arguably limits the ecological validity of the findings. Yet, this study still conducted a broad and comprehensive investigation of the Chinese literature, traced references, and conducted an in-depth analysis of medium-quality and high-quality research, effectively reducing bias due to insufficient literature included.

The qualitative system evaluation of China's health emergency management assessment revealed that, although China has carried out substantial research related to health emergency assessment, in the face of frequent global public health emergencies, the current assessment of health emergency areas still requires continuous improvement. Foreign health emergency management assessment related research is carried out earlier and applied in practice. The research on China's health emergency management assessment has been carried out late, the evaluation system is flawed, the evaluation criteria are not standardized, the evaluation model is unstable, and the assessment of health emergency management processes lacks attention. A first step in improving the situation is to enhance the relevance of the process of health emergency management assessment. For more than ten years, the health emergency management assessment has prioritized the evaluation of staged and key management work. At present, there is still a lack of research across all processes related to the health emergency management evaluation system. Second, the process of the health emergency management evaluation system is weak. Previous research on a health emergency management assessment system typically targeted certain types of public health emergencies and lacked the exploration of health emergency management assessment systems based on the commonality of multiple types of public health emergencies. Third, the application of a health emergency management assessment system is not strong. The content and the objectives of the previous health emergency management assessment systems are relatively scattered, lack organic integration of the assessment process, and create a state of under-applied appraisal.

The representative research of China's health emergency assessment system is mainly distributed in the eastern part of China. The design of such research mainly focuses on cross-sectional studies. While the dimensions and the high-frequency indicators of the health emergency assessment system have been extracted, the applicability of the health emergency assessment system needs to be improved. China should emphasize research and application of health emergency assessment in central and western regions, including ethnic minority areas, and the health emergency assessment system should be improved from the perspective of classification and integration of health emergency assessment subjects, as health emergency management assessment is an important part of the health emergency management activities. Through evaluation, problems in health emergency management can eventually be found, and the effective prevention and control of public health emergencies can be achieved to the greatest extent possible. There are many types of and methods for health emergency management assessments, and the related dimensions and indicators are complex. In health emergency management assessment, it is extremely important to select appropriate assessment methods according to different assessment purposes, targets, and contents. Laws, regulations, and policy bases of health emergency management assessment should be strengthened, especially after the establishment of the National Emergency Management Department in April 2018.

The most important finding of the current research is that there are many types of health emergency management assessments and multiple health emergency management assessment methods in China. The dimensions and the indicators of health emergency management assessment are also complicated. In general, the dimensions of health emergency assessment are mostly in the secondary dimension. The evaluation indicators mainly include management ability, improvement ability, exercise ability, and reporting ability. Laws, regulations and policy bases for health emergency management assessment also need to attend to differences and linkages between national health emergencies and national emergency laws, regulations, and policies. It is necessary to improve the relevance of the entire process of the health emergency management assessment system. The practical application of the health emergency management assessment system also needs to pay attention to the application of health supervision, schools, and other institutions. The correlation research of the entire process of the health emergency management evaluation system needs to be further explored and improved. In addition, China should build a health emergency management assessment system that is in line with international standards and focuses on Chinese characteristics, which needs further exploration in the future.

China's comprehensive promotion of health infrastructure construction requires improvement of disaster prevention, mitigation/emergency response capabilities, and improvement of the emergency health emergency response system. Future research should explore the optimal methods of realizing China's health emergency management, evaluate relevance and commonality, and develop sound and applicable standardization of health emergency management assessment systems to meet the developing requirements of potential emergencies in China. This research can be used to develop health emergency assessment research in other countries and contribute to the development of a global health emergency movement.

Evaluation of Data Exchange Process for Interoperability and Impact on Electronic Laboratory Reporting Quality to a State Public Health Agency Evaluation of Data Exchange Process for Interoperability and Impact on Electronic Laboratory Reporting Quality to a State Public Health Agency,Background: Past and present national initiatives advocate for electronic exchange of health data and emphasize interoperability. The critical role of public health in the context of disease surveillance was recognized with recommendations for electronic laboratory reporting (ELR). Many public health agencies have seen a trend towards centralization of information technology services which adds another layer of complexity to interoperability efforts.,"Past [1] and present [2] national initiatives that promote electronic health records (EHRs), also advocate for the electronic exchange of data across various healthcare sectors using nationally recommended standards [3] . The critical role of public health, in the context of disease surveillance is recognized by these regulations, with recommendations for electronic laboratory reporting (ELR). ELR refers to the electronic transmission of labs related to reportable conditions to public health [4] . The emphasis on interoperability in recent legislations [5] and roadmaps [6] is facilitating the focus on electronic movement of data across healthcare settings. Many public health agencies have seen a trend towards centralization of information technology services which adds another layer of complexity to interoperability efforts. Given this landscape, it is essential to understand the process of data exchange and its impact on quality of data being transmitted, as this is a crucial step in interoperability. In addition, this holds broad implications for future priority transactions such as electronic case reporting to public health.

Initial research around ELR focused on comparison of paper-based reports to electronic transmissions and found predominantly positive impact of ELR [7, 8] on specifically two metrics of data quality: timeliness and completeness. Subsequent studies have assessed the role of intermediaries such as Health Information Exchanges (HIE) [9] [10] [11] to facilitate ELR and reported better completeness of data with HIE support. Presently, studies have begun to focus on provider reporting of notifiable diseases [12, 13] , as moving to electronic case notification [14] [15] [16] along with ELR will be great progress to support overall public health disease surveillance. Challenges in adoption and use of recommended codes [17] [18] [19] and need for an informatics savvy workforce [20] were identified as some of the issues in the move towards ELR [21] .

A recurring theme across these studies was assessing the quality of data, including exploring new venues to measure [22] [23] [24] and improve [25] it. Timeliness and completeness were the two dimensions of data quality (DQ) which were often evaluated. Metrics from DQ frameworks published in literature can be used as guidance in identifying additional parameters for assessment.

Data quality assessment framework by Kahn et al. [26] , identifies three DQ categories: conformance, completeness and plausibility, along with verification and validation as two DQ assessment contexts. DQ framework by Strong et al., proposes a broad conceptualization of the quality of data from perspective of data consumers. It defines high quality data as one that is fit for use and emphasizes context around data production and usage.

Strong's framework proposes four DQ categories (Intrinsic DQ, Contextual DQ, Representational DQ, Accessibility DQ) comprising of fifteen DQ dimensions [27, 28] . These include Intrinsic DQ (Accuracy, Objectivity, Believability, Reputation); Contextual DQ (Relevancy, Value-Added, Timeliness, Completeness, Amount of data); Representational DQ (Interpretability, Ease of understanding, Concise representation, Consistent representation); Accessibility DQ (Accessibility, Access security). The strength of this framework is the breadth of DQ characteristics. Data quality is a multi-dimensional concept dependent on multitude of factors and adoption of data standards does facilitate DQ, but does not guarantee it [29] . Good quality data that meet many of DQ dimensions are critical for public health surveillance purposes. With increasing electronic data exchange and emphasis on interoperability, it is essential to understand impact of various facets of data exchange on various dimensions of DQ.

The Minnesota Electronic Disease Surveillance System (MEDSS) [30] is the public health information system for supporting infectious disease surveillance at a state level for Minnesota and operational since 2008. It holds data on reportable conditions and receives ELRs submitted to the state public health agency. MEDSS is used for case management, contact tracing and to support outbreak investigations. Its scope has expanded to include non-infectious diseases such as blood lead surveillance and birth defects. It's a person-centric surveillance system which currently holds ~1,279,986 events across infectious diseases, lead and community and family health programs. Approximately 153,880 lab tests/results were reported electronically for 2017 across six health systems and four reference labs. Many healthcare systems are currently on a waiting list for either onboarding/move to electronic exchange or upgrade to better version of reporting standard.

Nationally recommended standards for ELR [4] comprise of HL7 2.5.1 for message format and LOINC [31] and SNOMED [32] codes for representation of lab tests and results respectively. With increasing demands for electronic data exchange for incoming data to MEDSS from clinical sectors and for outgoing data to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), new informatics tools to support data validation and exchange were implemented. The objective of this study was to assess the data exchange process and to understand its impact on the quality of data in MEDSS. The overarching goal is to utilize findings for improvements in informatics tools and processes to enhance the value of MEDSS by providing good quality data to support various public health purposes including disease surveillance.

The process of assessing data exchange for electronic lab reporting and its impact was a mixed methods approach with qualitative data obtained through expert discussions and quantitative data obtained from queries of the MEDSS system. Various subject matter experts (n=9) were identified spanning across the informatics team that supports MEDSS operations, public health program professionals who are users of the MEDSS system and its data, and the Information Technology (IT) team which supports the data exchange process. The focus included both onboarding (process OJPHI of shifting to electronic exchange for either new reporting or migration/upgrade to different standard) and on-going submissions. ELR is unique in that reporting can occur from either EHR or from LIMS (Laboratory Information Management System) and can occur from healthcare delivery organization or from reference laboratories and these were taken into consideration. Interviews were conducted in an open-ended/discussion format and were done over time frame of November 2017 through February 2018. Based on these discussions, two high level categories of data exchange process which could impact data quality were identified: onboarding for electronic lab reporting and internal data exchange routing. Figure 1 displays the ELR onboarding process and includes the testing and validation suite of tools offered in public domain by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) [33] . The six identified key processes that influence quality of data are numbered A through F (A -mapping of tests and results to appropriate codes, B -NIST test bed for testing of messages, C -submit test HL7 messages, D -solicit HL7 messages with test cases (e.g. specific tests, seasonal diseases), E -technical review, F -program review). Figure 2 displays the internal data exchange routing process which includes the PHIN Messaging System (PHIN MS) [34] , a CDC provided software that serves as a transport mechanism for effective movement of messages. This part comprises of four main components numbered G through J (G -PHIN MS, H -Lab code list database validation, I -Rhapsody® Integration Engine [35] rules, J -mapping in MEDSS).

The potential influence of the ten identified critical steps in the data exchange process and its impact on quality of data was identified through expert input using Strong's DQ framework as a OJPHI guidance. This was followed by analysis of data in MEDSS by criteria identified by the informatics team. Evaluation of messages not mapped to any disease program in MEDSS was identified as a priority. Next, assessment of completeness of race and ethnicity fields before and after implementation of demographic data import feature in ELR was completed. Using Influenza reporting as a scenario, the number of non-reportable tests that get submitted and added to data in MEDSS was examined. Finally, the number of incoming messages which get rejected due to errors was examined to quantify the need for additional technical assistance. 

The process of exchanging data electronically is iterative and is initiated with numerous rounds of message testing and varying gradation of technical assistance based on data submitter need and capabilities. Each step in the process was deemed critical in its impact on the quality of data which moves across clinical sector and public health. Table 1 lists the six identified key processes for ELR onboarding, relevant sub-processes/notes and their influence including both DQ metric and DQ dimension. All DQ metrics (Intrinsic DQ, Contextual DQ, Representational DQ, and Accessibility DQ) were impacted with varying influence on DQ dimensions. Some errors such as improper mapping on EHR end had a cascading effect and can pass through technical filters and go undetected till use of data by epidemiologists. Some DQ dimensions such as accuracy, relevancy, value-added data and interpretability are more dependent on users at either end of the data exchange spectrum, the relevant clinical groups and the public health program professionals. The results from analysis of data in MEDSS by various criteria identified by the informatics team is presented in Table 3 . Evaluation for cases which are not mapped to any disease program and assigned to ""other/unknown"" category yielded 952 cases. Assessment of messages for these cases noted an absence of LOINC and/or SNOMED codes and their combination pair for disease assignment. Next, the analysis focused on submission of non-reportable respiratory diseases along with reportable conditions (Influenza) due to issues with special lab test panel, and this identified 366 cases. This was followed by evaluating the number of incoming messages which get rejected due to errors and there currently isn't any process that keeps track of it. The corresponding impact on data quality metrics due to these identified issues are also presented in Table 3 . An enhancement was implemented in January 2018 to import demographic data (race, ethnicity) from ELR feeds and this evaluation presented in Table 4 . Of the total of 3,651 electronic lab messages received from January through February 2018, data on Race was present in 2,310 messages and 1,680 messages received in that time frame had data on Ethnicity. Comparison of this new data with already existing race and ethnicity data in MEDSS obtained through case reporting and follow-up investigations revealed 270 number of messages wherein race from ELR feed was different than one currently recorded in MEDSS. 

Federal regulations and incentives have offered the needed momentum towards electronic reporting to public health. But, there are differences in public health measure reporting [36] with ELR lagging behind immunization reporting due to complexities around multitude of labs associated with reportable conditions, slow adoption of recommended codes and multiple entities/professionals involved in exchange such as clinical labs, reference labs, ordering provider, infection control practitioner and disease epidemiologists. Another key factor to consider is that ELR can be generated from EHRs or from laboratory information systems (LIS) in reference labs OJPHI or in healthcare settings. This study also portrays the need for constant updates to the various validation tools to ensure errors are not being propagated across the data exchange chain.

This research points to the complexity of the data exchange process by illustrating the numerous stakeholders involved and the critical role each one plays in moving towards interoperability. It also pointed to the need for all data exchange partners to be informed of evolution of standards, both message formats (e.g. HL7) and codes (e.g. LOINC, SNOMED). Some of these exchange mechanisms require technical assistance for either submitter (e.g. labs, providers) and the receiver (e.g. public health) or both of them. National projects such as Digital Bridge [37] and APHL Informatics Messaging Services (AIMS) [38] are aimed to assist in data exchange across jurisdictional boundaries in public health. The data exchange process could be set such that messages get rejected if they fail any of the checks, but will require manual intervention by public health or the data reporters to understand quality issues around rejection and fix them.

The study also presents various testing tools (NIST test bed) and validation engines (Rhapsody, lab code list validation database) that help to automate quality checks and monitor various DQ dimensions. Approaches from other public health reporting such as immunizations wherein provider quality reports [39] are generated could be tried in the context of ELR. Likewise open source software tools have been proposed to support data quality checks for both immunization reporting [39] and ELR [23, 40] . Implementation and maintenance of these tools require both financial and technical resources. Importantly, there needs to be overarching guidance and support from national organizations such as CDC to ensure standardization and to facilitate sharing of tools/resources across jurisdictions.

The study revealed that data quality is dynamic and on-going oversight is a collaborative effort by MEDSS informatics team, technical and public health program professionals. Overall, maintenance of good data quality in context of ELR needs a multipronged approach with automated tools, data exchange partners education, technical assistance, regular updates of codes/tools, organizational commitment and national guidelines along with support by informaticians/data quality analysts.

This research depicts the details of processes, people and technology and the need for all the parts to align to make an electronic data exchange truly meaningful by providing good quality to data that fits the purpose (public health surveillance in this case). It highlights the benefits of standardization of data exchange processes which can be applied to other public health transactions. Many public health agencies have seen a trend towards centralization of information technology services which adds another layer of complexity to interoperability efforts. It underscores the value of a public health informatician to be part of electronic exchange of data across various sectors (clinical care, labs) and public health. Finally, this study presents a compelling picture of the interoperability endeavor as a team effort and underscores the critical role an informatics team can play in facilitating the data exchange process.

The study has some limitations and focus on some dimensions of data quality by Strong et al., is one of them. Some DQ aspects such as accessibility are not integrated with exchange process and hence were excluded. The research emphasis was determined by criteria outlined by MEDSS OJPHI informatics team, and was limited based on available data during study period. Some metrics were not tracked and certain tool enhancements were implemented recently by IT support team and thus evaluation was limited. Another limitation is that currently a large volume of ELR submitters are reference labs which are not required to collect race and ethnicity data and hence completeness of those data fields through ELR is limited. Some DQ errors are attributed to frequency of upgrade of codes/validation engine that are driven by organizational resources (finances, trained personnel) / institutional priorities and beyond the scope of this study.

With the growing demands for electronic reporting with public health, there is a need to understand the current processes for supporting electronic exchange and their impact on quality of data. This study focused on electronic laboratory reporting to public health and analyzed both onboarding and internal data exchange processes. Insights gathered from this research can be applied to other public health reporting currently (e.g. immunizations) and will be valuable in planning for electronic case reporting in near future. The study has potential implications in promoting data quality along with electronic exchange to support public health surveillance.

Policy Support and Resources Mobilization for the National Schistosomiasis Control Programme in The People's Republic of China,"Schistosomiasis remains a public health problem in many developing countries around the world. After the founding of The People's Republic of China, from 1949 till date, all levels of government, from central to local, have been attaching great importance to schistosomiasis control in The People's Republic of China. With considerable policy support and resources mobilization, the national schistosomiasis control programmes have been implemented during the past 65 years. Here, we summarize the successful experience of schistosomiasis control during the process. Recommendations for the future management of the Chinese national schistosomiasis elimination programme are put forward after considering the remaining challenges, shortcomings and lessons learnt from 65 years of schistosomiasis control drives in The People's Republic of China. They will help to sustain past achievements, foster the attainment of the ultimate goal of schistosomiasis elimination for the country and provide reference for schistosomiasis control programme in other countries.","Schistosomiasis remains a public health problem in many developing countries around the world (Mazigo et al., 2013) , and is a major limiting factor in the development of local economies (Zhou et al., 2002) . After the founding of The People's Republic of China, all levels of government, from central to local, have been attaching great importance to schistosomiasis control. Such efforts have also been integrated into sustainable social and economic development planning. After more than 60 years of constant efforts in the control of schistosomiasis, the Chinese government has made remarkable achievements, which can be a learning basis for many developing countries (Xu et al., 2016a,b) . At present, schistosomiasis elimination has been identified as the new target in The People's Republic of China (Lei and Zhou, 2015) .

This chapter reviews the process and successful experiences of schistosomiasis control in The People's Republic of China for the past 65 years, from 1949 to 2014. The control programme can be divided into four stages, namely in the early years after the founding of The People's Republic of China from 1949 to 1959, in the later 20th century from 1960s to 1980s, from the late 1980s to the end of the 20th century and the 21st century (Xu et al., 2016a,b) . At each stage, the successful experiences have been summarized into three aspects, namely national policy support and measures, resource mobilization and effect of schistosomiasis control. Such a summary provides the basis for designing an elimination programme against schistosomiasis in The People's Republic of China and be potentially used as a reference for developing schistosomiasis control programmes in other developing countries. CHINA FROM 1949 TO 1959 2.1 Background Before the founding of The People's Republic of China, schistosomiasis was a pandemic disease in southern China (Chen, 2014) , causing great harm to people's life and health. After the founding of The People's Republic of China, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC), headed by Chairman Mao Zedong, considered schistosomiasis a major public health problem and attached great importance to its control (Shi, 2011) . Eliminating schistosomiasis was considered a serious political task at that time. Although the whole country was mobilized to make unremitting efforts to eliminate the disease, the work of schistosomiasis control was exceptionally arduous due to limited economic and technological conditions at that time.

2.2.1 To determine the organizational leadership of schistosomiasis control Due to the urgency and difficulty in schistosomiasis control in the early days, the Central Committee of CPC set up the organizational leadership for the control programme promptly in November 1955. The leading group was also called the 'nine people group'. Subsequently, leading groups were found at different levels of party committee, including in the provincial party committee, municipal party committee, county party committee and town party committee, which lead the local work of schistosomiasis control (Fig. 1 ). In addition, specific responsibilities and actions at five levels of leadership were clearly stated. Firstly, a regular meeting system was established. Secondly, a regular reporting system, which reflected the true progress and problems of schistosomiasis control was set up the local schistosomiasis control planning was sought to be assessed and reformulated each year. The leading group of the Central Committee of CPC performed its duties fully and consecutive national work conferences on schistosomiasis control were held thrice in Shanghai in a span of 2 years (Shi, 2011) . Directives of the state council for schistosomiasis elimination were issued by Premier Zhou Enlai on 20 April 1957, and the council issued the highest level of government documents on schistosomiasis control (Wang, 2011) . A notice on implementing the directives of schistosomiasis elimination was published by the Central Committee of CPC on 23 April 1957, which expressed the terms that all provincial party committees, municipal party committees of schistosomiasis endemic areas and the party groups of the relevant departments under the state council should ensure the execution of the state council's instructions. From then on, the relevant provincial communist party had to submit a report on schistosomiasis control every 6 months to the Central Committee of CPC.

To strengthening the legal system management At this stage, setting up a legal system governing the control of infectious disease, including schistosomiasis, was required. The infectious disease management law of The People's Republic of China passed in 1955 was the first health law for the management of infectious diseases issued by the highest authority of the state after the founding of The People's Republic of China. With this law, the prevention and treatment of infectious diseases were brought into the ambit of legal system management for the first time (Zhou, 2004) . Initially, only scientific management system of schistosomiasis control was set up at that time in The People's Republic of China, where schistosomiasis was listed as a 'c' class infectious disease in the law. By setting up a proper legal management system, a comprehensive set of regulations and principles as well as prevention and treatment measures for schistosomiasis were clarified. This included the responsibilities of the citizens, social organizations and relevant government departments (Cao et al., 2016) . In addition, the law reflected science and humanity as more attention was directed at protecting the individual privacy of patients with infectious diseases (Li and Shen, 2006; Yao and Xu, 2005) . Furthermore, the reporting and releasing system of epidemic became more effective as witnessed in the legal infectious disease reporting system carried out in the 1950s in The People's Republic of China. Therefore, the transparency of infectious disease control was strengthened and the citizens' right to know was respected according to the above approach.

In order to strengthen the scientific aspect of the control programme, technology support measures were also put forward by the professional institutions in The People's Republic of China. For example, the national expert advisory committee of schistosomiasis control of CPC was established in December 1955, only one month after establishment of the leading group of the Central Committee of CPC. Subsequently, the comprehensive measures for schistosomiasis control were put forward by the national expert advisory committee of schistosomiasis control of CPC (Shi, 2011 

2.3.1 Integrating organizations at all levels from central to local for schistosomiasis control The work of schistosomiasis control was lead uniformly by the office of the leading group of the Central Committee of CPC. Resources from different departments (including health, agriculture, water conservancy, education and civil affairs) and various organizations (including army, trade unions, communist youth league and women workers committee) were integrated for the control of all endemic areas. Besides, resources of organizations from different endemic provinces including Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian, Anhui and Shanghai were integrated for the national control of schistosomiasis. In addition, the schistosomiasis control bureau, under the Ministry of Health, was established in Shanghai in July 1957 to strength the leadership of schistosomiasis control. All these activities had led to improved coordination and cooperation between the central schistosomiasis control institutions (Wang, 2011) .

control Schistosomiasis control was regarded as the most important work under disease control during this time period. Therefore, different levels of leading groups of CPC for schistosomiasis control were established after the central leadership group was established. They included the provincial, the municipality, the county and the township committees of CPC. Various levels of expert advisory committee for schistosomiasis control have also been successively set up during the same period. At a local level, there were people in charge of the schistosomiasis control work in villages. In 1953, stations of disease control and prevention had already been established in provinces, cities (municipalities) and counties (districts) across the whole country. These stations became the professional network for disease control unit of the CPC and the state to implement the strategy and measures of public health (Li, 2013) . By August 1957, a total of 19 professional institutions, 236 stations and 1346 groups were established specifically for schistosomiasis control in The People's Republic of China.

To strengthen the scientific research work on schistosomiasis, the human and financial resources from medical colleges and institutions working on schistosomiasis control in different areas, including Jiangsu province, Zhejiang province, Anhui province and Shanghai, were systematically integrated by the national expert advisory committee of schistosomiasis control of CPC. In addition, under the leadership of the national expert advisory committee of schistosomiasis control of CPC, different levels of scientific research institution were established in provinces, cities and counties (districts) (Wang, 2011) . Besides the scientific research organization mentioned above, national and local institutions and laboratories of TCM, were also integrated. All of them played an important role of schistosomiasis control.

After the directives of schistosomiasis elimination were published by the state council and the basic policies of 'health work should be combined with the mass movement' were implemented in 1957, all masses and organizations were mobilized to carry out the work of schistosomiasis control with vigour and vitality. These organizations could be divided mainly into two kinds, namely mass organizations of treatment and mass organizations of prevention, which included the snail control team, investigation team of infection rate and emergency response team, who played important roles in snail control, faeces of human and livestock management, and daily sanitation and hygiene management. For example, in order to play its role properly, Jiangsu Province integrated their treatment and prevention units with their social medical organization by establishing a joint clinic. During this period, similar mass organizations of prevention and treatment were also established in endemic provinces, so as to implement the principle of mass prevention and treatment into practice.

Through the implementation of measures mentioned in Section 2.3, the following achievements have been achieved in the 1950s in The People's Republic of China.

Firstly, through a national large-scale epidemiological investigation on schistosomiasis, the distribution of schistosomiasis epidemic areas in 1959 were verified, and they were found to be located along the south of the Yangtze River of The People's Republic of China, including 12 provinces (autonomous regions and municipalities directly under the central government), namely Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, Fujian, Guangdong, Guangxi, Sichuan, Yunnan and Shangha. There were 449 epidemic counties (cities, areas), 3563 epidemic towns, resulting in more than 11.6 million patients, 1.20 million cattle infected by schistosome, and an area coverage of 14.3 billion m 2 of snail. The high epidemic areas of schistosomiasis were also located along the Yangtze River and its connected lakes, such as Dongting Lake, Poyang Lake and Tai Lake. The epidemic in other provinces, such as Yunnan, Fujian, Guangxi and Guangdong provinces, were relatively light (Chen and Feng, 1999; Tang, 2012) . According to the epidemiological characteristics and snail-ridden environments, the areas endemic with schistosomiasis were divided into three types in The People's Republic of China, namely marshland, hilly and water network areas (Liu et al., 2016; Shi et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2016) .

Secondly, successful experience of schistosomiasis control was documented in a systematic and comprehensive way including the scientific achievements and the invention of the masses during the work of schistosomiasis control. The national compilation of schistosomiasis research data has been published every year since 1955, and a guiding 'schistosomiasis control manual' was published for the first time in 1956. The ordinance of schistosomiasis control (draft) was also made available, and consisted of 7 chapters and 33 articles. Promulgation and implementation of the ordinance play an important role in promoting the work of schistosomiasis control.

Finally, Yujiang County in Jiangxi Province was the first county to achieve schistosomiasis elimination in June 1958. Chairman Mao wrote a brilliant poem entitled 'Send away the god of plague' when he heard the good news. This poem greatly inspired the passion of scientific researchers for schistosomiasis control and the people who resided in endemic areas. The will and determination to send away the god of plague was formed since then (Wang et al., 2009a,b,c) . By the end of 1958, the number of schistosomiasis-infected patients who have received treatment was more than 4.3 million, and many areas have completely eliminated the harm with schistosome infection (Zhang, 2014) . The Health Minister, Li De Quan, said 'schistosomiasis has basically been eliminated in 65% of the epidemic areas' during a meeting, which summarized achievements for 10 years worth of health work since the founding of The People's Republic of China in 1959 (Wang, 2011) . Through masses mobilization in 1950s, great achievements had been obtained including achieving the goal of basic elimination of schistosomiasis and protecting people's health, thus resulting in the promotion of national productivity and economy.

During 1960s to 1980s, the main task of schistosomiasis control was large-scale snail control, combined with irrigation and water conservancy construction by people who resided in endemic areas. It was inspired by the successful experiences of Yujiang County. It was also based on the global strategy of schistosomiasis control, which emphasized snail elimination and the condition of rural social economy at that time in The People's Republic of China (Mao, 1990) . Due to the occurrence of natural disasters and famines in 1960s, a huge negative impact was inflicted on health prevention between 1966 and 1976, causing the work of schistosomiasis control to be severely disrupted. The process of schistosomiasis control was halted, leading to a serious reemergence of schistosomiasis. The leading groups and professional organizations for schistosomiasis control were dissolved at different levels, namely the national, provincial, municipal (city) and county (district) levels (Wang et al., 1989) . After 1970s, the process of schistosomiasis control began to develop steadily, with a national overhaul and recovery. Some epidemic prevention institutions were rebuilt. During this period, the effective policies and measures for schistosomiasis control were made once again under the leadership of the CPC and government, which played an important guidance for schistosomiasis control (Cai, 2013) .

3.2.1 Continue to give policy guarantee and promoting The management model of schistosomiasis control consisted of leadership of local party committees at different levels, which were led uniformly by the Policy Support and Resources Mobilization leading group of the Central Committee of CPC. The coordination work of party committees, at different levels, and the relevant government departments were all completed by the leading group of the Central Committee of CPC. They were also responsible for the formulation and implementation of schistosomiasis control planning. In addition, a network of the specialized institutions of epidemic areas were formed at three levels, namely provincial, municipal (city) and county (district). By the end of 1960s, the epidemic reporting network has been set up throughout the urban and rural areas of the whole country (Zhou, 2004) . The expert advisory committee of schistosomiasis control has set up at a later stage, and its responsibilities included: technical guidance and supervision for the implementation and application of the technical scheme and new technologies, setting standards, evaluation of control efforts and summarizing work experiences.

with agricultural production, combining mass movement with science and technology and combining temporary work with regular work The movement of mass prevention and control involved mobilizing all party members and citizens. During this period, the financial costs of schistosomiasis control were shouldered by the state, collectives and individuals. The early and advanced stage of schistosomiasis were both given priority and treated. And according to the patient's socioeconomic status, different charging strategies, namely full, discounted and at no cost, were applied. Meanwhile, snail control was given priority than water conservancy.

3.2.3 Following the comprehensive strategy on emphasis of snail elimination Schistosomiasis elimination was the main goal at that time. Schistosomiasis control workers strictly observed the following principles: active control, comprehensive measures of prevention and control, and performing work as circumstances permit. The comprehensive control strategy which emphasizes on snails elimination was implemented, and combined with the basic construction of irrigation and water conservancy depending on local economic conditions (Dai, 2001) . In addition, other measures, including the treatment of patients and infected livestock, transforming the ecological habitat of snails, personal protection, waste management and safe water provision, were also implemented. A 5-year plan of schistosomiasis scientific research from 1963 to 1967 was formulated in 1963 (Zhang and Cai, 2013) , in which great importance was attached to the research on the snail as a vector, snail control methods and the treatment for advanced schistosomiasis.

3.3.1 Continue to integrate the professional schistosomiasis control institution The national professional institutions and organizations of schistosomiasis control were improved and expanded (Fig. 2) . By the mid-1980s, there was a total of more than 260 professional institutions in the province, municipal (city) and county (district), more than 1620 professional institutions in towns and subdistrict, more than 16,000 professionals, and about 10 parttime staff in each village (Zheng, 1988) . 

Due to its regional distribution, a document numbering as No. 12 was issued by the Central Committee of CPC in 1970 indicated that 'adjacent area of the provincial, municipal (city), district (county) should carry forward the spirit of collaboration of communism through close cooperation, work together and strive to complete the task', as well as the same hydrographic net of adjacent areas (eg, around Dongting Lake), in 1970. Accordingly, after the collaboration plan of schistosomiasis elimination between Hunan and Hubei provinces was made by the two provinces and their adjacent areas with 11 county and 2 farms, a huge range of activities for disease control were carried out. From then on, it has a growing influence on schistosomiasis control in the whole country. Because of the concern, support and good organization from the party and government in The People's Republic of China, more collaborations between provinces and individuals were included in the work, resulting in the achievement of the goals for schistosomiasis control.

Through implementation of the strategy, which emphasized on snail control according to the target of schistosomiasis control, the progress of schistosomiasis control was hastened in The People's Republic of China. The measures included survey of snail population and mass snail control, survey of infection rate and provision of chemotherapy to infected patients and livestock, and transforming the ecological environment of snail combined with the infrastructure of irrigation and water conservancy in endemic areas. By the end of 1984, 11 million patients with schistosomiasis were treated and 11 billion m 2 of snail-ridden areas were eliminated. The number of counties that has eliminated schistosomiasis increased. Within 370 endemic counties nationwide, 76 counties reached the standard of schistosomiasis elimination and 193 counties reached the standard of basic schistosomiasis elimination (during 1956e95, the goals for schistosomiasis prevention and control were divided into two level, namely, elimination and basic elimination. 'Elimination' and 'basic elimination' were equal to the later technical term of 'interruption' and 'transmission control', respectively). For example, hilly areas or water network areas of Guangdong Province, Shanghai, Fujian Province and Guangxi Province reached the standard of schistosomiasis elimination . Finally, the national standard for elimination of schistosomiasis and basic elimination of schistosomiasis were promulgated and implemented, guiding future work of schistosomiasis control (Chen, 2005) .

Due to reforms in the national and the increasing needs of the development of health work, the leading group of the Central Committee of CPC and organizations and institutions were cancelled by the Central Committee of CPC in 1986. Subsequently, the work of schistosomiasis control was handed over to the Ministry of Health, where the Bureau for Disease Control was established. The Bureau for Disease Control was renamed to be the Department of Endemic Disease Control in 1989, and the latter was further renamed to be the National Endemic Disease Control office in 1994. After being restructured in 1998, the disease control department guided the work of schistosomiasis control countrywide. Under the leadership of the Ministry of Health, the Schistosomiasis Expert Advisory Committee was established and consisted of experts from the national institutions of schistosomiasis control, medical colleges and different provinces. These experts provided consultation and assisted in decision making. Since the 1980s, the collective ownership economy gradually transformed to the household contract responsibility system in rural The People's Republic of China. Due to changes in the economy system and opening up of markets in The People's Republic of China, the epidemic prevention system was also subjected to modification. It was difficult to organize the mass movement of large-scale snail control, and to assemble the resources of disease control. The idea of 'send away the god of plague' became history (Chen, 2005) and schistosomiasis infections began to rise again in areas where measures of schistosomiasis control failed to be carried out. Meanwhile, it was discovered that the target of schistosomiasis elimination in the marshland and some hilly areas was difficult to achieve with only emphasis on snail control as there were other natural environment and economic factors influencing the progress. The government paid high attention to the schistosomiasis resurgence in The People's Republic of China. Comrade Deng Xiaoping commented: 'It is beneficial for the people to control endemic diseases.' in 1984. Comrade Jiang Zemin said in the letter to the Five Province's Schistosomiasis Control Conference in 1989, 'It is the duty of the governments at all levels of schistosomiasis endemic areas to carry out schistosomiasis control and elimination', which contributed to a new wave of efforts in sending away the god of plague through mobilization of the available resources in the early 1990s.

At the same time, schistosomiasis control strategy and target have been adjusted by the WHO Expert Committee in 1984. They pointed out that health education should be an important part in the disease control strategy as transmission of schistosomiasis was closely related to people's work and living style. The emphasis on preventive chemotherapy was also gradually introduced in The People's Republic of China, and pilot work on control was carried out in heavy endemic areas.

In the mid-1980s, WHO put forward and carried out the strategy of 'disease control' through the administration of praziquantel, which was a high efficient, cheap and safe drug (Dabo et al., 2013; Ojurongbe et al., 2014) . The People's Republic of China also started to adjust the strategy of schistosomiasis control by adopting integrated control involving both chemotherapy administration to humans and livestock and snail control in susceptible areas (Zhou et a1., 2005; Utzinger et al., 2005; Guo and Zheng, 2000; Zheng and Guo, 2000) .

In view of the severe epidemic situation at that time, the five provinces of marshland areas meeting was held in Nanchang City in December 1989, which called for 'sending away the god of plague by mobilization once more'. After 1989, the State Council strengthened the leadership of schistosomiasis control and various measures of schistosomiasis control were adopted. They included planning for prevention and control, increasing the investment, coordinating the power of different departments, adjusting the strategy, advocating the control strategy consisting of three steps (namely infection control, transmission control and interruption) and improving the management mechanism. The State Council issued the file on 'decision on strengthening schistosomiasis prevention and control' in 1990. Five provinces of marshland areas were defined as focus throughout the country in the file. Regular meeting were set up to solve the important problems during the progress of implementation. During the period of Chinese eighth five-year planning (1991e95), the Central Committee of CPC and the government of endemic areas at different levels invested funds of 1 billion yuan for schistosomiasis control (source: National Conference of Schistosomiasis Control in 1997).

The Expert Advisory Committee of Schistosomiasis of the Ministry of Health was founded in 1987. For decades, the expert consulting organization has provided lots of scientific suggestion and advice of schistosomiasis control for the government, including guidelines, policies, planning, control strategy and technical guidance.

Since the 1980s, the health policy focus on science and technology was put forward in The People's Republic of China. Attention was given to schistosomiasis control during the national planning. The national schistosomiasis control planning from 1987 to 1990 emphasized the importance of scientific research. The Schistosomiasis Expert Advisory Committee of Ministry of Health played an important role in schistosomiasis control, by working on inventing new drugs for snail control with high efficiency, low toxicity and low price through scientific research (Cai and Zhang, 2012) . The State Council issued ""the national eighth five-year plan of comprehensive control of schistosomiasis"" in 1991, in which schistosomiasis control was accepted into the overall planning of economic and social development at different levels of government. The national eighth five-year plan of scientific research of schistosomiasis control has strengthened the scientific research of schistosomiasis control. The national health education implementation planning was made since 1992, where health education was accepted into the overall plan of schistosomiasis control. The purpose of health education was to mobilize the whole society to support schistosomiasis control, and to change the behaviour of target groups who are in close contact with infected water. The State Council issued 'The national ninth five-year plan of comprehensive control of schistosomiasis' in 1997, where the important position and role of science and technology in schistosomiasis control was provided with more attention by the government after 1980s. The government no longer relied on mass movement and participation for schistosomiasis control, but developed the science and technology for it instead.

In face of the severe endemic situation due to a rebound of schistosomiasis, and insufficient investment for schistosomiasis control, Chinese government decided to actively strive for the World Bank Loan Project (WBLP). Foreign capital and advanced technology and management were introduced to make up for the inadequacy of government investment and the lack of technical and management skills. The project was implemented from 1992 to 2001 (Collins et al., 2012) . The endemic disease control department of the Ministry of Health and foreign loan office were responsible for the implementation of the project. Within the 10-year period, the total investment for the project amounted to 1.088 billion yuan, including the World Bank loan of RMB 491 million yuan and the Chinese government of different levels matching fund of RMB 597 million yuan (Tables 1e4). The projects covered 219 counties of 8 provinces (Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Anhui, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Yunnan and Sichuan). The total goals of the project were to control the epidemic of schistosomiasis and to interrupt transmission of schistosomiasis in some areas in The People's Republic of China. All project activities were planned till the end of 1998, while three provinces Hunan, Hubei and Yunnan continued till 2001 due to further demands. The project had support from the State Development Planning In addition, 9.64 billion m 2 of area was surveyed for snails, snail elimination with molluscicide was performed on 2.85 billion m 2 , and snail elimination via environmental modification was conducted on 1.05 billion m 2 . An estimated 7.47 million people benefited from the project (Chen, 2005) .

Continuing to integrate the resources of regional defence The regional defence agreement of five provinces of schistosomiasis control was made in 1985 including Jiangsu, Anhui, Jiangxi, Hunan and Hubei. It was decided that classified guidance of schistosomiasis control should be carried out in the five provinces of marshland, paying special attention to the integrated control strategy. It was also demanded that acute schistosomiasis control should be a main component in the control work for the five provinces. Control included snail survey and elimination, case screening, chemotherapy of human and animal at the same time, and strengthening control of migrant population, so as to promote the progress of schistosomiasis control.

The State Council issued 'a decision on strengthening schistosomiasis control' in 1990, where the schistosomiasis leading group of five provinces, namely Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, Anhui and Jiangsu, comprised of the vicegovernor or the local leader of schistosomiasis leadership team. This group unified commands and coordination and played an important role in schistosomiasis control.

A series of technical training activities were carried out during the WBLP, and a national network of health education was also preliminarily established. The management and professional technical personnel having both ability and political integrity were selected to go abroad to study, and related experts were organized to go abroad to inspect and conduct academic exchanges at the same time. This resulted in a large number of elite people being trained and the quality of technical personnel improved together with the strengthening the international communication and cooperation ability.

A series of applied scientific research work was also carried out during the project, including a total number of 245 research projects approved and funded by joint research management committee (JRMC). Finally, a total number of 278 papers were published, 25 research projects won awards at or above the provincial level, and 7 research projects won the national patent through 6 years JRMC activity. These fruitful 

The WBLP, which lasted for 10 years was an important part of the national 'eighth five-year plan and ninth five-year plan' in The People's Republic of China, which funded for schistosomiasis control and accumulated valuable experience. The number of endemic areas of schistosomiasis decreased yearly (Figs 3 and 4) through the implementation of the project. From 1992 to 2001, 47 counties achieved transmission control and 82 counties achieved transmission interruption. The number of highly endemic areas of administrative villages fell by 37.1% and the moderately endemic areas fell by 29.0%, but the low endemic areas increased by 15.0%. The epidemic of schistosomiasis was effectively controlled through the implementation of the project. By the end of 2002, the national infection rate of human and livestock fell 55.0% and 50.0%, respectively, from before the project was implemented in 1992. The national density of infected snails in endemic areas decreased by 75%. In Zhejiang province, schistosomiasis transmission was interrupted in 1995 (Chen et a1., 2005) and thus, achieving one of the goals of the project. Compared with the early years of The People's Republic of China, the infection rates in the province, county and town decreased by 59.0%, 74.2% and 72.0% respectively; total number of schistosomiasis patients -1995) in The People's Republic of China' was issued for the first time. The 'Chinese Journal of Schistosomiasis Control' was established and the 'Handbook of Schistosomiasis Control"" was modified. A lot of news on schistosomiasis control and the epidemic were reported by the central and local newspapers and radio stations, bringing them to the attention of the national and local leaders (Wang et a1., 1989) .

In the early 21st century, there was a significant rebound of schistosoma epidemics in the Yangtze River basin and some hilly areas due to biological, natural and social economic factors Wang et al., 2004) . 1. The ecological environment of endemic regions had changed because of the implementation of measures for flood diversion after the flood in 1998. Measures included building of embankments and returning farmland to lake. However, this change of environment has led to the proliferation of oncomelania snaileinfested areas (Yang et a1., 2005) . 2. New epidemic characteristics and regularity of schistosomiasis thus emerged due to the changes of environment. For example, after the completion of the Three Gorges Dam, the extension of the flooding period caused the infectious season to be longer in areas with snails, such as Dongting Lake and Poyang Lake. Global climate change also increased schistosomiasis transmission intensity in some areas (Zhou et al., 2002 (Zhou et al., , 2008 Wu et al., 2007) . 3. The development of animal husbandry led to a more important role of the animal host in schistosomiasis transmission. 4. Chemical molluscicide (especially for aquatic animals) caused serious pollution in the environment, limiting the scope of application of molluscicide.

Compliance with long-term and repeated chemotherapy in humans and livestock dropped yearly. Infectious source increased since synchronous chemotherapy of human and livestock could not be carried out. Furthermore the only effective drug, praziquantel, had a potential risk of resistance (Wang and Liang, 2007) because of its wide-range use for a long time in the endemic areas. 6. The increase in social and economic developments brought along a rise in population mobility and livestock trading. Therefore, the frequency of contact with infected water, and reinfection of human and animal increased (Zuo et al., 2003) . 7. Since 2000s, the society and the mass people have paid more attention to the market economy system; however, due to the change of people's ideology and behaviour, schistosomiasis control was ignored to some extent and some measures were hard to carried out at one time (Li et al., 2002; Cai et al., 2003; Yin et al., 2002) . 8. After the WBLP on schistosomiasis control ended in 2001, there was a serious shortage of funding, causing schistosomiasis control in the country to be more passive. 9. The current technology and measures cannot satisfy the needs of the current schistosomiasis control programme, hence it was difficult to effectively control the disease. Thus, at the beginning of the 21st century, there was a significant rebound of schistosomiasis epidemics in The People's Republic of China. As a result, the total number of patients countrywide remains at around 800,000 from 1998 to 2005, and 700,000 of them are from the five marshland provinces. Cattle infection rate was around 4e5%, with an increased spread of snails. The risk of infection with schistosome was rising, with new areas of infected snails estimated to be about 9 million m 2 each year in the marshland areas . The endemic status of schistosomiasis in The People's Republic of China showed that the task of schistosomiasis control was still urgent. The continuous rise in endemic status lasted for 3 years, increasing the risk of human and animal infected by schistosome (Chen et al., 2002 Xiao et al., 2004) . In addition, it was difficult to reach the goal of transmission interruption through snail elimination in the marshland areas, such as Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, Anhui and Jiangsu Provinces, as well as the hilly areas, including Sichuan and Yunnan provinces, where the snails were widely distributed, and the ecological environment were complex. Therefore, during 2000s the emphasis on schistosomiasis control is in marshland and hilly endemic areas (Cao et al., 2003) .

To curb the rebound trend of schistosomiasis endemic status, the Central Committee of the CPC paid important attention to effectively control schistosomiasis by quickly adopting a series of measures. The administrative institutions, including the State Council and the Ministry of Health, announced 141 files to guide the national schistosomiasis control from 2003 to 2007 (Fig. 5) . The State Council leading group of schistosomiasis control was established in February 2004. And the notice of strengthening the control of schistosomiasis further was issued by the State Council in May 2004. The national conference of schistosomiasis control was held in Yueyang City one week after the notice was issued, in order to accelerate the process of schistosomiasis control. Since then, there were important adjustment and propulsion from the national planning and policies, legal management, financial investment and technical standards.

The 'National Program of Schistosomiasis Control in Mid-and Long Term (2004e15)' was organized in July 2004. The goal and objectives of schistosomiasis control were clearly clarified in these national programs. The timeline for reaching goals and the national standards in the endemic areas in The People's Republic of China, including infection control, transmission control and interruption, was clearly stated. With the support of all departments, the central fiscal transfer payments programme was quickly implemented, thus achieving the expected results. At the same time, the management model of this project also became the best example for disease prevention and control in The People's Republic of China because of its specific goals, scientific strategies and specific measures, which took into account the vital interests of the people in endemic areas. The 'National Program of Schistosomiasis Comprehensive Control (2004e08)' was organized by multiministries and commissions in October 2004. The central government allocated special funds to carry out comprehensive control of schistosomiasis in heavy endemic areas, focussing on 163 key counties (city, district). The 'National Program of Schistosomiasis Comprehensive Control (2009e15)' was organized in 2010 and reaffirmed the overall goal of schistosomiasis control in The People's Republic of China. The 'National Program of Animal Disease Control for the Mid-and Long Term (2012e20)' was organized in 2012. In addition, suggestions for the twelfth five-year plan of the national economy and social development made by the Central Committee of the CPC were passed during the fifth plenary session of the 17th of the communist party. It was an important task to 'improve the system of public health and medical service' during the ""twelfth five-year' period. According to the policy, a basic public health system, including schistosomiasis control, was to be provided in the future.

The application of comprehensive control strategy 'on the emphasis of infection source control' With the rapid development of economy in the 21st century, the epidemic reduced gradually in endemic area. Based on results from epidemiological studies and a further understanding of the characteristics and regularity of schistosomiasis in The People's Republic of China, Chinese scholars paid more attention to the two transmission stages of schistosomiasis, namely the miracidium and snail. It was considered that the waste management of human and livestock was an effective way to control infection and reinfection of schistosome ). The comprehensive control strategy 'on the emphasis of infection source control' was officially announced and implemented in 2006 Wang, 2005; Wang et al., 2009a,b,c) . The central government arranged special funds for water conservancy, agriculture, health and forestry for schistosomiasis control. The comprehensive control strategy 'on the emphasis of infection source control' Policy Support and Resources Mobilization was implemented in endemic areas, through the project resources and the increased investment from the local government. The notice of 'further strengthening the infectious source control of schistosomiasis' was issued to the relevant provinces and the ministries by the State Council general office via an urgent telegram in October 2007. Prohibition of countermeasures to control grazing in the areas of snail habitats was extended since 2008. It was indicated that the Central Committee and the State Council were equally concerned with fighting the 'god of plague', flood prevention and disaster relief and people in the endemic areas were inspired to fight schistosomiasis. In addition, the research institute of parasitic disease of Chinese academy of preventive medicine was renamed to the National Institute of Parasitic Disease, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, in 2002. The national and provincial institutes of parasitic disease made up a scientific research base, which provided guidance for the scientific research of disease control. Three levels of institute (station) of schistosomiasis control, namely municipal (city), county (district) and countryside (town) were still playing a role to organize the implementation of measures. This led to an effective implementation of the measures of the comprehensive control strategy.

The law on the prevention and control of infectious diseases was formally implemented on 1 December 2004, in which schistosomiasis was promoted from 'c' to 'b' class of infectious diseases (Zhou, 2004) . The regulations on schistosomiasis control were issued by the State Council in 2006. It was demanded that the comprehensive control measures must be implemented. From then on, the legalization of schistosomiasis control allowed the programme to have organization and management, forming a new work mechanism where the government-led ministries and departments cooperated, experts and technical personnel supported and the masses participated .

After the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003 (Wang, 2004) , the Chinese government paid great importance to the public health and disease prevention and control. The National Finance increased finance investment on schistosomiasis control, making it part of the central financial transfer payment project. The total number of special funds allocated for endemic areas was over 11.2 billion yuan from the central government since 2004 (data source: Deputy Prime Minister Liu Yandong, speech on the National Conference of Schistosomiasis Control in 2014).

The 'Technical guidance for water conservancy combined with schistosomiasis prevention' was issued by the Ministry of Water Conservancy in 2005. And the 'Criteria for control and elimination of schistosomiasis (GB15976-2006) in The People's Republic of China' was issued in 2006, which replaced the 'Criteria for control and elimination of schistosomiasis (GB15976-1995) in The People's Republic of China'. In the same year, 'National specifications on schistosomiasis prevention and control' was issued, which made the implementation of schistosomiasis control more scientific and standardized.

With the present economic and social developments, the construction of new socialist rural areas has become an important work. The local governments invested lots of money for it, including agricultural mechanization, safe drinking water, the use of biogas and construction of nonhazardous sanitary latrines. These funds were made up of health project funds from the central transfer payments, construction funds such as agriculture, water conservancy, forestry and land , as well as matching funds from central project supporting funds from the local governments and routine funds of the schistosomiasis control project. This did not only guarantee a smooth development in all the endemic provinces, municipalities (cities), counties (districts), but also improved the efficiency of schistosomiasis control under the construction of a new socialist countryside. In endemic areas of schistosomiasis, the safe drinking water problem of 6 million people were solved, 1.62 million nonhazardous sanitary latrines were built, 490,000 biogas were built, 430,000 cattle were killed, 760 thousands sets of new agricultural machinery were introduced to replaced cattle, 1183 km of the river channel revetment were constructed, 0.17 billion m 2 of paddy fields were changed to dry land, 1272 km of river and lake beach were forbidden from grazing by fence, 20 billion m 2 of prevention forest were built since 2011. The government of Hubei Province invested 240 million yuan to implement cattle elimination, 200,000 head of cattle were killed for 4 consecutive years from 2011 to 2014. Thus, the infectious source of livestock was controlled efficiently by lots of measures, such as promoting the whole county with comprehensive control, establishing agricultural cooperatives and carrying out the 'no oxen county' campaign (data source: Deputy Prime Minister Liu Yandong, speech on the National Conference of Schistosomiasis Control in 2014). Local governments at all levels worked according to the demands of 'building a harmonious society, constructing new countryside' and implemented comprehensive control measures, with emphasis on infectious source e timely suggested by the Ministry of Health. The process of schistosomiasis control were effectively promoted in The People's Republic of China due to the priority of the resources and strategies, methods and technology, and efforts to ensure achievement of anticipated goal (Lin et al., 2007; Yi et al., 2009a,b; Wang et al., 2009a,b,c) . For example, the State Council approved the implementation of the national rural drinking water safety project and solved the drinking water safety problem for 353 million rural residents and more than 24 million students and teachers from 2005 to 2012. In addition, The People's Republic of China has also allocated 18.5 billion yuan to the construction of prevention and control system for animal disease and a comprehensive schistosomiasis control (Li, 2013) . The pilot counties for schistosomiasis-integrated control were set up by the State Council leading group in different endemic areas for the first time, including Jinxian County in Jiangxi Province, AnXiang County in Hunan Province, Hanchuan County in Hubei Province, Guichi County in Anhui Province and Puge County in Sichuan Province. They were the representatives of schistosomiasis-integrated control through implementation of all proposed measures (Yu et al., 2006) . Subsequently, provinces also carried out the pilot work in heavy endemic counties with effective results (Zhang et al., 2009; Zhu et al., 2009; Yang et al., 2009; Yi et al., 2009a,b) .

The planning has been implemented after 2005. The comprehensive and scientific prevention and control were strengthened under the unified leadership of the central government, and the close cooperation of ministries of agriculture, forestry, water conservancy, health and others, as well as the guarantee of organization, funding, laws and regulations, technology, institutions and personnel. According to different ecological environment and epidemic characteristics in endemic areas, distinct goals for prevention and control were made and thus a varied package of control measures was carried out to control schistosomiasis. Measures included eliminating and replacing cattle with machine, adjusting agricultural industry structure, eliminating snails by aquaculture, forestry, improving irrigation system, river regulation, eliminating the source of infection by improvement of water supplier and construction of sanitary latrines, building the biogas, synchronous chemotherapy for human and livestock, case screening and treatment, health education (Liu et al., 2014; Cao et al., 2016; Yang et al., 2016) and others.

The work mechanism among the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Agriculture, and provinces in heavy endemic areas was established in order to promote the process of schistosomiasis control in The People's Republic of China. The government of Hubei Province launched the new work mechanism of schistosomiasis control with the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Agriculture in 2008. The strategy of prevention and control with emphasis on infectious source were strongly performed in 33 key counties. This strategy integrated the resources from the department of agriculture, water conservancy, land, health, forestry, transportation, including the leading group of government, departments union, action of the central and local, and thus allowed power and resources to be concentrated. Due to 'the implementation of comprehensive control in the whole county' in heavy endemic areas, the infection rate was reduced further and the achievements were consolidated in Hubei Province. The unified actions for schistosomiasis control between the government of Hunan Province and the Ministry of Health were carried out in 2010. According to the principle of 'overall planning, comprehensive control, showing emphasis', the control measures, focussing on management of infection sources, were carried out in 14 counties (districts) in heavy endemic areas of the Dongting Lake and along the Yangtze River. It was also combined with new rural construction in order to eliminate the cause of schistosomiasis.

To strengthen the leadership of schistosomiasis control, lots of governments at different levels included the programme into their overall planning for local economy and social development and the management target of government, such as signing the 'target responsibility' and 'responsibility contract'. Various forms of responsibility system, including clearing responsibility, task and objectives and the regular evaluation system were set up. It was also important to evaluate the performance of the cadres. Related research work of schistosomiasis control has been carried out in-depth by the relevant ministries and commissions of the State Council and the governments at all levels in The People's Republic of China. control were achieved (Hao et al., 2009; The Ministry of Health et al., 2008; Hao et al., 2010; Li et al., 2009) . Jiangsu and Hubei provinces achieved the standard of transmission control in 2010 and 2013, respectively, causing the final objectives of national long-term planning of schistosomiasis control to be achieved. Besides, the infection rate in three provinces Anhui, Jiangxi and Hunan reduced yearly. All of them will achieve the final objectives of national long-term planning of schistosomiasis control as scheduled by the end of 2015. 

Reviewing the brilliant achievements of schistosomiasis control in since mid-1950s, the experiences, which were suited to the development of society and economy at different stages, have been accumulated from the prevention work in The People's Republic of China (Fig. 11) . In The People's Republic of China, the major experience of policy evolution of schistosomiasis control was that, we had depended mainly on the mass movement from the 1950s, on the progress of scientific and technological in the 1980s, and then attached great importance to the ecological comprehensive control since the 21st century. Therefore, it gives us the inspirations as follows.

Schistosomiasis control was always an important topic in the field of public health in The People's Republic of China. Moreover, it is valid only due to the unified leadership and policy support from the government, whether it is in the early years where the country has a relatively backward social economy, or in 2010s with the rapid development of social economy (Table 5 ). There were three rebound epidemics of schistosomiasis in The People's Republic of China: the first one was influenced by the cultural revolution during the 1960s, the second was influenced by the reform of market economy system during the 1980s and the third was affected by the multiple factors of the natural environment and social economy around the 20th century. The CPC and the government paid great importance to schistosomiasis control. The policy system of schistosomiasis control was formed by strengthening the leadership according to the measures of issuing a series of policy document on schistosomiasis control from central to local government, and making central planning and local specific measures. Therefore, the mode of schistosomiasis control depended on the leadership of the government, who indicated the direction of the development and laid the foundation in future.

In addition, disease control and prevention was upgraded to the national polity level, where promoting disease control and prevention by political authority formed the solid foundation of schistosomiasis elimination.

A series of planning has been made from the central government to the local governments in The People's Republic of China, effectively promoted by the implementation process of schistosomiasis control, by setting phased objectives and the final target in the long term. Measures were adjusted according to local conditions and epidemic situation, and from strategies to specific measures all were integrated to allow a comprehensive control programme to be rolled out. Experiences from The People's Republic of China showed that the prevalence of schistosomiasis could be controlled effectively with well-planned and executed national control programmes and a certain amount of investment ).

Schistosomiasis is a public health concern and its control involves the departments of agriculture, forestry, water conservancy, forestry and environment. Thus the control programme depends on the cooperation of different departments, and is difficult to be implemented by the department of health alone. Remarkable achievements of schistosomiasis control were achieved in The People's Republic of China, because it has always paid important attention to combine coordination with development between different departments, integrate resources from the whole society, conform to the trend of social development, closely combine with the economic construction and implement comprehensive control measures according to the local condition.

Strategies for schistosomiasis control has been continually improved in The People's Republic of China with the development of society and economy, the progress of science and technology, and the adjustment of strategies from WHO. All the corrections were made using scientific research as the guide. Practice shows that the promotion of science and technology was the key in speeding up the progress of schistosomiasis control. Difficulties and bottlenecks from schistosomiasis control were defeated relying on the progress of science and technology (Chen et al., 2016) . The level of disease prevention and control are improved relying on the guidance of science and technology. Concurrently, it is important to assemble a professional high-quality team who can carry out the scientific prevention and control measures.

In the early years of The People's Republic of China, the whole society was mobilized to join in the infectious diseases control, including the fundamental interests of the masses, social politics and economic development.

The basis of schistosomiasis control relied closely on the masses during the 1950s. Remarkable results were achieved by organizing the masses movement at that time even though the science and technology were underdeveloped. Hence, people were the main force of the elimination of schistosomiasis then. Nowadays, schistosomiasis control still need the organizations and institutions of disease prevention and control with the leadership of the party committees at all levels. We still need the understanding and support of the whole society to carry out extensive social mobilization and participation (Salam et al., 2014) . And we hope to create a healthy environment by sending 'the god of plague' away together.

Across the 65 years of history in schistosomiasis control in The People's Republic of China, precious and rich experiences in terms of policy support and resource mobilization were accumulated, providing a powerful guarantee to promote the process of national prevention and control. But two main problems need to be emphasized on the macrocontrol of policy in future, as follows: Firstly, it was not given enough attention to the schistosomiasis control, which is complex in nature, its economic benefits were always ignored. Therefore, there was a lack in assessment on strategy, especially on comparative assessment on economic benefit analysis of strategy and the rational allocation of resources. Secondly, the investment of schistosomiasis control was under a budgeting system responsible by the state. When the proposed measures did not work, nobody but the state had to bear the economic losses. It also means that there is no competition for investment of schistosomiasis control, so there is no push for an effective use of national resources .

The national conference on schistosomiasis control was held by the State Council in November 2014. Premier Li Keqiang, the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee made important instructions for the meeting: '. sweeping ""the god of plague"" into history, and bringing the clean, peace and health to all people.' Vice Premier Liu Yandong, the Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee stressed that the control planning of the next 10 years must be made as soon as possible at the meeting. We must strive to improve the professional technology in order to win the battle of schistosomiasis control in the next 10 years, and strive to realize schistosomiasis elimination. With the social and economic developments, the level of people's life and culture has gradually improved. The government invests more financial and material resources to schistosomiasis control, therefore people will be able to choose a healthy life, far away from schistosomiasis . We believe that we will achieve the goal of schistosomiasis elimination as early as possible, and the long-cherished wish of sending 'the god of plague' will be finally realized through the leadership of the party and government, and the joint efforts from the whole society in the near future (Zheng et al., 2013) .

The time of cooperation for the development of improved global public health is approaching (Xu et al., 2016a,b) . The global elimination of schistosomiasis in 2025 was passed on the World Health Assembly in 2012. The United Nations summit put forward 'sustainable development goals after 2015' on 'Rio þ 20' in 2014, including the global elimination of schistosomiasis. Currently, one-third of global population is threatened by schistosomiasis in The People's Republic of China. In order to achieve global sustainable development, it is important to control schistosomiasis well in The People's Republic of China. As a responsible and big country, we should response positively to the international initiative, by speeding up the pace of schistosomiasis elimination (Tambo et al., 2014) . This will in turn benefit both the people of The People's Republic of China and the international community.

Open Access A Population Health Surveillance Theory,"OBJECTIVES: Despite its extensive use, the term ¨Surveillance¨ often takes on various meanings in the scientific literature pertinent to public health and animal health. A critical appraisal of this literature also reveals ambiguities relating to the scope and necessary structural components underpinning the surveillance process. The authors hypothesized that these inconsistencies translate to real or perceived deficiencies in the conceptual framework of population health surveillance. This paper presents a population health surveillance theory framed upon an explicit conceptual system relative to health surveillance performed in human and animal populations.","Population health surveillance (PHS) represents one of the core functions of public health and animal health and is crucial in the prevention and control of various priority health conditions and diseases. The general objective of PHS is to achieve a timely and continuous assessment of a given population status with respect to a health problem [1, 2] . In short, PHS helps fulfill a need for timely and pertinent information.

In this paper, we define the word 'theory' as being a set of interconnected statements, concepts, or propositions linked by a communality of purpose or topic leading to empirical verification [3] . A theory is an attempt to understand, explain and interpret a reality of a phenomenon or a given subject matter as one sees it [3, 4] . By definition, a theory is testable and should lead to predictions [3] . The expression 'a population health surveillance theory' refers to a theory integrating all concepts essential to the surveillance process and determines the rules connecting these concepts, it should provide a systematic way of understanding, explaining and organizing surveillance and serve as a global base line. The population health surveillance theory (PHST) should also act as an organizing frame leading to the development of a functional organization (i.e., a PHS program). The PHST makes a prediction on whether or not a given surveillance program is acceptable or not, based on the exhaustivity of the concepts and the coherence of the concept relationships. According to the authors, the term 'population health surveillance' includes the surveillance of population health indicators, diseases, infections, pathogens, risk factors and any factor or determinant that may provide an indication on the health status of a population.

The recent threat of a global influenza pandemic, the incidence of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) cases in many countries, as well as the emergence and re-emergence of many more infectious diseases have demonstrated the prime importance of having effective surveillance programs at the regional, national and international levels [5] . In the new International Health Regulations (IHR), adopted in May 2005 by the 58th World Health Assembly, provision was made for a legal framework designed to prevent, protect, control and provide a public health response against diseases and health events that may constitute a public health emergency of international concern. The new IHR has established a set of rules and procedures to support the existing global outbreak alert and response system, to require countries to improve international surveillance and notification mechanisms for public health events, and to strengthen their national surveillance and intervention capacities. According to the IHR 2005, each World Health Organization (WHO) member state and each country that has agreed to be bound by these regulations shall develop, strengthen and maintain the capacity to detect, assess, notify and report health events in accordance with specific core capacity requirements [5] [6] [7] .

From an animal health and trade perspective, the World Trade Organization agreement on the application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures (SPS agreement) sets out the basic rules for food safety and animal and plant health standards [8] . The SPS agreement is very clear regarding each country's right to adopt their own sanitary measures to protect the health of their people, animals and plants [8, 9] . These measures must be based on international standards or on a scientific assessment of risk [8, 9] . As a consequence, the SPS agreement has increased the need for countries to provide science-based evidence to support their claims regarding population health status. This has wide implications as without an effective and reliable surveillance program in operation, a country attempting to export goods would be unable to provide valid scientific and technical information on its health status to an importing country, increasing the risk of losing trade opportunities [8, 10] .

There are two important knowledge elements underpinning a PHS process: a methodological know-how set of practices and a set of concepts and principles framing the design characteristics of the surveillance program. There are a wide range of methods that are being proposed and applied in the context of PHS and despite the variety of methods and practices pro-posed, most PHS programs documented seem to rely on an illdefined conceptual base [1, [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] . One important concept often left ambiguous relates to delineating the PHS process from the disease control process. In the literature, three different views on this issue have been published: first, the disease control process is different from the surveillance process [18] ; second, the disease control process and therefore the intervention strategies are components of the surveillance process [19] [20] [21] ; and third, the surveillance process is part of any disease control process [1, 22, 23] .

Until 1950, the concept of 'Surveillance' was restricted to the observation of people with serious communicable diseases with the objective of detecting symptoms so that prompt isolation could be instituted [17, 24] . In 1963, Alexander Langmuir broadened the use of the term 'Surveillance' by applying it to disease rather than individuals [17, 24] . Langmuir limited the scope of surveillance to collection, analysis and dissemination of data in public health practice [17, [25] [26] [27] , thus according to Langmuir's definition, surveillance does not encompass direct responsibility for disease control activities [17, 26, 27] . In 1966, surveillance was defined by the WHO to include ""the epidemiological study of disease as a dynamic process"" and a variety of disease control activities [27, 28] . This included eight core components for an effective surveillance program, namely: detection; registration; confirmation; reporting; data analysis and interpretation; epidemic preparedness; response and control; and feedback [21] . These components were reviewed by the WHO in 2001 but the disease control activities were still kept within the scope of public health surveillance programs [29] . Other public health researchers proposed activities similar to the ones proposed by the WHO to scope the PHS, but excluded components relating to epidemic preparedness, and the response and disease control activities from their definition [18, [30] [31] [32] [33] .

For animal health specialists, PHS programs only require three components: first, a defined disease monitoring program; second, a predefined disease intervention strategy; and third, a defined threshold of disease frequency [1, 19] . In this case, 'monitoring' describes the ongoing efforts directed at assessing the health and disease status of a given population, which necessitates a program for collecting, processing and summarizing data, and disseminating information to appropriate organization as well as individuals [1, 11, 19] .

One of the main consequences of this inconsistent scoping of surveillance and misunderstanding of the driving concepts is the difficulty in establishing rigorous evaluations of surveillance programs. Although we can find a wealth of publications describing the concepts, applications and methods that can be used in the context of PHS, these elements have never been assembled to constitute the base of a PHST [1, [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] 32] .

The main objective of this paper is to propose a theory of population health surveillance which would be based on an explicit system of values about health surveillance in a given population.

The population health surveillance theory reflects the authors' system of thinking and was based on a creative process.

The authors used the definitions of Carol Grbich for the following concepts: constructivism, positivism and intersubjectivity [34] .

The word 'Surveillance' was originally derived for the French verb 'Surveiller' which literally means 'to watch over'. In this context, ""Surveillance"" refers broadly to the activity of watching over a person, a population, an object or a phenomenon. More specifically, surveillance is a continuous and dynamic process of close observation of a specific target. Hence, in addition to the notion of 'observation', surveillance should implicitly include the following elements: ongoing data collection, analysis, interpretation, knowledge production, and timely information dissemination (i.e. information sharing) on the state of a predefined target to an appropriate audience (e.g. stakeholders, decision-makers), it is therefore essentially a repetitive process aimed at producing targeted information.

PHS refers to the health surveillance of a given population as measured by health or disease indicators while 'individual health surveillance' refers to the description of the health or disease status of a person or an animal. Unlike individual health surveillance, PHS involves a specific population structure (e.g. subpopulations, population at risk) often varying in time and space and can be further seen as a collective activity in consideration of the organized human effort needed for its functioning. This relates to the concept of ""organization"" in the primary sense of the term, such as a group of people that work together, setting objectives and then judiciously using financial and material resources to achieve them. In short, PHS is a specialized type of organization which performs surveillance on populations. The following observations concerning PHS can also be made:

PHS is a type of organization which enables the production of epidemiological intelligence. As such, one of the central tasks should be the ability to detect and prioritize which hazards should be investigated (problem definition).

PHS also goes beyond simply observing a given population. PHS often involves a specific target (e.g. specific disease and population), specific objective(s) and continuous (repetitive) processes.

PHS often features retroactions on the surveillance process and thus should be considered as a mathematical system (Figure 1) . The PHS involves a retroaction (feedback) process where input and output are seen as needs and information respectively. The produced information is then assessed and adjustments (i.e. retroactions) are made, when necessary, to improve a set of attributes describing the surveillance process. Through these retroactions, the surveillance process adapts to the needs of the stakeholders' objectives.

In a modern conceptualization of surveillance, PHS differs from population health monitoring in that the latter involves no or only a crude level of analysis of the collected data which is often directed at detecting changes in disease level or risk factors in a given population. The levels of data analysis and data representation are usually rudimentary in any monitoring process compared to 'Surveillance'. It could be, for example, a simple count of all notified cases, or a repetitive calculation of disease prevalence in a specific region. The Surveillance process generates more, or a richer, knowledge than a monitoring process as it includes the contextual interpretation of this data (to be used for decision). The surveillance process usually involves advanced statistical analysis to generate knowledge. Surveillance is based on an epidemiological intelligence approach, meaning that collected data is processed intelligently to produce knowledge. The use of the word 'Surveillance' or 'Monitoring' will then depend on the complexity of the problem, and the level of information and knowledge to generate. In this context, surveillance includes continuous data collection, the use of intelligent and advanced data analysis techniques, the production of knowledge, and the communication of the information to decision makers in a timely manner. Surveillance implies the use of a well structured communication system, in which monitoring programs could be either absent or rudimentary.

The PHS process is composed of five interrelated steps (Figure 2) . The problem

The initiation of a surveillance process usually requires the presence of three essential elements: i) a dissatisfaction, ii) a need for knowledge and/or time dependent information, and iii) some level of motivation to eliminate the dissatisfaction and meet the information need about the population health status. There is a need for surveillance as long as these elements persist.

Dissatisfaction is the feeling of psychological discomfort that emerges when a person compares his/her perception of two situations -one representing the actual state of things vs. the desired state of things. Dissatisfaction then is subjective and is part of the affective dimension of a problem. When dissatisfaction is shared by a sufficiently important portion of the decision makers and the stakeholders then it constitutes the starting point for a surveillance initiative. In most instances, the lack of useful information is a source of dissatisfaction and correction of that state is sought.

The coexistence of these three prerequisite elements (i.e. dissatisfaction, need for information, motivation) is the foundation on which the problem is perceived and first scoped. This step most often involves various groups of participants (content experts, stakeholders, decision-makers) and is based on the concept of intersubjectivity of the constructivism paradigm, which is a state of overlap of individual understandings that overemphasizes agreement and de-emphasizes disagreement among the participants. At this point, it is necessary to build an explicit formulation of the problem that can be discussed and enriched until a consensus is reached among the participants.

Problem formulation requires the formal and specific descrip-tion of the dissatisfaction, which represents the first step in the knowledge production process. Problem formulation is often challenging due to the degree of difficulty relating to the nature of the problem, and the knowledge and experience of the people formulating the problem. The definition of a problem often requires close cooperation and consensus building among various stakeholders working in different disciplines. In the context of PHS, the following elements have to be included during problem formulation: identifying the essential stakeholders and multi-disciplinary expertise, identifying the health outcome to be measured, defining the population under surveillance, analyzing the current situation and available knowledge, and setting the surveillance objectives ( Figure 3 ). The problem formulation process must be clear, rigorous, precise, and based on a constructivist paradigm and intersubjectivity.

Surveillance planning is defined as an ongoing process that provides a technical and a logistical framework for making decisions concerning the expected results and the strategies available for solving the surveillance problem. Surveillance planning needs to be consistent with the objectives and the frameworks previously defined during the problem formulation step. The final result in surveillance planning is a collective action plan that identifies activities, task division and resource allocation. The following elements must also be considered during the surveillance planning step: data collection and integration (including database issues), data analysis, and information communication. After identifying the main surveillance elements and establishing a plan for each of these activities, it is necessary to link them all together via an administrative and organizational plan Step 4

(the program). PHS is a collective activity that requires resources: human, financial and material. During the planning stage, the feasibility, the availability of sufficient resources and the compliance with sound methodology should be foreseen. External validation of the proposed plan should be considered.

Elaborating an audit process is the final step of the surveillance planning step (Figure 3 ).

Implementing the surveillance program is the final step in the knowledge production process. The objective of this step is to put the surveillance planning into action. Surveillance implementation is an ongoing process of intentional actions aimed at producing two types of knowledge: tacit and explicit. The tacit knowledge is hard to formalize and communicate. However, the explicit knowledge can be encoded, articulated into formal language, shared, stored and communicated through information technologies. The audit of the surveillance program is a crucial element to be taken into account during the surveillance implementation step. The surveillance program evaluation needs to be a recurrent process aimed at comparing the surveillance results with surveillance objectives. As a result of the surveillance evaluation, the problem, the objectives and the surveillance plan may be re-assessed accordingly.

The explicit knowledge generated during the knowledge production step is in fact information shared through various communication channels and formats appropriate for the target audience(s). The produced information should be communicated on a regular basis to maintain the motivation and the engagement of all stakeholders and decision-makers. Most often, the frequency by which this information is produced and shared will vary according to the disease epidemiology (e.g. endemic, epidemic/epizootic disease), the socio-economic impact of the health problem, as well as the information needed for disease control activities and international obligations or requests.

The PHST is an explicit theory that helps explain and organize the surveillance process. The first element of the theory describes the context and initial state which triggers the need for a PHS activity and relates primarily to the identification of the hazards and to the feeling of dissatisfaction by stakeholders in face of these hazards [1, 35] . The basic questions underpinning this first element are: what hazard(s), to whom, where and when. The second step is directly consequent to this initial state and, as for any scientific process, aims at providing an explicit formulation of the problem which is necessary before the next step can begin [19, 36] . The coherence of the surveillance process and related activities will depend directly on the quality of the problem formulation.

The surveillance planning and implementation steps of the surveillance process aims primarily at producing a strategic plan that will frame the production of specific knowledge according to the problem formulation step. Coherence between strategy and objectives is required not only at the onset of surveillance but also during the ongoing execution of the surveillance activities [37] . In this context, it is therefore essential to plan and include an audit and a review of the strategy as retroactive actions. Once the strategy is agreed upon and authorized by the organization mandated to carry out the surveillance, then it must be implemented and executed.

The PHS theory proposes a clear distinction between surveillance and monitoring processes with the latter referring to essentially a data gathering activity with a crude presentation of the data. The theory stipulates that surveillance is based on an epi-intelligence approach and aims to produce knowledge through advanced analysis techniques [12, 17] . As an illustration, if we consider a patient in an intensive care unit -the equipment monitors while the medical staff watches over the situation. The monitor refers to the screen on which the patient's data is continuously collected and displayed. PHS is a much more involved activity that will always incorporate some degree of data monitoring. Problem formulation and knowledge production are two essential components of PHS that do not exist to the same extent in monitoring. Monitoring can often be largely automated but it is doubtful that, even in the future, surveillance could ever become fully automated due to the complex nature of data interpretation and feedback actions. In simple terms, monitoring is to be supplemented by intelligent actions in order to be framed as ''surveillance''. This concept is fundamental to the proposed theory of surveillance.

The PHS activities are directed towards addressing specific population-level problems, and therefore are relevant to a group of individuals (communities, populations) and many stakeholders. This notion implies that an organization is required to plan and conduct the surveillance activity [27] . The social representation and population relevance of this organization must be apparent with respect to the problem formulation (how the issue is framed), the selection of surveillance experts, and the stakeholders engaged and consulted [35] . Thus, the application of an explicit theory relevant to population health surveillance provides an appropriate framework to help in reaching consensus on the problem formulation and on the structure of the organization needed to carry out the surveillance activities.

The ongoing aspect of the surveillance process is usually well accepted as the recognition of health hazards may emerge or shift over time. Given that one important objective of surveillance is to produce knowledge about the hazardous situation and since knowledge, when it is obtained, changes the need for further knowledge, the hazard and the knowledge base need must be continuously reassessed. A rapidly changing situation must be reassessed more often than a slow changing situation, which implies that it is in the nature of the surveillance activity to contain a retroaction mechanism (Figure 1 ). This makes surveillance an adaptive knowledge production system as defined in Von Bertalanfy's general system theory [38] . The recurrent retroactions between the produced information, the problem definition, and the methods applied in measuring the outcomes are integral parts of the proposed theory.

The proposed theory describes surveillance as a complex organization that handles a process with a non linear dynamic with the objective of producing information that helps to protect the health of the population from hazards, which could be referred to as epidemiological intelligence [17] . According to the proposed theory, surveillance is based on an epidemiological intelligence approach and surveillance programs should be structured as an intelligence organization [17] .

One of the major scoping issues in the field of PHS is whether or not to include the disease control process as part of the surveillance. PHST stipulates that the disease control process is not part of the surveillance process and vice versa. The two processes have different objectives and are consequently distinct, which is a vision shared by Yarrow [18] . PHST suggests that surveillance and disease control programs should be kept independent and separate. The proposed theory of surveillance is conceptually linked directly to knowledge theory while disease control is linked to action and decision theory. This major conceptual difference separates ontologically surveillance from disease control. In the case of an audit of surveillance, the main question would be: did the produced knowledge appropriately reduce the original lack of knowledge? The major question on the audit of disease control would be: did the disease control measures reduce the level of the disease in the population? It is quite possible that a good surveillance program will help to conclude that a disease control program is not needed. For example, one can decide to implement a tobacco control program without necessarily developing a cigarette surveillance program or can establish a vaccination program in a high risk population without implementing a surveillance program. When the disease control process is not included in a surveillance process and vice versa then it is easier to evaluate the performances of either the surveillance program or the disease control program or both. However, when these two activities coexist in the same program then it is difficult to know which process needs to be improved in order to eliminate the dissatisfaction. This situation is frequent especially when the disease, health condition or hazards under surveillance have significant impacts on trade or public health. Therefore, it is useful to separate these two processes and propose a theory for each process. They should be distinct but the two processes can be complementary.

The PHST is a construct reflecting the conceptual framework of the authors. The PHST assumes an overall similarity in the conceptual and structural frameworks of animal health and public health programs. This is justified by the desire to embrace the concept of health into one consistent paradigm− The one health concept.

The proposed theory of population health surveillance refers concurrently to a sequential structured process, a human organization and a system. The PHST offers a coherent thought process which explains and justifies the main components of population health surveillance and should help with the development and documentation of coherent population health surveillance programs. The proposed theory could be used as the basis for a conceptual evaluation tool of public health and animal health surveillance programs in a complement to existing methodological evaluation.

Refers to a school of philosophy that affirms that reality lies only in things which can be seen with the eye [34] . The positivism paradigm views truth as absolute and values the original and unique aspects of scientific research [34] .

In this paradigm, reality is viewed as socially and societally embedded in the mind [34] . Reality is changing over time and knowledge is constructed jointly in interaction by the researcher and the researched through consensus [34] . Multiple realities are thus possible [34] .

Detecting infant facial cry because of inability to communicate pain, recognizing facial emotion to understand dysfunction mechanisms through micro expression or transform captured human expression with motion device into three-dimensional objects are some of the applied systems. Nowadays, collaborated with biomedical research, mining and analyzing social network can improve public and private health care sectors as well such as research health news shared on social media about pharmaceutical drugs, pandemics, or viral outbreaks. Due to the vast amount of shared news, there is an urgency to select and filter information to prevent the spread of hoax or fake news. We explored in depth some steps to classify hoaxes written as news articles. This discussion also encourages on how technologies of social network analysis could be used to make new kinds improvement in health care sectors. Then close with a description of limitless future possibilities of biomedical engineering research in social media.","Biomedical engineering research is multidisciplinary works, which commonly related to medical devices used for improving the quality of life. It merges scientific and engineering fields such as nanotechnology, stem cell as regenerative medicine, biomechanics, and biomedical devices for helping diagnostics and therapeutics [1] . As an example, nanoparticles or nanomaterials can be used in diagnostic applications such as gene therapy or bioimaging in the brain. Some of the applied systems within biomedical engineering research [2] are detecting infant facial cry to help to communicate pain [3] and lip feature extracting on the frontal face for speech training of the deaf [4] . Another work is recognizing facial emotion to understand dysfunction mechanisms through micro expression or transform captured human expression with motion device into three-dimensional objects [5] . Those works use image-based data in unobtrusive smart systems for healthcare related models. A recent trend is not only about images but also about textual data in healthcare related models such as fake news or hoax spreading within the power of internet technology.

Fake news or hoax has many definitions such as recurrent issues used as a political weapon, irrelevant truths (posttruths) or intentionally spreading falsehood information (alt-facts) [6] . Alternative facts (alt-facts) are information with no basis in reality while post-truths are defined as beyond the truths or irrelevant information. This discussion has a focus on fake news or hoax in Indonesia [7] in the form of alt-facts [8] especially about medical related issues [9] . Conducted surveys in Indonesia gave perceptions about hoaxes, how they are spread, their topic classifications and their effects on the communities. The medium of communication for hoaxes is varied like image or video such that manipulating non-textual content becomes another problem. Meanwhile, text-based hoaxes are usually spread through social media like Twitter or Facebook and the analysis to recognize them are not limited to the hoax text itself but also on how it is presented, by who, and in what format and context [10] . Hoax text presentation means that the analysis is about linguistic-based features because microblog text like Twitter and email text have different characteristics. The sources who are spreading hoax texts tend to have verifiability issues. Thus in the case of Twitter usage as a medium of communication for hoaxes, analysis of retweeting topology network becomes necessary. Aforementioned hoax analysis can be categorized into two major approaches: linguistic and network. Here, we discuss hoax within online news text that put more weights on the linguistic aspect [11] . Linguistic approaches concern with texts as a bag of equally significant words, syntax structure like noun and verb phrases within the texts, and semantic analysis to recognize any contradictions on other texts with the similar topics of allegedly hoax texts. As network approach, some web-based tools are used to predict and track disease outbreaks through query keyword evaluation [12] .

Hoax analysis for the Indonesian language becomes interesting research as well since the government makes it as an important issue [7] [8] . Many unverified but widespread news can hinder the national policies. Hoax texts as bags of words were identified with some classifiers [13] in some conditions such as the experimented topics are general, the dataset comes from undeclared sources, and the training data needs manual label. Several selection features are implemented to filter the important words. Those limitations are understandable because of no Indonesian hoax text datasets available unlike English hoaxes or fake news datasets (http://www.fakenewschallenge.org/). However, those steps are not suitable for analyzing medically related hoax text since the article has convincing content but fabricated facts unless there is a refutation article to verify the false claim ( Fig. 1 , overall hoax content is showed in the left figure while the disagree texts are in the right figure) . Those articles give stance position whether supporting the claims or refuting the hoaxes to evaluate the attitude expressed in the texts. For that reason, in a medical hoax classification problem, stance articles turn out to be essential.

Fake News Challenge (FNC) use stance classification approaches for classifying fake news [14] [15] , and their topics are not medically related hoaxes. FNC classify news texts based on headlines concerning their stances of agrees, disagrees, discusses and unrelated. Fig.2 shows article samples with stances of unrelated (top), agree (middle) and discuss (bottom) concerning issues of Christian Bale passes on a Steve Job role. Stance labels need careful evaluation because headline text and body text can result in different attitudes.

Next section describes some compared methods and experiments as an analysis implementation of medically related hoaxes with stance classification approach using our primary collected small dataset. 30-year-old Moscow resident was hospitalized with wounds very intimate nature. As it became known LifeNews, in the hands of doctors, the man complained that his casual acquaintance opoila in the sauna, and then gently held his castration operation. And actions criminals were executed with surgical precision. … … … (top, stance: unrelated)

""Christian Bale will not be starring as Steve Jobs in Aaron Sorkin's upcoming Steve Jobs biopic, according to The Hollywood Reporter. The actor has reportedly decided that he was """"not right for the part,"""" deciding to withdraw from the film. Bale was announced as the star of the film just last week, with Sorkin saying that Christian Bale was """"the best actor in a certain age range"""" to play Jobs, and that he had agreed to the part without an audition.… … … (middle, stance: agree)

""Actor Christian Bale is in talks to play the leading role in the upcoming Steve Jobs biopic being produced by Sony, reports Variety. Leonardo DiCaprio was originally in talks to play Jobs, but withdrew from negotiations earlier this month. Penned by Aaron Sorkin, the Steve Jobs biopic was originally set to be directed by """"The Social Network"""" director David Fincher, who was said to be in talks with Sony earlier this year, but the director title went to Danny Boyle instead, who also directed the hit movie """"Slumdog Millionaire."""" When David Fincher was still attached to the project, he reportedly was hoping to cast Christian Bale in the lead role due to his undeniable resemblance to the former CEO. Christian Bale is also known for his ability to adapt to roles, shedding and gaining weight as necessary to accurately portray characters. … … … (bottom, stance: discuss) 

Some methods are compared for identifying hoaxes with different kind of texts (Table 1 ) such as Facebook, Twitter, Wikipedia, and article news. Recent researches give more attentions to word-embedding techniques, which need no knowledge about the language of hoax texts [14] [15] . The weight value of term vector is no longer occurrences based but also considering positions of phrase texts like word embedding. However, the text source influences methods of feature selection and classifier. For example, in Wikipedia articles [16] there are appearance features like word counting, content ratio of texts & non-texts, and links within articles. Another kind of feature for Wikipedia articles is network-based coefficients like clustering coefficient to differentiate legitimate and hoax articles. Unique characteristic of Facebook posts create user categories [17] , which are user who like hoaxes, user who like non-hoaxes, and user who like both posts. Those categories have an influence in preparing data collection. For Twitter allegedly hoaxes [18] , retweeting topology network can be a network feature for hoax analysis to verify the credibility of text source.

This paper showed experiments with steps are directly taken from the approaches of stance classification [19] (Fig.  3) . The purpose of our experiments is to show how stance classification implemented in hoax analysis especially with medial contents. The first step of our experiments is collecting data come from medical archives of snopes.com (http://www.snopes.com/category/facts/medical/). The articles are categorized as true, false, and unverified facts. For our Snopes small dataset, we have articles of 19 true claims, 42 false claims, and 17 unverified texts. Then we find 400 related headlines of news texts as stance articles from the search results which have states of for when the claim is true, against when the claim is false, and observing when it merely repeats the claim but uses hedging or vague language. Because of the possibilities for hedging texts, there are two kinds of features: headlines and claim-headlines. Headlines features are common bag-of-words representation from term frequency until distance between root word and refuting word in a sentence that needs a process of analyzing grammatical structure. Whereas, claim-headline features need aligning process between words in a claim with its parallel headline, i.e. Paraphrase Database (PPDB). After aligning words and know their positions, the similarity between vectors of the claim and the headline uses wordembedding results.

We used the available implementation [19] (https://github.com/willferreira/mscproject) with certain preparation steps for medical hoax dataset. The classifier with headlines features gives varied performances in all stances (Table 2) , although claim-headlines features have consistent results in the against class (Table 3) . It confirms that aligning phrase or words using Paraphrase Database (PPDB) between the claim and the headline is necessary for vague language. Hedging or vague texts are common in the headline instances of observing class. Some misclassified data sample are presented in Table 2 . The same misclassified texts for headlines are also found in Table 3 . In the other hand, accuracy value for the instances of against class is consistent between headline feature (Table 2 ) and claim-headline feature ( Table 3 ). This happens because in the instances of against class, the article contents show similar stance with the article headlines. Table 2 shows the instances of against class have better accuracy value compare to others, while the instances of observing class have better precision value, and the instances of for class have better recall value. This happens because the headline texts are usually short. Therefore, further works on a better understanding of semantic meaning in the article is needed to obtain a better stance. This ongoing research focuses on stance classification, as a preliminary research on hoax analysis. After the stance classification is done accurately, the next step will be on hoax classification.

We have showed that biomedical engineering research are not limited to bioimaging of diagnostics applications for improving the quality of life. Filtering health information in social media such as hoaxes can be associated with biomedical research as well. Because of social media characteristic, linguistic and network features are common approaches in clarifying the truthiness of hoaxes. Understanding the contents of medical hoax or non-hoax texts often uses phrase and word positioning like word embedding. The allegedly hoax texts can be truth claims, false facts, or vague description. For that reason, hoax analysis can be solved as stance classification and data collecting process requires the hoax dataset and the stance dataset. However, text sources such as Twitter or Facebook give another perception for determining hoax analysis. For future works, researches of Indonesian hoaxes still offer many possibilities since analyzing grammatical structure become language barrier.

How the Hong Kong government lost the public trust in SARS: Insights for government communication in a health crisis,This paper analyzes the crisis mismanagement of the Hong Kong government during the SARS outbreak. It addresses eight factors that characterize a government crisis and uses them as guidelines to assess how the Hong Kong government performed in SARS.,"Helm and his associates (1981)'s work suggests that government public relations is distinguished from corporate public relations in both nature and scope. Especially in times of an acute crisis, the government's level of responsibility, complexity of communication layers as well as degree of public and media scrutiny often far exceed that of the private sector.

Specifically, eight factors that characterize the uniqueness of a government crisis are identified in this study (Buus & Olsson, 2006; Helm, Hiebert, Naver, & Rabin, 1981; Liu & Horsley, 2007; Rosenthal & Kouzmin, 1997; Viteritti, 1997) : (1) A crisis raises questions about the ineffectiveness of government authorities regarding prevention and containment. (2) A crisis can magnify the existing problem of the government's devaluation of communication.

(3) When a crisis occurs, the media scrutiny intensifies. (4) Government crises and their handlings constitute public's accumulated collective memories that are used to evaluate against the next government crisis. (5) The public often sees a government crisis as thematic rather than episodic in nature-that is, they evaluate crisis within a broader context (such as a product of the government and its leadership rather than in relation to a specific episode). (6) The public often interprets the government's crisis communication as a reflection of how much the government prioritizes public good. (7) When a crisis hits, the bureaucratic nature of the * Tel.: +852 26961907. public sector often magnifies in the eyes of the public. (8) The political, economic and social contexts constitute a powerful external crisis environment that often influences the government's decision.

The distinctive nature of a government crisis has two implications: Firstly, the existing crisis communication frameworks that commonly focus on the analysis of crisis response strategies (e.g., the use of apology, compensation, responsibility acceptance) may not be adequate to address the complexity of a government crisis. Secondly, when a crisis hits, the effectiveness of the government's crisis communication lies in how well it is able to tackle the eight aforementioned challenges that constitute the unique nature of a government crisis.

The 2003 SARS in Hong Kong constituted an acute emergency for the Hong Kong government to act because the local and international public safety was at great risk. However, the Hong Kong government's crisis management in SARS was considered the worst among its other counterparts (e.g., the Canada, the Macau and the Singapore governments) (Cheng, 2004) . Assessment of its crisis communication finds failure in handling the eight aforementioned challenges effectively. Data consisted of over 3500 news articles from five major newspapers in Hong Kong. Specifically, the Hong Kong government failed in.

When SARS started to break out in its neighboring Guangdong province in November 2002, the then Secretary for Health, Welfare and Food of the Hong Kong government, Yeoh Eng-kiong told the local media that because ""the authorities in China have already said there is no need to be concerned,"" there was ""no reason why Hong Kong people should be panicking."" When it was verified that there were contracted cases found in Hong Kong, the Department of Health concentrated in locating the virus origin, leaving the containment measures largely ignored.

The director of the Government Information Service (GIS), who was supposedly the Chief Executive's public relations advisor and representative, had remained absent from the scene throughout the SARS crisis. With over 400 staff in the GIS office, there was not one single designated media spokesperson from the unit. The office had been doing little besides updating the daily figures of contracted medical staff every day through press releases.

The Hong Kong government officials showed little media relation efforts to minimize media scrutiny during the SARS outbreak. The then Secretary for Health, Welfare and Food of the Hong Kong government, Yeoh Eng-kiong scolded the media for ""exaggerating the situation"" and trying to ""scare away all the citizens from the street."" When the reporters complained about the government's lack of transparency, Yeoh gave no response except two ""ha-ha"" sniggers.

In the midst of the outbreak, the government announced the establishment of an investigative team. However, when being asked when the government could release the investigation results, Yeoh replied that it might take ""a few days the shortest or years"" to come up with the answers. On 5 May, the day after the number of new infected cases had dropped to a one-digit unit, the government announced allocating $64 million US dollars to fund related research. However, the measure was seen as vain talks because no concrete actions and timetable were suggested.

The then Chief Executive of the Hong Kong government, Tung Chee Hwa, only made his first show 14 days after the virus broke out in a hospital. He then disappeared again for another 10 days. When asked by the media later why he did not pay a second visit to the hospital, Tung replied that he wanted to, but was ""stopped"" by his colleagues.

The Hong Kong government's economic concern overrode the concern for public safe. When being asked how the public should protect themselves, Yeoh responded coldly that ""there was danger in eating, drinking and even breathing, and one'd better not live if one wants to be risk-free."" He insisted that the scenes of muffled, mask-wearing citizens would tarnish the image of Hong Kong and scare the tourists away. When the public asked the Hong Kong government to follow the Singapore and Canada governments to suspend classes and quarantine suspected cases and their families, Arthur Li, the Secretary for Education and Manpower Bureau, refused and stated that ""the (economic) price for such act was too high.""

Government officials were inconsistent in their comments and behavior, indicating to the public serious bureaucratic problems and poor communication between government agencies. At the beginning of SARS, the Department of Health issued an announcement that they believed the disease had not spread to the community. Yet, another health care entity in the government, the Hospital Authority, announced that there was such possibility. In the midst of the outbreak, some officials (e.g., Ko Wing-man, the Director of Professional Services and Public Affairs) came out wearing masks, whereas some (e.g., Yeoh) did not. Even at the final stage of the SARS outbreak, the issue of mask wearing was still unsettled. While Henry Tang, the then Secretary for Commerce, Industry and Technology suggested to ""burn the masks"" to celebrate, Yeoh reminded the public to ""keep the mask on"" in crowded areas. The inconsistent and anarchic messages reflected a lack of crisis control center and the breakdown of the intra-bureaucratic communications among government units.

Tung had unnecessarily let the political factor interfere his crisis management decision and action. Upon the outbreak of the deadly SARS epidemic, Tung was hesitant to decide/act without direct instructions from the Beijing government. He only resumed his visibility in the SARS crisis after he was called upon to meet the General Secretary of the Communist Party Hu Jintao at the apex of the outbreak. Tung appeared in the public again after being instructed publicly by Hu to ""put citizens' health and well-being as the highest priority."" He suddenly became active after the Beijing government publicly praised the neighboring Macau for implementing preventive measures efficiently and fired the health minister and the mayor of Beijing for mishandling the SARS crisis.

To conclude, eight challenges that characterize a government crisis have been identified in this paper. The Hong Kong government failed in its crisis management in SARS for failing to tackle these challenges effectively.

Perspectives of Australian policy-makers on the potential benefits and risks of technologically enhanced communicable disease surveillance -a modified Delphi survey,"Background: Event-based social media monitoring and pathogen whole genome sequencing (WGS) will enhance communicable disease surveillance research and systems. If linked electronically and scanned systematically, the information provided by these technologies could be mined to uncover new epidemiological patterns and associations much faster than traditional public health approaches. The benefits of earlier outbreak detection are significant, but implementation could be opposed in the absence of a social licence or if ethical and legal concerns are not addressed. Methods: A three-phase mixed-method Delphi survey with Australian policy-makers, health practitioners and lawyers (n = 44) was conducted to explore areas of consensus and disagreement over (1) key policy and practical issues raised by the introduction of novel communicable disease surveillance programmes; and (2) the most significant and likely risks from using social media content and WGS technologies in epidemiological research and outbreak investigations.","Significant outbreaks of infectious disease have impacts that extend beyond morbidity and mortality. Since they are often unanticipated and unpredictable, such outbreaks can cause fear, economic instability and social upheaval [1, 2] . Establishing and maintaining surveillance systems are the foundation of effective outbreak detection and public health response. Moreover, effective routine surveillance is central to the rational allocation of resources and addressing health inequalities, which cannot be tackled unless made visible. Because surveillance relies on the collection, collation and interpretation of large amounts of data, technological innovation has the potential to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of population-based communicable disease research and surveillance systems. For example, the increasing availability of pathogen whole genome sequencing (WGS) and the collection of passive data generated by internet and mobile phone use within a population, will provide new resources for communicable disease research and surveillance activities [3] [4] [5] .

Methods for characterisation of microbes have become increasingly sophisticated over the last 20 years. WGS technologies can provide rapid and accurate information about which microbial species and strain type is causing an outbreak and the timing and direction of transmission. Incorporating this information into surveillance systems will permit more accurate biological risk prediction and faster outbreak identification and tracking [6, 7] , but also reveal information about individuals that many people would consider to be private [8] . Concurrent with these developments in microbiological analysis, there has been a similar rate of technological innovation in data management. Using the tools provided by 'Big Data' , syndromic surveillance systems can track and integrate online data collected for unrelated purposes that potentially reflect disease activity in the community such as social media posts and internet searches [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] . Integrating either or both of these new sources of information into communicable surveillance practices has the potential to greatly enhance current systems. If linked electronically and scanned systematically, pathogen WGS data and user-generated online information could be mined to uncover new epidemiological patterns and associations much faster than traditional public health approaches [14] [15] [16] . Incorporating these new technologies and novel sources of information into established communicable disease surveillance systems should improve our understanding of the rate and direction of disease transmission between individuals and within populations, provide earlier warning and more accurate monitoring of outbreaks, and reduce uncertainty and public fear during their early stages [8, 17] .

The benefits of earlier outbreak detection and response are significant but, when there is no immediate threat, the routine use of a new technology to capture more detailed, specific personal health information could be perceived as intrusive and a threat to privacy, no matter how great the potential benefits for research and practice. When implementing such systems, sovereign states, health authorities and surveillance officers must consider the organisational, political, legislative, personal and ethical implications of surveillance [18] [19] [20] . However, there are also ethical and medico-legal risks in not using available information that could protect local and, potentially, international communities from serious disease outbreaks [21, 22] . Health authorities and researchers in Australia, and elsewhere, are beginning to explore the use of pathogen WGS and event-based social media monitoring, but many jurisdictions still lack policies and structures to support these technologies [5, 23, 24] .

In this paper, we report the results of a modified Delphi survey involving policy-makers and experts with backgrounds relevant to the legal, ethical and epidemiological dimensions of technology-enhanced surveillance systems. This method is particularly useful for technological forecasting and the evaluation of complex problems where (1) the rate of socio-technical change exceeds that which can be managed by technocratic styles of governance; and/or (2) objective data (and models and relations dependent on this data) are insufficient to explain or predict social actions [25] . Participants were drawn from two broad groups, namely (1) an established policy community centred on communicable disease control and (2) an emerging issues network of individuals interested in the social, legal and security dimensions of technological change and innovation.

Policy communities and issues networks are at either end of a continuum characterised by differing levels of internal cohesiveness, state support and access to, and ability to regulate, shared resources [26] . Policy communities are stable, institutionally entrenched groups who share values and broad policy preferences, interact frequently and participate in relatively equal communications to produce lasting policy outcomes; conversely, issue networks include increasingly influential academic, industry and interest groups varying in levels of co-ordination and access to resources, who discuss, critique and generate ideas for policy initiatives in specific policy areas [27, 28] . This study is part of a larger project to develop guidance for policy-makers; its aim is to engage these two networks in a conversation about the social, ethical and legal implications of the use of new technologies (online data monitoring and WGS pathogen fingerprinting) in infectious disease research, control and prevention. In this Delphi survey we sought to (1) identify perceived barriers to the adoption and effective implementation of new technology for communicable disease research and surveillance; and (2) explore areas of consensus or disagreement about potential threats or conflicts of interest between individuals, commercial entities and the broader community associated with it.

A heterogeneous and geographically dispersed group of Australian-based policy-makers and experts in infectious diseases, epidemiology, food safety, health informatics systems, and health and technology law were invited to participate in this Delphi survey. Noting that the boundary between the roles of policy-makers and expert advisors can be nebulous, we defined 'policy-makers' as individuals who participate in policy processes to create, order and maintain rules and structures of action, and 'experts' as individuals with knowledge and experience of the law and/or public health practices, relevant to infectious disease control and prevention, technological innovation, or both [29, 30] . Sampling was purposive, to ensure representation of the relevant disciplines and types of actors. Potential participants were identified through institutional websites and researchers' professional networks.

The rationale underpinning Delphi surveys is that consensus about contentious issues carries more weight than individual opinions [31] . Anonymous data are collected from individuals, collated and then re-presented to the group to elicit further responses [32] . In this study, we analysed data iteratively in parallel with data collection. Rather than force consensus, we employed a modified technique that allowed participants to explain their views. Participants were asked to assess and respond to the levels of consensus/disagreement that emerged from each round to provide greater insight into the potential benefits, harms and risks of using new technologies to enhance communicable disease surveillance. Participants who completed each round were invited to participate in the next, but were free to withdraw at any time. We used an online survey platform (Limesurvey).

In round 1, we asked participants to respond to three hypothetical scenarios (available in Additional file 1) describing the use of a new technology for the purposes of communicable disease surveillance in (1) social media/ online, (2) hospital/workplace, or (3) commercial environments. Responses were analysed qualitatively and coded thematically by two authors (CD and JJ) using framework analysis, a deductive matrix-based qualitative research method for ordering and synthesising textual data, developed by the National Centre for Social Research (United Kingdom). Framework analysis methods are especially well suited to conducting applied and policy-relevant research [33, 34] . During rounds 2 and 3, participants' comments, key arguments and levels of consensus from previous rounds were presented as quotations, bar charts and summaries of qualitative findings, taking care to weigh different opinions and arguments equally. Individual comments were de-identified.

Additional data and comments were collected, using Likert scales and free text responses. On completion of each round, participants' Likert scores were tabulated and free text answers analysed qualitatively, as described. The final stage of analysis during preparation of this report drew on the knowledge and professional experience of the research team, which includes expertise in health social science, bioethics, Australian health law, infectious diseases, microbiological laboratory and data sciences, and health protection. This study was approved by the University of Sydney Human Research Ethics Committee (#2016/819).

Email invitations were sent to 92 potential participants, of whom 44 (47%) from a range of relevant roles and disciplines responded (Additional file 2: Table S1 ). Invitations included an individualised link to the online survey, through which participant consent was obtained. As expected, the panel size gradually decreased as participants withdrew [35] , but the balance between sectors and characteristics of participants remained substantially constant (Additional file 2: Table S1 ).

In round 1, panellists answered a series of structured questions about a scenario describing the use of a new online event-based surveillance system that monitors social media (Twitter, Facebook, etc.) for indicators of emerging public health risks. In the scenario, the new system picks up a post on Facebook from Bob, a 25-year-old high school teacher from Sydney. His post suggests that he may have contracted highly pathogenic avian influenza on a recent holiday to Indonesia. Online discussion of symptoms and work absences also suggests that Bob might have spread the infection to several of his colleagues. Delphi participants proposed a number of responses to this scenario. While the mandate to respond to a potential public health risk was seen to be clear, Delphi panellists disagreed about how to do this and how to contact those most at risk (particularly Bob and his colleagues). After reading each other's comments and suggestions on the merits and risks of different strategies for addressing this acute situation, in rounds 2 and 3 we asked the panel to nominate which approach to contacting Bob they thought was the most appropriate. Figure 1 shows that, while a direct approach (speaking to Bob in person) was strongly favoured, a majority of panel members questioned the acceptability of using a social media platform for this communication, even though Bob had posted information about his health status in a public forum. Others were concerned that an online intervention could create panic by identifying Bob as a public health risk. As one panellist noted: DP #12: ""Where individuals have already disclosed information themselves, then one can make a reasonable assertion that the information is therefore not private. This, however, is not the same as that individual allowing or being willing to have their social media platform used to contact or warn others or to make further enquiries, since all of these actions have the potential to alarm, stigmatise or otherwise negatively affect the social media user.""

When asked to answer either yes or no, 83% of round 2 Delphi panellists agreed that members of the public should expect that their activities on social media could be used for public health surveillance. Using a list drawn from responses to previous rounds, panellists were asked, in round 3, to indicate the conditions under which they believed surveillance of social media is appropriate (Fig. 2) . The key differences (revealed in the comments) were the extent to which participants were concerned about the lack of a clear legal and social mandate and the potential for negative Fig. 1 Panellist's preferences as to how public health authorities should contact someone flagged by an online event-based communicable disease surveillance system public reactions. Many panellists also expressed doubts about the veracity and validity of data passively collected from online sources: DP #37: ""…we don't know how reliable social media actually is in these circumstances. People post things on social media for lots of reasons. It may not be accurate and could be misleading. So use of the data may lead to a wasteful, inappropriate and/or damaging response.""

Taken together, these results indicate that most experts agree that using social media as a source of data for routine population health surveillance does not raise significant ethical concerns. However, there is considerable uncertainty about the legitimacy and acceptability of moving beyond population surveillance to use these online systems as a platform for targeted interventions during a public health response, especially when the individuals involved might be publicly identifiable. The sectoral affiliation of panel participants did not appear to influence responses, except in the case of those with legal backgrounds, who strongly preferred that any of the activities discussed should take place under the auspices of a dedicated legislative framework.

Enhanced communicable disease surveillance in hospital/ workplace environments

The second scenario described the use of a novel, highly discriminatory WGS strain-typing system that can routinely type all methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus isolates from hospital patients. Because WGS technology can provide a pathogen's unique genetic 'fingerprint' , it can potentially identify the timing and direction of individual person-to-person transmission events. In the scenario, the new technology shows that two premature babies who were cared for and died in the same neonatal intensive care unit both had the same rare community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strain.

Panellists agreed that the most important measures to be taken in response to this scenario were a thorough cleaning of the neonatal intensive care unit facility and a renewed focus on infection control. There was, however, disagreement as to how WGS and strain-typing technologies should be used to mitigate the risks of further infections (other infants, parents, staff, etc.). Most prominent were varying levels of concern about (1) the lack of consent from the parents to use WGS on the isolates collected from the dead neonates for the purposes of conducting an epidemiological investigation; (2) the confidentiality of information elicited through testing and strain typing isolates taken from other patients, parents and/or staff members; and (3) the impact on a staff member or parent if they were found to be the source of the pathogen.

Nevertheless, panellists saw an overriding need to address the outbreak in the interests of public safety, irrespective of any broader questions about consent, confidentiality and discrimination. As one panellist noted: DP #07 ""…the main issue, is not whether strain typing is done, but how the results are handled. It is in everyone's interest to understand how pathogens are transmitted so that transmission can be prevented in future, but there should never be any blame (or, hopefully guilt) or penalties involved.""

To explore this issue further, panellists were asked, in round 3, to indicate under what conditions they believed it is appropriate to waive consent from individuals (patients, families and/or staff ) and perform a test for an epidemiological investigation aimed at addressing a potential risk to the health of future patients. Figure 3 shows that most panellists held that the protection of the public was of overriding importance and that most of the potential harms could be managed by establishing systems to maintain the confidentiality of those effected. However, differences in the priority afforded by panellists to different conditions of use, such as absence of alternatives, rights of appeal, and likely effectiveness, indicate that the appropriate thresholds for taking such actions remained contentious. Once again, neither the policy network from which participants were recruited, nor their sectorial background appears to have been a major influence on panellists' opinions and perspectives. 

The final scenario described a significant and fatal outbreak of infection due to a rare strain of Listeria (15 cases/5 deaths) in the community, which appears to be linked to the consumption of chicken-wraps produced by a commercial food company. In this scenario, a dispute arises between public health authorities, one of the victim's families and the food company as to the limits of 'commercial-in-confidence' and who controls access to isolates (and any related information) previously submitted voluntarily by food producers to commercial food laboratories for routine fee-for-service safety testing.

Panellists' responses to this scenario focused on the need to establish who was the legal owner of the isolates held by the commercial food laboratory and whether private companies have the right to block further testing (WGS or otherwise) that lies outside the purpose for which samples were submitted. New technologies such as WGS were seen as being valuable to the investigation of food-borne diseases. However, they also increase commercial/reputational risk for companies who routinely test their products, such that: DP #22 ""…mandated access [to commercial samples and test results] may result in changes to testing in the commercial domain (e.g. cessation of some testing) such that isolates are no longer available… The relationships between labs, food businesses and primary industry and public health agencies are important, as are the priorities of each entity.""

In round 2, panel members were split as to whether WGS testing should proceed without the permission of the food company (12 in favour, 10 against, 9 uncertain). In their comments, many panellists were keen to emphasise that public interest should always trump commercial interest, and questioned how a company could have effective property rights over a pathogen contaminating its product. To explore this issue further, panellists were asked, in round 3, to indicate the conditions under which they believed it was appropriate to conduct a test on an isolate collected from a commercial company without prior consent. Figure 4 indicates that significant disagreement remained as to what conditions were required for testing to be appropriate. More detailed analysis of individual responses revealed that these differences were also present within disciplinary groups and across policy networks. Reflecting on their experiences, many, but not all, panellists from the communicable disease policy network wanted to establish a clear procedural separation; they wanted to distinguish the need to be able to perform secondary tests on isolates submitted to commercial food laboratories in order to inform epidemiological investigations (finding out what is going on) from issues of commercial-in-confidence and reputational damage (managing commercial and property issues raised by the public health response), whereas participants from both networks with legal backgrounds wanted matters of ownership and access to information to be resolved before any testing could take place. To provide remedies to this situation (in the longer term) participants suggested that legal clarity on the issue of public health access to commercial data and environmental and food isolates needed to be established.

The application of new technologies to communicable disease surveillance can provide great benefits but also create risks. In round 3, we asked participants to rank the four most significant and four most likely risks for individuals (11 items) and for the broader community (9 items) from lists compiled from previous survey rounds. Final rankings were determined by assigning a score equivalent to reverse rank (e.g. a score of 4 to items rated 1st, 3 for items ranked 2nd, … 1 for items ranked 4th); scores were multiplied by the number of participants who gave each rank and the overall ranking was determined by adding scores for each item. Additional file 3: Tables S2 and S3 respectively show the final rankings the panel gave to risks for individuals and risks for the community.

For individuals, participants ranked the psychological consequences of knowing one's social media posts are being monitored and the risk of breach in data security highest, with these unwanted outcomes being seen as both significant and likely (Additional file 3: Table S2 ). Instances and potential social consequences of breaches in the privacy of individuals from primary or secondary data usages such as loss of privacy or stigma were not seen as being major risks. In their comments, many panellists noted that consent for data linkage and secondary use was implied, even as they shared concerns that an erosion of community trust in health authorities was the most significant risk from the systematic use of these technologies (Additional file 3: Table S3 ). Notably, the veracity of the data produced by enhanced surveillance techniques was once again a key concern among panel members, with the risk to the community of unnecessary fear-mongering and resource misallocation (through individuals changing their behaviour) being ranked as significant and likely.

Participants in this Delphi study, whom we assumed to be representative of policy-makers and other stakeholders involved in decision-making about new technologies for communicable disease research and surveillance, shared a belief in their potential benefits. However, our findings indicate that both groups were uncertain about the public acceptability of routine collection and linkage of such data to enhance surveillance. Despite broad agreement that it could be ethically justified, participants were uneasy about creating a perception of threat to individual rights, which could erode public trust. The panel identified the key challenge to systematic use of new technologies as a need to establish publicly supported guidelines for their operation.

There are good reasons for participants' hesitation about the use of these technologies, without a clear social licence. The socio-political impacts of technological innovation and emerging risk uncertainty can quickly undermine public trust in governments and, by implication, the authority and perceived legitimacy of associated policy communitiesas events surrounding the introduction of mobile telephone masts and genetically modified crops attest [36, 37] . More broadly, political sensitivities are easily heightened as new surveillance systems are introducedconcerns about privacy, consent and other individualistic values tend to dominate public discourse [38] . In practice, however, when compared to other state-led surveillance practices, typically there has been little public opposition to use of personal information by health authorities for the purposes of protecting public health [8, 39] . In recent decades, for the reasons described above, opposition to the use of health specific surveillance data in new ways has been more likely among public health officials than members of the wider public [40] [41] [42] . Participants of this Delphi were strongly in favour of enhancing communicable disease surveillance, with many supporting a need for greater public interest consideration, not more privacy.

Where the panellists failed to agree was around appropriate thresholds for public health action and policy protections to be offered to subjects of enhanced surveillance systems. For example, there was consistent disagreement, across all three survey rounds, about the relative importance of confidentiality and public health risk and prioritisation of reasonable alternative interventions; these differences need attention and resolution. Experience shows that, with current analytical tools, interpretation of passively collected and analysed online or pathogen WGS data raises questions about what counts as significant or compelling evidence and what action, if any, should follow [43] . The absence of a policy framework to provide institutional support for new surveillance systems and guide subsequent public health actions comes at a cost [4] . Surveillance systems have limited effectiveness unless they lead to an organised response [44] . Although impossible to quantify, systematic non-use of data can amplify and compound the harms associated with inaction [22] . For reasons of transparency and public acceptability, if not protection, resolving these issues should be a priority because not collecting and using data of significance to public health can lead to preventable harms [8, 45] .

Against this background, the relevant Australian legislation prioritises the pursuit of public goods, such as effective communicable disease surveillance, over protecting private interests. Neither individuals nor companies have a broad right to privacy under Australian law. Instead, the law in this area balances public interest against protecting individual or commercial privacy interests and includes a range of protections for the public [46] . This extends to cyber law, which operates under a general principle that social media users own the online content they create, but have limited rights to control its secondary use by others (either individuals or organisations). Similarly, it is a long-established principle under Australian common law that there is no property in human biological samples. This means a person does not own biological samples taken from them (tissues or microbial isolates), nor does the laboratory or facility that holds the samples. As long as there is a clear public health (rather than research) purpose for epidemiological investigation, it follows that there are no significant legal barriers preventing laboratories from performing secondary tests on isolates without the permission of the individuals from whom they were collected [47] .

In contrast, it would appear that food or environmental samples (including those collected from livestock) are considered property under the law, such that the Public Health and Food Acts do not clearly establish that further testing of the isolate is legal without strong evidence that the threat to public health is ongoing [48] . Most members of the panel were perplexed by this impediment to secondary testing and argued that public interests should always override any property claims. We note that the case for such a pragmatic approach to issues of consent and ownership for secondary testing of isolates owned by commercial entities is bolstered by epidemiological considerations. Some degree of strain typing must be done routinely if this practice is to be useful for identification of transmission events [5, 16] . Therefore, legal reform may be required because any insistence on a high threshold of public health risk before pathogen WGS can be done would limit the timeliness and, consequently, the effectiveness of this type of communicable disease surveillance. The development of clear guidelines for the secondary testing of patient, food and environmental isolates should be a priority before the use of WGS in epidemiological investigations becomes routine.

Finally, our study reveals a gap between existing policy structures relevant to the use of WGS technologies and social media monitoring for public health purposes, and the individualistic focus of the concerns of most participants. As is the case with many activities undertaken in pursuit of public health, some form of trade-off between public and private interests is necessary. In order to strike the right balance, it is important that the potential benefits and harms of enhanced communicable disease research and surveillance are weighed appropriately. The content of interactions between participants from the different policy networks sampled demonstrated a range of attitudes as to how health authorities should collect, link and use data. The panel concluded that privacy concerns and potential conflicts with commercial interests caused by enhanced surveillance techniques need to be managed appropriately, but neither should substantively limit the pursuit of public interests as important as effective communicable disease prevention and control. However, efficient surveillance across a large population is not achievable unless most people participate. A structured dialogue between interested groups and development of an ethically and legally defensible rationale for the design and operation of surveillance systems [49] , prior to their implementation, will help to reassure the public and other stakeholders and enhance the likely success of these systems.

Delphi survey methods have several well-known limitations, including that the substantive outcomes consist of a set of group intuitions and perspectives, constructed through highly structured social processes of justification among experts [50] . However, as noted in the introduction, the method is particularly useful for the evaluation of complex problems where the rate of social or technological change exceeds the rate of innovation in governance, where evidence that can adequately explain or predict social actions is lacking, or both [25] . The initial response to participant invitations for the current survey was sufficient to generate a lively debate, which was gratifying, given that our invitation was unsolicited. Retention of participants over successive rounds was moderate and the balance between members of different sectors remained constant. Moreover, allowing participants to express their views and comment on each other's interpretation, via open-ended free text questions, over multiple survey rounds increased the reliability of the study and improved the robustness of the results.

This Delphi survey has captured the perspectives of representatives of expert groups concerned with enhancing communicable disease surveillance systems in Australia. Because of differences in cultural norms and the surrounding social, legal and public health systems, a similar group brought together in another jurisdiction may come to different conclusions. Perspectives of the Australian public are currently being sought through a series of citizens' juries, to explore what they believe to be acceptable and legitimate use of Big Data and pathogen WGS for the purposes of communicable disease surveillance [51, 52] .

The results of this Delphi survey suggest that there is broad support for using event-based social media monitoring and pathogen WGS technologies to enhance communicable disease surveillance systems across sectoral groups and relevant policy networks. Panellists agreed there is a need to establish a policy framework to ensure appropriate safeguards are in place to protect privacy and that the public is consulted so that they are not unnecessarily alarmed by, or suspicious of, the introduction of new processes for data collection and analyses. However, the emphasis of reforms should be on enabling effective research and surveillance to be conducted, where common benefits are possible. In this regard, the concerns of Australian policy-makers and experts on this issue are not unique. A recent WHO review points to the need to engage with affected communities to establish the conditions and protections under which it is acceptable for surveillance to take place and develop institutional mechanisms that ensure ethical issues are systematically addressed before data collection, use and dissemination [45] . Given that these technologies are already available and have the potential to enhance the capacity of Australian and other health authorities to investigate and prevent outbreaks of infectious disease, with their attendant social and economic costs, the development of clear ethical and legal guidance is urgently needed. The absence of such policy and procedural protections means that public health authorities are likely to only employ these new technologies sporadically, such that opportunities to protect individuals and the wider population from harm will be missed.

Evaluating the effectiveness of an emergency preparedness training programme for public health staff in China ARTICLE IN PRESS,"The emergency preparedness training programme met its aims and objectives satisfactorily, and resulted in positive shifts in knowledge and attitudinal/ behavioural intentions for public health staff. This suggests that this emergency training strategy was effective and feasible in improving the capability of emergency preparedness.","Summary Background: The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) crisis of 2003 provided a new urgency in China in terms of preparing public health staff to respond effectively to public health emergencies. Although the Chinese Government has already carried out a series of emergency education and training programmes to improve public health staff's capability of emergency preparedness, it remains unclear if these training programmes are effective and feasible. The purpose of this research was to evaluate an emergency preparedness training programme and to develop a participatory training approach for emergency response. Methods: Seventy-six public health staff completed the emergency preparedness training programme. The effectiveness of the training was evaluated by questionnaire before training, immediately after training and 12 months after training (follow-up). Additionally, semi-structured interviews were conducted throughout the training period. Results: The emergency preparedness training improved the knowledge levels and increased attitudinal and behavioural intention scores for emergency preparedness (Po0.01). The results at follow-up showed that the knowledge levels and attitudinal/behavioural intention scores of participants decreased slightly (P40.05) compared with levels immediately after training (Po0.01). However, there was a significant increase compared with before training (Po0.01). Moreover, more than 80% of participants reported that the training process and resources were scientific and feasible. 

Since the 9/11 disaster, anthrax bioterrorism, 'mad cow' disease, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and avian influenza outbreaks, public health emergencies have become an important threat to communities worldwide. Managing these emergencies and the threats they pose is part of the longterm government development plans in many countries, and expensive resources are being invested into preventing and responding to public health emergencies. 1 In China, surge capacity is one of the most urgent problems regarding public health emergency response at the present time, 2 along with the lack of equipment and the low efficiency of the public health emergency information system. Recognizing this, the Chinese Government carried out a series of emergency preparedness education and training programmes to improve the capability of public health staff to respond to emergencies nationwide. However, it remains unclear if these training programmes are feasible and effective in improving emergency preparedness.

Investigation has revealed that the emergency response of the public health sector was insufficient, especially the emergency preparedness of public health staff, such as not knowing the emergency response protocols and management procedures, and how to collect and analyse the relevant data during the SARS outbreak. 2, 3 Therefore, in order to change the current situation and improve the capability of public health staff in China to respond to emergencies, a pilot study was developed and supported by the Ministry of Health of the People's Republic of China (MOH) and the World Health Organization (WHO). The study was carried out by Tongji Medical College in Hubei Province from 2004 to 2006. The training was completed in 2005, and the follow-up survey was conducted 12 months later.

Like any other successful health education programme, the emergency preparedness training programme should be subjected to a process of continuous monitoring, control, evaluation and, if needed, relevant modifications. [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] The comprehensive evaluation of an emergency training preparedness programme should include its various aspects (contents, aims and objectives, training resources, methods, effects and impact), and it should also answer questions about the efficiency and impact of training on the participants. [9] [10] [11] This study highlighted the procedures used in the evaluation of an emergency preparedness training programme, and focused on its most important aspects: training resources; training process; and effectiveness of training (before training, immediately after training and 12 months later).

Seventy-eight trainees from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in 18 cities in Hubei participated in the emergency preparedness training programme in 2005. Two participants did not complete their training and were not part of the evaluation (n ¼ 76). Trainers were selected based on their expertise in the field of public health emergency response, related training programmes and their involvement in continuous consultations on health service programmes, both educational and promotional. Trainers came from the MOH, WHO, Chinese CDC, Health Department of Hubei Province, Fudan University, Wuhan University and Huazhong University of Science and Technology.

The aims and objectives of training were designed carefully by educational and training experts with an intimate knowledge of the public health emergency response plan and the training programme, in consultation with public health personnel who did not participate in the training. The training programme was based on the US CDC's emergency preparedness core competencies for all public health workers. [12] [13] [14] In brief, the training consisted of: (1) the definition of public health emergency; (2) the public health workers' role during emergencies; (3) the responsibilities of local, province and government agencies during emergencies; (4) the role of the CDC during emergencies; (5) the CDC emergency response chain of command; (6) emergency communication strategies and use of special equipment; (7) emergency response protocols; and (8) management procedures, including the management of necessary supplies and equipment. The training contents and objectives were subjected to continuous monitoring and evaluation throughout the training period.

Various training methods were used, including case studies, workshops, tutorials, seminars, group discussions, role playing, drilling and fieldwork. Formal lecturing was the least used method. The training centre was equipped with modern audiovisual aids designed for training purposes. As well as the training logistics, other facilities and general services, such as transportation and accommodation, were provided free of charge to the participants.

Individual basic information, knowledge levels, attitudes and behaviours regarding emergency preparedness were investigated by questionnaire, which was designed by experts in the field of training programmes and continuous consultation on emergency management. In order to assess the questionnaire, a pilot test was undertaken among other public health personnel who did not participate in the training, and modifications were made by experts based on the feedback.

Thirty questions assessed the participants' knowledge of public health emergency competencies, which consisted of basic public health science knowledge, emergency management knowledge and emergency analytical/assessment skills (10 questions). If the correct answer was given to these questions, the participant received one point, whereas incorrect answers received no points. Eight items were designed to assess the staff's attitudinal and behavioural intentions related to the 'eight core competencies for public health services'. 15 Each of the eight items asked respondents to rate their attitudinal and behavioural intentions, as well as the frequency of their use of each of the competencies. Responses were rated on an ordinal scale (1 ¼ very low, 2 ¼ low, 3 ¼ middle, 4 ¼ high, 5 ¼ very high). Participants completed the first measurement (pre-test, baseline) on the first day of training. The post-training measurement (post-test) was conducted at the end of the last day of training. For the follow-up test, the participants were mailed a copy of the survey, with a self-addressed return envelope, 12 months after the training had been completed.

The training process and resources were subjected to continuous monitoring and evaluation by semi-structured interviews. The inclusion of the trainees in the evaluation process was extremely helpful in updating and modifying the programme. The items addressed in the semi-structured interviews were as follows: (1) the scientific methods offered; (2) the technical material presented;

(3) the performance of the trainer; (4) the benefits derived by the participant; (5) the use of the audiovisual aids; (6) the strengths and weaknesses of the session; and (7) final critical comments and remarks. The forms were distributed at the end of each session to be completed anonymously by each participant. The forms were analysed immediately and the results were shown to the trainer who had conducted the session. If any defects were revealed, the necessary rectifications were made immediately. Evaluation of workshops and fieldwork was carried out in a similar fashion. Feedback of the results of the evaluation was given to the participants.

Most data were reported as scores. Frequency and confidence scores were derived for each domain by participants' responses to the frequency questions and the self-efficacy questions. Repeated-measures analysis of variance was used to test differences between pre-test, post-test and follow-up test. The data from semi-structured interviews were categorized independently by three authors using the triangulation method, and the individual results of the analysis were compared and discussed until consensus was reached. All results were expressed as mean7standard deviation. Data were analysed by one-way analysis of variance using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences for Windows, Version 12.0 (SPSS. Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).

Seventy-six of the study participants completed the entire training programme and represented public health staff from the CDC of 18 cities (97.44% response). Most respondents were male (n ¼ 57, 75%) and over half (n ¼ 42, 55.26%) had earned a bachelor's or master's degree, of which one-sixth possessed Masters of Public Health degrees. Additionally, most participants (n ¼ 62, 81.58%) had more than 5 years of experience as public health staff. Some trainees (n ¼ 50, 65.79%) had participated in inter-related training approximately 12-24 months previously. The results of reliability assessment showed that test-retest reliability and the internal consistency of questionnaires was accredited to some extent (test-retest reliability of pretraining ¼ 0.83, Cronbach's alpha 40.61). The results of related analysis indicated that the construct validity of the questionnaire was of high quality (related coefficient fluctuated between 0.35 and 0.79, Po0.05). 16, 17 Knowledge levels

The investigation revealed that knowledge levels of public health emergency preparedness were relatively low before training. After training, a significant increase in the mean knowledge scores was observed (pre-test: 19.7972.41; post-test: 24.4970.86; followup test: 24.2471.58) (Po0.01). Basic public health science knowledge and emergency management knowledge scores decreased slightly (P40.05), but the mean scores for emergency analytical/assessment skills were increased dramatically in the follow-up test compared with the post-test (Po0.01). Furthermore, there was a significant increase in overall knowledge scores between the follow-up test and the pre-test (Po0.01) (Fig. 1 ).

Descriptive statistics on attitudinal and behavioural intentions at pre-test, post-test and follow-up test are presented in Table 1 . As mentioned above, the responses ranged from high (5) to low (1) . The results showed that participants reported a significant improvement in their attitudinal and behavioural intentions in all eight core competencies in the post-test compared with the pre-test. Twelve months later, there were slight decreases in participants' attitudinal and behavioural intentions in some core competencies, but the mean score for emergency analytical/assessment skills was significantly increased compared with the post-test (4.35 vs 3.69), and mean scores for policy development/programme planning skills (2.94 vs 3.95) and financial planning and management skills (2.66 vs 3.47) were decreased compared with the posttest (Po0.05).

The results of the semi-structured interviews showed that most participants (n ¼ 73, 96.05%) thought that the training methods were excellent/very good, and the training contents were clear and easy to understand. The remaining participants (n ¼ 3, 3.95%) indicated that the training methods needed to be improved/further developed. However, all of the participants recognized that the training was innovative.

Analysis showed that 80.26% (n ¼ 61) of participants were satisfied with the trainers' performance, and 19.74% (n ¼ 15) of participants thought that the trainers' performance needed to improve. However, no participants indicated that resource personnel were incompetent. Additionally, most participants (n ¼ 72, 94.74%) were very satisfied with the venue, training logistics and services, and only four participants (n ¼ 4, 5.26%) thought that logistics and services needed improvement.

Continuous medical education and training is a process of updating knowledge, developing skills, bringing about attitudinal and behavioural changes, and improving the capability of participants to perform their tasks efficiently and effectively. 18 Effective training methods are key to the success of an emergency training programme. A number of studies have shown that the training methods recommended by the present study educators were effective because different participants learn by different training methods, and methods of active training are especially helpful for adult learning. [19] [20] [21] Formal lecturing was the least used training method because trainees do not participate actively in the learning process and the outcome is inferior to methods of active learning. The results of the evaluation suggested that up-todate training of public health staff should focus on the development of effective training methods, and interactive training methods may help to increase the quality of training and improve retention of knowledge through immediate reinforcement of learning. 22, 23 Furthermore, comprehensive evaluation and feedback about the training programme were of vital importance for the participants and trainers as it helped participants to identify their limitations while monitoring their performance during the training period. Also, trainers tended to improve their performance as they were aware that it was being monitored and evaluated. Feedback of the results of evaluation of the training sessions to the trainers was found to be helpful in rectifying the weaknesses of sessions. 24 In addition, the mean scores of emergency analytical/assessment skills increased rather than decreased by 12-month follow-up. This is similar to results found by Qureshi et al. 14 For this type of phenomenon, one must consider the experience of the public health staff at the end of 2005. Before the follow-up survey, the majority of trainees had participated in avian influenza emergency response activities, thus providing practice and increasing perceived relevance of the training. As such, this probably had a positive effect on the effectiveness of training. Nevertheless, the increased overall knowledge score and the positive change in attitudinal and behavioural parameters suggested that training programmes on emergency preparedness resulted in gaining knowledge and shifts in attitude and behaviour. 

This study had a few potential limitations. The analysis was limited to staff who were primarily engaged in disease monitoring and control, and epidemiological investigations in the CDC. In addition, evaluations were based on changes over time without the use of a horizontal comparison group. Thus, it was not possible to fully determine which changes were due to the emergency preparedness training programme and which were the result of other factors. These results, however, remained constant throughout, which provides support that these changes were due to the training programme.

The effectiveness of any educational training programme depends on its continuous monitoring and evaluation, which should include appropriate and varied methods. Moreover, trainers and trainees should be actively subjected to the process of monitoring and evaluation, which was helpful in monitoring their overall performance. Immediate feedback with results analysis of the continuous monitoring and evaluation should be available to those involved so that necessary improvements can be made. The results of the evaluation suggested that the emergency training strategy was effective and feasible in improving the capability of public health staff to respond to an emergency.

Establishment of CDC Global Rapid Response Team to Ensure Global Health Security,"The 2014-2016 Ebola virus disease epidemic in West Africa highlighted challenges faced by the global response to a large public health emergency. Consequently, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention established the Global Rapid Response Team (GRRT) to strengthen emergency response capacity to global health threats, thereby ensuring global health security. Dedicated GRRT staff can be rapidly mobilized for extended missions, improving partner coordination and the continuity of response operations. A large, agencywide roster of surge staff enables rapid mobilization of qualified responders with wide-ranging experience and expertise. Team members are offered emergency response training, technical training, foreign language training, and responder readiness support. Recent response missions illustrate the breadth of support the team provides. GRRT serves as a model for other countries and is committed to strengthening emergency response capacity to respond to outbreaks and emergencies worldwide, thereby enhancing global health security.","T he need to detect and respond to disease outbreaks before they spread has long been recognized as a priority because uncontained outbreaks can rapidly proliferate into international emergencies (1) (2) (3) . A jarring example was provided by the 2014-2016 Ebola virus disease (Ebola) epidemic in West Africa, in which ≈29,000 cases were identified and ≈11,000 patients died (1, 4) . Although most cases occurred in 3 countries, imported and locally transmitted cases were confirmed in 7 others, including the United States (5) . This experience highlighted needs for improved international collaboration and coordination and stronger national response capacity to rapidly detect and control major health threats at their source to ensure global health security (3, (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) .

The 2005 International Health Regulations (IHR 2005) , adopted by the World Health Organization, dictate that all member states should be prepared to detect and respond to public health threats and emergencies (11) . However, by 2012, <20% of countries reported full compliance with IHR 2005 (12) . To accelerate progress, several member states and international partners launched the Global Health Security Agenda, which outlines specific actions that countries can take to meet IHR 2005 requirements (6, 7, (13) (14) (15) . The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), in coordination with other US government agencies and global partners, is using its expertise and the Global Health Security Agenda framework to assist partner countries and strengthen global health security (16) .

CDC has a long history of responding to global public health emergencies, including polio and severe acute respiratory syndrome. It is internationally recognized for its expertise in disease detection, investigation, diagnosis, monitoring, and control, as well as management of public health emergencies (16) . Several groups within CDC work closely to identify and respond to public health threats. The Global Disease Detection Operations Center (GDDOC) is dedicated to the detection and monitoring of global public health events of international importance (17). GDDOC links external requests for assistance with the appropriate disease-specific CDC subject matter experts, who respond frequently to domestic and international outbreaks of diseases in their program domains. GDDOC also serves as an agency liaison to the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN) and supports the mobilization of subject matter experts through GOARN. In the field, responders work closely with governments and partners, including within Incident Management System structures or health clusters when established. Although mobilized CDC responders do not provide medical care, such activities are coordinated with organizations providing patient care.

Before the Ebola epidemic, when response operations exceeded subject matter expert program capacity, surge staff from the Epidemic Intelligence Service and other CDC programs were engaged and coordinated by the CDC Division of Emergency Operations (DEO). For larger, complex public health responses, the CDC director can authorize the activation of an agency-level Incident Management System, supported by the CDC emergency management subject matter experts in DEO and ordinarily based in the CDC Emergency Operations Center (EOC) (18). DEO also provides logistical and other support to response operations funded by GDDOC without activating the Incident Management System. At the time of the Ebola epidemic, CDC lacked a formal pool of on-call, trained responders who could rapidly mobilize for extended periods and in large numbers.

In July 2014, CDC activated its Incident Management System in response to the Ebola epidemic; as the largest agencywide response ever, it tested the limits of the agency response capacity (19) . During July 9, 2014-March 31, 2016, ≈4,000 CDC staff participated in the response in Ebola-affected countries; in countries at high risk for Ebola introduction; from CDC headquarters in Atlanta, Georgia, USA; or through other partner organizations (1). By March 31, 2016, CDC had supported ≈2,000 mobilizations of 1,400 personnel providing wide-ranging technical support, for ≈80,000 person-days of mobilization time (19) (20) (21) (22) (23) .

The size, scale, severity, and duration of the Ebola response highlighted key challenges to the efficiency and effectiveness of international emergency response efforts (Table) . Specifically, greater support from the international community was needed because of limited national capacity of affected countries to detect and respond to the outbreak, fundamental aspects of IHR 2005, and the diminishing healthcare capacity over the course of the epidemic (1). Despite CDC experience regularly providing assistance for smaller, shorter outbreaks, sustaining support over 21 months proved difficult. Because of limited CDC presence before the epidemic, weak or underdeveloped relationships with governments and partner organizations in affected countries hindered response coordination. Short mobilizations (typically 30 days) and frequent staff rotation in the field also disrupted development of long-standing relationships and continuity of response. However, longer mobilizations of such a large workforce could hamper staff members' regular duties, potentially affecting other CDC programs (1, 19, 20) . Additional challenges included identifying staff with the appropriate technical skills and foreign language abilities who were mentally and emotionally prepared for the austere conditions and ready and available to mobilize (19, 20) .

The challenges observed during the Ebola response underscored the need for a cadre of highly trained and experienced personnel who can rapidly mobilize to respond for extended periods (20) . To address these challenges, CDC established the Global Rapid Response Team (GRRT). We describe the establishment of GRRT, team structure, main activities, case studies, and lessons learned.

Before the Ebola epidemic ended, CDC began investing in its capacity to rapidly respond to public health emergencies. GRRT strategy Limited in-country capacity to detect and respond to disease outbreaks (1) Support the development of national outbreak detection and response systems Wide range of technical expertise required to address needs of a large outbreak response (1) Recruit team members with a wide range of technical expertise and experience Train responders in multiple technical areas for high-risk diseases Establishing working partnerships with governments and partner organizations for more efficient coordination (1, 19, 20) Train responders on working with partner organizations, incident management systems, cultural sensitivity, and foreign languages Recruit dedicated, ready responders who can mobilize for up to 6 mo for stronger partner relationships and improved coordination Short mobilizations (traditionally 30 d) and frequent rotation of staff disrupted continuity of response activities (19, 20) Recruit dedicated responders who are available and ready to mobilize for up to 6 mo if needed Expand the typical mobilization length of those in leadership roles Develop best practices and systems for information management in field response Responder preparation and readiness (19) Strengthen safety, security, and responder wellness training through a GRRT orientation Support continuous learning by offering frequent technical trainings on priority topics Track responder international travel-related mobilization requirements, training, and clearance compliance Obtain supervisor preapproval for mobilizations during on-call months Identifying appropriate responders (19) Roster GRRT responders and tracking skills and experience to match staffing needs Limited foreign language capacity (20) Develop a program to develop and validate foreign language capacity Logistical support for field efforts (19) Roster a group of dedicated and surge logisticians who can mobilize to provide support directly to responders in the field or coordinate with Atlanta-based logistics personnel to provide support *GRRT, Global Rapid Response Team.

In June 2015, CDC launched GRRT to address many of the challenges recognized during the Ebola response and to support other countries when their national response capacity is overwhelmed. Housed within the Emergency Response and Recovery Branch (ERRB), Division of Global Health Protection, at the CDC Center for Global Health, GRRT is an agencywide asset mandated to strengthen emergency response capacity. GRRT stands ready to provide technical and nontechnical support for public health responses worldwide; it is the result of collaboration across CDC.

GRRT comprises a small group of dedicated responders and a large group of agencywide surge staff. This model enables effective response to common events with a small number of experts while the team prepares for larger, rare events that necessitate substantial response. A total of 18 dedicated responders with public health emergency response expertise can immediately mobilize and remain in the field for extended periods. Included on this Atlantabased team are multilingual epidemiologists with expertise in public health and humanitarian emergencies, logisticians who support GRRT activities and coordinate with DEO during a response, highly experienced team leaders, and support staff. Outside Atlanta, 1 regional emergency advisor in West Africa is tasked with engaging national, regional, and global partners to build capacity to detect and respond to health threats in the region. This group of dedicated responders answers the need to improve response time for emergencies, establish stronger long-standing relationships with governments and key partners, and reduce disruption to the continuity of response activities from staff turnover in the field. GRRT surge capacity comprises >400 CDC staff members from around the agency; the goal is to support an emergency response with up to 50 staff members on short notice. Nearly 40 of the surge staff members routinely respond to humanitarian emergencies and build public health capacity as part of their regular duties in ERRB. They provide expertise in nutrition, emergency preparedness, surveillance, mental health, reproductive health, water, sanitation, and hygiene. The remaining surge staff vary widely in technical, language, and leadership skills and experience levels. They were recruited from 15 CDC centers, field personnel staff with state and local health departments, and overseas offices. International experience of the surge staff is a median of 2 years (mean 5 years), totaling 1,577 years combined. More than half have emergency response experience and ≈13% report having expertise in >1 foreign language. The most common occupations are epidemiologist, health scientist, public health advisor, and health communicator; surge staff have experience in nearly 30 different occupational areas.

Balancing the need to mobilize large numbers of agency staff, thereby possibly hindering their regular duties, with the need to ensure that existing programs maintain their operations is challenging (19) . To address both needs, surge staff are on call 2 months each year for emergency mobilizations. The assignment of these on-call months is determined by staff availability (avoiding months in which regular duties or personal needs require the staff to be in the home office) while evenly distributing the technical skills, foreign language, and experience levels across months. The resulting roster lists at least 50 surge staff with a similar distribution of skills and experience who are on call for mobilization each month.

Requests for assistance come from within CDC and from external partners. After receipt, requests are evaluated to determine the appropriate response mechanism. Requests meeting specific criteria are addressed through standard response mechanisms (e.g., GDDOC or subject matter expert mobilizations). GRRT reviews requests that do not meet the criteria or exceed capacity of other CDC groups. Decisions to respond are based on, among other considerations, the urgency, public health impact, and availability of appropriate staff to fill the request. After the decision to respond is made, responders are selected according to their skills, experience, and availability.

From September 1, 2015, through December 31, 2016, GRRT responders were mobilized 291 times for 10,148 person-days to work in 35 countries, territories, and the CDC EOC (Figure) . Most of the mobilization time was spent responding to outbreaks of Zika virus infection (65.0%), yellow fever (9.4%), Ebola (4.3%), cholera (3.9%), polio (0.5%), and measles (0.5%). The remaining time went to natural disasters (Hurricane Matthew [12.8%] and wildfires in Indonesia [3.2%]). Responders aligned themselves with existing response activities, working directly with ministries of health, the World Health Organization (WHO), CDC country offices, and other partners.

In addition to response activities, GRRT collaborated with ministries of health and external partners, such as the Africa CDC and the West African Health Organization, to assess and build national and international capacity to detect and respond to health threats, improving IHR compliance (320 person-days mobilized; median mobilization length 9 days). Activities included supporting the WHO Joint External Evaluations (24), developing rapid response team guidance, and facilitating response-related trainings.

Within CDC, GRRT works to build a sustainable, trained workforce. GRRT has designed a comprehensive training curriculum for surge staff that includes safety, security, soft skills, and technical training. GRRT increases responder readiness for rapid mobilization by defining and tracking training and logistical criteria. Continuing education is provided monthly for additional training opportunities beyond the baseline training received during a 1-day orientation. These trainings are hosted by subject matter expert groups throughout the agency and feature a combination of scientific topics, role-specific technical content for the field, interpersonal skills, and situational awareness updates depending on current emergency context. GRRT is also developing training focused on the principles of field team leadership in international response; the aim is preparing leaders to apply Incident Management System principles during mobilization while navigating the nuances of international field response. To enhance the agency's foreign language capacity, GRRT provides foreign language training opportunities online and in classrooms. Efforts to standardize foreign language testing are under way.

To illustrate the breadth of GRRT's response work and its influence on agency response capacity, we describe selected responses to the Zika virus epidemic, urban outbreaks of yellow fever, and Hurricane Matthew in Haiti. Case studies demonstrate GRRT ability to support large complex outbreak responses, fill response needs when CDC expert capacity is strained, and manage smaller responses without EOC activation.

In May 2015, an outbreak of Zika virus disease was reported in Brazil. In October, unusually high rates of birth defects, particularly microcephaly, were reported in areas with Zika virus transmission (25) . By January 2016, Zika virus had spread to 14 countries and territories in Latin America and the Caribbean, and CDC activated an Incident Management System to respond to the outbreak (26) . To support the response and address external requests for assistance, GRRT coordinated closely with subject matter experts, GDDOC, and DEO.

The complex Zika virus response, with its expansive affected geographic area and multidisciplinary technical needs, tested the CDC emergency response capacity soon after the Ebola experience. Investigations into the modes of transmission, birth defects associated with infection, and effective interventions required subject matter experts in vectorborne diseases, maternal and child health, reproductive health, and birth defects. Laboratorians strengthened Zika virus testing capacity and improved existing diagnostic tools. Health communication specialists developed messages in multiple languages for varied audiences, balancing the relatively mild symptoms of infection experienced by most persons with the devastating consequences of infection during pregnancy (26) . GRRT supported the agency response by mobilizing 117 responders to 9 countries and territories for 151 mobilizations and 6,597 person-days. A total of 69 mobilizations and more than half of the response time (3,556 person-days) were in the CDC EOC, where responders worked in Incident Management System leadership positions and as subject matter experts. The GRRT primary focus is international response, and responders are trained to work within varying cultural and environmental conditions outside the continental United States; however, the needs for assistance resulted in ≈90% of GRRT response time occurring in affected US territories and freely associated states. The GRRT roster, searchable by technical and language skills, facilitated the rapid identification of appropriate responders to fill response needs, particularly for speakers of Spanish and Portuguese, key languages in many of the affected areas. Although WHO declared the end of the emergency in November 2016 (27) , GRRT will support CDC Zika virus response activities until no longer needed.

In January 2016, the Angola Ministry of Health alerted WHO of an urban outbreak of yellow fever in Luanda Province (28) . Because of active cross-border travel in the region, yellow fever cases spread to neighboring Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). In March 2016, the DRC Ministry of Health notified WHO of another yellow fever outbreak.

The CDC GDDOC closely monitored the evolution of the outbreak and coordinated mobilization needs with GRRT. Traditionally, the CDC response to a request for support would be led directly by subject matter experts; however, at the time, these experts were already fully engaged in the CDC Zika virus response and had limited capacity to lead another vectorborne disease response. Therefore, GRRT, in close coordination with GDDOC and anchored by expert guidance from CDC subject matter experts, contributed to the requested technical assistance and surge presence in the field.

During April-November 2016, GRRT mobilized 15 responders to Angola for 742 person-days and 7 responders to DRC for 211 person-days. Responders, working closely with expert guidance from headquarters, provided epidemiologic and management support to country ministries of health; led the interagency Incident Management System in the field on behalf of WHO; led field investigations and epidemiologic surveillance activities; and supported logistical needs, border health assessments, and a mass vaccination campaign. Four responders were mobilized to WHO headquarters to coordinate with and support the WHO yellow fever outbreak response. By August 2016, the last confirmed cases of yellow fever were reported, and the disease did not spread to additional countries. The last GRRT mobilization ended in November 2016.

The yellow fever response highlighted the benefits of agency surge capacity, particularly when specialized technical expertise is needed for multiple responses in multiple locations. The response also underscored the benefits of accurately identifying responders with highlevel foreign language fluency but demonstrated the need to strengthen language capacity. Fluent speakers of Portuguese and French were identified for mobilization to Angola and DRC, respectively. However, because insufficient numbers of Portuguese speakers were available, fluent Spanish speakers partially filled the language gap.

On October 4, 2016, Hurricane Matthew, a category 4 storm, made landfall in southwestern Haiti, causing major damage and flooding, killing at least 540 persons, and displacing ≈175,000 persons (29,30). Torrential rains washed away roads, bridges, and crops, threatening food security, water safety, telecommunication capabilities, and medical services (29). The hurricane devastated healthcare facilities, including 46 cholera treatment centers (29), and disrupted key public health programs.

After the 2010 earthquake in Haiti, GRRT surge staff, particularly ERRB responders, had experience in Haiti, and a field response was coordinated with the CDC Haiti Country Office. Because the CDC EOC was already coordinating 3 simultaneous activations for Ebola, Zika virus, and polio, GRRT and ERRB implemented the Incident Management System in the field and in ERRB workspace at CDC headquarters. Simultaneously, the CDC National Center for Environmental Health activated an Incident Management System to coordinate the domestic response for the expected effects to the US coastline. To foster coordination within the agency, both activations, outside of the CDC EOC, were supported by DEO in the early phases of the response.

GRRT mobilized the first wave of responders to Haiti 2 days after the hurricane struck. In total, GRRT mobilized 31 responders to Haiti, 26 members to the Atlanta-based Incident Management System structure, and 2 liaisons to the US Agency for International Development Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance and the Pan American Health Organization. In total, 1,302 person-days were spent responding to Hurricane Matthew.

GRRT responders supported the response in a diversity of roles. Early in the response, while physical access to affected areas was still limited, GRRT members organized a rapid phone assessment to provide critical information on the current needs of affected populations. CDC responders partnered with the Haiti Ministry of Health to investigate cholera cases, assess damage to healthcare facilities, and reestablish affected disease surveillance systems. Atlanta-based support staff mobilized to the CDC Haiti Country Office to support the Incident Management System structure, enabling the Haiti-based staff to fulfill their regular duties. At CDC headquarters, responders worked as Incident Management System staff coordinating the agency response and information managers for the CDC Haiti Country Office.

The Hurricane Matthew response demonstrated successful coordination of international and domestic response activities across the agency without burdening EOC staff. The GRRT/ERRB Incident Management System deactivated in November 2016, and the last mobilization for the Hurricane Matthew response ended in December 2016. An after-action review was conducted to evaluate the response and improve GRRT processes for future activations.

The lessons learned from the Ebola epidemic forced many national and international organizations to reevaluate their emergency response capacity and processes. At CDC, these lessons contributed to the development of GRRT, a cadre of highly trained and experienced staff members and resources that provide response and surge capacity for CDC international emergency response operations. GRRT dedicated response staff enable rapid and longer mobilizations to establish and sustain working relationships with governments and partner organizations and to improve continuity of response activities. The large roster of >400 team members fosters a diversity of skills and experiences, and tracking of team member profiles facilitates matching technical skills and language capacity with response needs. GRRT support for CDC staff preparation and deployment readiness improves the speed at which qualified responders can be mobilized. GRRT capacitybuilding activities support countries' progress toward IHR 2005 compliance, particularly around workforce development, personnel deployment, and emergency operations, in alignment with DEO and subject matter expert activities for other action packages.

Despite progress, several challenges remain. The Zika virus and yellow fever responses highlighted the need for strengthened language capacity. GRRT language training and targeted recruitment of highly proficient staff aim to address this gap; other language training options are being explored. CDC response capacity can be developed further by providing additional disease-specific technical training, particularly for high-risk pathogens and epidemic-prone diseases that may warrant a large-scale response. This training will build disease-specific response capacity and enable a limited set of subject matter experts to guide response activities in multiple areas, as was seen during the yellow fever response.

Moving forward, GRRT continues to evolve and seek new ways to improve international response capacity in coordination with international partners. Ongoing identification and rostering of responders with appropriate technical and language skills to fill response needs is critical for rapid response. The GRRT surge capacity roster will need to be maintained to keep responder information current and replenished with future qualified staff. CDC response mechanisms can be further improved through continued coordination with agency emergency response personnel and streamlined mobilization processes. To ensure a cohesive approach, GRRT will continue coordinating with external partners during emergency responses by identifying clear roles and responsibilities for staff (20) . In addition, GRRT will continue supporting Global Health Security Agenda activities; building local, national, and regional response capacities; and supporting WHO, GOARN, and other international partners in global efforts toward development of international and regional public health rapid response teams. The lessons learned from the establishment of GRRT at CDC can serve as a model for the creation of similar response units in other countries.

The CDC GRRT was established to address lessons learned during the 2014-2016 Ebola epidemic. Since June 2015, GRRT has been actively engaged in strengthening agency and partner emergency response capacity by developing a capable emergency workforce. However, continuing these activities and sustaining the momentum of global health security requires ongoing resources to ensure that GRRT is ready to respond to future health threats. CDC is one of many global organizations that respond to outbreaks and emergencies; no one organization alone can effectively control global health threats. As the international emergency response community coordinates to build capacity around the world, GRRT will work diligently so that disease threats are rapidly detected, responded to, and controlled at their source, thereby ensuring global health security.

"Surveillance, response systems, and evidence updates on emerging zoonoses: the role of one health","Globally, emerging zoonotic diseases are increasing. Existing surveillance systems for zoonoses have substantial gaps, especially in developing countries, and the systems in place in the developed world require improvements. Resources and updates on evidence-based practice (EBP) for zoonoses are sparser in the veterinary literature as compared to the medical literature. Evidence updates for emerging zoonoses are either absent or rudimentary in both human and veterinary medicine. A 'one-health' concept, including a global signaling surveillance system for emerging zoonoses, will be essential for correct diagnoses, interventions, and public health strategies. An open access EBP platform supported by builders of EBP resources is urgently needed to counter emerging zoonoses.","T he World Health Organization (WHO) defines emerging zoonosis as 'a zoonosis that is newly recognized or newly evolved, or that has occurred previously but shows an increase in incidence or expansion in geographical, host or vector range' (1) . The emergence of a zoonosis can result from different factors, including global warming and climate change; anthropogenic factors such as trade, tourism, deforestation, changed agricultural practices and livestock farming, and hunting; and natural factors such as pathogen adaptation and animal migration (2) . Emerging zoonotic diseases are increasing, causing severe economic impacts and animal and human health risks. The World Bank estimates that zoonotic disease outbreaks Á mostly of emerging zoonoses Á have caused global losses exceeding $US200 billion, including reduced trade, tourism, and tax revenues in the past 10 years (3) . Among the infectious agents considered to be emerging, 175 species from 96 genera have been documented, of which 132 (75%) species from 78 genera are zoonotic. It has been estimated that zoonotic pathogens are twice more likely to be emerging than their non-zoonotic counterparts (4) .

There is a large and complex interdependence between different species on our planet. Therefore, it is essential to combine disciplines in biology, veterinary medicine, and human medicine in order to understand and control emerging diseases (5) . The management of emerging zoonoses is outside the scope of traditional medicine (bedside practice) and veterinary medicine (stall side practice); consequently, there has been an enhanced collaborative effort between the two professions, resulting in the new 'one-health' concept. This is a systemsapproach concept which consolidates the 'collaborative effort of multiple disciplines working locally, nationally, and globally to attain optimal health for people, animals and our environment' (6) . However, decision making for emerging zoonoses is an enormous challenge as there are large uncertainties and a lack of data. In that regard, medical and veterinary practitioners need timely, relevant, reliable evidence and current, integrated knowledge to manage emerging zoonoses.

There are two general surveillance systems for early warning and preparedness: (A) 'Syndromic surveillance' that focuses on disease trends by analyzing data on a cluster of clinical symptoms potentially associated with a disease or a phenomenon (in the absence of pathogen identification); and (B) 'Risk surveillance' that focuses on detecting risk factors for disease transmission without estimating the prevalence of pathogens, or identifying clinical features. Even in developed countries, syndromic surveillance for animal diseases, including zoonoses, are rudimentary. To overcome this deficiency, the Triple-S project, co-funded by the European Commission, is forging synergies between the human and animal health sectors by providing scientific and technical guidance on syndromic surveillance in real-time or near real-time which encompasses emerging zoonoses (7) . Examples of international organizations that report and respond to zoonoses, including emerging zoonoses, are listed in Table 1 . These organizations, including the WHO, the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE), and the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) have several different roles, including monitoring, notification regarding cases/and outbreaks, and technical support.

Other than the country-specific surveillance systems, certain global, region-specific, and non-governmental organizations which provide information related to zoonoses in general are:

(1) Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR) of CDC (2) Global Public Health Information Network (GPHIN) of Health Canada (3) UK public health network for zoonoses (4) European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDCMedVetNet and PACNET in the Pacific region) (5) Sentiweb in France (6) Although there are early warning and surveillance systems in the developed world for timely recognition of emerging zoonotic diseases in humans and farm animals, improvements are needed. However, detection and surveillance systems for emerging zoonoses in the developing world are much less functional. In that regard, surveillance systems for wildlife, exotic animals, and companion animals have not been established. Wildlife represents a significantly large and often unknown reservoir for emerging zoonoses, in addition to being a reservoir for re-emergence of zoonoses previously controlled. Factors for emergence of zoonoses from wildlife include a burgeoning human population leading to exploitation of forest areas for agriculture and dwelling, ecotourism, outdoor activities, and live animal trade (8).

Evidence-based practice (EBP) Á an interdisciplinary approach to clinical practice Á in human medicine has evolved over the past two decades due to a parallel progressive transformation in the following core domains: clinical trial registries, research reporting standards, systematic reviews, collaborations that produce and archive systematic reviews, MEDLINE indexing, and evidence update resources for point-of-care decision support. In contrast, the information and infrastructure supporting evidence-based veterinary medical practice in all of the above elements are less developed due to less public funding being made available to the veterinary side as compared to human health care (9) . The EBP resources include websites that provide processed information on best available research evidence which are critically appraised, integrated, concisely summarized, and regularly updated as new research evidence becomes available. Distilling and disseminating evidence, a process of knowledge translation, which evaluates relevance and applicability in various scenarios, is made accessible to health providers and those making policy decisions. These EBP resources are either freely accessible or via subscription. Access to such resources addresses several barriers identified by health care decision makers regarding access to evidence-based information, including limitations of time and lack of knowledge regarding resources that synthesize, summarize, and assess evidence for quality. Some of the available resources that provide ready access to high-quality, pre-processed research evidence include Cochrane database, National Guideline Clearinghouse (NGC-USA), American College of PhysiciansÁAmerican Society of Internal Medicine (ACP Journal Club), National Institute for Health and Clinical Evidence (NICE Á UK), Bandolier, Clinical Evidence, Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effectiveness PubMed, NHS Centre for Reviews and Dissemination (CRD) Databases, and Public Health plus. Some of these have been assessed using quality, relevance, and newsworthiness filters and are regularly updated. The above listed EBP resources provide evidence updates on etiology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis, and economics but are restricted to medical conditions only. Unfortunately, there are apparently no corresponding open, related guideline repositories or registries in veterinary medical practice, although the Evidence-Based Clinical Practice Guidelines of agency for health research and quality (AHRQ) has a short index for zoonosesrelated guidelines (10).

The focus of this commentary is on resources for evidence updates to counter emerging zoonoses, for example, Severe Acquired Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), West Nile, Avian Influenza, new variant Creutzfeldt Á Jakob Disease, Nipah, and the most recent Middle East Respiratory Syndrome. There is no certainty when and where the next zoonosis will emerge. Miscalculating an emerging zoonosis and poor risk communication between veterinary and medical sectors could have dire consequences for public health and cause considerable economic loss.

Guided by the American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA) and Council on public health and regulatory veterinary medicine, numerous articles have been published on zoonoses from the year 2000 onwards under 'Zoonosis Updates' in the Journal of American Veterinary Medical Association (JAVMA). This section does not provide evidence updates. On a regular basis, solicited scientific opinions are published in the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) journal on zoonotic diseases, outbreaks, trends and on diagnostic tests (11) . New editions of the terrestrial animal health code of OIE (12) have chapters on zoonoses and a manual of diagnostic tests and vaccines.

According to NICE (National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence), evidence updates highlight new evidence and provide a commentary describing its strengths and weaknesses relating to published accredited guidance (13) . Similarly, an accredited and guided evidence updates for zoonoses are essential on a sustained basis to assist decision makers with the development of evidence-based disease prevention and control plans within the complex humanÁanimalÁenvironment systems. Considering the threats, particularly those associated with emerging zoonoses, evidence-based information should be provided and constantly updated for:

(1) diagnostic tests to accurately classify the health status of individuals (2) the most effective preventative and therapeutic interventions (3) any emerging antimicrobial resistance and counter measures (4) public health strategies for population-based interventions

In order to strengthen the health care system (health systems evidence), knowledge translation, exchange, and action are required by synthesis, dissemination, transfer, and uptake of knowledge in practice and decision making. This should begin with an unbridled global joint signaling structure which encompasses syndromic surveillance and risk surveillance for emerging zoonoses. The signaling structure should foster a regular rapid flow of information between veterinary and medical health sectors, give early warning of pathogen emergence, and focus on determinants of disease emergence. Parallel systems of processing evidence regarding the proposed diagnosis, interventions, medical measures, and other public health strategies to assist decision making, emergency preparedness, and response should evolve in the lines of the existing evidence updates resources. Emerging zoonoses causes serious health threats and global economical losses. Countering them mandates the adoption of a one-health approach involving various stake holders, including ecologists, to understand the hostÁ parasite interaction in the natural reservoir and to understand the ecological constraints, often limiting adaptation to other hosts. Providing early warning of zoonotic pathogen emergence requires a one-health surveillance system at local, regional, and global levels. Evidence updates on diagnostic, preventative, and therapeutic interventions; antimicrobial resistance; and public health policies would support clinicians, public health practitioners, scientists, and policy makers to prevent and control emerging zoonoses. To accomplish this, a multi-disciplinary evidence-based strategy integrating with the existing EBP resources would provide a useful tool. Such a coordinated strategy should be essentially translated and disseminated in an open access performing platform to be of utility in real-time emergency preparedness and response.

Informed consent and public health,"During the past 25 years, medical ethics has concentrated largely on clinical medicine and the treatment of individual patients. This focus permits a view of medical provision as a (quasi-) consumer good, whose distribution can be or should be contingent on individual choice. The approach cannot be extended to public health provision. Public health provision, including measures for limiting the spread of infectious diseases, is a public good and can be provided for some only if provided for many. The provision or nonprovision of public goods cannot be contingent on individual informed consent, so must be in some respects compulsory. An adequate ethics of public health needs to set aside debates about informed consent and to consider the permissible limits of just compulsion for various types of public good. It will therefore gain more from engaging with work in political philosophy than with individualistic work in ethics.","Medical ethics has been transformed during the past 30 years. One conspicuous change has been a steadily increasing focus on informed consent, which is now usually taken to be essential for any ethically acceptable medical practice. The literature on informed consent in medical ethics is vast and repetitive. However, it has significant limitations. Some of the difficulties are well known and recalcitrant, although this seldom dents the enthusiasm of those who think informed consent essential to (or even sufficient for) ethically acceptable medical practice. In this paper I shall mention the commonly discussed difficulties, but shall concentrate on some less discussed but philosophically deeper difficulties that limit the use to which informed consent procedures can be put in public health provision.

Some of the most frequent disagreements about informed consent are about the basic reasons for thinking that it is ethically important. Is informed consent required to respect persons or to respect the autonomy of persons? If the latter, which conception of autonomy is relevant? If some persons are more autonomous than others, will informed consent procedures be more important for them? Or will they, on the contrary, be more important for those with limited autonomy? Alternatively, are informed consent procedures required because they provide a degree of assurance that patients are not deceived or coerced in the course of clinical practice? (Faden & Beauchamp 1986; Wolpe 1998; O'Neill 2002a) .

A second, even more frequently discussed, range of problems arises when patients cannot grasp the information that is essential to giving informed consent. If they cannot understand the proposition to which their consent is sought, they cannot give or refuse informed consent. The hard cases are numerous and intractable. Many patients cannot consent to medical intervention or treatment because they are too young, too ill, too disabled or too demented to understand the information that they would have to grasp to make an informed choice. As they can hardly be denied medical treatment because of these difficulties, it must be given without their consent. Should it then be given on the basis of others' consent (e.g. that of parents, guardians or relatives)? Or does the very idea of proxy consent undermine the fundamental concerns that are taken to justify informed consent requirements, or even show disrespect for individuals or their autonomy? Should proxy consent perhaps be set aside as mere pretence and replaced with greater reliance on professional judgement of each patient's best interests? Or would doing so revert to unacceptable medical paternalism, and so fail to respect patients and their (faltering) autonomy? Responses to these questions often propose ways of revising or refining the procedures used for requesting and recording consent to make consenting easier for less competent patients. But even the most energetic and timeconsuming presentation of user-friendly information, even the most elaborate and detailed consent forms and procedures, will not make informed consent possible for numerous patients with various types of incapacity.

However, these are not the deepest difficulties. Informed consent procedures are problematic not merely because their philosophical rationale is disputed, and not merely because some individuals lack competence to consent, or lack it at some times. The most basic philosophical difficulties with informed consent arise because consent is a propositional attitude. Consenting-like other cognitive states or acts such as knowing, believing, understanding, hoping, wondering, thinking, desiring or fearing-takes a proposition as its object. Hence consent is never directed at a medical intervention as such, but rather at some proposition that describes an intended intervention. However, any intervention can be described in many different ways. Even in the easy cases, where competent patients consent to a procedure or treatment described in a certain way, they may not be aware of and may not consent to other true descriptions of the same intervention, or of its more obvious effects. This can be the case even when the second description is entailed by the first, or when it refers to an obvious consequence of the state of affairs described by the first.

So propositional attitudes are opaque. A person may know or understand or hope that x, but not know or understand or hope that y, even where x entails y. A patient may consent to an intervention, and the intervention as described may entail or bring about certain conditions; however, the patient may not consent to those conditions because he or she may not grasp the entailment relation or the causal connection. For example, a parent may consent to the removal of tissues from their dead child, and the undifferentiated reference to tissues will cover entire organs; however, the parent may not know that this is so, and be upset to discover that entire organs were removed on the basis of general consent to the removal of tissues.

Because propositional attitudes are always opaque, the basic difficulties of informed consent procedures cannot be reliably eliminated by making information more available or consent procedures easier to follow. For unless the information is actually understood by those whose informed consent is requested, genuine consent will not stretch to the relevant proposition. This difficulty is ubiquitous within the central debates of medical ethics, although barely discussed (O'Neill 2002b).

These difficulties have been heightened rather than resolved by recent attempts to improve informed consent procedures. Two supposed improvements are often advocated and raise particular difficulties. The first demands that all consent should be explicit rather than implied; the second that it be specific rather than generic.

The distinction between explicit and implied consent contrasts ways of consenting. Explicit consent typically relies on documents, signatures and formal statements; it may require witnesses who confirm that proper procedures for consenting have been followed. The formal procedures are typically designed to create enduring records, thereby reducing later uncertainty about the consent given, and perhaps forestalling dissatisfaction, complaint or litigation. Patients who consent explicitly to proposed interventions thereby accept that they cannot later claim that they were injured or wronged, and accept that they will not have grounds for complaint or litigation.

By contrast, implied consent is inferred from a patient's action. For example, agreement to blood being taken or to having an injection is standardly signified by extending one's arm for the doctor to take the blood or give the injection. No documentation of the consent is required. It would be possible-but laborious-to replace the implied consent that is currently seen as sufficient in these and similar cases with explicit consent procedures. It would be possible-but strenuous-to introduce explicit consent procedures for the most minor and routine of medical Phil. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B (2004) interventions. However much we introduce additional explicit procedures and consent forms for interventions that are now performed on the basis of implied consent, explicit consent always relies on background understandings that remain implicit. The longest and most complex consent form cannot include a complete description of everything that will be done. Much is taken as understood, and consent based on those understandings can only be implied. No programme for replacing implied with explicit consent can be complete.

The distinction between specific and generic consent applies to the propositions to which consent is given, rather than to processes of consenting. For example, consent may be given to the removal of tissues, or alternatively to the removal of a specific sort of tissue, or even to the removal of tissue for a specific use, such as diagnosis, or as part of a cancer treatment or post-mortem to determine the cause of death. The descriptions to which consent is given are always incomplete. We can always add more detail. So those who believe that informed consent should be highly specific need to explain how specific it has to be to constitute ethically adequate informed consent. Answering this question may be no easier than answering the pseudo-question 'how long is a piece of string?'

These problems are not 'merely theoretical'. They surface and create practical problems wherever data protection issues arise, in secondary data analyses, indeed in the use of tissues for comparative study. If personal information is to be 'processed' (obtained, recorded, processed, sorted, used) only in accordance with the consent of those to whom it pertains (the 'data subjects'), then it will constantly turn out that if the consent obtained is sufficiently specific to permit a certain use, it will also be sufficiently specific to preclude other uses.

Similarly, if tissues and information from past patients are to be studied for purposes that could not have been anticipated, they must be studied without specific consent, because such consent could not in principle have been requested or given at the relevant time. The problem is not merely that in the past consent procedures were too lax, and that the relevant consents were not obtained, or not recorded with sufficient clarity (although that was often the case). The problem is deeper, indeed irresolvable, because many valuable purposes could not have been anticipated at the time that tissues were removed and stored. For example, nobody could tell in advance when information and tissues obtained in the course of treating past patients will turn out to be useful for unanticipated research. Both clinical information and tissue samples pertaining to deceased patients may later turn out to be vital for reaching a better understanding of new diseases. When the first patients with vCJD died, the only way in which pathologists could determine whether this was a new disease was by comparing their brain tissue with samples taken from patients who had died of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease across many decades in many countries. Tissue and information from those who died in the 1918 influenza epidemic may yet prove valuable in studying emerging diseases (Gamblin et al. 2004 ). It is difficult to see how secondary data analysis of this sort can proceed if access to tissue samples from and data pertaining to past patients, their treatment and their clinical outcomes, cannot be consulted without specific prior consent to such studies. Although the incidence of disease could be monitored on the basis of collecting deidentified data, linked data are needed for all more elaborate forms of retrospective study and public health research. Specific consent requirements undermine secondary data analysis in medical and other areas of inquiry; they would close down epidemiology.

However, a claim that specific consent is ethically required for retrospective study of linked patient information and tissues is neither intuitive nor plausible, provided that standard safeguards such as the approval of ethics committees and anonymization are in place. What would we think of a patient who asks his doctor how he knows that a medicine will prove helpful, is told that it helped nearly all patents with same condition, accepts the treatment but then refuses consent to the further study of information-even anonymized information-about the clinical outcome in his own case?

There are further and more general reasons for rejecting the current tendency to suppose that informed consent procedures are the touchstone of ethically acceptable medical provision. One of the most significant is that informed consent procedures are inapplicable whenever the goods or benefits to be provided are public goods. Certain types of goods-consumer goods, clinical care-can be provided for individuals, and their provision can in principle be made to be contingent on individual consent. The difficulties that informed consent requirements raise may prove irresolvable in some cases and resolvable in others. By contrast, if public goods are provided for any, they have to be provided for many. Some types of public good must be provided (or not provided) for whole populations; others may be provided (or not provided) for more restricted groups. For present purposes I leave these differences aside, to make the simple point that the provision of public goods cannot be made contingent on individual consent. For example, road safety, food safety, water safety, safe medicines and measures that protect against infection cannot be tailored to individual choice. Because there are no obligations to do the impossible ('ought implies can'), informed consent cannot be ethically required for the provision of public goods.

The implications of these thoughts about public goods are wider than may at first seem to be the case. For example, clinical care itself has to be provided to standards and formats that are also largely fixed and uniform, and so cannot be treated as a matter for informed consent. The scaffolding of professional training, of institutional structures, of public funding, of physical facilities are all public goods. The public provision of health care can reflect democratic process, and thereby certain forms of collective choice; but its basic structures cannot be geared to individual choice. Unavoidably there are large areas of medical ethics in which informed consent can play no part, or at most a minor part. What then are the appropriate ethical and other normative issues in these areas of medical ethics?

Phil. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B (2004) 

The ethical reasoning most commonly used in medical ethics focuses on transactions between individual professionals and individual patients, or between individual professionals and individual research subjects. Individualistic approaches are not likely to prove to be useful for analysing ethical questions about the provision of public goods, such as public health provision. However, it may seem that theories of justice will also provide an inappropriate account of the normative reasoning most relevant to the provision of public goods or to public health ethics. Most uses of theories of justice in health care ethics have addressed distributive issues, such as the just distribution of clinical care. Discussions of health care allocation decisions-of rationing-are discussions of the just distribution of a good that can be made contingent on individual choice. Theories of distributive justice also fail to address the distinctive ethical questions that arise in providing public goods, and so are not helpful for public health ethics.

But there is more to justice than distributive justice. All theories of justice also address the justification of compulsion, and in particular the justification of the forms of compulsion on which any legal order depends. There are many differing theories of justice, but by way of illustration I shall instance one theory, because it gives a particularly large-supposedly maximal-role to individual liberty and so to individual consent procedures. This theory is John Stuart Mill's form of liberalism, especially as developed in On liberty. I choose Mill's account of justice not because I assume or argue that it is more plausible than other accounts, but because he explicitly opposes compulsion except in very limited circumstances. Mill famously claimed that …the sole end for which mankind are warranted, individually or collectively, in interfering with the liberty of any of their number is self-protection. (Mill 1989, ch. 1, p. 13) Compulsion, on this view, is permitted only where needed so as to protect others: it is unjust unless needed to prevent harm to others. Public health provision is an obvious area where Mill's arguments are relevant, because compulsion may be needed to prevent individual action that might harm others' health.

Prevention of transmission of disease is a central case for Mill's justification of compulsion. Given the death rate from severe acute respiratory syndrome and the seriousness of the illness, Mill would view it as legitimate to make certain forms of action or treatment compulsory because the risk of transmission can be moderately high, and the risk of death for those who succumb high for some age groups. Depending on the gravity of the risk, it might be permissible to institute mandatory monitoring of those who may have been exposed, mandatory vaccination (if a vaccine is developed), restrictions on free movement, or quarantine. Similarly, where vaccination is safe and effective, Mill's argument would suggest that it could legitimately be made compulsory to produce the herd immunity that protects vulnerable individuals who cannot (yet) be vaccinated. Making public health measures such as these compulsory would hardly have seemed controversial a century ago. It has come to seem controversial on the basis of an illusory assumption that all medical provision, and with it public health provision, can be organized on the basis of informed consent of individuals. It cannot.

Of course, there are always difficulties in judging how great a risk is, and in deciding which forms of compulsion are most effective and most readily justified in a particular case. Such issues can be resolved only on a case-by-case basis, using the right expertise and the right information.

Often there are deficits in information and in expertise, as with the many uncertainties about the mode of transmission and likely spread of vCJD, and other new transmissible diseases. But where information and expertise point to the likelihood of harm to others, there are even on a very strong liberal account of justice no good ethical arguments to forbid all compulsion. To the contrary, appeals to individual consent do not offer a coherent, let alone an acceptable, way of approaching public health provision. Salus populi suprema lex is not an obsolete thought (Cicero 1928) .

Moving towards a new vision: implementation of a public health policy intervention,"Background: Public health systems in Canada have undergone significant policy renewal over the last decade in response to threats to the public's health, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome. There is limited research on how public health policies have been implemented or what has influenced their implementation. This paper explores policy implementation in two exemplar public health programs -chronic disease prevention and sexually-transmitted infection prevention -in Ontario, Canada. It examines public health service providers' , managers' and senior managements' perspectives on the process of implementation of the Ontario Public Health Standards 2008 and factors influencing implementation. Methods: Public health staff from six health units representing rural, remote, large and small urban settings were included. We conducted 21 focus groups and 18 interviews between 2010 (manager and staff focus groups) and 2011 (senior management interviews) involving 133 participants. Research assistants coded transcripts and researchers reviewed these; the research team discussed and resolved discrepancies. To facilitate a breadth of perspectives, several team members helped interpret the findings. An integrated knowledge translation approach was used, reflected by the inclusion of academics as well as decision-makers on the team and as co-authors. Results: Front line service providers often were unaware of the new policies but managers and senior management incorporated them in operational and program planning. Some participants were involved in policy development or provided feedback prior to their launch. Implementation was influenced by many factors that aligned with Greenhalgh and colleagues' empirically-based Diffusion of Innovations in Service Organizations Framework. Factors and related components that were most clearly linked to the OPHS policy implementation were: attributes of the innovation itself; adoption by individuals; diffusion and dissemination; the outer contextinterorganizational networks and collaboration; the inner settingimplementation processes and routinization; and, linkage at the design and implementation stage.","Public health systems in Canada have undergone significant renewal over the last decade in response to various threats to the public's health such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) [1, 2] , water contamination [3] , and Hepatitis C in the blood supply [4] . In Ontario (ON), Canada, renewal efforts have involved the review and subsequent revision of public health policies that ""establish the minimum requirements for fundamental public health programs and services…"" to be delivered by ON's 36 boards of health [5] . There is limited research on how these policies have been implemented or what has influenced their implementation. Understanding the process of policy implementation in practice settings can provide valuable learning for other jurisdictions undergoing similar public health policy renewal processes, and is the focus of this paper.

The aim of Renewing Public Health Systems (RePHS)a five year program of researchis to study the implementation and impact of public health renewal in two Canadian provinces, ON and British Columbia (BC), over time. Two exemplar programschronic disease prevention (CDP) and sexually-transmitted infection prevention (STIP)are being used to explore these topics. These programs were chosen based on having a similar focus in both provinces allowing for provincial comparisons, the likelihood of primary care and public health collaboration on the topic (a secondary research interest) and expressed interest by our knowledge user partners. This paper reports on results from the first two years of data collection (baseline) in 2010-11 in ON. Baseline results from BC are reported in a parallel paper [6] .

Five years after the 2003 SARS outbreak, the Ontario Public Health Standards 2008 (OPHS) [5] were released. Additional file 1 provides a detailed history of the process of initiation, development, and roll out of the policies up to 2010 when this program of research was initiated. In short, following the 2003 SARS outbreak [7, 8] a provincial report -Revitalizing Ontario's Public Health Capacity [9] recommended that the Mandatory Health Programs and Services (MHPSG) [10] policy document be replaced with renewed provincial public health program standards that were to be continually revised, in other words, part of an ever-greening process. The Standards were expected to fit within public health's fiscal envelope or public health funding. In addition, there was to be increased emphasis on accountability, coordination and collaboration across the health system, as well as financial sustainability. Government and a Technical Review Committee deliberated on a number of cross-cutting themes to be included in the new Standards [11] . These included: balancing the need for provincial standardization and being responsive to local contexts; integrating public health functions as part of the overall framework emphasizing population health assessment and surveillance, as well as the delineation of a Foundational Standard; establishing a logic model approach to define causal linkages between requirements, board of health and societal outcomes; and, ensuring that public health roles and contributions to addressing determinants of health and reducing health inequities was prominent within a robust introduction to the standards.

The draft OPHS were submitted to the Chief Medical Officer of Health in April, 2007 with an expectation that ""a robust and comprehensive roll-out strategy"" would be included with training supports. On the Technical Review Committee's advice, government continued to develop protocols to support specific requirements within the OPHS to achieve greater standardization in province-wide implementation. Figure 1 illustrates the four pillars (or principles), upon which the Standards were built, the OPHS Foundational Standard [5] and its accompanying Population Health Assessment and Surveillance protocol [12] , as well as five program standards and their relevant protocols that existed at the time this study was conducted. This figure was updated in May 2014 to reflect the addition of the Tanning Beds Compliance Protocol [13] .

In 2007, Protocol Development Teams began drafting protocols, such as a Population Health Assessment and Surveillance Protocol and Infectious Diseases protocol [12, 14] . Numerous stakeholders had an opportunity to comment on drafts in 2008. Guidance documents were also developed, updated or referenced. The OPHS and 26 protocols were released in October 2008 and came into effect in January 2009 and continue to be updated, with the most recent revisions to the 2008 Standards published in 2014 [15] with an additional protocol.

The OPHS release in 2009 included program specific workshops and a dedicated website for the OPHS with additional resources. In support of the OPHS release, the former Ministry of Health Promotion and Sport released nine guidance documents in 2010. The content of these policy documents has been explored in depth by the RePHS research team from a number of perspectives including: chronic disease prevention [16] , equity [17] , public health human resources [18] , and primary care and public health collaboration [19] .

An integrative framework to understand implementation of a public health policy intervention A focus on implementation sciences grew in parallel with the development of the field of knowledge translation, but this focus was on the knowledge user setting and understanding how a knowledge product or innovation could be integrated in everyday practice or policymaking in a sustainable way. As a result, attention to how contextual and organizational factors enabled implementation became important [20, 21] . Greenhalgh and colleagues wrote a seminal article and book that reported on a systematic review to address how innovations can be spread and sustained in health services organizations [22, 23] . They used a meta-narrative technique to synthesize findings from empirical and theoretical works in 13 different research traditions, such as evidenced-based medicine and complexity studies. Based on their analysis, the authors put forth a ""unifying conceptual model"" of diffusion in service organizations composed of eight elements: 1) the innovation, 2) adoption by individuals, 3) assimilation by the system, 4) diffusion and dissemination, 5) system antecedents for innovation, 6) system readiness for innovation, 7) the outer context: interorganizational networks and collaboration, 8) implementation and routinization, and 9) linkage (at the design and implementation stage). We used this empirically-based framework [22, 23] , to interpret our data related to the policy implementation. In our analysis we took the authors' advice also to pay attention to implementation adaptations that arose and occurred informally in addition to those that were spread through official, planned mechanisms.

The purpose of this paper is to explore public health service providers' , managers' and senior managements' perspectives in six Ontario health units on the process of implementation of the OPHS and factors influencing their implementation within two exemplar public health programs -CDP and STIP. We used Greenhalgh et al's Model of Diffusion of Innovations in Service Organizations as an organizing framework [22, 23] to interpret the findings. Similar to the parallel paper that explored policy implementation of BC's Core Public Health Functions Framework, ""knowledge about the implementation experience and the challenges encountered by practitioners and managers may help inform improvements in both the policy intervention and the implementation process"" [6] p.4.

This paper reports on baseline results from a longitudinal multiple case study, which incorporated a number of data collection methods. We drew upon results from focus groups and interviews to obtain perspectives from health unit personnel and senior management in relation to the core program standards. Cases were defined as the STIP and CDP programs that are directed by policy. These programs were chosen because they were offered in both provinces and were likely to involve collaboration with primary care -a cross cutting theme. Six out of 36 health units in the province of Ontario were recruited to provide a diverse sample that matched the general demographic makeup (e.g., population density; ratio of immigrants; urban, rural, remote or mixed) of the health authorities in BC. One health unit dropped out due to reduced capacity to participate in research as a result of multiple staff changes and vacancies; the health unit was replaced by another in 2011. Service providers, managers and senior management (i.e., directors, a Chief Nursing Officer, Medical Officers of Health, and Associate Medical Officers of Health) were recruited to participate (Table 1) . Service providers and managers participated in focus groups separately to avoid the influence of power-over relationships. Focus groups were [1] framework is supported by four pillars which are the principles that underpin the Standards. The foundational Standard and protocol is to be integrated into the 5 program Standards with their relevant accompanying protocols. This diagram was current at the time of data collection: In May 2014, it was revised and an additional protocol was added.

conducted within homogenous teams (i.e., STIP and CDP) when relevant. Senior management participated in interviews. Interviews and focus groups were audiotaped, transcribed verbatim, cleaned for accuracy and entered into NVivo10.0 for analysis. Focus groups were conducted face-to-face at the health units by program area, and interviews were completed in person or by phone by researchers. Focus group and interview questions were tailored to address participant groups, i.e., service providers, managers, senior management (See Additional file 2).

In this study, we used concepts in Greenhalgh's framework as sensitizing concepts to provide general ideas for developing our interview questions to ensure that we covered the broad domain of known influences on successful policy and innovation implementation. When it came time for analysis, we did not use Greenhalgh's framework to structure or organize our coding. Rather, we coded line by line in inductive fashion to develop a set of empirically-derived codes. To begin, a coding framework was created by having each researcher from the team code two or three selected transcripts followed by a review and discussion in a face-to-face meeting. Agreement was reached on the coding framework and remaining transcripts were coded by trained staff. After a few more transcripts were coded, results were reorganized by identifying codes that could be merged or reorganized into higher level thematic codes by researchers. When all coding was completed, each researcher was assigned a set of transcripts to review as a peer debriefing strategy: in other words, each transcript was reviewed by two researchers to increase the credibility of analysis [24, 25] .

In the final step, after thematic higher order codes were identified, we again turned to Greenhalgh's framework to help us in interpreting the various categories of inductive codes and the relationships among them. Our discussion is therefore framed around relevant concepts in Greenhalgh's framework. Nonetheless, we acknowledge that in our coding we were theoretically sensitized by the Greenhalgh framework. Sensitizing concepts are central to a grounded theory approach to analysis [26] , but the notion was developed much earlier by Blumer [27] . A sensitizing concept is one that is not clearly specified with respect to its attributes. Thus, it does not allow the researcher to move easily between data identifying the instance and the attributes of the concept. Rather, a sensitizing concept provides the researcher with general suggestions about what to look for in an empirical instance. Definitive concepts, on the other hand, provide very specific directions for what to see [27] p. 7.

Key results were circulated to decision-maker team members (they were not privy to the raw data) as well as senior Ministry staff at various meetings for input. Thus decision-makers provided additional context to help interpret findings and increase credibility of results [28] . An integrated knowledge translation approach [29] was used throughout, and is reflected by the inclusion of academics as well as decision-maker researchers (i.e., government and public health unit staff) on the RePHS team. 

Participant demographics will be presented followed by results, using illustrative participant quotes, related to: 1) how the OPHS (policies) were disseminated; 2) awareness of policies; 3) general opinions about the policies; 4) processes used for policy implementation; and 5) internal and external factors influencing policy implementation.

A total of 21 focus groups and 18 interviews were conducted throughout October-December 2010 (manager and staff focus groups) and August 2011 (senior management interviews) ( Fig. 2 ).

Policies were most frequently communicated through formal means by health unit managers to front line service providers. This was done through program discussions, new staff orientation, presentations, in-services, emails and workshops. In some health units, managers noted that communication ""cascaded"" from senior management to service providers and policy analysts, and in one health unit a designated 'champion' was responsible to ensure policies were communicated through programs/branches (satellite offices). Sometimes participants were informed about the policies by external sources such as: external networks, Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care updates, Ministry sponsored webinars, and the Ministry's formal launch. A director noted: ""I think mostly it was in the initial consultations. So there was that launch of the drafts and all the health units were asked to provide feedback."" Often managers and front line staff were involved in standards development by providing feedback, or contributing to the writing process. This helped to incorporate a variety of perspectives. As described by a service provider: In a few cases policies were reviewed by staff independently, staff assisted in the preparation of guidance documents, or they participated on a provincial planning committee.

Managers and senior management knew about the new policies and reported that staff awareness was supported through discussions at team meetings or regular planning meetings. As described by one manager:

We were aware of them and used them as a planning tool before, even before they were passed. So, I think we were very aware of them and we try to really encourage our staff to continue to be aware of them.

In a few health units the OPHS were incorporated into organizational documents, such as strategic plans and logic models, as a way to identify and align priority program activities with the government mandate thereby facilitating policy implementation into services and programs

Service providers were asked about their knowledge of the policies. Many were unaware of them, or were only aware of some aspects of them, such as the accompanying protocols. As noted by one participant: ""I'm familiar with the OPHS but the old ones (referring to MHPSG). I haven't seen the new [OPHS], updated ones. They have not been, in any way that I'm aware of, been shared with me."" For most front line staff who were aware, they did not focus on them ""… I don't think about the standards an awful lot. Like in the clinic here, you are focused on hands-on work. So it's not something that we dwell on too much. We know what we have to do and we do it."" Despite direct involvement by health unit staff in the development of the OPHS and broad health unit communications around them, awareness was uneven. Overall, managers were more aware and found ways to incorporate them into their work processes, whereas most front line service providers either were unaware or paid little attention to the OPHS. Having more direct engagement with the policies through the development and or implementation phases seems to have influenced the level of awareness of the policy.

Themes that indicate influences on policy implementation are bolded and summarized in Fig. 3 .

There were mixed views about the OPHS. In general, some managers and senior management reported that they were fortunate to have them, describing them as providing direction and being empowering. As a director : ""… it does provide direction for us. It is a way that we have structured our organization somewhat around the Standards. It's certainly how we report out on things."" Others saw the policies as being similar to the old policies with the same overarching themes or as an extension of the MHPSG. A few others understood them as continually emerging and changing, with their new protocols and guidance documents.

There was a mix of opinions around the degree of prescriptiveness of the OPHS compared to the MHPSG. However, most participants felt the OPHS were generally less prescriptive allowing for more flexibility in programming, but providing less direction. Exceptions were related to aspects of infectious disease programs which were seen as more prescriptive. As a STIP manager described: ""It's not prescriptive as far as the education piece, but the clinical and the investigation, that's very prescriptive."" There was a need for balance between having flexibility in implementing the OPHS while also being prescriptive so that arguments could be made for some hard to sell programs, such as harm reduction. A manager explained:

The lack of information [referring to the nonprescriptive policy] allows us to do what we'd like to do. However, that same lack of information also doesn't give us the permission that we need to do some of the things that we need to do. So, would we have liked to have seen more meat? Maybe.

Participants indicated that the non-prescriptive nature of the policies left decision-making around them open to outside influences, which will be described later. Some tension was identified in that the policies called for evidence-based programming. However, participants felt that there were times when specific, local community needs were not prioritized areas in the OPHS or no evidence existed in relation to interventions to address community needs. Participants also correctly understood that the policies were to be fiscally neutralin other words, staying within the budget. This limitation was generally accepted by participants as a reality that could not be changed.

Organizational leadership was a significant factor influencing policy implementation. The topic of leadership was spoken about as both a barrier and facilitator by staff and managers from most health units. A significant factor influencing implementation was management approaches. Some staff in a number of health units said they felt unsupported and disempowered. Complaints ranged from challenges to autonomous practice of service providers, increased control by senior management, a lack of staff voice, lack of transparency related to changes in priorities, limits on innovation, and having to work through multiple layers of bureaucracy. One staff member described this latter issue as follows: ""…they have added layers and layers and layers. I used to report to a manager; now I have a supervisor and I have a manager. There's the MOH."" Another staff member described their lack of control:

You are suddenly doing something that just changes your […] entire operational plan and allocation of resources. And we are often not given a reason. It could be someone's personal interest: It could be something they heard on the news. But it just plops into your assignment and we don't have a lot of say at that level.

On the other hand, leadership was seen by many others as being trusting, supportive, flexible, accessible, and encouraging creativity. As one staff member put it: ""I met with the supervisor of the population health team and we talked about the scope of this position as well as the standards and planning for this upcoming year. So she was very supportive and just assisting me with that planning.""

Capacity building opportunities and resources was another important factor influencing implementation of the policies. Staff in most health units expressed the presence of and value in capacity or career building opportunities, as well as access to supportive tools and resources; however, not all staff members shared this sentiment. One participant said: ""I don't feel supported in terms of responsibilities with the new policies. They tell us what we are supposed to do but I don't think the process and how we do it is well supported…""

Another leadership factor influencing implementation that was mentioned in most health units was a sense of inequity in program support from management across programs and branches. In particular there was less support for some topics over others. Topics that did not explicitly fall under the policies were less valued although they were important to communities, for example: ""body image: there wasn't quite a good fit under OPHS […] Is that mental health? Because, if it's mental health, then it doesn't belong in public health. If it's healthy eating, then sure."" Also, health promotion was less valued by managers than infectious disease control; and sensitive topics such as harm reduction were valued less than topics such as healthy weights.

Explicit senior leadership support for the policy and its implementation was reported to be important by all. Having a vacant senior leadership position at the time of the roll out was a barrier for implementation in some health units, while other health units were influenced by local municipal pressures. A lack of valuing of OPHS by leadership and lack of leadership to champion the OPHS were problematic in half of the health units. As shared by one participant: ""The lack of importance placed on [the policies], from the top down impacted how they were received by staff."" Another senior manager supported perceptions from some health units that: ""We could have used a little bit more leadership and guidance in terms of how we can do these things and what are some of the resources."" Medical Officers of Health were identified by some health units to have a very important influence on public health decisions in relation to the roll out of policies and accompanying program resources. For example, a manager described a situation in which the Medical Officer of Health did not support the provision of services to homeless populations as they were seen as peripheral to STIP programming: ""…It kind of brought to light maybe things that we were doing that didn't exactly fit in with our program or didn't fit in with the role of public health."" In this case, it showed the power that leaders had in interpreting the policy and ultimately making decisions about program resources. Although some staff said it was up to leadership to deal with implementation, others said they wanted more involvement in it. This has the potential of creating staff discontent from a feeling of disempowerment.

Health units reported on the explicit application of the OPHS in planning processes and/or documents. The policies were used by HUs most often to justify programs as well as to guide operational planning and other program planning processes (balanced scorecards and the budgeting process). This was in addition to the application of various forms of evidence to inform planning (e.g., literature reviews, environmental scans, other health unit activities). Formal planning tools and planning processes were generally used (e.g., logic models, work plans, service plans, and internal planning processes). A number of participants reported making explicit reference to the OPHS in planning documents. One director explained how the relationship between the OPHS and financial resources was explicitly noted in planning documents: ""We'll show what percentage [of our budget] is going to Foundational Standard or different Standards."" OPHS implementation was facilitated by the explicit integration of the policy in program planning processes including decision making around the use of resources.

Participants described planning processes as involving several steps at the program level, as well as across programs and health unit branches. A manager described the process this way.

So we have to develop logic models for each of our program areas, pretty wellparticularly at the standard level and then at the program level. And then we have to develop yearly program plans […] Those are written by the managers and staff and reviewed and approved by the director then onto the medical officer of health. And of course, those are compared to the standards and protocols to ensure that we are meeting all of the requirements.

Others said that integration across programs and branches in planning processes could be improved: ""I think there could be more integration across the branches. Currently we have good integration within our [CDP] branch […] We try very much to work with healthy sexuality program…"" Also, planning processes appeared to be more extensive for CDP than STIP. A STIP manager explained:

… We are different, because we have very protocoldriven programs. We really don't have a lot of choice in this. We have a choice in how we target the high risk. So there's room to move, but it's not the same as chronic disease where you're planning new programs all the time.

Planning processes engaged many stakeholders including individuals, health unit teams, and community partners. Planning that incorporated staff and management feedback and involved the full team was identified as vital in the planning process. As depicted by a STIP manager: ""…in the planning process when we do our operational plans… it would be with our front-line staff. And the staff that's going to be doing the clinical or the education portion. So [we plan] as a team."" Participants also spoke at length about the role communities played in planning programs and services to implement the OPHS. Much of planning was community driven, community engaged, as well as community needs driven. Communities were engaged through community consultations, surveys, assessments, focus groups, or advisory committees. A CDP manager noted:

We have placed more emphasis on the need, in terms of gathering evidence, to linking with priority populations and engaging with communities […] Some of the things that we have decided to do with respect to our four branch office areas in particular is have community consultation sessions within [the] branch office areas.

Planning with community partners was also seen as challenging considering the time needed to build trust, respond, and allow them ""to be part of that plan as opposed to rushing it."" Despite the time and resources required, engagement by internal staff and external partners in planning processes was essential in implementing the OPHS.

Elements of governance by the Boards, which serve to establish norms and structures through management practices, polices and processes, had an influence on the implementation of the OPHS. Many respondents' comments reflected a perception that public health was generally well supported by their Board of Health. In reference to the OPHS, a manager explained that: ""… [The Board members] believe in public health. They believe in us. They have confidence in the workers in public health"", implying that trust in public health work extended to the implementation of new practices. This was reflected in a true desire to see positive community outcomes, to be ""making a difference in the population's health."" Further, there was evidence of a reciprocal relationship between staff and the Board; as a senior manager said, ""I'm really happy with […] the quality of questions and inquiry and interest in public health. The majority of the board members seem to come with that real interest and engagement…"" This generally positive interaction led to ""pretty high standards"" or expectations from public health staff with respect to OPHS implementation. In turn, Boards had the ability to raise the profile of PH by putting PH issues on the political agenda in various cities and regions which was an unexpected, immediate impact of implementation.

In a few cases, however, health units experienced difficulty in attracting the attention of the Board because of the multiplicity of local issues on the table. Further, approvals from Boards of Health were generally required for new programming: ""We can't just say, we're going to have a new sexual health program, and we're going to hire new staff […] We have to justify increases in budget, increases in staffing…"" This quote hinted at an underlying tension from the legislatively mandated OPHS requirements and governance level accountability of the local board of health. Directions from the province and political pressures from Boards of Health who ""held the purse strings"", and thus make decisions around programming, were not always aligned creating challenges for OPHS implementation.

Public health human resources played an important role in supporting policy implementation. Front line staff spoke to the importance of additional resources to assist with implementation of OPHS such as additional staff and staff with the right skill mix to facilitate implementation of revised or new programs and services. For example, increased emphasis on the use of evidence and research required staff with competencies to support this. One participant indicated: ""I think our role did not change but the support that we were providing to teams in terms of consultation for evaluation and things that did increase a little bit more"". In addition, participants identified that additional staff were needed on a temporary basis during early implementation or new roles were created as a result of needing to meet OPHS requirements and the Foundational Standard in particular [5] . Participants from some HUs indicated that additional resources, particularly additional human resources, were needed to support implementation of OPHS but were not obtained.

In some HUs, a reorganization of programs and services to better implement OPHS led to staff being redeployed among programs. This meant that some staff moved from programs where they had worked for many years. Some staff were unhappy with these changes to their role. Others commented that staff were working across teams which was creating better collaboration and sharing of resources in their health units. Some participants described how the OPHS brought greater clarity to their role by focusing planning on key public health programs and services to be delivered. Many front line staff suggested that the OPHS reflected the reality of public health practice and programs. They indicated that they were already meeting the OPHS in their day-to-day work and OPHS implementation had little impact on their roles: For me it never changed, you know, for me it was always kind of like, we need to get out there…So I had no idea if that was our goals or whatever. But at the end of the day, you know, I knew that we were doing it. And I think that we all knew that we were doing a good job.

The local and regional community context, including population make up, geography, economics, and politics, had a significant influence on policy implementation. Whether a health unit served a rural population, a vastly diverse immigrant population, or offered public health services near an international airport, these contexts influenced the delivery of programs and services. As a senior manager explained, rural access ""has an impact on our delivery [and] the cost of delivery of services, because of travelling and having people in the smaller areas and the areas where there's need. We need to be looking at that, which the Standards don't."" As noted earlier, the local political climate also influenced OPHS implementation. For example, access to contraband cigarettes was described as a barrier to implementation of a protocol in a health unit surrounded by tobacco farms. Many examples were provided about smoking prevention efforts being influenced by local politics, particularly where the community's economic base was tied to tobacco:

…specific to chronic disease, we have an agricultural community growing tobacco and having managed that program for many years, that's a real political challenge. Moving forward and trying to do the programs as best we can, but knowing that they're often not supported strongly by the politicians, or being lobbied by their farming community. And it creates a tension there within decision making.

A senior manager pointed out that decisions were made based on community needs. Another senior manager supported the view that community data matters: ""…given our high rates of HIV and the issues around drug use and harm reduction […] we're working with particular populations. We have a high new immigrant population […] We're focusing our effort."" Another key factor was the needs of local communities and organizations. As one STIP manager described, ""There's a fair bit of flexibility in some of these standards for local needs to be driving some of it."" Community need was sometimes trumped by research evidence creating a dilemma for staff: You want to focus on a certain area and there isn't enough say best practices or evidence to support it, I think there's less support to do that. It's more, this is concrete, there's proof behind it, you work on that… and sorry about the community wanting to work on this, but there's not enough evidence behind it."" Front line staff in particular struggled with this, since it threatened long-term relationships with their community partners.

A key implementation facilitator was collaboration among health units and between health units and community partners. Collaborations enhanced community partners' awareness of public health services, as well as implementation of school, street outreach, and primary care programs. Collaboration also enhanced access to specific communities (e.g., cultural, geographic, hard to reach communities). As one STIP manager put it.

…street outreach […] has all been done through collaboration with partner agencies. Because when we do street outreach, we are actually walking the streets and encouraging people to come in for testing in conjunction with the Needle Exchange Program and the outreach workers there or Access AIDS and their outreach workers.

Another factor supporting implementation was alignment of mandates of local or regional organizations. Collaboration is a two way street with NGOs looking to health units for support in implementing their work, and health units looking to these same groups to implement their guidelines. For example, regional cancer programs and public health units collaborate to implement aspects of Ontario's Cancer Plan related to healthy eating and physical activity. Although most participants saw community partners as resources to support program delivery and evaluation, others saw them as competitors for limited resources. Interestingly, a few saw partners as drivers for PH implementation. As one manager explained: ""[Partners] are trying to leverage [resources]. [They tell you] 'your mandate says you should be doing this.'"" Dependence on municipal support services was another factor influencing implementation and was usually reported as a barrier. For example, reliance on municipal infrastructure for IT systems to support surveillance work. As noted by a senior manager: ""Where we want support of an IT department, we have to negotiate that with the City."" Another example of reliance on municipal structures was the use human resource departments, requiring health units to negotiate with them for services.

Another regional factor was the relationship and/or alignment between health units and regional health authorities. Funding flows to all health services from the regional health authorities with the exception of primary care and public health who generally receive their funding from the province. One public health manager described the regional authority's role and their relationship to it as follows:

Their mindset is not chronic [disease preventionoriented] and their mindset is not…primary, secondary, tertiary, and even quaternary care… and public health is rarely [their interest]. I was invited to [a committee] which was basically… physician advisory groups… [We] sat and decided [what] the clinical plan was going to be. But it's clear from that clinical plan that public health is just a bump on a log and they're not really interested because they don't fund us.

Other managers spoke about positive involvement with the regional health authority for regional program development such as falls prevention and cardiovascular disease prevention, as well as benefits of linking with primary care through various regional committees.

Specific policies at the local or regional levels also affected implementation of the standards. For example, at the time of OPHS implementation, there was a regional focus on performance measurement in one health unit which diverted energy away from OPHS implementation. Another example was school policies that challenged the implementation of public health programs. As one manager described:

…we keep working with the school board to make sure that we can implement [the vaccine program]. Sometimes there are little barriers because we are on school grounds. For example, we must have parental consent and we know that there is no age of consent.

Municipal (local) economics were discussed as factors in policy implementation. Municipal fiscal issues impacted the budgets of local public health units. The province funds 75 % of public health while the municipality funds the remaining 25 %. These structures impacted funding for public health human resources in various ways. When municipalities implemented austerity measures such as hiring freezes and cuts in programs they were also implemented in some public health units negatively impacting staff capacity and thus OPHS implementation. For example, the fiscal austerity climate: prevents [our casual staff] from becoming permanent. [] … it poses a barrier then to actually implementing the Standards because you don't have the staff capacity to do that. And the wrinkle in our [region] is even though there's a 75-25 funding split, if the [region] wants to cut you know a couple of million dollars they're willing to lose …the leveraging from the province. So in many ways you're losing three times that because of the leveraging.

There were five notable external provincial level factors that facilitated implementation.

The first is related to Ministry-based consequences for not meeting the Standards and accountability. Respondents noted that that the Ministry had been ""extremely mute"" about any repercussions related to not meeting the Standards. As a result, there was a perception that no Ministry-based consequences existed for failing to implement the policy. Participants identified likely consequences of not meeting the Standards as: a claw back of funding, funding withdrawal, or a fine. One participant felt that with the absence of penalties ""the government does lose a little bit of credibility"" with the Boards of Health. A STIP manager commented that the lack of penalties underscored a feeling that health units were unsupported by the province: ""…the running joke is that the province doesn't support health units. It doesn't provide any real guidance to us.

[…] and all health units are on their own and what not."" Despite this uncertainty, there was awareness of accountability agreements between the Ministry and health units that were going to be created for monitoring purposes, but not be tied to funding. One respondent guessed that scoring low on an indicator would lead to ""a meeting to discuss why [it was] not [reached]"" as is done with others in the health sector. Respondents suggested that the Ministry would be open to documentation and rationales such as the community's particular health needs or the size of the health unit to justify variances with meeting the Standards' expectations. One respondent mentioned that the Ministry ""has been very clear though that they will work with health units to address any type of shortfall."" Some participants said that not meeting a standard would imply the need for additional funding or raise the profile of a particular issue.

The second is the supportive role of various provincial-level government departments or related agencies. The third provincial factor includes Ministry activities that supported health units in building capacity to implement the policy. For example, the Ministry provided communications to health unit leaders (managers) related to implementation of the OPHS through regional meetings across the province as well as teleconferences. This illustrates the inter-relationship that exists between provincial and organizational factors. On-going communication efforts have also been made through updates posted on a website. A participant reported that the website provided not only the OPHS 2008 and protocols, but also included background information, logic models, and other resources. Public health staff could also approach the province for support. As one STIP manager noted:

… If we would have a question about a specific item under the OPHS, we would go to the province. It happens very occasionally that we will go the province for stuff; for case management issues, if it's an interpretation of a case definition […] The fourth noteworthy factor supporting implementation is the existence of other provincial policies that influence public health work. Three examples of provincial policy that affect local implementation of the OPHS are: the School Food and Beverage Policy, Smoke-Free Ontario strategy and legislation, and the Ministry of Education's Daily Physical Activity in Elementary Schools policy. These policies also drove public health activities and were seen as being in alignment with OPHS directions.

The fifth factor influencing implementation was imbalances of provincial funding across programs. Participants discussed that certain federal or province-wide programs such as Smoke Free Ontario received targeted or additional funding while other programs relied solely on their public health unit budgets. This meant that certain programs were better resourced than others which influenced OPHS implementation.

We are so small and we don't have a lot of resources and because we are getting funded provincially for [tobacco] programming. I mean it sometimes seems unbalanced to the other programs. Why do they get so much training? Why couldn't they go to conferences? How come they have all the swag?....So, it can seem very unbalanced.

This imbalance was frustrating for staff and managers who had to do more with less.

While there are national or federal level influences on implementation of the policy interventions, these appear to be much less prominent than local/regional or provincial factors. Resources available through national agencies such as the Public Health Agency of Canada's e-portal were one notable factor. Public health units report following the National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) guidelines related to immunizing for hepatitis B and hepatitis A, and the Canadian STI guidelines, which helped them implement the OPHS.

Although most influences on OPHS implementation were identified as occurring at the local/regional level, provincial and national level influences were also felt. Further, some influences were related to more than one level. For example, H1N1 influenza was a local, provincial, and national public health priority in 2009 with resources and priorities at each level that influenced public health activities. Other examples include multi-level initiatives such as Canada Prenatal Nutrition Program, Canadian Physical Activity Guidelines; and various promotional events and weeks, such as National Non-Smoking Week and National Nutrition Month. Other initiatives were noted that originated from various branches of the Federal Government, such as First Nations and Inuit Health Branch.

This study helps to fill a gap that exists in the public health policy implementation literature. It showed that multiple levels of influence exist that impact the implementation of the public health policies. In addition, complex relationships exist among factors across and between levels. This is illustrated in Fig. 3 by dotted lines between levels. The factors aligned very closely with many of the components in Greenhalgh and colleagues' Model of Diffusion in Service Organizations [23] , which is used to guide the discussion. It is important to note that the Greenhalgh et al model was created as a composite framework based on a meta-narrative systematic review of the diffusion of innovations literature. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that each element in the model is not relevant in every situation nor is it reasonable to expect that it would show up in every instance. Our data did not demonstrate relevance of some aspects of the model (e.g., aspects of the innovation itself such as trialability, capacity to evaluate the innovation), indicating that some influences were more important than others in this situation. Participants identified those that were most relevant and salient to them basing their interpretations of their own experiences. These interpretations might be different from others in similar or different situations. However, in our constant comparative analysis, each concept 'earned' its way into the results by appearing repeatedly in the data. At the same time, the factors influencing diffusion of innovation (which includes an implementation stage) in Greenhalgh's framework were empirically grounded in a large body of literature.

Factors that were most clearly linked to the OPHS policy implementation and components in the model and demonstrating a powerful influence on implementation will be highlighted. These include: attributes of the innovation itself; adoption by individuals; diffusion and dissemination; the outer context -interorganizational networks and collaboration; the inner setting -implementation processes and routinization; and, linkage at the design and implementation stage. We discuss each of these components followed by implications for practice and policy, and study strengths and limitations.

Attributes of the innovation itselfthat is, the OPHS policy -is a component in the model that influences uptake. End users of the innovation need to perceive relative advantage of the innovation for successful implementation [23, 30] . Many staff members identified that the policy was useful to justify programs, especially politically sensitive ones such as harm reduction. The fact that the OPHS are legislatively mandated is an attribute that could be used to leverage local implementation and could be helpful in securing resources that might otherwise be diverted to other municipal programs. Opportunity for reinvention of the innovation is another aspect of an innovation's attributes that can support uptake [23] . Participants had mixed opinions in relation to the prescriptiveness of the new policy. Most participants felt that the policy was less prescriptive compared to the OPHS predecessor (the MHPSG), particularly in relation to the CDP program. The ability to tailor programs to meet local community needs was seen as a great advantage in the new policy -an opportunity for reinvention. On the other hand, staff involved in STIP programs did not see much change of the new policy with respect to prescriptiveness, since they have always had strict guidelines to follow for STI management including contact tracing. Similarly, the Bax, de Jong and Kooppenjan study of implementation of road policy in the Netherlands [31] noted that a policy implementation gap was the absence of precise policy objectives which allowed for discretionary power to deviate from the intended policy directions. They also argued that an implementation strategy needs to match the policy and implementation context. Another important lesson was that ""local knowledge is indispensable to adapt a uniform package of measures to specific conditions"" (p.880). In other words, implementation requires a certain amount of discretionary freedom to permit local tailoring. On the other hand, Bax and colleagues also reported that a lack of precision in their policy had risks characterised as: ""'not knowing how to' (lack of proper information and communication), 'not being able to' (lack of competence and capacity), and 'not wanting to' (resistance)"" ( [31] p.873). This finding mirrors results of our parallel public health policy implementation paper which reported a key theme as, ""you've told me what, now tell me how"" [6] . A balance is needed that allows for tailoring of policies to local contexts along with the provision of resources and supports to facilitate implementation.

In relation to the component adoption by individuals, Greenhalgh and colleagues [23] argue that being engaged in discourse around the innovation can help increase the meaning that is attached to the innovation. This has been found to influence uptake by individuals [23] . Further, when individuals' ascribed meaning of the innovation matches how senior management and other stakeholders understand it, this can result in better uptake [22, 23, 32, 33] . It is likely that staff involvement in policy development as well as active discussions around it during implementation, enhanced the meaning attached to the policy. It also increased its perceived advantage. A longitudinal case study involving two Swedish national evidence-based policies aimed at improving health and social care indicated that active involvement and dialogue of professional organizations (stakeholders) during policy development allowed for a quick implementation start up, and improved the chances for a positive response from the target group [34] . Normalization process theory also highlights the importance of individuals' understanding the meaning of the innovation, known as coherence [32, 33] . The authors argue that this can influence implementation and uptake of practice innovations and was demonstrated in our analysis through participants' critical reflection on the policy's implications for practice and communities.

Greenhalgh et al. [23] also drew on strong indirect evidence from work by Hall and Hord [35] . They showed that if participants understand the consequences of the intervention, they will more likely adopt it. In contrast, participants in our study were unclear about the consequences of not meeting the policy standards. Many felt there were none or that consequences would be tied to funding. Despite this lack of clarity, many were aware that accountability agreements were soon to be released that would clarify expectations related to meeting the standards. This points to a relationship between factors in the outer setting (i.e., accountability and consequences) and adoption by individuals. Similarly, in a Swedish case study of a national public health policy implemented in two municipalities, Jansson, Fosse and Tillgren [36] reported that that the policy lacked relevance to their context, was not targeted to local needs, and lacked specific requirements. Engaging staff in discussions and communicating information related to consequences surrounding public policy during implementation appears to be important to improve uptake.

Diffusion and dissemination is another component in the model which has been shown to influence implementation [23] . As noted earlier, a number of public health service providers were unaware of the new policy despite senior and middle managers' attempts to communicate them to staff. This was reported to a greater and lesser extent depending on the health unit. Many providers felt that policy implementation was a management responsibility, while they were charged with service delivery. This meant that the policy held little meaning in their workload for many front line staff, which influenced their degree of interest in learning about it. It is not surprising then that most managers and service providers who were either engaged with Ministry staff in developing the policy or provided feedback during its development felt particularly engaged and positive about their experiences. Others have found that government policy implementation at the municipal level was successful when it was desired and understood and there were resources provided to support implementation [36] .

The outer context is another critically important consideration in the model [23] . For example, the structure and quality of social networks were identified as a powerful influences on adoption of innovations [23] . Health unit staff often described the value of working with other regional and provincial networks to support their public health work. In this study, horizontal networks of peers were found to be supportive for program implementation, in particular for tobacco programs, as a positive ""intentional spread strategy"" [23] p. 609. Similarly, Greenhalgh et al. [23] noted that informal interorganizational networks such as homophilous networks or networked provider agencies that share a common management and governance structure can influence implementation. Related to the value of networks, a notable area that was identified in our results was the influence of external community partnerships with other sectors, such as primary care and schools. Input from and influence of these community partners was a significant factor influencing implementation of the OPHS. This is likely related to the value placed on collaborations and partnerships as a foundational principle in the OPHS [5] .

Himmelman argues that collaborations demand much more in terms of shared resources; degree of trust; commitment to a common goal; and sharing of risks, responsibilities and rewards, than do networks [37] . Greenhalgh et al considered collaborations in their review, but noted that they were focused on rapid cycle quality improvement projects rather than the implementation of innovations [22] . Annor and colleagues [38] argue that how individuals and organizations interact with each other should be a major focus in policy implementation. Since a single organization cannot solve complex problems alone, working in collaboration is essential for success. They report on a case study of public mental health policy implementation in England involving local implementation teams to deliver the policy. They reported several challenges in working in collaborations including: a lack of common understanding of key definitions (i.e., mental health), funding projects with existing resources, low priority placed by partners on public mental health initiatives, and the presence of a dominant partner that controlled resources and held power which led to competition between stakeholders.

A qualitative study of implementation of the Ontario School Food and Beverage Policy showed that schools' external partnerships with food suppliers and food industry were critical for successful policy implementation [39] . Strong collaborations with external partners appears to be essential for successful implementation of public health policies. The outer context also takes into account the social-political climate. Although the policy push from the Ministry was felt by those in management, it had less impact on health service providers. However, all participants noted that local politics including municipal budgets and directions from the Board of Health impacted implementation and had an influence on programming decisions. This is not surprising given the funding structure of the majority of public health services in ON is shared between the province (75 %) and the municipality (25 %).

The implementation processes and routinization component of the model involves having senior and middle management and leadership support and commitment to the innovation to influence uptake [23] . Leadership is also noted as an important system antecedent in the model which can help influence receptivity for change in the organization [23] . Alignment with the goals of leaders and the innovation is also important but the evidence for this association is not as strong. Others identify that having leaders set priorities and manage the process of implementation is important [30, 36] . In this study, the role of leaders in policy implementation was critical not only in providing direction for staff, but also in supporting their implementation efforts. Staff had varying opinions on the style of leadership and management approaches. How management styles influenced policy implementation was not clear, however, and deserves more exploration. Medical Officers of Health were seen as having great influence on program and services directions. Not surprisingly, a lack of leadership (a vacancy in senior leadership) or local municipal pressures were seen as a barrier to implementation. This tension was seen in some health units more than others. Participants expected more 'top down' direction and support from their leaders in these health units.

Our study showed that policy implementation was heavily integrated into health unit planning processes. Operational planning and strategic planning documents often referenced the OPHS. Greenhalgh's model [22, 23] does not discuss the influence of planning processes in terms of implementation. However, the process of implementation, including the constructs of planning, engaging, executing, reflecting and evaluating was identified by Damschroder and colleagues [40] as a key domain in their consolidated framework for implementing research into practice. Planning processes were highly apparent influencing implementation in most health units. Planning documents were tied to financial costs and public health human resource allocation. Others have reported value in participating in joint planning processes such as the creation of community health profiles and policy dialogues to support implementation of integrated community plans [41] .

Greenhalgh and colleagues' model does raise the issue of having dedicated and adequate time and resources to implement the innovation as a component of system readiness for innovation [22, 23] . However, adding planning processes as a factor into the model may be warranted especially for highly bureaucratic organizations in which such processes are the norm.

The model discusses the importance of linkage at the design and implementation stage with developers and potential end users of the innovation. Engagement is critical to ensure that everyone's perspectives are considered [23] . The study revealed that staff viewed their involvement in the development of the Ministry policies very positively. Further the Ministry's support and constant feedback through webinars and road shows during the roll out of the policy was greatly appreciated by many participants. The model indicates that support from the change agency, e.g., government, in the form of ongoing dialogue and networking among organizations to support the change can be valuable for uptake as well as the provision of ""augmented product"" support (p. 598) such as a help desk [23] .

Our analysis demonstrated an uneven level of awareness of the OPHS and related documents at the time of roll out. In addition, there was an uneven level of engagement with the policies at the organizational level. Some leaders took an approach that satisfied their obligations for management accountability, e.g., they held staff meetings to discuss the Standards or they retrospectively ensured that their operational plans addressed them. Others, perhaps on account of their personal leadership style, worked in a pro-active manner by incorporating the Standards into organizational strategic plans or by creating a culture where staff felt supported in their implementation of the policies. Langley and Denis [21] suggest that traditional approaches to implementation, as we've presented here using the Greenhalgh et al., model [22] , and perhaps as the Ministry envisioned, can be enhanced with attention to context-specific factors. The authors suggest three focal points: 1) attention to the uneven benefits that might be realized by different stakeholders (""what's in it for whom""), 2) attention to values held by different groups, 3) understanding what is essential (in the policy) and what is in the soft periphery that can be adjusted to the context. A change management strategy could be included in a transition/implementation plan in the next set of standards [42] using a lens that positions health units as political systems rather than rational systems [21] .

Our study strongly draws attention to the importance of ensuring policy cohesiveness to support successful implementation. Some policies are easier to implement than others as they might differ with respect to the degree of change required, resource requirements, complexity of the policy setting, etc. Sometimes the policy itself might have somewhat conflicting objectives, as was the case in our study, making it difficult to implement as intended. Repeatedly we heard that the policy was intended to be responsive to local community needs. Further, the policy explicitly supported collaboration with community agencies (one of the key principles) to promote health and prevent illness, and respondents noted that their community partners sometimes had particular requests from them. These collaborative directions are in line with traditional public health activity. However, the policy also took a stronger evidence-based approach than the previous MHPSG; in other words, health units were asked to carry out reviews of the literature to understand problems and develop programs with demonstrated effectiveness. This direction is in line with the general trend in the larger health sector and in public health to provide health services that are grounded in evidence [31, 34, 43, 44] . Thus both of these objectiveslocal responsiveness and research-based programmingare reasonable in their own right. Taken together, however, many respondents did indeed speak to a practice tension that arose when trying to implement the overall policy related to conflicting values of different forms of evidence. For example, a local demand or problem was not resolved because there was a lack of research literature (a form of evidence) to support an effective solution, or the literature suggested an alternative solution from what partner agencies demanded (community need, which is another form of evidence). Participants clearly felt uncomfortable when local needs could not be met because of a lack of research evidence. In addition, discomfort was felt when local needs were being met, but initiatives fell outside of the scope of the OPHS. An implication for future policy implementation is to ensure greater policy cohesiveness or mechanisms about how to manage these practice conflicts related to the policy.

There are a few limitations that should be noted in reference to this work. We involved six health units that we identified based on their different contexts; however, they may not be representative of all health units in Ontario. In addition, we were not able to engage all health unit staff members equally. For example epidemiologists and planners were underrepresented and these staff would likely have been quite engaged in policy implementation decisions. We did, however, obtain valuable input from public health staff at all levels of authority from service providers to senior leaders. Further, we did not seek input from members of Boards of Health who could have provided unique perspectives on implementation and the policies themselves. We selected CDP and STIP programs as exemplar programs in order to keep the study manageable, to provide a useful comparator and to enhance our ability to track changes over a five year period within a similar cohort. This decision did result in limited knowledge of the influence of the OPHS in other program areas. Despite these limitations, we have obtained rich input from a wide variety of stakeholders in public health including services providers who typically are not asked for their impressions on policy, and are ultimately the ones who provide the programs and services to meet the OPHS. Another strength of this research is that it reflects an integrated knowledge translation approach, where practitioners and policymakers were co-investigators on the research team. Some of them contributed to the writing of this paper. Their additional insights about the data served to bring credibility to our collective interpretation.

This study explored processes and factors influencing implementation of a new provincial public health policy in Ontario, Canada. Although many health unit service providers were unaware of the policy change, engagement in developing the policy or provision of feedback by health unit staff at the front line as well as the management level was positively received. Implementation of the policy was most evident in planning processes that incorporated many internal stakeholders as well as community partners. The policy was also incorporated in operational planning documents such as logic models. Factors influencing implementation were closely aligned to components of Greenhalgh and colleagues' Diffusion of Innovations in Service Organizations framework. Most notably, the nature of the policy itself (e.g., its prescriptiveness), organizational leadership, planning processes, governance, health human resources, local and regional economics, as well as provincial and national factors such as other policies, best practice evidence and networks had an influence on implementation. Our results provide empirical support for components of Greenhalgh et als' framework [23] and suggest that two additional components be consideredthe role of external partnerships with other sectors and the influence of planning processes. The constructsplanning processes and cosmopolitanism (links to external organizations)are identified in the more recent Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research [40] . These influences are important to consider by public health organizations when implementing new or revised provincial public health policies given that they constantly change and evolve over time. The RePHS team will continue to explore changes in policy implementation and impact over time in ON as well as BC.
