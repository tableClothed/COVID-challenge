Public Perception on Healthcare Services: Evidence from Social Media Platforms in China,"Social media has been used as data resource in a growing number of health-related research. The objectives of this study were to identify content volume and sentiment polarity of social media records relevant to healthcare services in China. A list of the key words of healthcare services were used to extract data from WeChat and Qzone, between June 2017 and September 2017. The data were put into a corpus, where content analyses were performed using Tencent natural language processing (NLP). The final corpus contained approximately 29 million records. Records on patient safety were the most frequently mentioned topic (approximately 8.73 million, 30.1% of the corpus), with the contents on humanistic care having received the least social media references (0.43 Million, 1.5%). Sentiment analyses showed 36.1%, 16.4%, and 47.4% of positive, neutral, and negative emotions, respectively. The doctor-patient relationship category had the highest proportion of negative contents (74.9%), followed by service efficiency (59.5%), and nursing service (53.0%). Neutral disposition was found to be the highest (30.4%) in the contents on appointment-booking services. This study added evidence to the magnitude and direction of public perceptions on healthcare services in China's hospital and pointed to the possibility of monitoring healthcare service improvement, using readily available data in social media.","Investigating public perception of healthcare services from different perspectives may generate inconsistent results. For example, patient-initiated violence against health workers [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] , and the tension between doctors and patients for their dissatisfaction with the quality of healthcare [7, 8] , were wildly covered in the Chinese media. While patient experience surveys on the national level showed that patients were generally satisfied with both in-patient and out-patient services [9] . Such differences may result from biases rooted in the survey and media coverage; however, the inconsistency also pointed to the need for additional data sources to monitor public opinions on Chinese healthcare services.

It has been suggested that social media might be such a data source. Rozenblum et al. pointed out that when patient-centered healthcare, the internet, and social media were combined, the current relationship between healthcare providers and consumers might face major changes-thus creating a ""perfect storm"" [10] . Users' posts on the social media platforms would generate a large volume of real-time data regarding public or private issues, among which healthcare related information scatters. Therefore, the utilization of social media data for healthcare research becomes a dramatically growing field and already covered various medical and healthcare research fields [11, 12] . Sinnenberg and colleagues proposed four ways in which social media data were used in healthcare studies:

(1) content analysis, (2) volume surveillance of contents on specific topics, (3) engagement of users with others, and (4) network analysis of users [12] . For the content analysis, most studies focused on measuring public discussion on specific diseases [13] [14] [15] , sentiment analysis for medical interventions (e.g., cancer screening) [16, 17] , identifying safety concerns among health consumers [18] , detecting adverse events of health products [19, 20] . Several researchers studied patient experience, based on the comments posted by patients from online health communities in China [21, 22] , but few studies have been conducted to gather information on healthcare services related topics using social media data. Meanwhile, although sentiment analysis has been wildly applied to process user sentiments associated with health-related text [23] , the lexical resource and tools designed for doing health-related sentiment analysis in Chinese language are few and far between. Fast-advancing in technology and economy, social media users and their activities spiked in China, which made social media a promising source for healthcare service monitoring. In China, the internet penetration rate reached 55.8% at the end of 2017 [24] , with local providers dominating the market, rather than Facebook and Twitter, which are not accessible in China. Chinese social media sites have a unique landscape, and it may not only be used as a communication software but also as an entry point for information. As subsidiaries of Tencent Holdings Limited, Shenzhen, China, WeChat and Qzone are two leading social media and networking services platforms. Each of them reached more than 938 million and 632 million monthly active user accounts in the first quarter of 2017 [25] . According to the 2016 WeChat Data Report, typical users of WeChat were born in the 80s or 90s [26], representing a wide breadth of demographic group in China. Besides providing multimedia communication and supporting social networking, WeChat also has ""Official Accounts"", which serve as channels for publishing articles to the public. Any individual or organization can apply for having their own official account to broadcast their ideas and believes. As for Qzone, it is a platform bundled with QQ, a popular online messaging application in China. Qzone allows users to create their own personal page to write blogs and post updates. And users could be able to express their individual opinions and attitudes freely and instantly on the social media platforms. Subject to the platforms' terms of service and privacy policy agreed upon by users [27, 28] , three kinds of information were collected, stored, and used by the platforms: (1) Personal information;

(2) non-personal information; and (3) shared information. The shared information refers to information that is voluntarily shared on the platforms by users freely and instantly, thus providing a valuable perspective and opportunity to gather public opinions on healthcare services.

As such, we selected WeChat and Qzone as the social media platforms to conduct this exploratory study. The objectives of this study are to conduct volume and sentiment analyses base on the extracted social media contents on hospital healthcare services. The study could demonstrate the social media users' perceptions of hospitals healthcare and may shed light on the further utilization of social media as a data source for healthcare research in China.

This study consisted of three phases. Firstly, we utilized a predefined list of healthcare services categories to devise key words and search strategies accordingly. The data searching strategy would then be used to extract contents from a raw database, which contained publicized posts of WeChat and Qzone. The extracted materials were then put into a corpus. Secondly, we applied natural language processing (NLP) techniques from Tencent NLP platform to the corpus and calculated the volume of content concerning different healthcare services topics. Thirdly, we conducted sentiment analysis to explore the sentiment polarity of Chinese social media users on different healthcare service topics. The detailed process of data collection and analysis is presented in Figure 1 

The raw databases used for this study come from WeChat and Qzone of the version only operated in mainland China. The user volumes and data inclusion criteria of the platforms were showed in Table 1 . Publicly available posted information such as: posted blogs, reviews and articles that are voluntarily shared by individual users from June 2017 to September 2017 were collected from the two platforms. The data collection followed the privacy policy for users of Tencent and was subject to the confidentiality and security measures that implemented by the platforms. And the data analyses were supported by technicians in the Tencent. 

The nine healthcare service categories, used in this study, were derived from the objectives of the National Healthcare Service Improvement Initiative (2015-2017), which was dedicated to improving patient-centered healthcare and patient experience nationwide by the former National Health and Family Planning Commission of P.R. China (NHFPC) [29] . The initiative operated under the leadership of the Bureau of Medical Administration of NHFPC [30] , which suggested that we used nine predefined categories to reflect the healthcare services in hospital (see Table 2 ). Table 2 . Healthcare services categories and corresponding descriptions in the National Healthcare Service Improvement Initiative 2015-2017 (NHSII).

Objectives of NHSII

Optimize the layout of the facility and build a friendly service environment Appointment-booking service Promote utilization of clinical appointment services and guide patient flow Service efficiency Improve service efficiency and effectiveness by rational allocation of resources Information technology Take advantage of information technology to improve patient experience Inpatient service Promote inpatient service process reengineering and provide integrated healthcare service Nursing service Continuously improve quality of nursing care and enhance nursing workforce Patient safety Ensure patient safety by promoting adoption of standard operating procedures Humanistic care

Strengthen humanistic care and provide medical social worker service Doctor-patient relationship Harmonize the doctor-patient relationship and reduce medical disputes

In this study, we constructed a healthcare services corpus, in the Chinese language from the social media data source, to enable further analyses. First, we constructed lexica of keywords and terms in accordance with the predefined service topics. For example, the lexicon for ""Information technology"", used in this study indicate new information dissemination channels, based on information technology provided by hospital to improve patient experience of service information acquisition. And this lexicon contains six information technology service-related terms, namely, ""Weibo"", ""WeChat"", ""website"", as well as ""Self-service machine"". Second, we developed a set of searching strategy to extract the relevant data from the two sources based on the corresponding lexicon of topics. The entire list of search terms for each category and its corresponding searching strategy were provided in Supplementary  Table S1 . Finally, we applied the search strategies to the database of publicly posted materials to screen for posts related to the healthcare service categories to construct the corpus. The search and screening process were performed by Qcloud.

Based on the healthcare services corpus, we classified the content to different healthcare services topics that predefined and measured the content volume of the topic. Specifically, we used the open application programming interface (OpenAPI) services provided by Tencent NLP to analyze the retrieved contents. It is an open platform for Chinese natural language processing (based on parallel computing and distributed crawling system) [31] . Such services enable us to split reviews and blogs into sentences, and each sentence was filtered to classify whether it contained target service topic keywords and terms. If the sentences, containing certain keywords and terms, belonged to the corresponding topic of healthcare services categories as listed in Table S1 , then they would be divided into a certain category. By counting the appearances of each service topic keywords in terms of the number of sentences in the corpus, we can aggregate the counts at the topic level and calculate the proportion of different topics from the social media corpus. For the sentiment analysis tool in Chinese, we also select Tencent NLP, as its algorithm was trained by hundreds of billions of entries of internet corpus data in Chinese and with successful application in other Tencent products (https://nlp.qq.com). OpenAPI with function of Chinese batch texts automatic summarization and sentiment analysis of Tencent NLP enable us to categorize the sentences on certain topic in the social media corpus into a sentiment polarity classification (i.e., neutral, positive, and negative). Finally, each sentence was tagged and classified into different sentiment polarity.

The social media corpus contained approximately 29 million records from WeChat and Qzone, spanning the 9 pre-defined categories, related to hospital healthcare services. Table 3 presents the content volume of each healthcare services topic by social media channel. Among the social media content on healthcare services topics, patient safety was the most commonly encountered topic, both in WeChat and Qzone. The majority of the content related to patient safety issue, its approximately 8.73 million records and covered 30.1% of the entire corpus. The proportion of contents related to other topics varied in the corpus: Information technology (22.2%), service efficiency (17.9%), service environment (10.3%), inpatient service (9.6%), appointment-booking service (3.4%), nursing service (2.5%), doctor-patient relationship (2.5%), and humanistic care (1.5%). 

The results of the sentiment analysis of contents from the corpus found that, in all nine healthcare services topics, 36.1% of the contents in the corpus have been recognized to reveal a positive disposition, 16 .4% neutral and 47.4% negative. We found that topic comprising most positive contents was service environment (59.6%), followed by patient safety (53.2%). With regard to the topics that contained more negative contents than positive, the most one was doctor-patient relationship (74.9%), followed by service efficiency (59.5%), and nursing service (53.0%). Notably, over one third of contents in the appointment-booking service (30.4%) revealed a neutral disposition.

Additionally, in contrast to the content volume distribution for the nine topics, the sentiment disposition of contents in corresponding healthcare services topics shows differences. For instance, Table 3 shows that the nursing service and doctor-patient relationship share an equal proportion (2.5%) of contents in the corpus, however, we observed the disposition of contents from social media users to the two topics varied in Figure 2 . 

To our knowledge, this is the first study that has attempted to explore the public perceptions of healthcare services, using publicly posted materials, of two Chinese social media platforms. Our results showed that patient safety was the most significant topic for users of Chinese social media platforms, followed by information technology and service efficiency. Service environment was found to have the highest proportion of positive comments.

The research assessed the application of content volume calculation and sentiment analyses on Chinese social media data. The study is a crucial step to discovering the methodology on harnessing the social media data in China and an early attempt to track the perceptions of healthcare services in the public by analyzing a unique data source.

This study found a large number of information technology and service efficiency, which might reflect the series of efforts made by both the government and the hospital in integrating information technology in healthcare services in China. Several researchers have identified that health information technology services were used to enhance patient experience [32] [33] [34] , and as a potential solution to shorten the lengthy waiting time in China's public hospital [22, [35] [36] [37] .

Humanistic care was the least mentioned topic in the corpus complied by this study. It may suggest that Chinese social media users are not very familiar with the idea of humanistic care. Those who posted about it basically expressed a positive attitude. An alternative explanation might be this type of care has yet to reach the public only experienced by a few people. Further empirical studies or controlled studies may be conducted to provide further insights.

Our research also explored the sentiment disposition of social media content on healthcare services: 47.4% provided negative feedback. Although this was only the initial results, it could be quite alarming to healthcare administrations and policymakers. Despite the fact that patient surveys generally had favorable results in China [9] , there was still a significant amount of negative comments

Although this was only the initial results, it could be quite alarming to healthcare administrations and policymakers. Despite the fact that patient surveys generally had favorable results in China [9] , there was still a significant amount of negative comments on the social media platforms. Further and more detailed methodology is necessary to further understand the negative comments.

In the 9 topics investigated in this study, we found huge variations in the negative feedback as well as content volumes across topics. For instance, the contents related to doctor-patient relationship only take percentage of 2.5% in the corpus, however 74.9% of the content revealed negative feedback. The varied sentiment polarity distribution of the topics may have important policy implications for healthcare reform in China. For example, 30.4% of the social media references to appointment-booking service reflected neutral feedback, which may suggest that the unsureness of the public on this novel service.

Patients have yet to be familiar with the services-even though it certainly aims to improve the convenience for patients as well as hospital efficiency. Such feedback could be essential for hospitals to improve their service quality by enhancing patient education. Further research might focus on what exactly were discussed in those negative posts so that targeted measures can be employed by the hospitals and responsible administrators to improve the services.

In line with previous evidence [11, 12] , our results show that social media could be a useful tool for health research in China, as well as English, and could be used to capture the public's perspective of healthcare [23, 38] . However, it appeared that the most concerned issue of healthcare in social media is different from what has been found in patient surveys. Findings from a recent qualitative study found that patients cared about the environment and facilities in hospital the most [39] , whereas in our study patient safety issues had the greatest volume. Another research examined the online doctor reviews in China revealed that most posts expressed positive attitudes towards the physicians [21] . Although the evidence on these issues are still not conclusive, it might suggest the perception difference between general public and patients.

Our research extends application of the natural language processing techniques to analysis of healthcare services related contents in China's social medial platforms and offers a new perspective of healthcare services in China's hospital. The results would be of benefit to healthcare providers and regulators benchmarking their performance on patient-centered healthcare delivery. This is important because the social media has been considered as a portal of health information acquisition for Chinese netizens [40] , the perspective of social media would be supplementary in understanding how consumer views the healthcare services in hospital besides the results from traditional paper-based surveys.

This study has the following limitations. First, because the raw material was user-generated data, selection bias may have affected the data. For example, it was observed that most social media users were born in the 80 s or 90 s [26], however we were unable to characterize the users social-demographic information in detail, since the user privacy policy of Tencent currently prohibit such practice. Moreover, considering the exploratory nature of the study, our study focused only on WeChat and Qzone as data sources, whereas other social media platforms in China may have the potential to conduct such analyses as well.

Second, since we derived the healthcare services categories and lexica based on the government document on NHSII and expert consultation, thus the corpus in this study may have failed to include certain amount of healthcare services related data. As a result, we may have underestimated the content volume of healthcare services from the two social media platforms. Furthermore, although all the material in the databases are in Chinese, and therefore most likely be generated by users from China, we are currently not able to determine whether the posts, containing the key terms on healthcare, were describing the Chinese healthcare system or discussing foreign healthcare systems in Chinese language. Further research may strive to develop searching strategies that enable such distinction and increase the specificity of the results.

Third, although the consumer health vocabulary (CHV) is the gold standard reference for retrieving the target data, it has been used in previous researches [13, 38] , such open source of vocabulary list and its corresponding lexica are not available in Chinese language. The accuracy and credibility of the sentiment analysis of this study also await further validation; however, it would require an alternative method to conduct sentiment analyses for Chinese language and the possibility to apply such methods on the Tencent data, which were publicly posted material but still under strict terms of utilization. Another limitation concerned that we have no ability to confirm that the data supplied by Tencent completely represent all users' data as there could be undocumented keyword filter on the platforms. These would inflict potential bias and limit the generalizability of our findings.

Weibo is another popular Chinese social media platform considered to be the counterpart of Twitter in China. Future research could consider extend the analysis process to contents from Weibo, to further explore users, and their views, that have not been covered in this study.

Both the quantitative approach, as shown in our research, and the qualitative approach, such as the face-to-face individual interview method, would be useful to better understand consumer care in healthcare services. There is a scarcity of empirical research exploring the latter issue at present. It has been proposed to complement public perspectives on healthcare services [39] .

Furthermore, the popularity of consumers' unsolicited comments on healthcare providers in social media, prompts an important avenue for understanding patient experience, and has been demonstrated by previous researches [38, [41] [42] [43] [44] . Future research for measuring patient experience based on social media data at hospital level would be help to better understand the landscape of healthcare quality in China.

By analyzing shared information from WeChat and Qzone, this study showed that patient safety was the most concerned topic for users of Chinese social media platform, followed by information technology and service efficiency, while the doctor-patient relationship was found to have the highest proportion of negative comments. This study explored the possibility of utilizing social media to monitor public perceptions on healthcare services. The findings provide an overview of public opinion on healthcare services, which could help regulators to set up the benchmark, on a national or regional level, to monitor the progress of healthcare improvements between comparator districts and services domains. It is also a necessary complement to the traditional paper-based consumer survey. The potential differences between social media perception and traditional consumer survey results would help regulators better understand the gap in quality of care services from various perspectives. Further studies could also focus on extending the NLP method to a more content-based resource and to expand our understanding of mass opinion on healthcare services.

Collaborative accountability for sustainable public health: A Korean perspective on the effective use of ICT-based health risk communication,"The sustainability of public health practices requires collaboration between the government and its citizens. On the government's side, social media can provide a conduit for communicating health risk information in an effective and timely fashion, while also engaging citizens in informed decision-making. On the citizen's side, information communication technology (ICT)-based practices cannot function unless citizens recognize and act on their responsibility to actively engage with government social media platforms. Despite an increasing interest in understanding the adoption of ICT practices and e-government services for health risk communication, there remains a crucial need for a comprehensive framework to explain which factors determine citizen use of digital government resources. The purpose of this study is to investigate how to increase government accountability for motivating citizens to engage in ICT-based health risk communication, thereby attaining sustainable public health practices through collaborative governance.","The sustainability of public health practices requires collaboration between the government and its citizens. On the government's side, social media can provide a conduit for communicating health risk information in an effective and timely fashion, while also engaging citizens in informed decision-making. On the citizen's side, information communication technology (ICT)-based practices cannot function unless citizens recognize and act on their responsibility to actively engage with government social media platforms. Despite an increasing interest in understanding the adoption of ICT practices and e-government services for health risk communication, there remains a crucial need for a comprehensive framework to explain which factors determine citizen use of digital government resources. The purpose of this study is to investigate how to increase government accountability for motivating citizens to engage in ICT-based health risk communication, thereby attaining sustainable public health practices through collaborative governance.

By integrating trust and health risk information into the e-government adoption model (GAM), this research examines factors that influence citizens' likelihood of using government social media resources. Survey data from 700 Korean citizens were analyzed using structural equation modeling. The results indicated that individuals with higher social media competency are more likely to (a) seek risk information through social media and (b) perceive the government's social media sites as easy to use. Consistent with the GAM, intentions to use the government's social media sites for information and interactions appear to increase as citizens perceive more value in using them regarding information quality, ease of use, functional benefit, and security. Furthermore, perceived trust in the government's social media resources appears to function as a mediator of this process. Initial trust in the government is an important determinant of perceptions of its digital resources. Citizens who trust the government tend to evaluate new initiatives positively and are more likely to accept and make use of them.

The results of this study can inform policy design and implementation by elucidating the mechanisms that determine citizens' adoption and usage of digital government services. Theoretically, this work expands the GAM to include health risk communication and adds empirical evidence to the small yet growing body of knowledge of e-government initiatives. These findings also highlight the importance of public trust in the government, as this encourages citizens to seek health risk information and assistance from the government. Overall, the data and model generated in this investigation represent an important step toward the successful and sustainable modernization of public services.

Information-communication technology (ICT) can help governments and their citizens collaborate toward achieving sustainable public health practices. While public health is simply a collection of individual citizens' health, it can be influenced by, mental and physical, individual and collective, and social and environmental factors. For example, maintaining physical health begins with an individual's mental awareness of hygienic concerns; however, individual awareness alone is insufficient. This is because even an individual citizen's health https://doi.org/10.1016/j.giq.2018.12.008 Received 6 March 2018; Received in revised form 7 December 2018; Accepted 30 December 2018 citizens' decision-making in terms of adopting a new technology-driven government system, such as public health risk communication, on government social media sites.

On the one hand, this research provides a blueprint and directions for what determines citizens' participation in and collaboration with government's public health risk communication on social media sites, which may inform researchers, policymakers, and public officials of critical determinants that affect the cognitive, affective, and conative aspects of citizen's willingness to use government-led ICT services and solutions. On the other hand, this research offers managerial insight into how governments can be more accountable and better help citizens fulfill their responsibility using ICT-based health risk communication. Taken together, these efforts facilitate sustainable public health practices in the social media-based public governance era. Given the rapid proliferation and widespread use of social media by government agencies, this study illustrates which policy instruments and transformation strategies should be implemented both by the governed and those governing to enhance public accountability and the effective governance of health risk communication in this new ICT-driven governance ecosystem.

Toward this end, South Korea represents a well-suited study site because the Korean government has committed to developing citizencentered and public value-based e-government and collaborative governance using innovative ICT policies and services in the 4th industrial revolution (Eom & Kim, 2014; Sohn, 2017) . Moreover, most of the Korean public health agencies and government healthcare organizations already heavily use social media platforms, apps, and networks as cost-effective and convenient means toward spreading information, practices, and solutions concerning personal and community health initiatives since the 2015 Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) outbreak in South Korea. Therefore, this locale and its government serve as the foundation for the present investigation into the design and implementation of effective, sustainable ICT practices using social media in the public health sector.

""Accountability underpins civilization"" (Donahue, 2002, p.1) . As long as a service is called ""public"" and is provided by the government, like social media-based health information provision, it is accompanied by the concept of accountability, which assumes a ""principal-agent"" relationship. Although there are numerous definitions of accountability, we can generally agree, ""Accountability is about explanation and justification to a forum with the possibility of sanctions as a result"" (Hughes, 2012, p.187) . Accountability is the ""relationship between an actor and a forum, in which the actor has an obligation to explain and to justify his or her conduct, the forum can pose questions and pass judgment, and the actor may face consequences"" (Bovens, 2007) . Following this definition, the actor is an individual or organization, and the forum is individual or institution; the obligation is formal or informal, and the questions and judgment lead to either a negative or a positive consequence.

Comparing the two similar concepts of responsibility and accountability, Mosher (1968) described objective responsibility as ""the responsibility of a person or an organization to someone else, outside of self, for something or some kind of performance. It is closely akin to accountability or answerability,"" (p.7) and subjective responsibility as feeling responsible and behaving responsibly in a cultural and social context. Hughes (2012) differentiated between accountability and responsibility using organizational hierarchy. He argued that a staff member is accountable to a superior, whereas every superior is responsible for the actions of his or her subordinates. In sum, despite the various attempts to distinguish between accountability and responsibility, their differences are not always clear, and the two terms are often interchangeable. Still, the common argument on accountability prescribes the existence of at least two parties, in which one party expects the other to act beneficially and to not do something harmful (Hughes, 2012; Mulgan, 2000; O'Loughlin, 1990; Romzek & Dubnick, 1994; Saltzstein, 1992) .

Citizens should (and want to) be protected from health risks. However, who is accountable for public health? Based on the condition of accountability, individual citizens are socially responsible and accountable to one another, because everyone is closely connected to and influenced by each other's health. We are all expected to maintain our health. Otherwise, we place the burden of caring for ourselves onto others. In other words, public health has an aspect of externality. Citizens should protect themselves from health risks, both individually and collectively. However, because of the externality of the health problem, citizens also empower and require the government to protect them from health risks through public health policies.

Using social media as a communication platform is one way that government fulfills its accountability for public health (Graham et al., 2015) . Governments are supposed to satisfy four types of accountability (Romzek & Dubnick, 1987; Romzek & Ingraham, 2000) : (1) hierarchical accountability to obey organizational directives; (2) legal accountability to comply with external mandates; (3) professional accountability to defer to individual judgment and expertise; and (4) political accountability to be responsive to key external stakeholders. Among the four, public sector reform has placed great emphasis on professional and political accountability (Romzek, 2000) . Regarding public health, governments are accountable for providing risk communication to more citizens, for example, in this day and age, by using ICT. Simply put, citizens and governments have their own accountabilities regarding the mitigation of public health problems.

Citizens and governments often collaborate in order to get more or better policy resources and outcomes such as information, legitimacy, and productivity (Donahue & Zeckhauser, 2011) . To facilitate this collaboration, governments can use various forms of communication with its citizens: unilateral informing, bilateral consultation, involvement, collaboration, and empowerment (IAP2, 2007) . Specifically, ""collaborative governance"" is often referred to as a special form of the principal-agent relationship in which the government acts as the principal and private players (e.g., contractors or volunteers) act as the agent (Donahue & Zeckhauser, 2011) . However, the concept of collaborative governance is insufficient to describe the collaboration between governments and citizens, because their roles are often mixed between principal and agent. Collaboration in the ""agency relationship"" (Hughes, 2012) rather implies a mutually accountable relationship between citizens and governments.

In the context of health, how are risks assessed and addressed? Generally speaking, risks are managed by following a prescribed process (Crouhy, Galai, & Mark, 2006 ) that includes the following steps:

(1) identify the problem or risk exposure; (2) measure and assess risk exposure and its effects; (3) find and evaluate instruments and facilities to shift or trade risks; and (4) form and adopt risk mitigation strategies to avoid, transfer, and contain the risks. In health risk management, there is a spectrum of citizen participation (Donahue & Zeckhauser, 2011) . Examples include (1) enabling patient and family decisionmaking, (2) enabling community decision-making, (3) encouraging public work such as volunteer coordination, (4) gathering input and data on health, (5) connecting and sharing networks, and (6) disseminating health information.

In combining the discussion above of accountability and risk management, one can identify several challenges regarding citizen accountability in public health. The first challenge is the citizens' selfprotection. Every citizen is expected to have a sense of responsibility toward him-or herself, as well as toward the community; this responsibility should lead to health risk information-seeking behavior (Lee, Hoti, Hughes, & Emmerton, 2015; Medlock et al., 2015) . The second challenge is about the citizens' voice. Because of the externality of health problems, citizens usually shift the accountability of protecting themselves from health risks to their government. Furthermore, they want to (or should) keep interacting with their government to put their voices into policy (Barg et al., 2017; Li, Abelson, Giacomini, & Contandriopoulos, 2015) . The third challenge involves co-production between citizens and government. Citizens are increasingly becoming co-producers with their governments for public values (Alford, 2009) . When it comes to health risk communication using ICT, the citizens who use ICT media are expected to act (or be well prepared to act) as not only information recipients but also information producers or disseminators (Moorhead et al., 2013; Park, Reber, & Chon, 2016) . The fourth challenge concerns citizens' utilization of health-related services. No matter how good an ICT-based public service is, if citizens choose not to use it due to any number of reasons (e.g., ignorance, digital literacy, accessibility, service quality, trust, security concerns) the implementation of policy through this form of civic engagement would be far from successful.

ICT-based health risk communication systems operated by the government should meet the challenges above. With this in mind, the current study employed variables that help address the challenges, based on the theoretical lens of the e-government adoption model (GAM) that incorporates determinants of adopting ICT-based health risk services. In other words, these variables allowed us to explore the answer to the question: How can government better facilitate citizen accountability for public health? Additionally, this investigation considered the factors behind citizens' acceptance and adoption of ICTbased health risk communication services. The variables, theoretical rationales, and models are specified in the following section.

A tendency to seek risk information may lower barriers to adopting innovation for risk management purposes, as information seeking serves as a coping strategy for risk reduction (Golant, 2017; ter Huurne, Griffin, & Gutteling, 2009 ). Previous scholars have found that more exposure to medical information and health-related training leads to information seeking using various sources (Hall, Bernhardt, & Dodd, 2015; Kelly, Sturm, Kemp, Holland, & Ferketich, 2009; Kim & Kwon, 2010) . Furthermore, those with more sources of information reported higher levels of self-reliance when making health-related decisions (Hall et al., 2015) . Information-seeking behavior is part of the effort to cope with information insufficiency, which positively influences the adoption of new communication technology (Golant, 2017) . In other words, individuals with a higher tendency to seek information are inclined to seek more sources of information and try a communication tool that best fits their need for efficient information acquisition. Thus, we posit the following hypothesis: H1. Individuals with higher tendencies to seek risk information will be more likely to use the government's social media sites for (a) obtaining risk information and (b) engaging in interactions with the government for risk preparation. Shareef et al. (2011) proposed the GAM theoretical approach to explain and predict the adoption behavior of e-government services. Based on GAM, the present study considers the perceived ease of use as a perceptual determinant of adoption. Perceived ease of use was originally referred to as the perceived ability to use by Shareef et al. (2011) , but its conceptualization and operationalization when focused on perceptions of e-government websites is best described in terms of T.D. Lee et al. Government Information Quarterly 36 (2019) 226-236 ease of use. Thus, this study uses the modified concept of perceived ease of use instead of Shareef et al.'s (2011) original description. The easier and more effortless people perceive the use of a new technology to be, the more likely they are to use it (Davis, 1989) . A positive relationship between perceived ease of use and adoption behavior is well documented in the literature (Hung, Tang, Chang, & Ke, 2009; Ozkan & Kanat, 2011; Wirtz, Piehler, & Daiser, 2015) . Perceived information quality and perceived functional benefit are key factors that lead users to adopt ICT-based government services. These two concepts imply that people who believe new technology will provide useful information and help them complete tasks efficiently tend to accept the technology and make use of it (Shareef et al., 2011) . Perceptions of usefulness, regarding information quality and task completion, have been reported to play a considerable role in the adoption of information technologies (Oliveira, Faria, Thomas, & Popovič, 2014; Ozkan & Kanat, 2011; Wirtz et al., 2015) . Another important aspect of ICT-based services that encourages adoption behavior is the security of a system. Perceived security refers to the degree to which users perceive that a technology ensures the security of personal information and uses their information appropriately (Shareef et al., 2011) . Problems related to user privacy are considerable barriers that hinder the success of new information technology (Gilbert, Balestrini, & Littleboy, 2004) . Thus, security provisions should be ensured for citizens considering the use of ICT-based government services (Bertot, Jaeger, & Hansen, 2012) . The perception that a technology is secure and safe to use relates positively to the usage of that technology (Shareef et al., 2011; Venkatesh, Chan, & Thong, 2012) . Based on the theoretical background and empirical evidence discussed above, we hypothesize:

H2. Individuals with favorable perceptions of ease of use, information quality, functional benefit, and security will be more likely to use the government's social media sites for (a) obtaining risk information and (b) engaging in interactions with the government for risk preparation.

Social media competency is a prerequisite condition for seeking risk information from these sources (Cheng & Mitomo, 2017; Lallmahomed, Lallmahomed, & Lallmahomed, 2017; Wirtz et al., 2015) . By adopting the conceptualization of the internet's self-efficacy established by Eastin and LaRose (2000) , this study defines social media competency as the degree to which a person is confident in his or her ability to perform tasks on social media required to meet given communication goals. Previous research suggests that higher levels of social media competency lead to increased perceptions of usefulness and ease of use with a new application (Cheng & Mitomo, 2017; Slade, Dwivedi, Piercy, & Williams, 2015) . Thus, we propose the following two hypotheses:

H3. Individuals with higher levels of social media competency will be more likely to seek risk information using these platforms.

H4. Individuals with higher levels of social media competency will be more likely to perceive the government's social media sites as easy to use.

Trust in the government is an influential factor that encourages citizens to adopt online ICT-based government services because trust in the service provider serves as a contextual cue to assess the benefits and effectiveness of using a new application (Alsajjan & Dennis, 2010) . Lack of trust in the government hinders the adoption of e-government services by its citizens (Fakhoury & Aubert, 2015; Lallmahomed et al., 2017; Park, Choi, Kim, & Rho, 2015) . Increased trust in the government, however, leads citizens to perceive government services positively and thus bolsters faith in these services (Gefen, Karahanna, & Straub, 2003) . Trust in the services that the government offers on social media, in turn, is expected to promote intentions to use them for information acquisition and interactions with the government for better task achievement (Shareef et al., 2011) . This line of reasoning leads to the following hypotheses:

H5. Individuals with higher levels of trust in the government will be more likely to perceive the government's social media sites for risk preparation positively in terms of (a) ease of use, (b) information quality, (c) functional benefit, and (d) security.

H6. Trust in the government's social media sites will mediate the influences of perceptions of those sites (such as ease of use, information quality, functional benefit, and security) on intentions to use them for (a) obtaining risk information and (b) engaging in interactions with the government for risk preparation.

H7. Intention to use the government's social media sites for obtaining risk information will relate positively to one's intention to use the sites for engaging in interactions with the government for risk preparation.

The Korean government has been increasing its use of mobile devices (e.g., smartphones) and social media sites/platforms (e.g., Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Instagram) to enhance government information availability, provide innovative government services, strengthen the informed and dialogical relationships with the public for democratic practices and public value creation. Therefore, a variety of digital government services and smart technologies on public safety and healthcare promotion are fully generalized in Korean society (Korea Institute for Health and Social Affairs, 2012; Rana et al., 2017) . In this study, we employed a professional market research company specialized in panel data research on public health, public hygiene, and healthcare, in order to ensure the representativeness and validity of the study. The research company conducted quota sampling, based on the Korean Population and Housing Census 2017, and extracted 1050 respondents who have received or/and consulted the information on public health from the e-government services through government websites and smartphone application. As a result, this company recruited 1050 citizens based on their availability, not by exploiting screening questions. Among them, 700 participants answered the surveyan approximately 67% response rate.

The mean age of the participants was 42 years (SD = 12.1), and 355 of them were male (50.7%). More than half of the respondents held a bachelor's degree (51.6%) or higher (9.0%); the remaining participants had earned either an associate degree (16.6%,) a high school diploma (22.6%), or had completed a middle-school education (0.3%). Table 1 contains details on the sample population's characteristics.

Participants received an invitation through email to complete a survey at their convenience. The questionnaire began with demographic questions, such as sex and age. Respondents then answered questions that measured the study variables, including social media competency, risk information-seeking behavior, perceptions of the government's social media accounts and intentions to use them. The entire survey required approximately 20 min to complete.

The ability to use social media was measured using five items taken from Wirtz et al.'s (2015) Internet Competence Scale. All of the items in this study were rated on a 7-point Likert scale. The items were ""I feel confident when using social media and applications,"" ""I am comfortable when using social media and applications on my own,"" ""I am able to use social media and applications well on my own,"" ""I am able to use social media and applications even if there is nobody around to help me,"" and ""I feel confident and competent finding information by using search functions on social media"" (M = 3.59, SD = 0.79, α = 0.94) ( Table 2) . 

To measure citizen's trust in their government, we constructed an instrument based on previous research (Griffin et al., 2008; Lallmahomed et al., 2017; Park et al., 2015) . Eleven items were used for this measure, including ""I feel that the government does its best for people"" and ""I feel that the government performs its task with honesty and integrity"" (M = 2.78, SD = 0.77, α = 0.95) ( Table 2) .

Participants' risk information-seeking behavior was measured by six items (Griffin et al., 2008; ter Huurne et al., 2009) , including ""When the topic of health risks such as infectious diseases comes up, I try to learn more about the causes and preventive measures"" and ""When this topic comes up, I'm likely to tune it out"" (M = 4.70, SD = 0.61, α = 0.83) ( Table 3) .

To assess participants' perceptions of the ease of use of the government's social media sites, a seven-item scale was adapted from Shareef et al.'s (2011 ) GAM model. Shareef et al. (2011 developed this scale to measure ""perceived ability to use"" (p. 20), although the scale items focused more on perceived quality of the government's website than on perceptions of one's ability to use it. We modified this scale to measure perceived ease of use. For example, ""It is easy to find needed information on the government's social media sites,"" ""Interactions with the government through social media are clear and understandable,"" and ""The government's social media sites provide all relevant information necessary to fulfill my needs"" (M = 3.06, SD = 5.78, α = 0.85) ( Table 4) .

To assess perceptions of the quality of information provided on government social media sites, three items were adapted from Shareef et al. (2011) : ""Information provided at the government's social media sites is up to date,"" ""The government's social media sites provide accurate information about the services the government provides,"" and ""The government's social media sites provide information sequentially and systematically"" (M = 3.15, SD = 0.63, α = 0.80) ( Table 4) . Trust in the government (Griffin et al., 2008; Lallmahomed et al., 2017; Park et al., 2015) I feel that the government does its best for people. Table 3 Descriptive statistics and factor loadings for risk information seeking. 3.2.6. Perceived functional benefit To measure perceived functional benefit of using the government's social media to see health information, the following four items were used: ""The government's social media sites help accomplish tasks more quickly,"" ""It does not take too much time to seek service from the government's social media sites, as compared to traditional government service,"" ""Using the government's social media sites enhances overall efficiency,"" and ""Using the government's social media sites makes it easier to perform tasks"" (M = 3.37, SD = 0.63, α = 0.85). These items were also adopted from Shareef et al. (2011) (Table 4) .

Two items from Shareef et al.'s (2011) scale of perceived security were modified to assess how safe and secure participants feel when using the government's social media sites. Participants rated their agreement with each of the following items: ""The government's social media services are technologically stable"" and ""The government's social media sites have adequate security features"" (M = 3.06, SD = 0.66, α = 0.77) ( Table 4 ).

Perceptions of trust in the government's social media sites were operationalized as credibility and integrity of its social media services. Eight items were adapted from Shareef et al. (2011) , including ""The government's social media services are overall reliable"" and ""The government's social media sites take prompt action when I encounter health risk problems"" (M = 3.03, SD = 0.58, α = 0.90) ( Table 5) .

Based on Shareef et al.'s (2011) scale for the adoption of e-government services, we created six items to measure intentions to use the government's social media platforms for (a) obtaining information and (b) interacting with the government. These two types of adoption intentions were treated as separate variables in the data analysis, as they reflect different forms of communication. Obtaining information pertains more to one-way communication in which the government provides constant updates and relevant risk information using social media (e.g., progress on outbreak containment, availability of vaccines, and possible preventive measures) without receiving any feedback or inquiries from citizens. Interactions with the government describe the two-way communication that occurs through reciprocal dialogues such as commenting on social media posts, having live Twitter chats, and sending direct messages to ask and answer specific questions. Intentions to adopt information services were measured using three items, including ""To obtain information about health-related risks, I would use the government's social media sites"" (M = 3.19, SD = 0.72, α = 0.93). The other two items were used to assess intentions to adopt interactions, including ""To make a query, I would use the government's social media sites"" (M = 3.17, SD = 0.73, α = 0.92) ( Table 5) .

Cronbach's alpha tests for measurement reliability indicated adequate internal consistency among items for each variable, with an alpha value ranging from 0.77 to 0.95. A series of factor analyses also confirmed the reliability and validity of the measurement items. For each variable, all factor loadings were greater than a loading criterion of 0.40, ranging from 0.594 to 0.931 (Harlow, 2014) . Values for individual items that measured the same variable were averaged to create a scale score for data analysis.

We tested the proposed hypotheses (H1 -H7) using path analysis with structural equation modeling in IBM SPSS Amos 23. This approach is superior to running a series of regression analyses because it tests Table 5 Descriptive statistics and factor loadings for trust in government's social media sites and adoption intentions. The government takes full responsibility for any type of insecurity during interaction on social media.

Adoption intentions for information (Shareef et al., 2011) To search/obtain information about health-related risks, I would like to use the government's social media sites. presumed relationships simultaneously, instead of analyzing several causal paths individually, and controls for measurement errors (Zhao, Lynch Jr, & Chen, 2010) . A maximum likelihood estimation was used to obtain path parameters. We ran the initial path analysis, which allowed all variables to relate to all of the other variables. We then removed the insignificant paths from the model and some error variances were modified to co-vary according to the modification indices. These modifications were made one at a time while observing changes to the model fit indices and path estimates. After this model trimming, the goodness-of-fit indices indicated that the developed model fit the data well, χ 2 (16, N = 700) = 52.069, p < 0.001; CFI = 0.990, SRMR = 0.043, RMSEA = 0.057 (see Fig. 1 for the final path model).

According to Hu and Bentler (1999) , structural equation models are valid when the value of the Comparative Fit Index (CFI) equals or exceeds 0.95, the value of the Standardized Root Mean Square Residual (SRMR) is less than or equal to 0.09, and the value of the Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA) is less than or equal to 0.06. Models have an acceptable fit when they meet at least two of these criteria.

The results indicated that risk information seeking was positively associated with intentions to use the government's social media sites for information acquisition (β = 0.12, p < .01). There was no significant direct influence of risk information seeking on intentions to use the government's social media sites for interactions with the government for risk preparation. However, risk information seeking had a positive influence on use intentions for interactions with the government indirectly through use intentions for information acquisition (indirect effect = 0.06). These results support both H1a and H1b (see Table 6 for all direct and indirect effects in the final path model).

Higher perceptions of the ease of use of the government's social media sites resulted in stronger intentions to use those sites for obtaining risk information (β = 0.10, p < 0.05) and interacting with the government (β = 0.12, p < 0.001). Perceived functional benefit also had a direct influence on use intentions for information acquisition (β = 0.16, p < 0.001) and interactions with the government (β = 0.14, p < 0.001). The other two GAM-based variables -perceived information quality and perceived security -did not have a significant direct influence on the two types of use intentions but they appeared to indirectly affect both use intentions through perceived trust in the government's social media sites. Specifically, the indirect influences from perceived information quality on use intentions for information acquisition and interaction were 0.10 and 0.08, respectively. The indirect influences from perceived security were 0.14 and 0.11, respectively. These data serve to support H2a and H2b.

As expected, the results showed that social media competency was positively associated with risk information-seeking behavior (β = 0.27, p < 0.001). In other words, individuals who have more confidence in their abilities to use social media were more likely to use them to seek risk information. Social media competency also appeared to positively associate with perceptions that the government's social media sites are easy to use (β = 0.20, p < 0.001). Additionally, the results revealed that individuals with higher levels of social media competency found the government's social media sites provided benefits in terms of efficiency in completing tasks and finding information (β = 0.23, p < 0.001). These results support H3 and H4.

In support of H5, higher levels of trust in the government led to higher levels of all GAM-based variables: (a) ease of use (β = 0.58, p < 0.001); (b) information quality (β = 0.57, p < 0.001); (c) functional benefit (β = 0.42, p < 0.001); and (d) security (β = 0.51, p < 0.001). These results indicate that, if individuals perceive the government to be trustworthy, they also perceive its social media sites as being easy to use, providing accurate information about potential risks, improving the efficiency of task completion, and possessing adequate security features. These data support H5a through H5d.

Results revealed that perceived trust mediated the influence of site perception, which translated into the intention to use them for risk information acquisition and interactive communication with the government. Specifically, perceived ease of use (β = 0.22, p < 0.001), T.D. Lee et al. Government Information Quarterly 36 (2019) 226-236 perceived information quality (β = 0.18, p < 0.001), perceived functional benefit (β = 0.12, p < 0.001), and perceived security (β = 0.25, p < 0.001) had a positive impact on perceived trust in the government's social media sites. Perceived trust, in turn, positively influenced use intentions for information acquisition (β = 0.57, p < 0.001) and interaction (β = 0.15, p < 0.001). These results thus support H6a and H6b.

Intention to use government social media sites to obtain risk information positively related with use intentions of engaging in interactions with the government for risk preparation (β = 0.50, p < 0.001). This result indicates that individuals who intend to seek risk information using the government's social media resources (i.e., one-way communication) are more likely to adopt and engage in twoway communication with the government for risk management. Thus, H7 is supported.

The ICT-based communication of the public health risk can be successful and sustainable only when the government and the public, including general citizens, patients, care providers, etc., fulfill their accountabilities to engage with the system. While government accountability involves legal, bureaucratic, political, and professional characteristics, citizen accountability centers on deliberative and participative features in the policy process and governance. In other words, fulfilling accountabilities of both parties are complementary to each other. Citizens' active engagement enables citizens not only to acquire information regarding health, wealth, and well-being that is necessary for situational awareness and informed decision-making, but also enables these citizens to provide the government with ample means for better policy design and a provision of appropriate public services (Donahue & Zeckhauser, 2011) . Civic accountability for engagement with the government represents one of the best ways to create a networked community in which citizens feel supported, included, and confident to work toward sustainable development (Orr, Prugh, Renner, Seyle, & King, 2014) . In this respect, this study has identified guiding principles and determining factors behind both government' and citizens' involvement in sustainable public health governance using ICT systems, specifically government social media sites used for health risk communication services.

This study found that citizens are more likely to access and utilize the health risk information provided by the government, and to interact with government entities, when they feel competent in using ICTs, trust their governments, and perceive the system and services to be easy to use, qualified, beneficial, and secure. These findings indicate that understanding the user-oriented variables (e.g. social media competency and trust) and the system-oriented variables (e.g. perceptions of ICTbased government infrastructure and services) is important to facilitae the adoption of a government's digital services for health communication (Liu et al., 2014) . To this end, the primary role of public managers and policymakers is to keep pace with changes that are associated with sociological, psychological, and behavioral features of their end-users, and take these features into account in their ICT policies and e-government services.

Regarding public health risk communication, the government is required to incorporate these user characteristics, such as their technological competence, into the e-government platform. In a time of public health crisis, user-oriented functions may facilitate warning diffusion, situational awareness, informed dialogue, feedback loops, and remedial actions (Mergel, 2016; Zuiderwijk, Janssen, & Dwivedi, 2015) . This study also suggests that e-government practitioners can benefit from their digital communication platform by ensuring its timeliness, usefulness, easy-to-access features, and trustworthiness (Lin, Spence, Sellnow, & Lachlan, 2016; Savoldelli, Codagnone, & Misuraca, 2014) . Regarding the content, governments can identify the most suitable approaches to increase the usefulness of the messages and thereby mitigate public health risk by analyzing the types of information that citizens want or/and need, the preferred format, and the appropriate level of detail. Furthermore, it is important that such e-government services can prevent inaccurate, incomprehensible information, by monitoring the system and adopting filtering tools. As for social media channels, the public health risk communicators should engage in clear, balanced and beneficial approaches to deal with potential emotional responses of the public because social media is a personalized network with subjective norm-based communication infrastructures (Graham et al., 2015; Mergel, 2016) . Furthermore, our study highlights that the ICT competence level of target citizens is a crucial condition for the use of government social media services, which reveals the need to enhance the citizen's media literacy (Lallmahomed et al., 2017; Lin et al., 2011) . To this end, the government can develop various tools for public deliberation and participation, such as media literacy campaigns and project-based learning programs. Such policy measures and educational interventions can improve the overall level of informed preparedness and agile responsiveness of the citizens in case of health risk Ems, 2016) . In this regard, the government can fulfill sustainable health risk communication and management that is not only low-cost but also effective.

The research findings are consistent with previous literature (Dwivedi et al., 2016; Eom & Kim, 2014; Rana et al., 2017; Zuiderwijk et al., 2015) that emphasize the importance of building and maintaining the credibility and public trust of government. While the ICTbased communication practices of the public health risks are likely to encourage citizens' intention to collaborate with the government's efforts to deal with health risks, they can also reduce the spread of rumors and inaccurate information, namely, ""fake news,"" and instead, generate the positive effects of word-of-mouth communication.

This study provides meaningful implications, but its findings may be limited to the context of South Korea or other settings in which culture, political environment, and government systems are similar. To be specific, South Korea is well known for its high level of smartphone penetration, internet performance, and broadband network (Eom & Kim, 2014; Rana et al., 2017) . South Korea is also known for its hierarchical government communication structure, as well as its previous experiences regarding the health risks and the influence an outbreak can have on citizens' perceptions and actions toward government information and services during public health emergencies. Moreover, with their relatively high level of social media competency, the citizens of South Korea are cultivated to be the major users of government social media channels, (Kim, Yoon, & Jung, 2017) . Thus, it is necessary to be cautious and not to generalize and directly apply the findings of this study to other countries or settings. This limitation indicates the direction future studies should take.

Studies that analyze multiple countries and regional context can extend the validity and generalizability of this study's findings, which can broaden the horizon of scholarly understanding of citizens' information-seeking behavior in ICT-driven health risk communication (Dwivedi et al., 2016; Liu et al., 2014) . Moreover, such future studies will reveal the various practices and approaches of different governments, as well as their citizens' perceptions, which will offer valuable insights for both scholars and public managers in search of innovative methods to promote collaborative accountability in the digital era regarding ICT-based public health policy.

In addition, comparative and/or longitudinal studies that investigate whether the application of these health risk communication systems bring about similar or different outcomes will help to identify particular user segments and media contexts that have different behavioral patterns in e-government adoption . This will help to reveal the requisites and drivers for the adoption of egovernment services.

This study examined the factors that influence citizens' likelihood of using government social media resources in the context of public health communication. By integrating trust and health risk information into the e-government adoption model (GAM), we conducted survey with 700 Korean citizens and analyzed these data using structural equation modeling. The results indicate that individuals with higher social media competency are more likely to seek risk information through social media and are more likely to perceive the government's social media sites as easy to use. Our findings confirm that, with regards to the GAM, citizens' intentions to use these services increases if the services are perceived as more valuable. In addition, the perceived trust in the government's social media resources functions as a mediator of this process.

This study provides meaningful information regarding the current state of the literature and policy-makers. First, this work extends the GAM to the area of health risk communication, and adds empirical evidence to the knowledge of e-government studies. These findings also have useful policy implications. In particular, the data presented here reveal the importance of citizen engagement for sustainable public health communication; taking an initial step to empirically explore public health communication in the context of a digital government.

Crisis communication in context: Cultural and political influences underpinning Chinese public relations practice,"This study analyzes academic journal articles in order to depict the features of Chinese crisis communication in Mainland China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan. The findings revealed the following features of crisis communication in Chinese societies: collectivistic culture, nationalism, rationalism, face-giving/saving, striving for the ""golden mean,"" the preference for passive communicative strategies, and the avoidance of extreme strategies. Nevertheless, the differences in political systems-the ubiquitous intervention by authoritarian government on the Mainland, the mistrust of government in post-handover Hong Kong, and the relatively mature democratic polity in Taiwan all lead to unique crisis communication practices.","Much existing research analyzes the descriptive features of various crisis communication practices (e.g., Bradford and Garrett, 1995; Cancel, Cameron, Sallot, & Mitrook, 1997; Cho, 2005) and their effectiveness (Brown & White, 2010; Kim & Sung, 2014) . Though helpful, such research has been relatively inattentive to the contextual variables that determine specific practices, especially at the social, cultural, and cross-cultural levels. This has led to doubts about the applicability of crisis communicative strategies across cultures. Because Western cultural assumptions have shaped much research in the field of crisis communication, a revision of such assumptions is needed if the findings of public relations research in general (Pompper, 2005) and crisis communication in particular are to be more widely applicable. This paper addresses previous appeals for more culturally and contextually sensitive perspectives in crisis communication research (Avery, Lariscy, Kim, & Hocke, 2010) by investigating patterns of crisis communication as they have taken shape in three Chinese societies (Mainland China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan) . Along with Brazil, Russia, and India, China has one of the world's most rapidly developing markets. Its growing economy is creating new public relations opportunities within and outside its borders, thereby arousing worldwide interest in China's emergent engagement with the global economic sphere. In the first decade of the twenty-first century; however, China's economy faced several major crises. Some were explicitly economic, such as the Asian financial meltdown in 1998 and the WTO accession in 2001. Others affected the economy indirectly but with no less impact: bird flu outbreaks in 2001, SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) crises in 2003, the Wenchuan earthquake in 2008, and more recent food safety crises. Crisis management and crisis communication have therefore played a critical role in both the public and private sectors in contemporary China.

This study develops a holistic description of crisis communication in three Chinese societies by quantitatively and qualitatively analyzing the content of 93 academic journal articles published in 15 top journals in the field of communication research between 1999 and 2014. The following questions are addressed: which strategies were mobilized by an organization in response to the crisis? Can a universal practice of crisis communication be identified while remaining sensitive to distinct local contexts? Which crisis communication strategy works in one context but not in another?

Building upon crisis communication theory and practice, this study makes the following contributions: (1) detailed depictions of Chinese crisis communication in its native forms in Mainland China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan; (2) the illustration of complex interrelations between Chinese cultural traditions and their political contexts; and (3) the enrichment of current theoretical knowledge of global crisis communication through narrowly defined intercultural and cross-regional comparisons.

This section begins by defining the dominant theories of crisis communicative strategies (CCSs) before reviewing the variables that determine the effectiveness of Chinese crisis communication in its various forms.

Crisis communicative strategies (CCSs) are defined as verbal and nonverbal responses that an organization uses to address a crisis. William Benoit (1995) developed image restoration theory, which later became one of the most cited frameworks in crisis communication research. Benoit (1995) argued that an attack with two components (an offensive act and an accusation of responsibility for the action) threatens organizational or individual reputation, which in turn requires a crisis response strategy. The five main strategies in image restoration theory are (1) denial, (2) evasion of responsibility, (3) reducing the offensiveness of an event, (4) corrective action, and (5) mortification.

Situational crisis communication theory (Coombs, 2004) provides a comprehensive framework for effectively responding to crises. Coombs defines the following four categories of crisis response: (1) denial response, which includes three strategies: attack the accuser, denial, and scapegoat; (2) diminishing response, which includes excuse and justification; (3) rebuilding response, which includes compensation and apology; and (4) bolstering response, which includes reminder, ingratiation, and self-victimization. Huang, Lin and Su (2005) undertook a survey of PR managers from Taiwan in order to examine actual crisis-handling experiences. That study integrated categories of CCS (i.e., Bradford and Garrett, 1995; Coombs, 1995) on two over-arching continuums: defense-accommodation and specification-ambiguity. highlighted in particular the importance of strategic ambiguity for the Taiwanese, which they found to result from Chinese culture's emphasis on indirect communication (Gao and Ting-Toomey, 1998).

A number of other influential theoretical approaches have been applied to corporate crisis responses and their determining contextual factors (e.g., Bradford and Garrett, 1995; Cancel, Cameron, Sallot, & Mitrook, 1997; Cho, 2005) . In the existing literature, crisis type and the scale of the crisis event have been examined as variables that should help determine the appropriate response strategy (Cancel et al., 1997) . For example, many previous studies have grouped crises into major clusters or crisis types, such as the nature of the crisis (Lerbinger, 2001) , the locus of control and intention (Coombs, 1995 (Coombs, , 1998 (Coombs, , 2004 , and the severity of the crisis (Pearson and Mitroff, 1993) . Moreover, Pearson and Mitroff (1993) proposed a model consisting of four main crisis-management variables in respect to the nature of a crisis event: crisis types, crisis phases/stages, systems, and stakeholders. Coombs (1998) also emphasized the importance of perceived crisis responsibility and identified three elements shaping the perception of responsibility during a crisis event: the dimension of attribution, the history of organizational performance, and the severity of the crisis. Coombs (2004) further developed situational theory, which attempts to determine which crisis responses were appropriate for three different crisis clusters, i.e., victim crises, accidental crises, and preventable crises. This theory arrays CCSs according to levels of perceived crisis responsibility: the higher the level of perceived responsibility, the greater the reputational threat and the more accommodative CCSs should be.

Little attention, however, has been paid to contextual variables beyond crisis type/nature. Standing as an exception, Cancel et al. (1997) developed contingency theory for public relations and provided a variety of internal and external variables that influence organizational stances. External variables include industrial environment (e.g., level of competition), threats (e.g., government regulation and litigation), and external public characteristics (e.g., degree of source credibility and level of commitment). Internal variables include an organization's characteristics (e.g., open or closed culture and age of organization), public relations department characteristics, and individual characteristics (e.g., training in PR, personal ethics, etc.).

Going beyond variables at individual levels (Coombs, 2004) or organizational levels (Cancel et al., 1997) , our study emphasizes cultural and political influences at the societal level, which allows for a tighter focus on factors that influence CCSs and their effectiveness. In our study, Chinese cultural context is used to revisit current theories of crisis communication. Current theories of crisis communication are predominately applied to democratic societies, especially American society, where corporations, interest groups, and policy makers reach the public and influence their opinions by building mass media agendas (Berger, 2001; Cobb & Elder, 1971 ). However, Mainland, Hong Kong, and Taiwan have maintained different political systems since the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949. It is likely that these same democratic conditions for current crisis communication theories either manifest differently or are absent altogether in the three Chinese societies. A preponderance of current crisis communication theories presumes the social norms and individual psychological motivations of individualistic cultures. Chinese societies, by contrast, inherit a collectivistic rationality from Confucian culture (Child, 2008) . Based on this contrast, our study provides a correction of Western communication theories by examining them within the context of contemporary Chinese culture and politics.

Cultural and political factors are examined closely in this study insofar as they allow for a detailed characterization of the three Chinese societies that are its focus. The following section begins with a broad discussion of the Confucian tradition shared by Mainland China, Taiwan, and Hong Kong. It concludes with a description of the unique political systems of each region.

The culture of an organization's chief agents and primary stakeholders can have a long-lasting impact on its communication patterns. Consequently, Confucius's teachings, which have dominated Asian culture for centuries, provide a crucial cultural context for better understanding crisis communication practices in China.

Confucianism emphasizes hierarchical authority and justifies an unequal distribution of power and wealth. As a belief system, it has therefore been a powerful source of legitimacy for the upper classes of Chinese society. Authority, order, harmony, and the strict rules governing interpersonal relationships, all key concepts in the philosophy of Confucianism, help explain some of the nuances of communicative practice and public relations in the three regions examined (Sha and Huang, 2003) . For traditional, devout Confucian Chinese, both the universe and human societies are hierarchically structured. Five classes of superior roles or stations exist in this worldview. They are, in descending order of authority, heaven, earth, the emperor, parents, and teachers. In fact, each of these serve the role of ""father figure"" to all of the orders or roles beneath it, compounding the flow of force and authority in a single direction and structuring power relationships among people, as well as those between people and their social and natural environments, as inherently one-sided (Shih, 1988) . China is the ""under-Heaven"" and is governed by the emperor, the ""son of Heaven""; the subject masses are his Tzemin, or ""son-citizens"" (Shih, 1988) . The vestiges of this patriarchal political culture persist throughout modern Chinese society.

Mainland China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan maintain different political systems. The Chinese Communist Party has authoritatively assumed the reigns of Mainland government since 1949, whereas the political systems of Hong Kong and Taiwan have significantly transformed in the past decades.

2.3.2.1. China. According to Oksenberg (2001) , the current Chinese political system still reflects its Soviet or Leninist origins. In the 21st century, the most important organization in China remains the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). The CCP monopolizes political opinion (Chou, 2009 ). The central government maintains the power to intervene in the affairs of local governments, NGOs, and even corporations. Under this political system, several events have occurred that have had major impacts on communicative practice. First, the ""Opening Policy"" was enacted in 1978; since then, the Chinese economy has transformed into one of market-based socialism characterized by joint ventures and wholly foreign-owned enterprises that established their own communication and/or public relations departments in Mainland China (Wu, Lin, & Guo, 2001) . Second, a renewed economic reform policy, declared in the the 3rd plenary session of 14th CPC Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) in 1993, led the way to new business ventures in China, radically reorienting the country away from isolationism and towards its present, ongoing transformation into one of the largest economies in the world.

Chinese media have also developed rapidly over the past two decades. According to Chinese government reports, the number of Chinese newspapers increased tenfold between 1950 and 2000. Given these changes; however, it should be noted that the majority of mass media outlets in China still operate as organs of the CCP. The CCP exerts control over all media, not only state-owned media, which it uses for policing journalistic coverage of the regime and its official policies (Zhao, 2000) .

2.3.2.2. Taiwan. Considered by some as a renegade province of China, Taiwan has anointed itself as the legitimate heir of Chinese tradition and Chinese culture. Taiwan self-consciously views itself as taking a different path from that of the Mainland, both politically and economically. The Republic of China (ROC) was inaugurated on October 10, 1911, and the Nationalist government moved to Taipei from the mainland in 1949. In practice, the ROC was ruled by an authoritarian regime until the lifting of martial law on July 24, 1987. Today, the ROC has become a functioning democracy with rival political parties. This transformation of the political system in Taiwan triggered the liberalization of the media as well as the rapid development of professional communication and public relations practices during the 1990s (Wu et al., 2001) .

As a colony of the Great Britain, Hong Kong was under British control between 1842 and 1997. In postcolonial Hong Kong, the political system is based on the principle of separated powers shared by executive, legislative, and judicial branches. The power of Hong Kong's executive office is limited by its legislative and judicial offices, and vice versa. Hong Kong's government is one of classical republicanism, insofar as it is viewed as a representative system elected and watched over by its citizens. A series of reforms in Hong Kong started to reverse government's notorious reputation for corruption. Ordinary citizens mobilized to monitor the corrupt behaviors of civil servants. As a result, politicians in Hong Kong tend to be cautious about their connections with elite business people (Manion, 2004) .

Hong Kong's original population was formed by waves of migration from Guangdong Province in southeast China. The proximity of Hong Kong's residents to their home districts consequently made travel and communication relatively easy. Hence the closer social and economic ties and the greater general cultural continuity with home districts, which developed alongside Hong Kong's status as a port city. This unique set of close relationships, both with the Mainland and with foreign powers, effectively made Hong Kong the shared periphery of two far-flung world centers: Britain and China (Luk, 1991) .

To recap, this study aims to examine Chinese crisis communication through analysis of scholarly research agendas in order to reveal how CCSs interact with both culture and political regimes. Analyzing articles published in reputable journals provides an accurate depiction of the landscape of Chinese crisis communication by systematically scrutinizing the strategies that scholars have chosen to focus on. Moreover, the following assumptions ground our theory of Chinese crisis communication. First, a certain society's research agenda not only reflects its preference for theoretical attention in general (e.g., Neely, Gregory, & Platts, 1995) but also reflects and represents debates over existing theories (e.g., Guest, 1997) . Second, the status of a communication practice in a certain country or region also reflects its political and media systems, its level of economic development, and aspects of its cultural history (Grunig, Grunig, & Vercic, 1997) .

Cheney and Christensen (2001) suggested that the public relations profession struggles with democratic principles in cultures that are dominated by or biased toward corporatism. Likewise, Spicer (2000) questioned, ""does public relations serve moneyed interests to the exclusion of groups without substantial resources?"" (p. 124). Leitch and Neilson (2001) claimed that PR practice is enriched by public-centered views that counter exclusively organization-oriented perspectives. We adopted a similar analytical framework for our cross-study comparison: does the investigation reflect an organizational or a public perspective? Is the organization examined for-profit or nonprofit? Is the issue investigated related to corporatism and moneyed interests, or not? Further research questions guide the present study: RQ1: What temporal trends exist in Chinese crisis communication scholarship? RQ2: What patterns exist in terms of the crises examined by Chinese crisis communication scholarship? Are there any regional differences?

RQ3: What patterns emerge in the articles in terms of research perspectives (i.e., institution, media, and stakeholder) and types of focal institutions (governmental institutions, corporations, public organizations and others)? Are there any regional differences? Do the patterns reflect a balanced or imbalanced research agenda in Chinese crisis communication scholarship? RQ4: What are the typical CCSs examined in Chinese crisis communication scholarship? RQ5: Are there similarities and/or differences in the CCSs among the three Chinese societies? How do differences and similarities present themselves?

RQ6: Based on the findings of current research on Chinese crisis communication, how does the ""interaction"" among cultural traits combine with a dominant political system to shape crisis communication practice across three Chinese societies?

We used quantitative content analysis for research questions one through three to detect the existence of any patterns. Qualitative methodology (thematic analysis of each article) was used for research questions four through six to investigate possible causes of crisis situations when considering internal, external, and contextual variables that might influence an organization's uses of CCS (Cancel, Cameron Sallot, & Mitrook, 1997) . Fig. 1 illustrates the analytical framework of the current study.

This study utilized a meta-review to study the cultural contexts of crisis communication in Mainland China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan. One approach to meta-review analyzes the content of literature reviews on a certain topic from a certain perspective, such as systematic reviews (e.g., Egan, Tannahill, Petticrew, & Thomas, 2008) , narrative literature reviews (e.g., Egan et al., 2008; Weed, 2009) , and introductory reviews (e.g., Weed, 2009) . Another approach combines established research methods to investigate patterns in academic work on certain topics. This kind of meta-review can utilize quantitative content analysis/assessment (e.g., Ehrhardt-Martinez, Donnelly, & Laitner, 2010), qualitative content reviews (e.g., Ehrhardt-Martinez et al., 2010), or other methods. We adopted this second approach to meta-review in an attempt to map the field of Chinese crisis communication. Moreover, this paper engages with appeals for more methodological diversity in its combination of qualitative thematic analysis (Avery, Lariscy, Kim, & Hocke, 2010) with quantitative content analysis. In order to enhance the scope and applicability of our findings (Eisenhardt, 1989) , this study compared a number of different crises that occurred within a Chinese cultural context. Analysis of multiple case studies helps alleviate artificial impacts on each crisis situation and vastly strengthens the findings (Yin, 2009 ). All cases originated in Chinese societies but fall under different crisis types in various industries. This study conducted thematic analysis of the conclusions in each article in terms of the factors found to have influenced CCS.

Hong Kong and Taiwan are examined in view of the fact that their legal, political, and media systems are different both from each other's and from those of Mainland China. In essence, the multiple-case logic used in this study more closely resembles that of a quasi-experiment. Our results were found using a combined logic of literal replication (the observation of outcomes from similar events) and theoretical replication (the occurrence of dissimilar outcomes due to explainable causes of crisis situations).

In the interest of comprehensiveness, this study reviews various types of work (journal articles & book reviews) published in both English-and Chinese-language journals that studied crisis communication in the three regions (Mainland China, Taiwan, and Hong Kong) from two academic perspectives (public relations and communication). The criteria used for journal selection were high general reputation, a strong influence on Chinese communication research, and accreditation by way of inclusion in certain scholarly indices, such as the Social Science Index (SSCI), the Chinese Social Science Index (CSSCI), and the Taiwanese Social Science Index (TSSCI). We first looked at two major journals in the field of public relations: the In order to represent academic journals from Hong Kong, Communication and Society (TSSCI) was reviewed. 1 Titles of articles were queried with the key words ""crisis/crises,"" and abstracts were queried with the key words ""China/Chinese/Taiwan/Taiwanese/Hong Kong/Macau/Macanese"". Only articles focusing on crisis management were included in the final sample. Articles selected for analysis were published in 15 academic journals between 1999 and 2014. These articles focused explicitly on Chinese crisis communication. Initial keyword searches were conducted in January 2012; further keyword searches were conducted in October 2014. This yielded a total of 93 articles for analysis (56 in January 2012 and 37 in October 2014). 2

Three broad categories were used to code each article. The first category codes publication year and the name of the journal and Index (SSCI, CSSCI, and TSSCI) in which it appears. The second codes the study's research subjects, including crisis case, the focal region of the study (Mainland, Hong Kong, Taiwan, or multiple regions), research perspective (institutional, media, or other stakeholders), and the type of institution involved in the crisis (government, corporations, NGO, or other institutions). The third category codes the CCSs adopted. Huang, Lin, and Su (2005) provided the coding scheme for CCSs in this study. A chi-square test analyzed regional differences among the three Chinese societies. A statistical limitation of this study is the relatively small number of articles (N = 93), given that a larger sample size (N > 200) would have significantly improved the accuracy of estimates from a Chi-square test (Bearden, Sharma, & Teel, 1982) . Therefore we use the results of our Chi-square tests only to compare frequency distributions of variables across regions.

Two postgraduate students served as coders for the 56 articles collected at the first stage of our research. Each coder coded half of the sample (28 articles) independently. To test inter-coder reliability, 11 articles were randomly selected, representing 20% of the total. Using Holsti's (1969) method, the inter-coder reliability was 1.0 for general information (journal name, publication year, author, institution, case or no case), 0.96 for research subject (research focus, article perspective, type of institution, and crisis region), and 0.89 for crisis communication practice (type of CCSs). The overall inter-coder agreement was 0.94. Three postgraduate students coded the other 37 articles collected at the second stage (one coder remained from the first stage). Ten percent were randomly selected to test inter-coder reliability. Holsti's coefficients for the coding categories were all sufficient (above 0.90). The number of related articles published in CSSCI-listed journals significantly increased in 2008, peaking (n = 16) in 2013, in contrast to only three articles on this topic published before 2008. Of all articles examined, nearly half were published in CSSCI-listed journals (43%, n = 40), of which 17 articles came from Modern Communication, 15 articles from Journal of International Communication, and eight from Journalism Quarterly (Bimonthly). The result of our Chi-square test shows a significant preference of CSSCI journals for articles focusing on Mainland China ( 2 (4, N = 66) = 14.05, p < 0.01). Among the 93 articles analyzed, 55 (59%) concentrated on Mainland crisis events, 14 (15%) focused on Taiwan, and only five articles (5%) focused on Hong Kong. Twelve of the articles included multiple regions while seven did not single out any specific Chinese society. Although CSSCI-listed journals published more work on Chinese crisis communication than SSCI-listed journals, their attention to the topic lagged far behind the SSCI-listed journals. RQ2 asked if any pattern exists in the crises examined across the three Chinese regions. Our findings show that a casestudy approach dominated scholarship across all three regions. The result of the Chi-square test did not identify a significant regional difference in adopting case study approaches ( 2 (2, N = 74) = 3.12, p > 0.05). More than half (n = 53, 57%) of the 93 articles examined one or more crises. Among the three regions, Mainland crises were the major subject of examination. Fifty five articles (59%) concentrated on Mainland crises, 14 (15%) on Taiwan, and only five (5%) on Hong Kong. A second finding was that crises seemed not to be confined to one region. The scope of influence for crisis events was often trans-regional or even transnational. Among the 93 articles examined, eight articles conducted comparative or cross-regional studies. For example, Hsiang et al. (2011) analyzed a multinational corporation's handling of a crisis event in Greater China, the US, and Singapore. Finally, crises with severe damages or extensive impact prompted considerable academic attention. The 2003 SARS crisis (nine articles, 10%) and the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake (12 articles, 13%) are two examples.

Concerning RQ3, results showed that the focus on different perspectives (i.e., institution, media, and the public/other stakeholders) was asymmetrical. The institutional perspective was the dominant perspective examined in Chinese crisis communication studies over the past 16 years (48 articles, 52%), in contrast to the media perspective (26 articles, 28%), the public perspective (22 articles, 24%), and other perspectives (four articles, 4%). The result of our chi-square test did not show significant regional difference in the perspectives adopted ( 2 (4, N = 60) = 2.93, p > 0.05). 3 Although the institutional perspective was dominant across all three regions, studies on Mainland crisis communication paid more attention to the media perspective and the public perspective than those focused on Hong Kong and Taiwan. Among the articles on Mainland China that reflected an institutional perspective, 20 focused on governmental institutions (42%), in contrast to corporations (11 articles, 23%), public organizations (three articles, 3%), or others (eight articles, 9%).

Chinese crisis communication research particularly emphasized governmental perspectives. After 2003, governmental crisis communication became the main topic of Chinese crisis communication research in Mainland China (Meng and Qian, 2008) . This trend contradicts the recent call for more symmetrical research agendas that concentrate on non-institutional perspectives (Spicer, 2000) . Nevertheless, recent years have seen increasing academic attention paid to the public perspective, especially when those studies focused on crisis communication in Mainland China. Twenty out of the 22 articles in our sample that adopted the public perspective were published after 2010, and eleven of those focused on Mainland China. This could be the result of the digital transformation of Mainland Chinese society. Sina Weibo -the most widely used social media platform in China -was established in 2009, and social media have since proliferated throughout the Chinese population. Social media has empowered the public to proactively deal with crisis situations as a community (Luo & Jiang, 2014; Pang & Zhang, 2014) . More symmetrical research agendas might be expected in future scholarship on Chinese crisis communication, especially scholarship focused on Mainland China.

RQ4 asks which patterns of crisis communication, if any, exist in Chinese societies. Ultimately, 19% of our sample (18 out of 93 articles) used situational crisis communication theories 4 (Bradford and Garrett, 1995; Coombs, 1998) as an analytical framework in their studies. Of these, justification/reducing effectiveness was reported as the most frequently used crisis response (16/18, 94%). The second most frequently used strategy was denial (14/18, 78%), followed by correction (13/18, 72%), concession/mortification (12/18, 67%), and excuse (12/18, 67%). Moreover, attacking the accuser (3/18, 17%) and ""no comment"" (2/18, 11%) were also used. The findings suggest the limited adoption of western crisis communication theories by Chinese crisis communication scholarship. This may imply that Chinese crisis communication scholarship lags behind the general crisis communication research community. On the other hand, it may reflect the preferences of Chinese crisis communication scholarship for localized theoretical frameworks. We used qualitative analysis for the other articles related to crisis response strategies and found that the CCSs used most often were ""golden mean"" strategies, according with the tendency of Confucianism to promote harmony and highly contextual, indirect communication (e.g., Fang and Faure, 2011) .

RQ5 asks whether there are similarities or differences in CCSs among the three Chinese societies examined. Convergent findings across three societies were found to reflect certain Chinese cultural contexts: (1) asymmetric worldview (more specifically, the two chief strategies which reflect this worldview: ""covering up"" (Chen, 2008; Veil & Yang, 2012; Yu & Wen, 2003) and ""no comment/no response""); (2) the use of diversion or strategic ambiguity (Huang, 2006; Huang, Lin, & Su 2005; Lee, 2004 Lee, , 2009 Hsiang et al., 2011) ; and (3) avoidance of ""extreme"" tactics, such as attacking accusers and apologizing to the public.

Covering up is a prominent strategy in Mainland China. This strategy includes other sub-strategies, such as prohibitions on reporting, deception, and the strategy of giving no comment/response. On one hand, government officials tend to cover up crises perceived as threats to their political careers (Huang and Leung, 2005) . Chen (2008) found that during the SARS crisis in Mainland China, local officials in Guangdong province prohibited the media from reporting the real death rate. On the other hand, a ""face-saving"" mindset can also prevail. Local government officials covered up the SARS outbreak merely because they were trying to save face (Chen, 2008, p. 47) . Additionally, in 21st century China, economic development and social stability have become top priorities for Chinese central and local governments (Huang and Leung, 2005) , thereby creating a larger incentive to cover up scandals.

Corporations also cover up scandals. Lyu (2012a) revealed that the Sanlu Corporation manipulated its ties to local governments in order to cover up its melamine-contaminated milk-powder crisis. Moreover, Sanlu sought to reduce negative publicity by purchasing positive advertising in the media (Veil and Yang, 2012) .

Similar cover-ups occurred in Taiwan during political crises. For example, Yu and Wen (2003) found that, in addition to strategies of denial and excuse, government officials used deception, media manipulation, and attacks against accusers to cover up the truth. According to Yu and Wen (2003) , the Taiwanese government handled crises as ""family"" or domestic matters. Taiwanese politicians avoided disclosing facts to the public during crisis situations in order to save face, secure national dignity, and reduce social turbulence.

Similar to the passive ""covering-up"" displayed by Mainland Chinese officials during the SARS crisis and the Wenchuan earthquake, a characteristic of Hong Kong's crisis communication is the prevalent use of ""no comment"". When the public cried out for more information during the SARS crisis, Lee (2007) found that Hong Kong's government resorted to a ""no comment"" strategy in order to block media attention. According to Lee (2007) , the government insisted not only on refusing to apologize but also on avoiding timely corrective measures. This practice could be related to Hong Kong's legal system, which is much more rigid than the legal systems of Mainland China and Taiwan. According to Fitzpatrick and Rubin (1995) , a ""no comment"" strategy is more likely to occur when admission of guilt is perceived as a liability for the organization in a potential lawsuit. Therefore, ""say[ing] nothing"" and ""say[ing] as little as possible"" are dominant strategies for crisis managers in regions where the rule of law is paramount.

Our findings also suggest that the avoidance of direct confrontation favored by Chinese culture (Ting-toomy, 2005) could be related to the frequent deployment of ""diversion"" as a strategy in Chinese crisis communication. Huang (2006) examined the ways in which four Chinese political figures responded to their alleged extramarital affairs. She demonstrated the prevalence and effectiveness of diversion/strategic ambiguity in these cases. As Huang noted, ""redirection [and] appeals to transcendence allow a political figure to put the case in such a way that the act supersedes its narrow, transient, and current scope and reflects low-context, less direct, more permanent, and future concerns"" (p. 26). Likewise, Huang, Lin, & Su (2005) used a survey of public relations and public affairs managers from Fortune 500 companies to empirically demonstrate that ""diversion"" and ""strategic ambiguity"" are crucial dimensions of CCSs in Taiwan. Such ""diversion"" strategies were also seen in the melamine-tainted milk-powder crisis in Mainland China (Lyu, 2012) and Hsiang et al. (2011) study of Bausch & Lomb's withdrawal of contact lens solution across the three Chinese societies.

4.2.4. Avoidance of ""extreme"" tactics such as attacking accusers and publicly apologizing ""Attacking the accuser"" and ""public apologies"" are seldom-used strategies in Chinese crisis communication, especially at the governmental level. For example, public apologies appeared neither in the SARS crisis (Chen, 2008) nor in the Wenchuan earthquake incident (Chen, 2009) nor in Sanlu's milk-contamination crisis; nor did Hong Kong's government express an apology during the SARs outbreak (Lee, 2007) . Huang (2006) observed that an accused politician chose not to directly attack his accuser, even though he could understandably have done so. Avoiding a direct attack on one's accuser saves face for both the accuser and the accused, thereby maintaining the harmony of the relationship, even if only at the surface level.

RQ6 investigates the extent to which Chinese cultural traits combine with the different Chinese political systems to impact CCSs adopted by Chinese crisis managers. This section consolidates lessons learned from studies published in the past fifteen years. The major characteristics of Chinese CCSs in crisis communication practices are defined below.

Traditional Chinese culture contributes to the unique CCSs in Mainland China (Liu, Chang, & Zhao, 2009) , Hong Kong (Lee, 2004) , and Taiwan (Huang, 2006) . In particular, collectivism, face-giving/saving, and the concept of the ""golden mean"" were identified as central cultural characteristics shaping Chinese crisis communication practices. 4.3.1.1. Collectivistic culture, nationalism, and rationalism. ""Collectivism"", especially at the national level, is a cultural and political attribute that contributes to the rhetorical representation of image restoration strategies, though such representation takes shape differently in the three different regions. Mainland Chinese tend to feel an obligation to take up the collective interest when expressing attitudes and making decisions, especially as they concern the agenda of the national government. Thus CCSs that use ""sustainability"" and ""national security"" to frame crises have been deployed frequently in Mainland China. Liu, Chang, and Zhao (2009) even found that Chinese entrepreneurs and public relations practitioners tend to tout China's overall prosperity more frequently than they are observed boasting of their own individual merits. Similarly, Huang (2006) emphasized the effects of collectivistic culture on the concept of relational harmony, examining four Taiwanese politicians alleged to be involved in extramarital affairs. Huang found that collectivist culture entails a form of ""relationalism"" that strongly shapes crisis communication practices (see Huang, 2006) . 4.3.1.2. Face-giving/saving. The tradition of face-saving (and face-giving) is another unique Chinese cultural trait that contributes significantly to Chinese crisis communication practices. Historically, the practice of ""covering-up"" and its related mindset, which desires that ""the ugly things in the family not go public"", have been common in Chinese crisis communication practices (Tang, 2003; Yu & Wen, 2003) . Saving face for oneself and giving face to others, coupled with narrow obedience to the collective agenda, only intensifies the tendency to cover up a crisis situation.

4.3.1.3. The golden mean. Chinese people traditionally have valued something known as Zhong Yong, which can be roughly translated as ""golden mean"". The golden mean is defined as that which is ""half way between two extremes"" (Ma, 1988, p. 203) . People in a Golden Mean-oriented society tend to behave in accordance with majority opinion (Ma, 1998) . Chinese people tend to think dialectically, and they have been found, statistically, to be more tolerant of contradictions than Western people (Peng and Nisbett, 1999) . The philosophy of the Golden Mean leads to a soft attitude towards resolving conflicts. In conflict resolution, Chinese people are inclined to reconcile large conflicts in a way that reduces them to smaller conflicts (Ma, 1998) . Therefore, extreme CCSs, such as attacking one's accusers, are neither highly valued nor frequently used in Chinese culture (Huang, 2006) .

The political regime in Mainland China is significantly different from that in Taiwan and Hong Kong, such that there is a significant difference in the way governmental crises are dealt with across the three regions. Of all potential actors, the regime in Mainland China is the strongest political force shaping the practice of crisis communication, not only at the level of central and local government but at the corporate level as well. This degree of government control in the Mainland is greater than that in Hong Kong, which in turn is greater than that found in Taiwan, whose regime has a comparatively small degree of sway over the crisis communication. (Meng and Qian, 2008) . Three factors jointly contributed to this. Symbolically, the Chinese government has attempted to play the role of the patriarch who rewards, disciplines, and protects his children (Huang and Bedford, 2009 ). This dynamic is particularly evident during crises or disasters, when the Chinese government has a symbolic responsibility to safeguard its ""children"". In addition to this symbolic responsibility, Chinese history and tradition have endowed the government with huge advantages in social status, resource possession, and power (Qian and Shi, 2012) . In Mainland China, the government has the requisite access and power to intervene upon other actors in a crisis event, whether those might be the media, corporations, or NGOs (Lyu, 2012a) . As a result, the government often assumes the principal acting role in conjunction with or instead of other institutions involved in a crisis (e.g., Cai, Lee, & Pang, 2009; Lyu, 2012a; Bowen and Heath, 2007) .

4.3.2.1.2. The suppression of uncertainty or instability by authoritarianism as a factor contributing to the failure of crisis communication. Meng and Qian (2008) , Gong (2009), and Cai, Lee, and Pang (2009) all pointed out that the key factor contributing to the failure of crisis communication in Mainland China is the tendency of the local governments to suppress uncertainty or instability at the expense of all other concerns. Compounding this basic problem, poor coordination exists between central and local governments. Mainland China is a large territory with multiple hierarchies built into its government at national and local levels. The central government exercises a great deal of control over the personnel and resource allocation of local governments. When large-scale crises (such as SARS and the Sichuan earthquake) take place, flexibility, coordination, and cooperation among various levels of government are key to effective CCSs. Tu and Gong (2008) claimed that these conditions for successful crisis communication do not exist within the Mainland Chinese government.

In Mainland China, ""the level of crisis severity"" is a criterion used by the central government to judge the performance of local governments. Thus, local government leaders tend to withhold or falsify crucial information about crises in reports to the central government (Huang and Leung, 2005) . During the SARS epidemic, for example, many mid-level officials suppressed or withheld news coverage and covered up the outbreak's severity by fabricating more manageable casualty figures (Huang and Leung, 2005) . 4.3.2.1.3. Interdependent relationships between local governments and corporations. Finally, relationships between local governments and corporations hinder the possibility of effective CCSs in Mainland China. For example, during the melaminecontaminated milk-powder crisis, the state-owned Sanlu Corporation took a passive role and waited for instructions from the government (Lyu, 2012a, p. 787) .

Four articles examined in the current study also focus on crises involving private corporations in Mainland China, and they all detail unethical and unprofessional practices. One pattern worth noting is that the practice of corporate crisis communication closely mirrors government conduct. Local government officials have been known to cover up for corporate criminals who pay large tax bills (Lyu, 2012a) . In many cases, large corporations expect some sort of ""protection"" or ""guidance"" from local governments; thus their initial strategy is usually to deny accusations or remain silent (Lyu, 2012a, p. 788) . Often, when the crisis becomes too severe to cover up and the central government finally steps in, much damage has already occurred both to an institution's reputation and to the public trust.

4.3.2.2. Hong Kong. Compared to the power wielded by Mainland China's government, the HKSAR has limited power. When crises occur, Hong Kong's government normally receives more critical scrutiny from scholars and the media than the private sector does (Lee, 2009) . The findings of the present study confirm this. Of all articles examined, governmental institutions in Hong Kong received the highest level of attention (60%), compared with corporations (20%) and media (20%). Ku (2001) maintained that, after the handover in 1997, the HKSAR was under the administration of an ""inexperienced and conservative Chief Executive"" (p. 131), which exposed its inherent weakness when dealing with crises. Academic attention was thus attracted to improving this situation.

The asymmetrical mindset that takes control during crisis situations also exists in Hong Kong. The difference being; however, that such asymmetrical strategies incurred heavy criticism from the media, which resulted in serious damage to the image and reputation of the HKSAR government (Lee, 2007 (Lee, , 2009 ) and loss of public support and public trust (Ku, 2001) .

Of the studies that examined crises in Taiwan and adopted the institutional perspective, only one article investigated governmental CCSs. Unlike the scholarship on Mainland China and Hong Kong, studies that focused on Taiwan highlighted the relationship between unprofessional corporate communication practices and weak regulation on the part of the ROC government. For example, Lin (2011) argued that the passive attitude of the government toward corporate malfeasance escalated the cable TV news-ticker crisis in Taiwan. The fiercely competitive market for ratings in Taiwanese media caused some TV stations to manipulate news tickers to attract viewers. The overuse of news tickers without proper regulations finally became a managerial crisis. Lin concludes that too much autonomy granted by governments to corporations can lead to unethical and unprofessional practices. The Taiwanese government did not effectively control the unprofessional practices of media institutions (in the case of the news tickers, especially) out of concern for maintaining press freedoms. Without any reasonable governmental regulations, however, some corporations will abuse their autonomy.

An accurate summary of this study's main findings must maintain a tone of ambivalence in regard to direct causal relationships. On one hand, Chinese tradition emphasizes harmony, order, face-saving, relationalism, and even nationalism, all of which shape particular forms of Chinese communication. For example, the Chinese traditions of face-giving/saving and the Golden Mean perpetuate the avoidance of extreme CCSs (attacking one's accusers or making public apologies) in Mainland, Taiwan, and Hong Kong. On the other hand, a region's political system also has a significant impact on crisis communication patterns in Chinese society. Formal institutions, particularly political regimes, can either discourage or encourage unethical and unprofessional practices in each region. Specifically, control-oriented crisis communication takes place more frequently within contexts distinguished by highly centralized and authoritarian political systems. Moreover, the transparency and symmetry of crisis communication have an inversely proportional relationship to centralization in the political system. Thus, an account of shared cultural heritage and varied political systems among regions within China is critical for establishing the nature of native crisis communication practices (see Table 1 ).

This study also discovered that research on Chinese CCSs emphasized institutional perspectives. Governmental crisis communication is paramount in research on the Mainland and Hong Kong, whereas corporate crises received the bulk of attention in research on Taiwan. Researchers seemed to be attracted to institutional crisis communication due to regional differences in political systems-ubiquitous intervention by the authoritarian government on the Mainland, the mistrust of government in post-handover Hong Kong, and the relatively mature democratic polity in Taiwan. Our study adds to this the following interesting findings about crisis communication in Mainland Chinese governmental agencies: governmental crisis communication is the predominate focus of research by scholars who work on Chinese public relations; and local governments and corporations within Mainland China display interdependent relationships.

Although our research contains important theoretical implications, it is limited by several factors. First, this study focused on crises that took place primarily in Chinese societies. Another limitation is this study's reliance on the conclusions and findings of the previous studies examined in our sample. Although we analyzed articles from reputable journals indexed in professional databases (such as SSCI, TSSCI, and CSSCI), these criteria are no guarantee of validity. They are only a strong safeguard against lack of validity. Despite the limitations of our methodological design, we believe that this study contributes significantly to an accurate depiction of the landscape of Chinese crisis communication. Through a comparison of empirical data collected from articles focused on three Chinese societies, the ultimate goal of this analysis is to go beyond traditional Western models of corporate crisis communication. The results revealed several compelling reasons for extending mainstream crisis communication theories that we found have limited impact on Chinese crisis communication scholarship. The exiting literature focuses too much on crisis-related variables (such as crisis responsibility attribution) as the primary contextual factor in a crisis situation while neglecting the crucial roles played by cultural context.

Moreover, this study suggests promising new directions for a more symmetrical research agenda for Chinese crisis communication.

First, the Internet has become a crucial context for public relations practice because it provides a technique for studying the attitudes and behaviors of the public during crises. While new forms of media have recently played a large role in mediating institutions and the public in Chinese crisis communication (Lyu, 2012b; Tu and Gong, 2008) , these relatively new communication platforms are in need of scholarly attention. Chinese social media and Internet use differ drastically from comparable practices in western countries. The centralized blocking of some mainstream foreign social media and restricted access to the Internet characterize a distinctive Internet context in China. Therefore, online crisis communication in China presents a set of exciting new challenges for Chinese crisis communication research.

Second, as noted earlier, a majority of Chinese crises have been studied from institutional (in particular, from governmental) rather than media or stakeholder perspectives. There has been little discussion of the effect of CCSs on various segments of the public in Chinese crisis communication research. Therefore, in support of the urgent call for more symmetrical research agendas (Dozier & Lauzen, 2000; Spice, 2000) , we suggest that future research would benefit from a more intensive focus on non-institutional perspectives and the stakeholder perspective in particular.

Moreover, the findings suggest that crisis communication research in public relations may be enriched both theoretically and pragmatically through more diverse contextual and methodological applications. Future research could compare this study's findings to a comparable study of organizations in other countries, which might provide valuable insights into cultural differences.

"Implementing a One Health approach to emerging infectious disease: reflections on the socio-political, ethical and legal dimensions","Background: 'One Health' represents a call for health researchers and practitioners at the human, animal and environmental interfaces to work together to mitigate the risks of emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases (EIDs). A One Health approach emphasizing inter-disciplinary co-operation is increasingly seen as necessary for effective EID control and prevention. There are, however, socio-political, ethical and legal challenges, which must be met by such a One Health approach. Discussion: Based on the philosophical review and critical analysis of scholarship around the theory and practice of One Health it is clear that EID events are not simply about pathogens jumping species barriers; they are comprised of complex and contingent sets of relations that involve socioeconomic and socio-political drivers and consequences with the latter extending beyond the impact of the disease. Therefore, the effectiveness of policies based on One Health depends on their implementation and alignment with or modification of public values. Summary: Despite its strong motivating rationale, implementing a One Health approach in an integrated and considered manner can be challenging, especially in the face of a perceived crisis. The effective control and prevention of EIDs therefore requires: (i) social science research to improve understanding of how EID threats and responses play out; (ii) the development of an analytic framework that catalogues case experiences with EIDs, reflects their dynamic nature and promotes inter-sectoral collaboration and knowledge synthesis; (iii) genuine public engagement processes that promote transparency, education and capture people's preferences; (iv) a set of practical principles and values that integrate ethics into decision-making procedures, against which policies and public health responses can be assessed; (v) integration of the analytic framework and the statement of principles and values outlined above; and (vi) a focus on genuine reform rather than rhetoric.","The recent Ebolavirus (EBOV) outbreak in West Africa and continuing human infections with a novel H7N9 influenza A virus in mainland China are salient reminders of how human and nonhuman health are inextricably linked. Nonhuman animals are the source of 70 % of emerging and re-emerging infectious disease (EID) threats to human health [1] , and more than half of all established human pathogens [2] . The threats posed by EIDs are dynamic. EIDs are caused by pathogens that can change their behaviour over timeeither through genetic modification or through changes in the patterns and pathways of transmission [3] . Social, economic and political systems can either promote or inhibit pathogen transfer, and the incidence and pathogenicity of the disease [4] . While a lack of data makes quantitation difficult, EIDs and zoonoses account for a significant proportion of the global disease burden [5] . EIDs and emergence of zoonotic pathogens, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), are direct causes of an estimated 15 million deaths worldwide each year [6] .

A One Health approach is increasingly considered to be the most effective way of managing EID threats [7, 8] because it represents an acknowledgement of certain facts about the nature of disease, which are then deployed to structure the response. One Health is grounded in a recognition that human, animal and environmental health are interdependent [9] , that animal species provide a shared reservoir for pathogen exchange and spread, and that many EIDs are driven by varied and dynamic human-animal interactions [9, 10] . The response One Health offers is to deconstruct the disciplinary silos [11] which have separated biomedical and social sciences devoted to the study of human disease from those devoted to nonhuman disease and ecological concerns [12, 13] . Inter-disciplinary research is called for and required, as is interventionist practice at local, national and international levels involving: policymakers, planners, regulators, physicians, veterinarians, ecologists, public and animal health officials, environmental health officers, microbiologists, and other allied natural and social scientists [10, 14] .

Although principally associated with EID prevention and control, One Health is also relevant to prevention and control of endemic and zoonotic animal diseases, as well as securing food safety [15, 16] . Considering the magnitude and complexity of global issues surrounding infectious disease and food security, the One Health approach has the potential to provide the creative, effective and sustainable solutions required.

Despite its strong motivating rationale, implementing a One Health approach can be challenging. Dealing with EIDs in an integrated and considered manner can be highly problematic, especially in the face of a perceived crisis. In this paper we examine the socio-political, ethical and legal considerations implied by a One Health approach to EIDs. First we describe how a One Health approach could galvanise and enhance current capacity in EID prevention and control. Making reference to case examples, we then identify and characterise sociopolitical, ethical and legal concerns that have the potential to limit the effectiveness of One Health interventions. Finally, we draw on this data to provide guidance as to how these concerns and issues might be addressed, and point to remaining challenges to the likely success of the One Health approach to EID control and prevention.

In order to explore the broader implications of a One Health approach we employed philosophical and qualitative methods to map existing and potential scientific, ethical and political responses to EIDs in Australia and our region. The overarching philosophical approach is that of developing sustained arguments that critically analyse the existing literature and reconceptualise or refine key concepts. This conceptual information is often observed in exemplars and paradigm cases. In particular we focused on materials pertaining to the social, political and ethical consequences of responses to the risks posed to human health and wellbeing by Hendra virus [HeV], Nipah virus [NiV] and Rabies virus [RbV] in Australasia, and compared them with international responses to canonical examples of pandemic and food borne zoonoses severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) [17] and bovine spongiform encephalitis/variant Creutzfeldt Jacob disease (BSE/vCJD), respectively. A synopsis of the characteristics and burdens of these diseases and the pathogens that cause them are outlined in Boxes 1 and 2.

Because our aim was to generate inductive insights and develop a robust set of argumentsrather than a comprehensive catalogue of every case example or publicationthe sample evolved iteratively from searches of textual sources such as publicly available international (e.g. WHO) and government reports; academic databases (e.g. PubMed); online/print news services (Factiva); organizational newsfeeds (Centers for Disease Control); and the websites of major One Health collaborations [18] . Materials in the sample were read and qualitatively reviewed through an iterative process of testing, revising and refining our definitions, principles and theoretical generalisations [19, 20] against the emerging conceptual map and feedback from the research team. Led by the first author, this cycle of searching, mapping and critical analysis continued until a period where new textual materials were not providing substantive new insights and the team was confident that a position of conceptual saturation had been achieved. In what follows we draw on these analyses and reflections to describe the content, context and nature of the challenges that need to be faced for the effective implementation of a One Health approach to EID control and prevention.

Findings EID prevention and control strategies require a One Health approach One Health is a holistic approach that emphasizes, but is not restricted to, the need to understand and regulate the environmental context (human-animalecosystem interface) of disease emergence and expression [21] . EIDs are characterized by their complexity and uncertainty as to their causes, consequences and likely solutions [22] . In broad terms, the occurrence and cross-species transmissibility of many emerging pathogens, like Ebolavirus (EBOV) and H7N9, arise from human activities such as changes in land use, growth in global trade and travel and intensification of animal husbandry practices [23] [24] [25] . The speed with which our understanding of the biology and epidemiology of H7N9 has developed demonstrates how much our ability to respond to new EID threats has improved over the last few decades. Yet despite advances in immunobiology and genomics that have contributed to diagnostics, therapeutics, and vaccine development, the threat of EIDs to human health and community wellbeing persists.

Part of the reason why EID threats remain in spite of scientific advances, are that EID events are not simply about pathogens jumping species barriers. The threats posed by EIDs are comprised of complex and contingent sets of relations that involve socioeconomic and sociopolitical drivers and consequences, with the latter extending beyond the impact of the disease. The social, cultural and economic impacts of zoonoses are significant. The examples contained in Tables 1 and 2 demonstrate the difficult balance between the human health risks and socioeconomic and cultural costs of EID control [26, 27] . Policy decisions should be based on sound evidencebut it is often the case in dealing with EIDs that the evidence required is absent or fluid. EID events are often dynamic situations that are characterised by uncertainty. As events unfold new evidence is created. Consequently decisions made on the basis of present data can be seen as wrong in the future, as more evidence and a better understanding emerges.

Official reviews of canonical EID events such SARS [17] and BSE/vCJD [28] share two key findings: (i) that actions to reduce risk should not be predicated on scientific certainty; and (ii) that policies to deal with the risks and effects of an EID need to be founded on widely held values, so that people understand, in advance, the kinds of choices that will have to be made. This suggests that the One Health approach needs more than inter-sectoral collaboration and robust health legislation, as the unique nature of EIDs critically limits the effectiveness of scientific, top-down and technocratic approaches to governance [29] .

Hendra virus infection is endemic among at least two species of flying fox in Australia and causes rare, but catastrophic, human infection [85] . Loss of habitat has led to increasingly intense incursions of flying foxes into populated rural and peri-urban areas and promoted the 'spill-over' of Hendra virus into horses and then to people [86] . Hundreds of people have been directly exposed to Hendra virus, with seven confirmed human infections and four deaths since 1994. With over one hundred dead horses and persistent risk, the emergence of Hendra has had significant impact on equine and tourist industries in north eastern Australia, diverted major research resources and caused significant distress and controversy in the broader community [31, 87] .

Nipah virus, a close relative of Hendra, is endemic in East Asian flying fox populations. In 1999, after a program of deforestation and agricultural development in Eastern Malaysia it spread to pigs then humans and other animals, causing respiratory disease and severe encephalitis [88] . It subsequently was reported in India and Bangladesh. Humans can be infected directly from bats, by ingestion of contaminated food and from other humans. Among 522 confirmed human cases, the overall mortality was greater than 50 % [89] . Nipah control programs devastated Malaysia's pig industry and caused high unemployment and dislocation of rural populations, at a cost of more than US$1 billion to the national economy [90] . Nipah virus has been identified by WHO as a likely cause of future pandemics.

Rabies virus infects the central nervous systems of people, wildlife and domestic mammals. The disease is transmitted by bites from infected animals and once it becomes symptomatic, it is virtually always fatal. 55,000 people die and 7.5 million receive post exposure prophylaxis annually, costing $124 billion [91] . Rabies is endemic in much of South East Asia but its range is expanding. Focusing on Australia, the continent is free from Rabies, but the current expansion of the disease in Indonesia [92] is a genuine threat to northern regions. Although likely controllable in domestic dog populations [93] , if Rabies were to become endemic amongst wild or feral animals in this setting, current modelling indicates it would be almost impossible to eradicate [94] . Table 2 Significant historical (i.e. effectively eradicated) EIDs

Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a human respiratory infection, caused by a coronavirus isolated from Chinese horseshoe bats [95] . It was first reported in Asia in 2003 and, within a few months, spread to thirty seven countries in the Americas, Europe and Asia. It affected more than 8000 people and caused 774 deaths, before being successfully eliminated by concerted international efforts. The outbreak and fear that another pandemic could occur are estimated to have cost Canadian and east Asian economies US$200 billion [27] .

Bovine spongiform encephalitis/variant Creutzfeldt Jacob disease (BSE/ vCJD) is a rare but fatal human neurodegenerative condition, caused by consumption of bovine products contaminated with the prions that cause BSE. Since vCJD was first identified in 1996, 175 cases have been reported in the UK and forty nine elsewhere. The World Bank estimates that the direct costs of vCJD/BSE to date exceed more than US $11 billion. Infected herds and the control measure imposed to prevent further infections devastated agricultural communities. The impacts of the emergence of a new zoonotic disease amongst the British public were far broader than agriculture, including the cessation of UK plasma production because of potential iatrogenic infection. With an estimated one in 4000 UK residents carrying vCJD, the burdens will continue well into this century [96] .

The success of One Health depends on more than scientific knowledge and technical achievement because some of the issues that arise in addressing EID risks are socalled 'wicked problems' [30] . When a new EID threat emerges there are rarely ready-made solutions and health policymakers and practitioners are often forced to make tragic choices that may contravene widely held values. Considerations must include the need to protect public health and the wider social, economic and environmental impacts of proposed interventions. Economic and political interests can complicate the decisionmakers' motives and decision-maker uncertainty is compounded by policy decisions becoming entangled in political, ethical and legal considerations [31] [32] [33] . As events surrounding the EBOV outbreak in West Africa illustrate, the importance placed on a specific EID threat at any one time also depends on who is setting the agenda [34] . Therefore to be successfully implemented, the One Health approach must address a range of socio-political, ethical and legal challenges that arise as a consequence of the spread of infection within and between species. Most of these challenges are not unique to One Health, but are shared by any approach to addressing EIDs. However these challenges frequently go unrecognized. In the following section we will clarify the nature of these issues so they can be addressed later in the paper.

(1)Socio-political challenges A focus on individualism, perceptions, short term solutions, populism and avoiding controversy are features of political life, which can prove challenging for EID policy and work against developing effective strategies for addressing EIDs.

Policy responses to EID events such as Nipah and Hendra virus infections (outlined in Box 1) tend to focus on necessary and proximal causes (what individuals do to put themselves at direct risk from an infectious pathogen) because the science about other aspects of EIDs is often complex, uncertain and lacking a clear narrative. Compounding this, our moral psychologies have evolved to respond to direct harmsnot indirect distal causal stories. Many people in liberal democracies believe that they are entitled to rights and freedoms that cannot be sacrificed merely for the marginal gains of others. As the discourse surrounding climate change and other wicked problems illustrates, this promotes technological solutions because they do not require substantive changes in human behaviours and underlying values systems. [35] The net result is that the policy focus for EID prevention and control tends to remain on individual behaviours rather than the structural drivers of emergence and transmissiona case example being the focus on vaccine development and the husbandry practices of horse owners in response to the zoonotic risks of Hendra virus [31, 36] ..

The political impetus for action in response to many EIDs is not necessarily scientific evidence but societal perceptions. Indeed, in the face of scientific uncertainty and ethical ambiguity, ideological perspectives and short-term political considerations often supplant efforts to devise effective long-term interventions [28, 37] .

Political imperatives to avoid, or at least minimise, public concern whilst dealing with EIDs can also prove challenging. In the case of BSE, powerful interests dominated early government responses, leading policymakers to make decisions that avoided public controversy, but had major economic consequences. As the crisis unfolded, expertise became politicized leading to conflict between agencies and policy inconsistency between health communication strategies and the measures being taken to minimize the risks to human health [38] . Even when the link between BSE and vCJD became clear, existing feed bans were poorly enforced and risk communication was dominated by fear of public panic [39] ; even as the decision was made to remove all potential sources of human infection from the UK food supply, messages were confused and policy implementation impeded by poor co-ordination between agencies [28] .

A common but problematic response to EID threats has been to invoke the precautionary principle. Roughly speaking, the precautionary principle can be applied in situations where human activities create a scientifically plausible, but uncertain, risk of significant harm. In response the principle advocates that actions ought to be taken to avoid or reduce the harm, and that these actions need to be proportionate to the seriousness of the potential harm. In other word, in the absence of evidence take a conservative approach.

However applying the precautionary principle to EIDs in an attempt to protect the public can result in what, in retrospect, amounts to an excessive response. This occurred with attempts to control Nipah infection, where significant damage was inflicted on industry, livelihoods and the economy. Similarly, experience with highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 in China and SE-Asia showed that overzealous policy responses can destroy livelihoods and threaten food supplies [40, 41] . In Vietnam alone, almost 40 million birds were culled in 2004 in an attempt to eradicate HPAI. Although many birds were owned by large commercial operations, others were kept by 'backyard' farmers and villagers. Mass culling of poultry appears decisive, but places excessive burdens on vulnerable populations, is ineffective in the context of extensive 'backyard' poultry farming and can, in fact, promote the spread of disease [42] . A similar scenario is currently playing out with Rabies control in Bali.

Unfortunately, the precautionary principle and analytic tools and concepts appealed to in this domain, fail to deliver what is required at times of EID outbreaks since they do not advance public engagement or help resolve disagreements in times of uncertainty [43, 44] . Philosophical critiques of the precautionary principle applied to EIDs have also shown its limitations, including that defining criteria by which to judge a threat as plausible and a response proportionate, often will only substitute one uncertainty for two others [45] .

(2)Ethical challenges

The effectiveness of an EID control policy will depend on the context of its implementation and particularly its alignment with stakeholder and public values [17, 46] . In modern liberal democracies at least some consensus over what is in the public interest and an understanding of the values which support it, is therefore required for the successful implementation of EID responses. Yet this is precisely what has been lacking in outbreaks where fracture lines, differences and value conflicts have become apparent. When the stakes are high, evidence and the implications of actions are uncertain, the situation is complex and resources may be limited but where decisions need to be made, differences are exposed. Such differences could be around beliefs about how to deal with ecological and environmental issues, which may conflict with the importance people attach to public goods, protection of individual autonomy and animal welfare [47]. These conditions of crisis and division are conducive to undesirable consequences including public fear, mistrust, misinformation and non-compliance with public health directives. For example in Canada during the SARS crisis, leaders were unprepared for the range of ethical conflicts that arose, including those over: individual freedom versus the common good; healthcare workers' safety versus their duty to care for the sick; and economic costs versus the need for containment [48] . As indicated in Box 2, both the outbreak itself and fear that another outbreak could occur had significant economic consequences.

Any approach which hopes to successfully respond to EID threats, including a One Health approach, needs to address the ethical concerns articulated above. To this end, potentially conflicting values and logic must be negotiated to realise effective, sustainable and just solutions. Prioritisation and resource allocation require political processes based on fundamental ethical questions about what is valuable, what is to be protected and, ultimately, what is dispensable. To be effective, public policy must be consistent with the values of citizens to whom it is applied, otherwise it can become mired in controversy about whose values should prevail [31, 37, 49] . Therefore, one of the first and most important tasks of policy work is to establish how the public interest is best defined.

(3)Legal challenges

The legal environment in which EID policy is made and in which responses to outbreaks occur, presents its own set of challenges. The law surrounding EID responses in most jurisdictions is diffuse, complicated and often subject to re-interpretation on the basis of whose interests are given primacy at the time decisions are made. Moreover, in many countries different approaches by State/Provincial and local authorities, overlaid by Federal/National powers, complicate regulation so much that 'hard law' is often replaced by resort to 'soft law' of executive and administrative powers and international instruments, such as the International Health Regulations (IHR) [50] . This may add complexity and confusion to the EID regulatory structures, rather than facilitating public health responses to a new threat. Such confusion provides a salient reminder that even in 'global law' approaches to EIDs, the sovereign state remains the institution responsible for regulation and control [51] .

Public health law responses to EIDs tend to be oriented towards controlling cross-border pathogen transfer and community outbreaks rather than the underlying deficiencies and structural conditions from which the threats emerge. Other laws, such as environmental law, may be more useful in addressing structural conditions for emergence. Changes in land use and agricultural intensification in developing societies are major drivers of EID. However, the cost of laws that restrict development may be greater global health inequities, with consequential effects for health outcomes. In order to clarify EIDrelated legal tensions between economic development and health security, a more explicit recognition is needed of who are the primary beneficiaries and who bears the costs of a One Health approach to EIDs [52] .

Legal clarity around the frameworks designed to protect populations from EIDs is critical to providing an enabling infrastructure to co-ordinate and support the One Health-based work of policymakers, development planners, human and animal health-workers and biosecurity agencies.

The health of humans, animals, and ecosystems are interconnected. A One Health approach promises a better understanding of how to prevent and control EIDs at the human-animal-ecosystem interface. However the socio-political, ethical and legal challenges of EIDs illustrated above highlight how responses to infectious disease threats are intrinsically value laden. When a new infectious pathogen such as Hendra or Nipah virus first appears, or a known threat such as Rabies or Ebola encroaches on a new setting, there is limited scientific evidence or past experience to guide decisions or determine whether a planned response will be proportionate. Vastly different interpretations of EID events and their likely outcomes might be supported by the available data. Policymakers and practitioners therefore have little guidance as to what they should do when faced with a nascent infectious disease threat, only what they can do. As others [52] [53] [54] have cogently argued, they must therefore ask themselves: whose health is being prioritized; which public and which good are we seeking to protect?

Notwithstanding recognition of a need for complementary work on values-based questions that inevitably surround EID risks and EID control, the adoption of the One Health approach, so far, has not included development of a comprehensive, ethically-informed policy and implementation framework; this has limited its practical utility [9, 55] . Despite rhetorical and some financial support for One Health as the guiding ethos by which to address interconnected human, animal and environmental health issues, its impact will be minimal unless implications of uncertainty on, and potential conflicts between, human values and political processes are recognised and articulated. Any attempt to address these ethical and normative dimensions must take into account the dynamic nature of EID risk management. A policy that seems reasonable today may be inappropriate tomorrow, in light of new evidence. And when situations are uncertain, decision-makers inevitably fall back on their values. Therefore, a solid framework based on shared values is needed to support decision-making surrounding EIDs when ""evidence"" isor may beunreliable, and rapidly changing or fluid.

What is needed to guide a one health approach to EIDs?

To successfully meet the challenges described above, particularly the necessity to align EID policy with public values, a One Health approach needs to engage in the following.

(i) Social science and economic research to help catalogue and describe the drivers, mechanisms and social and political configurations through which EIDs become threats to human, animal and ecological health [56, 57] . The complex connections between individual social needs and the local socioeconomic context of affected or at-risk communities, need to be understood and addressed by policymaking processes. This should ensure that manifest injustice, livelihood-based decisions and other social and cultural factors do not undermine the effectiveness of favoured control measures. Without adequate knowledge of specific local arrangements, there is a danger that insufficiently nuanced or unified approaches to EIDs will actually undermine the heterogeneous relationships and contingent practices that make health possible in circumstances of structural disadvantage [56, 58] .

The social sciences are analytically broader and more policy focussed than the natural sciences. Whereas the natural sciences tend to frame infectious disease threats narrowly as matters of biological integrity and security, such that barrier technologies and hygiene practices dominate the logic of interventions [59] , social science approaches go beyond this. Building social scientific evidence for use in conjunction with natural scientific evidence about EIDs aligns with the growing realization that EID emergence is as much about the social and economic configuration of capital flow as it is about the biological features of host-pathogen interactions. Current approaches to the economic and structural drivers of EID emergence still presume that state and market neoliberalism is part of the natural order, even as evidence is mounting that these systems of development are central to the problem [60, 61] . Moreover, the current emphasis on microbiology and focus on newer molecular techniques to characterise pathogens, is drawing attention away from developing better understandings of the environmental, economic and social drivers of EIDs. While this is understandable given the desire for vaccines and drugs to solve EIDs, if One Health researchers and practitioners broaden their approach to causality to include upstream, social and economic systemic causes, questions and issues that have been traditionally bracketed or thought best avoided will become central to the cross-sectoral collaboration implied by One Health.

Framework (OHAF) needs to be pursued. Such a framework would catalogue case-based experiences and reflect the particular dynamics of specific EIDs, and promote inter-sectoral collaboration and knowledge synthesis, including integration of information about social, cultural and economic impacts, control measures and uncertainty [62, 63] . The framework would serve as a prompt to ensure that minority perspectives are represented and all relevant concerns are considered. An OHAF could provide a rubric for comparisons between outbreaks. This would allow the inherent complexities of economic and societal responses to EIDs to be compared, to inform policy processes. It is vital for discussions about EID prevention and control to have this kind of sound empirical foundation, because uncertainty and media coverage have the potential to drive bad policy.

Development of an OHAF could be facilitated by adopting well established and methodically rigorous processes such as Framework Analysis, produced by the National Centre for Social Research (UK) [19] , or Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis [MCDA] developed within the field of decision science [64] . In the first instance Framework Analysis would allow for systematic incorporation of the perspectives and contributions of different scholarly disciplines and expert stakeholders. Framework Analysis facilitates movement between different datasets, thematic areas, theoretical resources, and levels of abstraction without loss of conceptual clarity [65] . The Framework method is used to organize and manage research and interpretation through the process of summarization, which is codified into a robust and flexible matrix that allows the policymaker/researcher to analyze data both by case and theme. It is commonly used in areas such as health research, policy development and program evaluation. Equally, MCDA methods offer an alternative and potentially complementary approach to OHAF development. Comprised of a suite of analytic strategies, MCDA have been shown to be valuable tools for prioritization and decision-making in animal and human health [64] . MCDA provides a framework to compare policy alternatives with diverse and often intangible impacts, which can be particularly useful in determining and justifying the prioritization and mobilization of limited research and public health resources [66, 67] .

(iii)Genuine processes of public engagement across the developed and developing world are also essential to a successful One Health approach. These processes are not so much about engaging in deliberative democracy for policy decision-making, as about defining the principles and values that should guide decision-making. This means procedural inclusiveness alone is not enough to ensure transparency and reflexivity, to capture people's preferences and to effectively communicate with the public [68] .

The successful implementation of the One Health approach to EIDs will depend on public trust and cooperation. Public support for unpalatable measures is more likely if citizens understand the issues, and policy implementation reflects community values and preferences. To this end, citizens' juries have been employed in the UK, Australia, the US and elsewhere [69] [70] [71] [72] to explore similar issues and identify citizens' preferences. They represent informed public opinion better than other social research methods (e.g. surveys or focus groups) because they give participants factual information, bring them into a structured and constructive dialogue with experts, provide them with time to reflect and deliberate, and allow them to represent their views directly to policymakers. To be successful, One Health needs to be about more than disease prevention and control. The dynamic, unpredictable effects and risks to peoples' lives of EIDs necessitate a public health and biosecurity infrastructure equipped to address the ethical problems that arise. EID management must therefore be based on normative principles as well as local knowledge, operational experience and disease-specific scientific and economic evidence. This means that governments and policy-makers need to explain and justify the values that underlie decision-making and engage the public in discussions about ethical choices, so that when difficult decisions arise in the face of uncertainty, they will be accepted as fair and essential for the public good [47] . This necessitates that the guiding values and likely ethical choices need to be articulated in a formal statement in advance, as in the heat of emerging health threat, decision makers will be under pressure from many sources to 'do something quickly'.

(v)Integration of an OHAF and SPV with the IHR and relevant national health and biosecurity legislation is essential so that policymakers and practitioners can dynamically test their decision-making.

Our response should of course be based on the best scientific evidence, but EIDs are not just scientific issues, they also have significant social, ethical and animal rights dimensions. Experiences of infectious disease threats such as BSE/vCJD and SARS indicate that there have been problems combining evidence and human values at both local and policy levels [28, 73] . The communicability of diseases between species raises social, ethical and legal issues that have not been clearly elucidated or adequately addressed. Our response to nonhuman animal disease is not determined solely by bio-scientific knowledge; the way people and animals live with and amongst each other is also shaped by social norms, economic imperatives and human values. In matters of public health it is no longer sufficient to ask what works and what is the strength of the evidence; we also need to ask ethical questions about how we should seek to live, and what is the right thing to do [74] [75] [76] . Consensus about the best approaches to EID control and prevention are not always possible, however an agreed set of guiding principles and values can be a means to ensure dialogue, if not always agreement.

The development of an OHAF and SPV will also promote clearer communication about public risk. Significant EID threats have major implications for distribution of scarce resources, access to and regulation of health services and maintenance of social order. As described above it is also clear that policy and legal responses to EID threats are often highly politicised and compromised by failure to communicate clearly with the public. Policymakers responsible for responding to disasters such as EIDs typically find that there is a dissonance between transparency that may appear alarmist versus withholding information to avoid panic. Regardless of advice, people will make their own decisions based on their interpretation of available information, from formal and informal channels. So public communication, before and during a public health emergency, is frequently as important as political decisions and regulatory changes [39, 77] . This means that, to be effective, a One Health approachlike any EID policymust deal with scientific uncertainty, whilst addressing the socio-political, ethical and legal dimensions of effective health communication and intervention strategies [3] . By exposing decision-making processes to reveal the scientific and normative uncertainties and ethical complexities, the introduction of an OHAF and a SPV into One Health theory and practice may incorporate iterative deliberation and learning into EID policy processes.

(vi)Finally, One Health must be about genuine reform rather than merely rhetoric. A One Health approach rests on the assumption that the cross-sectoral integration of expertise, research methodologies and public health infrastructure will inevitably improve capacity for disease-risk prediction and effective intervention. However, calls for increased intersectoral co-operation by public health practitioners, clinicians, scientists and policy-makers are not a new phenomenon. For example in the 1990s advocates of ""new public health"" called for health authorities to turn their attention to the social, economic and environmental factors that affect healthrequiring the realignment and policy integration of Health Departments with other government agencies [78, 79] . Unfortunately in this case as others, attempts at promoting inter-sectoral approaches rarely move beyond rhetoriceven when driven by the best intentions and supported by substantial resources [80] [81] [82] .

The problem is that arguments that promote the need for greater co-operation between sectors tend to focus on the likely benefits of collaboration rather than what reform would entailthat is, what needs to be done organisationally and politically to achieve the desired outcomes [83] . Established 'sectors'whether orientated towards human or animal health, agriculture or the environmenthave genealogies, traditions and rationalities of ""what we are here for"" that have been shaped by social, political and administrative processes [11] . As institutions, they are philosophically and structurally resistant to change that diverts resources and re-orients practices away from their own sectoral priorities [83] . In essence, they have their own constituencies to serve. As a consequence, establishment and implementation of mechanisms that enhance information-sharing, collaboration and inter-sectoral co-operation, such as working groups and interdepartmental committees, have rarely delivered the outcomes promised in the past. Responses to BSE/vCJD in the UK [28] , HPAI in South East Asia [11] , and recent case studies of One Health programs in Uganda [84] , suggest that more work is needed to coordinate implementation and overcome sectoral interests. The complexity of the problems posed by EIDs mean that organising effective control and prevention programs will require genuine cross-sectoral integration and, potentially, re-sectoring of some institutional and professional responsibilities [62] . And as the recent Ebolavirus disease outbreak illustrates, there must also be sustained social and political willingness to achieve control.

If One Health is genuinely the way forward, as we believe it is, then we should do more than talk about its potential benefits. Without genuine cross-sectoral reform and a radical broadening of the scope of its inquiry into how specific social, cultural and spatial configurations promote the risks of EID emergence, One Health is in danger of becoming merely a rhetorical strategy to avoid conflict between its core disciplines, whereby practitioners, researchers and policymakers will espouse the methodological and moral case for interdisciplinary collaboration yet remain in their silos [11] . Even if these barriers are overcome the One Health approach will only succeed if it explicitly acknowledges local contingent and contextual dimensions of disease risk and disease expression and the political impacts of scientific uncertainty, while also seeking to accommodate the values and preferences of 'at risk' and affected individuals. Further, we suggest that decision making around EIDs requires an ethical framework that reflects the values of affected and 'at risk' communities, privileges justice, takes account of human flourishing, protects animal health and welfare and is developed in consultation with relevant stakeholders and the public.

EID risk management is a major global public health issue to which One Health represents a promising approach, but its potential benefits have not been fully realised [53, 55] . Despite recognition that the social and cultural dimensions are critical to the success of One Health, social scientists are yet to play a central or substantive role in shaping research programs and interventions [12, 13] . At the same time as the literature on the ethics of pandemic responses and preparedness continues to grow, the One Health approach to EIDs has received little formal ethical consideration. Even the most ethically attuned existing frameworks for biosecurity and infection prevention and control provide only general operational principles that do not guide actions in times of uncertainty. If One Health is to be meaningful − let alone successful − more attention must be paid to how these different types of knowledge are brought together and brought to public attention. Effective responses to EIDs are likely to be delayed or precluded unless all the socio-political, ethical and legal implications are articulated, publicly debated and − as far as possible − resolved in advance. Policy makers and public health experts need a set of principles and values, developed and articulated prior to an outbreak that explicitly acknowledge the preferences of affected communities and can guide integration of new evidence into decision-making processes in a dynamic manner.

Informed public against false rumor in the social media era: Focusing on social media dependency,"This study explores how the public's belief in false rumors about Middle East Respiratory Syndrome that spread across South Korea related to their accuracy-oriented information seeking as well as the moderating effects of people's reasons for using social networking services (SNS). The survey results show that perceived credibility of false rumors did not affect accuracy-oriented information seeking. However, a significant result was shown in the moderating effect, such that SNS informational dependency interacted with false rumor credibility on accuracy-oriented information seeking. Overall, this study specifically identifies and discusses differences in SNS dependency and accuracy-oriented information seeking in the context of rumor communication to examine the construction of an informed public. Theoretical contributions of this study are discussed.","People often tend to seek more information in order to decrease their uncertainties in chaotic situations during which rumors are being widely spread (Wilson, 1997 (Wilson, , 1999 . Defined as finding 'missing' information, information seeking is motivated by people's necessity to search scant information (Case, 2012) . In rumor communication, an informed public is hard to be formed if people do not seek accurate facts. During the spread of false rumors that could generate major social problems (Tanaka et al., 2012) , a lack of accuracy-oriented information seeking can produce detrimental effects on a society because people may remain as a passive bystander, not an active searcher, letting false rumors confuse a society. Furthermore, if they show passive attitudes amid circulation of false rumors, social chaos is exacerbated.

The potential negative consequences of beliefs in false rumors in terms of information seeking are numerous. People should make the effort to actively check the accuracy of false rumors rather than passively responding to the rumors as bystanders and leaving those to be spread. This paper defines accuracy-oriented information seeking as a cognitive aspect of information seeking by finding accurate information (accuracy-aimed). People with accuracy goals tend to collect a wide range of information, thus reaching the most desired conclusions without prejudice (Hart et al., 2009; Taber and Lodge, 2006) . Past research shows that rebutting the forged rumors, one of accuracy-aimed behaviors, could mitigate the negative impact of false rumors (Tanaka et al., 2012) .

Research on the relationship between rumor and information seeking has rarely been conducted. Hence, the present study aims to establish the rumor communication model in the era of social network service (SNS) by exploring how perceived credibility of rumors affects accuracy-oriented information seeking. Indeed, past research which focuses on the effect of general messages credibility and information seeking shows mixed findings. Some studies argue that low credibility of the message motivates people to seek more 2. Literature review

Rumors are defined as unverified messages that circulate throughout the public (Sunstein, 2009 ) and that are easily formed during risky situations such as floods and terrorism, during which people are plunged into chaos that heightens their concerns over dangers (Danzig et al., 1958; Oh et al., 2010) . Particularly, false rumors, which will be discussed in this study, have been noted as the main causes for social problems in high risky situations (Tanaka et al., 2012) . False rumors are defined as baseless rumors spread during the crisis and later confirmed to be not true (Mendoza et al., 2010) . It is not a new phenomenon that false rumors are circulated during disasters (i.e., Prasad, 1935; Sinha, 1952) because people tend to obviate their uncertainties by spreading the false rumors under the risky situations (DiFonzo and Bordia, 2007) . This study will discuss about false rumors related to the spread of MERS virus.

In today's society, rumors are heavily spread through SNS. In the era of Web 2.0, when people are interconnected through twoway online social media, rumors are spreading faster than ever before. SNSs facilitate false information to be spread due to their fastforwarding characteristic (Adachi and Toda, 2015; Zhang and Leung, 2014) , and consequently creates nationwide panic (Tanaka et al., 2012) . However, despite these negative aspects of social media, some studies have argued that SNS can function as useful means of communication in the context of rumor communication. For example, Twitter can allow real-time updates and information transmission during disasters and other emergencies (Mills et al., 2009) . These contradictions show that the role of SNS in rumor communication should be thoroughly examined as the spread of rumors using SNS is increasing.

In the context of rumors, perceived credibility of rumors is regarded as participant's perception of the rumor's veracity or likelihood of being true and is linked with how people perceive and react to rumors (Grewal et al., 1994; Sternthal et al., 1978) . In this vein, it is important to examine rumor credibility in seeking how informed public is formed, which has rarely been examined in extant research. This study opens the gateway for research on the effects of rumor credibility by predicting diverse results. As previous research noted (Tanaka et al., 2012) , if people easily believe false rumors, they are not likely to find corrective information that are critical in blocking the spread of false rumors. That is, people with high beliefs in false rumors can easily accept the message without having awareness. However, another possibility is that high level of false rumor credibility can facilitate information seeking behaviors by stimulating people's curiosity, which could even lead them to find more accurate information. They may also hold cynical attitudes toward rumors and ignore them, not trying to check facts. Although we can predict different possible results of false rumors credibility, those remain as unsolved issues as no prior studies have empirically examined these possibilities. Hence, now is the time for communication scholars to examine the perceived credibility of false rumors and how the credibility functions in forming an informed public against the spread of false rumors through social media.

Information seeking is defined as ""a conscious effort to acquire information in response to a need or gap in one's knowledge"" (Case, 2012, p.5) , which posits that audiences are active searcher. When facing risks, people tend to seek abundant and accurate information to mitigate their uncertainties, as Allport and Lepkin (1945, p.14) stated, ""the more information he has, and the more carefully he thinks, the less chance that he will be led into believing by his inner, and often unrecognized, impulses."" However, merely spending a lot of time to seek information does not fully explain the meaning of information seeking. Especially regarding rumor communication, efforts to find accurate information against false rumors takes high importance (Crescimbene et al., 2012) , which is termed as accuracy-oriented information seeking in this study, because those effortful behaviors can prevent the circulation of false rumors. This study defines the accuracy-oriented information seeking as people's efforts to find accurate information.

There is a clear difference between accuracy-oriented information seeking and a general term of information seeking; the former stems from cognitive gratification needs but the latter encompasses cognitive gratification as well as people's diverse needs in a more generic term (i.e., hedonic needs, social integrative needs, etc.). That being said, accuracy-oriented information seeking is oriented toward finding information that can fill-in person's intellectual and cognitive needs. In contrast, information seeking does not take account of people's specific needs, only measuring how much information people found; but this can include diverse motivations for seeking more information such as to have fun, join societal relationships, or check the accuracy of the messages.

Theoretically, motivated reasoning theory further supports the explanation of accuracy goal-directed information-seeking (Johnson, 1997) . According to the concept of motivated reasoning, an individual is motivated to achieve goals when they process information (Chaiken et al., 1996) . Of the two dimensions of motivation (i.e., accuracy and direction), accuracy goals heighten cross-cutting exposure while lessening selective exposure, thus prompting people to collect diverse pieces of information to reach the most accurate conclusions (Fiske and Taylor, 1991; Hart et al., 2009; Taber and Lodge, 2006) . As noted in politics studies, accuracy motivated individuals try to search for various issues of candidates and evaluate each candidate's characteristics without having any bias (Leeper and Slothuus, 2014) . In contrast, people with directional goals tend to selectively expose themselves to information that corresponds with their opinions. Such directional motivated reasoning affects rumor rebuttals; that is, an individual is likely to ignore the rumor which contradicts his or her beliefs (Kunda, 1990) . Following these discussions, the concept of the accuracy-oriented information seeking, a developed term to be used in this study, corresponds to having accuracy goals when finding additional information in terms of the motivated reasoning theory. Furthermore, although studies have shown that accuracy motivation reduces congeniality bias (selecting one's supporting view rather than opposing view) while increasing uncongeniality bias (selecting one's opposing view rather than supporting view) (Hart et al., 2009) because it facilitates people's tendencies to uncover the truth by holding objectiveness and open-mind (Chaiken et al., 1989; Kunda, 1990) , no research has not directly linked the discussions of motivated reasoning theory with information seeking.

In context of rumor communication, past studies have revealed that verifying information and rebutting false rumors which is a core behavior of accuracy-aimed information seeking (Leeper and Slothuus, 2014) , make people have critical thoughts (e.g., Allport and Postman, 1947; Bordia et al., 2000; Iyer and Debevec, 1991) , which could ultimately curb the negative impact of false rumors (Tanaka et al., 2012) . Therefore, seeking information with accuracy in mind is essential in minimizing the circulation of false rumors. Such accuracy-oriented information seeking is a step toward finding alternative accurate messages to eliminate uncertainties and to judge whether rumors contain truthful information or not. Particularly, Shibutani (1966) argued that under the situation of great uncertainty and danger, people are accuracy motivated because they realize accurate intelligence determines their survivals. Despite these discussions, it is still unknown whether people sought accurate information in a reality-based risky situation, which raises the needs to focus on the actual incident, MERS virus, in this study to find out answers for the unsolved matters.

The underlying assumption of information seeking behavior is that individuals actively seek additional information if they are uncertain about the information they have (Wilson, 2000) . From this perspective, high perceived credibility of false rumors decreases motivations to find additional information because people might feel certain about the false rumor contents. Given that information insufficiency is a premise of low perceived credibility of that information (Flanagin and Metzger, 2000) , if individuals think that rumors lack sufficient information with having low level of credibility of the given rumors, they would seek more accurate information (Case, 2012) .

As discussed before, we differentiate a general term of information seeking from the accuracy goal directed information seeking, and assert that individuals who are engaged in accuracy-oriented information seeking make effortful behaviors to verify the accuracy of rumors. Metzger and Flanagin (2015) argued that different information seeking situations are motivated by different people's needs to search information. For example, people's accuracy goals (i.e., searching for information about important health-related issues) move them to seek out accurate information but other goals (i.e., searching for information about music groups) do not (Metzger and Flanagin, 2015) . Particularly, chaotic and dangerous situations also motivate people to be accuracy-aimed (Shibutani, 1966) , but no research to date has addressed the relationship between perceived credibility of rumors and accuracy-oriented information seeking under risky situations. Hence, we take this matter as the first research question.

RQ1. In a high risk situation, how is the perceived credibility of rumors associated with the accuracy-oriented information seeking?

.

The conceptualization of SNS dependency has evolved from the media system dependency theory (MSD) proposed by Ball-Rokeach and DeFleur (1976) . MSD explains that mass media affects individuals because they rely on media to achieve their everyday goals. The theory presumes the media, audiences, and society form an organic, interdependent structure (DeFleur and Ball-Rokeach, 1989 ) in a tripartite relationship. Similarly, research has demonstrated that SNS dependency affects individuals' achievement of personal goals Kim and Shin, 2013) . SNS dependency generally comprise six subsets that are not mutually exclusive: personal understanding, social understanding, personal action orientation, social action orientation, solitary play, and interaction play, which refer to the goals that individuals aim to attain by using media (Ball-Rokeach, 1985; Kim and Jung, 2014; Kim et al., 2015; Loges and Ball-Rokeach, 1993) . The different subsets of SNS dependency posit that individuals have different purposes for using SNS. Among various subsets of SNS dependency, we adopt SNS social dependency and SNS informational dependency as core values of SNS uses.

First, people mainly use SNSs to build or maintain social relationships (Ancu and Cozma, 2009; Chu and Kim, 2011) , which is termed as SNS social dependency in this study. SNS social dependency is regarded as people's tendencies to depend on SNSs to gain social interactive gratification through interpersonal communication (Ha et al., 2015, p. 432) . In this vein, SNS social action orientation dependency and SNS interaction play dependency commonly explain the core reasons for using SNS as social connectivity. SNS social action orientation dependency indicates that people depend on SNS in their daily lives in order to identify better ways to communicate with others, to consider how to improve relationships with acquaintances, and to figure out the ways to communicate with others in important or difficult situations . In the same vein, SNS interaction play dependency explains that people depend on SNS as something to do with their friends or to participate in enjoyable events through SNS Kim and Jung, 2014) . These two subsets collectively explain SNS users' social interactions which makes individuals to ""feel at ease and comfortable to engage in interpersonal communication exchanges through the technology-enabled space"" (Phang et al., 2009, p.729) .

On the other hand, people could rely on SNS for obtaining information to satisfy their cognitive needs. In this study, we newly term people's dependencies on SNS to acquire knowledge as SNS informational dependency that focuses on cognitive gratification through SNS usage. Indeed, linking between media dependency and information acquisition is a not new topic. Existing research has highlighted the role of media in helping knowledge acquisition (Ha et al., 2015; Humphreys, 2007) . Media users try to understand a society and their communities by relying on news media (whether it is a print, online, or television) (Ball-Rokeach et al., 1984; Loges and Ball-Rokeach, 1993; Patwardhan and Yang, 2003) . For example, they use Facebook or Twitter as an information source of news. Patwardhan and Yang (2003) found a positive relationship between social understanding and online news reading, concluding that people rely on Internet to understand the current society. These lines of research support the need to explore people's dependency on media for information acquisition purposes. These discussions imply that SNS per se do not affect individuals' behaviors. Rather, it is individuals' different motivations for using SNS that affect behaviors (Gil de Zúñiga et al., 2011) .

As individuals' motivations for using SNS vary, SNS social dependency and informational dependency have clear differences. That is, while some individuals use SNS for building their social relationships, some use SNS as important information sources, spending time obtaining information through SNS (Wise et al., 2010) . SNS informational dependent users focus on gaining information while SNS social dependent users depend on SNS to better understand their communities. That is, SNS social dependency includes both SNS cognitive and hedonic gratification while SNS informational dependency merely focuses on cognitive gratification (Ha et al., 2015) . Numerous studies have found that using SNS for social purposes has positive effects on information acquisition (cognitive gratification) as well as enjoyment (hedonic gratification) (Ha et al., 2015; Humphreys, 2007; Lin and Lu, 2011) . Particularly, SNS users who are relationship-oriented decrease boredom and feel enjoyment while engaging on social interactions, thus obtaining hedonic benefits from the media (Okazaki, 2008) , as affective social exchange theory noted that engaging in interpersonal communication has a positive effect on affective outcomes by satisfying hedonic gratification (Choo and Petrick, 2014; Ha et al., 2015) . Unlike SNS social dependency, SNS informational dependency is exclusively related to cognitive gratification, such as searching for information, learning, and knowledge acquisition (Nambisan and Baron, 2007) .

In this light, two types of SNS dependencies should act differently in the relationship between perceived credibility of rumors and accuracy-oriented information seeking. Compared to SNS social dependent users, SNS informational dependent users can be more pertained to the accuracy-oriented information seeking to fully understand their current situations with accurate knowledge. Following this line of logic, we postulate that the effects of perceived credibility of rumors on information-seeking behavior will differ depending on the different levels of SNS dependency under the high risk situation in which MERS occurred. Specifically, we expect that persons who rely on SNS for their information will be more motivated to verify facts than persons who rely on SNS for social purposes. Based on these expectations, the hypotheses and research questions are posed: H1. In a high risk situation, SNS dependency (social and informational) will moderate the relationship between perceived credibility of rumors and the accuracy-oriented information seeking.

RQ2. Does SNS social dependency moderate the relationship between the perceived credibility of rumors and the accuracyoriented information seeking? If so, does the moderating effect of SNS social dependency differ from the moderating effect of SNS informational dependency?

.

To summarize the above hypotheses and research questions, the proposed designed model is presented in Fig. 1 below.

MERS hit South Korea in 2015, and the whole nation has been suffering from MERS since May 20 of that year; of the infected 186, 38 people have died of the epidemic, the largest outbreak outside of the Middle East.

Over two months, the public was afraid of being infected by the syndrome and was in panic. The South Korean government was criticized by the public for not handling the syndrome in a timely manner. In addition, the government did not immediately disclose key information about the status of the syndrome to the public. According to a Washington Post report released on June 8, 2015, the government specifically did not share the list of hospitals where the infected had been treated, which contributed to the people's lack of faith in the government. The nation's former health minister Moon Hyung-pyo made official apologies to the public at a news conference, saying, 'The spread could have ended much earlier if we had reacted more thoroughly in the initial stage. I feel very sorry about that' (Seo and Fifield, 2015) .

Amid growing uncertainties and fear among the public, rumors were circulated across the nation, largely via social media. For instance, one rumor said, 'The MERS patient was confirmed at Yeouido St. Mary's Hospital so you should not visit' and was spread through SNS, but the hospital later refuted the message (Jhoo, 2015) . That applying petroleum jelly would prevent MERS infection was also disseminated among online users; calling himself a Middle East expert, one user posted in an online message that a fatsoluble substance such as petroleum jelly would block the water-soluble MERS from permeating throughout the body. The message was, however, countered by medical experts (Ahn, 2015) . Such false rumors created chaos around the country, confusing the public.

This study collected rumors that were actually spread during the MERS attacks in South Korea and conducted an online survey of South Koreans in their 20 s through a South Korean research company. Previous research on social media shows that more than 90 percent of undergraduates are Facebook users (Lampe et al., 2008) with largely focusing on college students (e.g., Stutzman, 2006) . With the existing research in mind, this study assumed that social media dependency is explicitly shown among young adults and expanded participants to twenties across the nation. This is because MERS was not a small issue for certain universities but a huge issue for the whole nation (Song, 2015) . The company used proportionate-stratified sampling weighted on gender based on the 2015 South Korean in their 20 s population census data (723,000 for men and 725,000 for women for a total of population in 20 s; 155 for men and 157 for women participated in the survey). Participants were randomly selected from the company's survey poll. Survey participants received a small monetary reward (approximately $1) as a form of appreciation for their participation in the research.

Before survey begins, researchers first asked, 'The below are false rumors about MERS that spread through SNS in 2015. Have you ever received at least one of the five rumors presented below?' The survey respondents were confined to those who had received at least one false MERS rumor through SNS among the five rumors which were presented. A total of 312 persons answered the survey questionnaires. After invalid answers were eliminated, the survey data from 297 respondents were analysed. Detailed items for each variable are presented below.

Researchers asked respondents, 'During the spread of MERS, how much credibility did you place in the aforementioned MERS rumor messages?' The perceived credibility of the MERS rumors was measured in the current study with six questions: 'At that time…' (a) I thought the rumors that I received were believable; (b) I thought the rumors that I received contained accurate information; (c) I thought that the rumors that I received were based on truth; (d) I thought that the rumors that I received contained enough information; (e) I thought that the rumors that I received provided objective information; (f) I believed the rumors that I received (Flanagin and Metzger, 2000; Roberts, 2010; Rosenthal, 1971) . These questions were answered on a 5-point Likert-type scale that ranged from 1 (not at all agree) to 5 (very strongly agree). Internal consistency for the perceived credibility of the rumors was measured using Cronbach's α, with reliability coefficients of 0.953. After summing all scores of the items, we divided by the number of items to create the mean value. (M = 2.58, SD = 0.89). 3.2.2. SNS dependency (social, informational) Following Kim et al. (2015) , we measured SNS dependency on a 5-point scale that ranged from 1 (not at all useful) to 5 (very useful). SNS social dependency measurement items were: (a) consider how to act with friends, relatives, or people you work with; (b) get ideas about how to approach others in important or difficult situations; (c) have something to do with your friends; (d) have fun with family or friends; (e) be a part of social events you enjoy without having to be there (Cronbach's α = 0.829. M = 3.21, SD = 0.75). In contrast, SNS informational dependency, which focuses on obtaining information by using SNS to better understand the situation, was composed of three items: (a) I usually get information through SNS; (b) I utilize information gained from SNS; (c) I immediately update information received from SNS. All items were measured on a 5-point scale that ranged from 1 (not at all agree) to 5 (strongly agree) and calculated as a mean value (Cronbach's α = 0.664. M = 3.19, SD = 0.75).

As noted, information seeking is defined as people's overall information-related activities (Wilson, 1999 ) motivated by the desire to find missing information (Case, 2012) . Given that the current study particularly aims to examine the accuracy-oriented information seeking, the items were rated on a 5-point Likert-type scale that ranged from 1 (not at all agree) to 5 (very strongly agree). Referring to previous studies (i.e., Hart et al., 2009) , I created the items to measure how carefully the respondents sought additional information after they heard the MERS rumors in order to find accurate information, asking ""After I received the MERS rumors, I made the effort to…"" (a) find out more facts about the message contents; (b) check whether the messages contained factual information; (c) find rebuttals regarding the message contents; (d) check the accuracy of the information; (e) reach the best conclusion; (f) know additional facts about the message contents. Items were summed and divided by a number of items (Cronbach's α = 0.914. M = 3.16, SD = 1.09).

As the control variables, this study used gender (0 = male, 1 = female), the perceived credibility of the South Korean government, and feelings toward MERS. The perceived credibility of the government was included because trust in the South Korean government was closely linked with the nationwide spread of rumors, such that low trust in the government prompted the spread of rumors. The item was measured using a 5-point Likert-type scale (1 = do not trust the government at all, 5 = strongly trust the government). Lastly, feelings toward MERS were measured using four elements: uncertainty, fear, anxiety, and feeling terrified and also were measured on a 5-point scale (1 = do not feel at all, 5 = strongly feel), based on the consideration that different levels of feelings affect information seeking (Johnson et al., 2002) . Table 1 shows the demographic profiles of the respondents in the current study. Survey responses from a total of 297 participants (male 49.8%, female 50.2%) who were in their twenties were analysed in the study, and the respondents reported perceiving the South Korean government's credibility as relatively low (M = 1.98, SD = 0.87). The mean value of the respondents' feelings toward MERS-uncertainty, fear, anxiety, and feeling terrified-was high above the median (M = 3.42, SD = 0.98) (See Table 2 ).

Partial correlational analyses, controlling for gender, South Korean government credibility, and feelings toward MERS, revealed that all of the analysed variables have low level of correlations. The correlation value between rumor credibility and SNS social dependency (r = 0.047, p = ns), rumor credibility and accuracy-oriented seeking (r = 0.059, p = ns), SNS informational dependency and accuracy-oriented seeking (r = 0.108, p = ns) was not significant. Meanwhile, SNS informational dependency showed a significant relationship with SNS social dependency (r = 0.319, p < .001) and rumor credibility (r = 0.314, p < .001) at low levels. Table 1 Descriptive statistics for the demographic and other control variables (N = 297). 

In order to examine the effect of the independent variables on the dependent variable and the interaction effects of SNS dependency, this study used hierarchal multiple regression from Step 1 through Step 3. We first entered gender, the South Korean government's credibility, and feelings toward MERS in Step 1. The independent variable and moderators were entered in Step 2. Then, the interactions were entered in

Step 3. Before we tested for any interaction effects, the perceived credibility of rumors and the SNS dependency values were all mean-centered in order to reduce the variance inflation factor and consequently displayed no multicollinearity (Field, 2009) .

The effect of rumor credibility and the moderating effects of SNS dependency on the accuracy-oriented information seeking were tested in order to examine RQ1, H1, and RQ2. All of the control variables were found to influence the accuracy-oriented information seeking (gender: β = −0.122, t = −2.074. p < .05; government credibility: β = 0.101, t = 1.774. p < .10; feelings: β = 0.329, t = 5.353. p < .001). The findings indicated that women were more likely than men to seek additional information with the aim of verifying the accuracy of the rumors. Additionally, people with strong beliefs in the government and more negative feelings toward the syndrome sought additional information to verify the accuracy of the rumors. RQ1 concerns whether the credibility of rumors would be associated with people's seeking additional information to verify the accuracy of the rumors. The results showed that rumor credibility did not affect accuracy-oriented information seeking (see Table 3 ).

Then, we added regression results in Table 3 to ModGraph-I program Ver. 3.0 developed by Jose (2013) . As shown in the graph, the three straight lines represent different categories of SNS informational dependency (high, mid, low). Regarding H1 and RQ2, SNS informational dependency interacted with rumor credibility (β = 0.107, t = 1.915. p = .056). The P-value of the R 2 change in Step 3 was found to be marginally significant at the traditional 0.05 level, indicating that the moderators statistically affected the relationship between rumor credibility and the accuracy-oriented information seeking. However, SNS social dependency was not found to be a moderator in the accuracy-oriented information seeking. These findings partially supported H2. Fig. 2 presents how SNS informational dependency moderated the relationship between rumor credibility and the accuracyoriented information seeking. The lines depicted in the graph show that high levels of SNS informational dependency had a stronger effect on the positive relationship between rumor credibility and the accuracy-oriented information seeking than lower levels. The interaction indicates that users who depend on SNS for information were more affected by rumor credibility than participants who did not rely on SNS for information when finding accurate information regarding the MERS. For the respondents who did not use SNS Table 2 Partial correlation result for analysed variables.

J. Lee, Y. Choi Telematics and Informatics 35 (2018 ) 1071 -1081 mainly to seek information, their beliefs in the rumors had little impact on their accuracy-oriented information seeking.

The primary objectives of this study were to better comprehend rumor communication in the SNS era and to explore how rational communication was actually constructed during the 2015 spread of MERS in South Korea. Specifically, this study set a goal to examine how false rumor credibility affects accuracy-oriented information seeking and further, whether SNS social and informational dependency moderate this relationship. Based on the assertion that accuracy-oriented information seeking is essential in a desirable society where deliberative democracy is materialized by an informed public (Weeks, 2000) , this study began with the premise that it is important to learn how people seek additional accurate information after they hear false rumors that are later found to be not true. Hence, this paper placed emphasis on accuracy-oriented information seeking based on previous arguments that accuracy goals help people to reach the most desirable conclusions (Chaiken et al., 1996) and have critical viewpoints toward rumors (Crescimbene et al., 2012) .

Overall, the findings for the proposed hypothesis and research questions were as follows. With regard to RQ1, regarding the relationship between rumor credibility and accuracy-oriented information seeking, rumor credibility did not influence accuracyoriented information seeking. This result implies that when people believe rumors, they may find more information to gratify their interests and curiosity (hedonic gratification) or to build a sense of closeness (integrative gratification), rather than to acquire accurate knowledge (cognitive gratification). Particularly in a risky situation, high levels of perceived rumor credibility may prompt curiosity and interest in the contents of rumors, leading people to seek additional information to satisfy their information needs. As behaviors of spreading rumors stem from the feelings of curiosity and intimacy with others (Fine et al., 2005) , those who have high credibility of rumors also want to feel close intimacy with others and to satisfy curiosities by searching over what others have talked over the rumors. This result represents that people do not always seek for accurate information when they are uncertain.

The culture as well as politics of South Korea can also explain the non-significant result between rumor credibility and accuracyoriented information seeking. After an outbreak of MERS, the then conservative South Korean government was found to control key public information, generating people's concerns, anger, and anxiety (Power, 2015) . Given such confusing situations, rumor credibility itself could have not led people to find accurate information. Rather, many other factors including political orientation (conservative or liberal) may prompt accuracy-oriented information seeking. In general, as liberal people tend to distrust the current South Korean government compared to conservative side, they may try to find more accurate information, regardless of how much rumors credibility they have. Additionally, the collectivistic culture of South Korea can cause them to seek out information in order to more satisfy their hedonic needs instead of cognitive needs. People living in a collectivist culture tend to put more emphasis on intermingling such as relationships with family, friends, colleagues, and etc. (Cho and Cheon, 2005; Kim et al., 1998) . Therefore, they may want to stick with their acquaintances by getting know more about rumors-related stories. In this sense, rumor fact-checking can be done by many other factors, rather than perceived credibility of rumors.

Regarding H1 and RQ2 which questioned the moderating effect of SNS dependency on the relationship between rumor credibility and the accuracy-oriented information seeking, SNS informational dependency showed an interaction effect with rumor credibility on the accuracy-oriented information seeking. Cognitive gratification stems from the U&G theory offers a good starting point for explaining how SNS informational dependency moderates the relationship between perceived credibility of rumors and the accuracyoriented information seeking. It can be inferred from the finding that people who use SNS mainly for obtaining information and have high beliefs in SNS rumors perceive the rumors as imperative information rather than merely social gossips. Once SNS informational dependent users believe rumors, they feel more needs to gratify their desires to learn, which prompt their motivations to find accurate information. Their perceptions of rumor credibility affect their desires to find accurate information because they use SNS for verifying J. Lee, Y. Choi Telematics and Informatics 35 (2018 ) 1071 -1081 the contents of rumors and for acquiring more knowledge and information, focusing on cognitive gratification. For SNS informational dependent users, high levels of credibility of rumors reflects need for cognition, which explains the extent to which people think deeply about received information, thus making an effort to assess the information critically (Metzger and Flanagin, 2015) . Also, the credibility of rumors motivates SNS informational users to think flexibly, termed as flexible thinking (Metzger and Flanagin, 2015) , thus increasing their intentions to search more contradictory information as an effort to evaluate the given rumors critically. Different from using SNS for social purposes that results in increasing affections as affective social exchange theory notes, SNS informational dependency can lead individuals to have critical thoughts under ambiguous situations. Building from these deductions, additional studies would be of interest regarding how information-dependent SNS users have different motivations and how their behaviors relate to information-seeking behaviors. Taken together, this study has significant conceptual implications in a number of aspects. Aiming to expand the understanding of rumor communication, this study focused on the credibility of rumor messages as the independent variable in an effort to determine the effect of credibility on information seeking. Perceived credibility of rumors is imperative for studying the context of rumor communication because it is related to the formation of reasoned communication under risky situations. In this sense, understanding how rumor credibility helps to construct or endanger an informed public is critical. Second, this paper extends the understanding of rumor communication by examining SNS. In contemporary society, the ways in which rumors are disseminated have undergone drastic changes. People are more likely to use SNS than ever before to disseminate false rumors that are spread quickly through SNS (Doerr et al., 2012) , which raises the necessity to examine SNS rumors in today's society.

Third, in examining the participants' SNS dependency, this study differentiated between social and informational dependency. The strength of this study is the consideration of individual differences in the functions that SNS provides for users, and the recognition of different aims that information seeking behavior may be attempting to accomplish. The results indicate that the two types function differently in the interactions with rumor credibility, supplementing previous studies regarding SNS dependency, which has not been elaborated in depth on the different dimensions of SNS dependency (e.g. Kim et al., 2015) . Lastly, examining people's behaviors with the aim of constructing rational communication after they receive rumors is another imperative step that this study performed in extending the understanding of rumor communication. By dividing information-seeking behaviors into the quantity and accuracy-oriented, this study distinguished itself from previous rumor studies that did not deeply consider people's actual efforts to eradicate irrational communication behaviors that includes non-accuracy motivated rumor spreading behavior. Because an informed public is a prerequisite for constructing a deliberative democracy (Weeks, 2000) , determining people's actual efforts to build up rational communication against irrationalities is imperative for communication researchers to contribute to societies' well-being.

In conclusion, this paper offers valuable implications for understanding the public's actual behaviors in seeking information in the context of rumors and for how credibility and SNS dependency affect these behaviors in the era of Web 2.0. It underscores how certain factors affect the formation of an informed public. At the same time, this paper found that SNS can play a role in constructing a public sphere depending on individuals' motivations for using it. Thus, it is difficult to perceive SNSs as merely unofficial channels because of the lack of professional gatekeepers, which was argued in previous studies (Leberecht, 2010; Mendoza et al., 2010) . The role of SNS in rumor communication is differentiated depending on the motivations for using SNS and on psychological factors including the credibility of rumors. In this way, SNS can function in both positive and negative ways in constructing an informed public.

To our knowledge, this study made a first attempt to assess the effects of people's perception about specific incorrect information on their information seeking behaviors. This study contributes to the growing field of research on information seeking through social media platforms. From the findings of the present paper, in the context of rumor communication, the dearth of information that leads to low perceived credibility is not an exclusive factor in seeking more and accurate information, which is essential in a rational society. Considering that SNS dependency affects information seeking behavior, especially in the era of Web 2.0, the important point is individuals' effortful attempts to be exposed to as much accurate information as possible in order to block false rumors from being circulated and to use SNS in an informational way. From these efforts, SNS can function positively as providing a true public sphere in which laypeople can receive and share accurate information and build up rational communication against the spread of false rumors.

Despite seminal findings, this study also contains some limitations. First, participants were limited to 20 s in this study. Although the selection of participants was based on past research showing people in their 20 s are heavy social media users, generalization of this study is limited. Second, although other types of information seeking can be found, the present study only focused on accuracyoriented information seeking. Additional research on exploring different types of information seeking can expand discussions on information seeking. In line with this limitation, this study only examined SNS social and information dependency. Because people use SNS for many different reasons, future studies are required to expand the discussions. Finally, the present study is based on the certain incident and limited to South Koreans. Future research is required to examine other incidents and compare between people in different cultures.

Social determinants of health inequalities: towards a theoretical perspective using systems science,"A systems approach offers a novel conceptualization to natural and social systems. In recent years, this has led to perceiving population health outcomes as an emergent property of a dynamic and open, complex adaptive system. The current paper explores these themes further and applies the principles of systems approach and complexity science (i.e. systems science) to conceptualize social determinants of health inequalities. The conceptualization can be done in two steps: viewing health inequalities from a systems approach and extending it to include complexity science. Systems approach views health inequalities as patterns within the larger rubric of other facets of the human condition, such as educational outcomes and economic development. This anlysis requires more sophisticated models such as systems dynamic models. An extension of the approach is to view systems as complex adaptive systems, i.e. systems that are 'open' and adapt to the environment. They consist of dynamic adapting subsystems that exhibit non-linear interactions, while being 'open' to a similarly dynamic environment of interconnected systems. They exhibit emergent properties that cannot be estimated with precision by using the known interactions among its components (such as economic development, political freedom, health system, culture etc.). Different combinations of the same bundle of factors or determinants give rise to similar patterns or outcomes (i.e. property of convergence), and minor variations in the initial condition could give rise to widely divergent outcomes. Novel approaches using computer simulation models (e.g. agent-based models) would shed light on possible mechanisms as to how factors or determinants interact and lead to emergent patterns of health inequalities of populations.","Health outcomes are increasingly perceived from a systems approach that is more holistic and non-reductionist [1] . The author in a recent paper extended the systems approach to incorporate principles of complexity science and to conceptualize population health outcomes as an emergent property of a dynamic and open, complex adaptive system [2] . The current paper explores these themes further and applies the principles of systems approach and complexity science (i.e. systems science) to conceptualize social determinants of health inequalities (SDHI). The paper begins with a brief overview of the existing models of SDHI, and then proposes a two step approach to remodel our perspectives and outlines possible implications.

Interest in studying social influences of population health outcomes dates back to at least the 19th century. Pioneering researchers in this area include Rudolf Virchow who reported on the role of political economy and poverty in causing an epidemic of plague in Upper Silesia of Prussia, and Friedrich Engels on the link between high mortality and poor living conditions of the working class in England [3] . Subsequently Salvador Allende's work in Chile attempted to show the role of social and political factors in generating health inequalities in populations [3] .

More recent expansion of a population-based approach to inequalities includes the work of Geoffrey Rose in the 1980's [4] . He distinguished between causes of incidence of a population group and causes of disease in individuals. The extreme example he proposes was to assume that every member of society smoked 20 cigarettes a day, which if investigates through cohort studies and case-control studies, will lead to the conclusion that incidence of lung cancer is determined by genetic predispositions. These smoking patterns are a reflection of social norms, values, traditions and their customs, in a historical context. Thus, societies with lower per-capita rates of smoking have a significantly lower incidence of lung cancer. The balances or imbalances of norms and social structures within the population lead to distinct patterns of individual behaviours in smoking rates or varying rates of disease prevalence or incidence among social groups, i.e. inequalities. Sick individuals represent the extremes of the population mean.

Recent literature uses the term social determinants of health inequalities (SDHI) to denote contexts, social norms, social structures, and their determinants. Three main pathways have been advanced to explain the generation of health inequalities from the social environment [5] .

(a) ""Social selection"", or social mobility which implies that health determines socioeconomic position, rather than the reverse. Thus, healthier persons will move towards better socioeconomic positions, compared to less healthier, leading to inequalities. (b)""Social causation"" proposes that a range of unequally spread material, psycho-social and behavioural factors, give rise to inequalities in health outcomes [6, 7] . Material factors include varying income levels and investments across infrastructure beneficial to the community. Psychosocial factors are the chronic stresses that arise from perceptions and experiences of personal status in an unequal society. Behavioral factors are, for example, the higher rates of smoking observed in poorer groups that lead to differential rates of diseases and mortality [8, 9] . (c) A ""life course perspective"" suggests that a multitude of factors across the life span (e.g. maternal malnutrition during fetal period, poor educational facilities in childhood, occupations with physical hazards etc.) determine and manifest disease trends observed over time. The ecosocial approach attempts to integrate these ecological, social and biological factors in disease causation through a dynamic process of their 'embodiment' i.e. ""we literally incorporate biological influences from the material and social world"" [10, 11] . There are several biological pathways that explain how social environment gets 'embodied' on health. One is the 'stress biology approach' whereby stress leads to chronic stimulation of the hypothalamo-pituitaryadrenal axis and the resultant hormonal changes increase risks of hypertension, insulin resistance, and hyperglycaemia [6] . The other relates to the advancing field of epigenetics, i.e. non-genetic modifiers of gene expression that are transmitted to future generation. They provide an explanation as to how environmental effects convert to lasting physiological changes and behavioral changes. An example is how psychological stress alters DNA methylation and histones in stress-sensitive brain regions such as the hippocampus, amygdala, and prefrontal cortex. These changes modulate subsequent gene expression [12] . Another pathway is through modifications of telomeres in dividing somatic cells. Telomeres are DNA repeat sequences, which together with accompanying telomere-binding proteins, cap and protect chromosome ends. Their length shortens with each cycle of replication, which is an expression of accelerated ageing as this process ultimately leads to a loss of capacity to replicate. It has been shown that lower socio-economic groups demonstrate shortening of the length of telomeres, thus suggesting that these groups acquire features of accelerated ageing with its consequences [13, 14] .

The Commission of SDH (CSDH) re-conceptualizes health inequalities by integrating these theories and concepts further [5, 15] . They describe SDHI to have a context, structural mechanisms and socioeconomic positions of individuals. It assumes a crucial role for the ""context"" which includes social systems (e.g. education system, labour market), culture (e.g. racism and caste) and political systems (e.g. structure of the state, redistributive policies). The structure of the state in relation to welfare and redistribution of wealth is recognized as a dominant institution. The 'context' should be viewed as a dynamic concept, having a historical past, a present and future trajectory. Structural mechanisms that are rooted in institutions and processes within the context generate stratifications in society according to socio-economic position, income or wealth, educational achievements and access, occupation, gender, race/ethnicity and other dimensions. These are inter-related dimensions and could act as proxies for each other. For example, in a heavily market-driven individualized society, incomes or wealth are good proxy indicators for socio-economic position. The socioeconomic position in turn is a key stratifier in most contemporary societies and reflects a hierachical system consisting of power, prestige and access to resources.

The SDHI operate through a group of intermediary determinants to mould health outcomes. The main groups of intermediary determinants of health are: material circumstances (e.g. quality of housing, exposure to pollution, financial means to purchase quality food, and work environment); psychosocial circumstances (e.g. levels of stress and social support); behavioural factors (e.g. rates of tobacco and alcohol consumption, nutrition and physical activity) biological factors (e.g. genetic predisposition to diseases in different population groups) factors) and the health system (e.g. access to quality care in populations). Increasingly, research evidence reports a widening range of influencing material circumstance (such as availability of safe water and sanitation, agricultural policies and food security, access to health and social care services, unemployment, under-employment and working conditions, access to housing, the living environment, access to education, and availability of transport) [15, 16] . Those holding higher positions in the hierarchies of social stratification (e.g. higher socio-economic position or most affluent) would hold an advantageous position in accessing resources, information and environments that are more favourable to better health outcomes.

An implicit and explicit recognition of an inter-related web of factors functioning as a system runs through the above discourse. Rose's concept of causes of incidence in a population group, implies that the population functions as a cohesive 'whole' or system, rather than being a mere collection of independent individuals. Similarly, the concept of SDHI proposed by the CSDH describes a system that consists of elements such as, a context, structural mechanisms, and intermediary determinants. These are related both as influencers as well as through feedback mechanisms.

However, as with most concepts related to health outcome, SDHI implicitly and explicitly accepts certain elements of a Newtonian view of reality (i.e. reductionism, linearity and hierarchy) [2, 17] . An example of this reductionist approach is the descriptions of a single factor that influences health outcomes (e.g. socio-economic stratification of mortality due to asthma) and selecting interventions that focus on a single determinant (e.g. improving thermal comfort in houses that have inadequate warmth) [18] . Another assumption prevalent in this discourse is linearity, which assumes that determinants of inequalities can be applied across a wide range of contexts. For example, differential access to healthcare or education is explicitly or implicitly assumed to lead to variations in outcomes, almost in a linear fashion [6, 7, 17] . This view does not give adequate credit to unintended consequences commonly seen in reality. For example, mobile phones have improved connectivity, but their use while driving have become an important cause of road traffic accidents, a feature that was never predicted at the outset. Another key concept is the role of hierarchies or power, position and access to resources (e.g. in the understanding of socio-economic position). The concept of hierarchies is implicitly used to explain the process of SDHI as exemplified by terms such as proximate or distal determinants of health inequalities. This indicates a clear path of influences that arise 'distal' to the population group (e.g. labour laws that determine wage structure) and affect it through more 'proximal' factors that are closer to the population (e.g. income) [6, 7] . The statistical methods of estimating the effects of determinants also imply other features of the mechanistic reductionist paradigm. Earlier generation of studies used relatively simple statistical models such as Odds Ratios [19] . These methods assume that explanatory variables have a cause and-effect-pathway (i.e. unidirectional path of influences) and do not encompass positive or negative feed-back loops between the outcome variable and explanatory variables. For example, poor education leads to higher probability of ill-health, which combined together lowers the level of employment and ability to generate income, which in turn influences the ability to live in a more affluent neighbourhood and therefore reduces opportunities for further education, and higher grades of occupations, as well has increases exposure to more polluting environments. They also ignore interrelations among individuals. For example health education could have a positive health impact on an individual, that could indirectly improve the health of the individual's friends. More sophisticated statistical methods, e.g. generalized linear models such as multiple regression, logistic regression and Poisson regression, account for multiple explanatory variables and to those that are not normally distributed. However, these analyses do not include feedback loops and interrelations among individuals. The latter require multilevel or hierarchical regressions models [20] . They 'implicitly assume that these effects can be isolated from each other and do not allow for feedback loops or reciprocal interactions between groups and individuals, or between outcomes and predictors' [21, 22] .

Systems science combines systems theory and complexity science. Systems theory states that properties of a complete system cannot be predicted by disaggregating, analyzing and exploring its individual constituent parts alone [23] . Complexity applies systems theory to open and adaptive systems (i.e. complex adaptive systems) and views health outcomes as an emergent property of such systems [1, 2] . The next sections propose a two-step process to visualize SDHI from a systems science perspective, firstly, by shifting away from a reductionist paradigm towards a systems approach and secondly, by enriching this with principles of complexity science.

In applying the systems approach, a point of departure from the conventional model of thinking is to consider population health outcomes as one of many components of the human condition or the 'standard of living' of a population. This human condition has several other facets or components such as educational attainment, economic well-being, and social status. These components too exhibit patterns of inequalities, in a manner similar to health outcomes. Health inequalities should be viewed as patterns in health outcomes that arise in association with other patterns of human condition, and lie within this milieu. Extricating health outcomes from these other human conditions and exploring it individually is therefore arbitrary, though justified on grounds of interest, existing disciplinarity and convenience of tackling one component at a time SDHI can be visualized from a systems approach using a matrix that captures at least part of the elements of the human condition system. Each group of columns will represent a facet of the human condition (e.g. health outcomes, educational attainment). For comparison between countries, the parameters should be uniform and preferably continuous variables. The bundle of parameters in health outcomes could include life expectancy at birth (LEB), vaccination rate of children at 5 years, inverse of infant mortality rate (IMR), inverse of maternal mortality rates (MMR), and inverse of childhood malnutrition rates. Similarly, the parameter bundle on educational attainment could be percentage enrolment by 6 years, percentage in secondary level education, and per-capita investment in education, and for socio-economic status, the per-capita income, and employment rates. Each row could be for a particular year or for specific intervals (e.g. 2005 to 2010). An appropriate colour coding for the parameters will give rise to a pattern in the matrix that will be a fingerprint of the human condition of a particular country. The whole matrix represents the totality of the human condition as an output. A similar method of visualization is used to illustrate worldwide trends in life expectancy at birth from 1970 to 2010 published in the Human Development Report [24] . This process will also demonstrate the disadvantages of narrowing our perspective to a particular health outcome (e.g. obesity rates) or its determinants (e.g. physical activity). When such single parameters are selected from the matrix, we are in reality focusing on a single facet of health outcomes extracted from a column of the matrix. Instead, the preferred option is to express data on several other health related outputs such as IMR, MMR, LEB, and morbidity rates. This will immediately highlight unintended consequences, a feature of complex adaptive systems. Once a predetermined bundle of health outcomes are used to describe health, e.g. LEB, IMR, and MMR, comparisons between countries or regions become easier.

The second step is to incorporate an inequalities dimension to this form of visualization. This could be done on standardized measures of inequalities or stratifiers (e.g. across income or wealth or educational attainment, or geographic region) over a period or 10-20 years (see Fig. 1 ).

This will allow tracking of trends within a country. For example, a stratifier such as income could impact across several categories of the human condition. This impact could be visualized using the following summary measure of inequalities: a) Health inequalities: Odds Ratios between highest and lowest income quintile in parameters such as IMR, MMR, under-5 year vaccination rates, childhood nutrition, LEB b) Educational attainment: Odds Ratios between highest and lowest income quintiles in education such as primary school enrollment, secondary school enrollment, and tertiary education. c) Inequalities in social capital: Odds Ratios between highest and lowest income quintiles in measures of social capital, contact with social networks,

One option is for individual countries to have several of these charts, one for each stratifier, and track selected measures of inequalities (e.g. ratios of IMR, LEB, MMR, primary school enrollment) over a period (e.g. every 5 years). Each cell will be filled by the result of the Odds Ratio. In order to give an immediate visual impression, a simple set of rules could be observed to colour the cells in the matrix. The colour coding could be such that the cells showing extreme values of a ratio (e.g. above an Odds Ration of 2) and having the widest the inequalities will receive red colour and the least receive green, with other intermediates receiving light green, yellow, and orange. The precise values at which the colour transits would be arbitrary (e.g. one may choose a ratio of 2 and above to be red and below 0.5 to be green) See Fig. 1 .

However, it is necessary to be consistent in order to allow for comparisons along the time axis and between countries or regions. A series of matrices developed for each stratifer in a country, could be analysed subsequently using hierarchical clustering algorithms (e.g. hierarchical clustering and k-means clustering) and computational methods (e.g. organizing maps and artificial neural networks) [25] . Hierarchical clustering will produce a 'tree' of those cells that are closest to each other (e.g. those with closest values as percentages). Heat maps can also be used to illustrate the clustering and it increasingly used to describe multimorbidity [26] . Such analyses from individual countries and the emerging patterns of health outcomes will give invaluable insight on the processes that are involved in giving rise to these particular patterns. It is possible that this method will demonstrate clusters of inequality measures that would not be expected from usual epidemiological parameters. An analogous situation was seen with data from acutely ill patients in Intensive Care Units, where by clusters of physiological parameters were observed that could not be defined by conventional knowledge [27] .

The third step is to view the system as a dynamic entity and to include dynamic dimension to the approach. Describing outcomes at a given time is a mere snapshot of a dynamic process and analogous to prognostication of diabetes and its risks by using a single random blood glucose level. Extending this further, the predictions become more robust if a series of observations are made and this dynamism is incorporated into the model by using rates of change of parameters (e.g. rate of decline of IMR). Parallels are seen in systems medicine where serial analyses of the pulsatile secretion of insulin (rather than fasting insulin) was found to be an early feature of diabetes rather than a single value [28] . Data can now be gathered relatively inexpensively using crowd-sourcing techniques (i.e. gathering information by engaging with a large number of people usually via the Internet) and real-time surveillance of information in Twitter and other social media [29, 30] . 

A systems approach views the human condition and their determinants as causes as well as outcomes. They are interlinked in a causal web, rather than a linear path of social determinants leading to a range of health outcome. The feedback loops lead to outcomes influencing their causations. For example, low income and deprivation lead to poorer health outcomes, which in turn makes the group even poorer and worsening health outcomes. In order to operationalize the above, more sophisticated models such as systems dynamic models are required [31] [32] [33] . Analogous models are now being developed for specific disorders such as obesity [34] .

A systems approach to SDHI emphasizes the role of the context in determining health inequalities. The relationships between the variations in health outcomes and other parameters would be more or less unique to that particular system. The interpretation of the outputs is heavily dependent on the context and less generalizable across different nations, social groups, or environments. This is yet another reason to explore natural experiments to identify causal pathways and interventions for a given context [21] .

The next advance is to incorporate complexity science to the systems perspective. This will require perceiving the patterns of human condition in a given population group to be an emergent property of a complex adaptive system (CAS). The latter is a special type of system that is 'open' to its environment, with non-linear interactions among a dynamic set of other interconnected systems and subsystems. Other systems include the political system (e.g. the predominant political governance system), the physical environment (e.g. pollution levels or transport), and biological systems (e.g. genetic predispositions), within the context of a larger social system [2] . One could position this within the context of global ecosystems (e.g. the biosphere, the atmosphere, the hydrosphere, geosphere and cryosphere).

A feature of a CAS is that it has emergent properties, i.e. it is almost impossible to predict precisely what it the larger system will evolve to, by using knowledge relating to the interactions among its components and sub-components [35] . Rather than mathematical modeling where equations are the basis of the model, some complexity scientists use simulations using computer-based programmes (e.g. Python) [36] . The building blocks of these simulation models are considered to be as fundamental and irreducible as mathematic equations, and are being hailed as a 'new kind of science' [37] .

If the analogy of the matrix of SDHI used in the previous section is applied, the picture will be one of continuously changing colours and patterns that are not predictable. Complexity scientists would mimic these patterns through computer simulations using simple rules that describe the inter-relationships among parameters. Of the commonly used computer simulations, those most likely to mimic patterns of health outcomes seen in the matrix model are agent-based models, cellular automata, and networks.

Initial work on agent-based models by Schelling showed that segregation in a city (often attributed to racial discrimination) can be simulated by simple rules applied to a grid where each cell represents a house [38] . Consider an example where 90 % percent of houses are occupied randomly, either by blue or red, in approximately equal proportions. A programme will simulate future scenarios if they follow two simple rules: place each house where at least 2 of 8 encircling them are of similar colour as the house, and avoid the cell if they have one or none of same colour. Within a few iterations, the emerging model begins to mimic cities that are segregated by race, poverty, or social status. These simulations provide evidence (but no proof ) that several alternate pathways could potentially explain urban clusters of race or poverty, rather than discrimination. Extrapolating to health outcomes, they challenge area-wise aggregation of health outcomes are through pathway such as the neighbourhood effects or the effects of urbanization on health outcomes [38] .

Cellular automata is another simulation where the programme places lines of square cells next to each other (e.g. you fill the cell with a black cell, if two of the eight cells around the cell of interest are black) as in a checker board [37, 39] . The interesting observations include the following: minor changes in the rules and initial conditions lead to emergence of widely divergent patterns, some lead to recurring patterns, and similar patterns arise with different starting points and different set of rules. If this metaphor is applied to SDHI, it illustrates the uniqueness of the context to a particular pattern of health outcomes in a population, and the theoretical possibility that widely divergent determinants lead to similar patterns of outcomes in different situations.

Networks perceive systems as interlinked webs. The strengths and numbers of links among nodes can be varied to generate emergent properties mimicking reality. Milgram pioneered the concept of small world networks, in which the degrees of separation between two individual members is considerably small compared to the given population [40] . This was illustrated by an experiment that showed an average six intermediate acquaintances separate any two people on the planet. Thus a highly infectious disease could theoretically spread to all 7 billion on the globe in about six incubation periods! Another improvement of this simulation is to incorporate the highly connected super-spreaders who are disproportionately relevant to rapid spread of the disease, called scale-free networks [41] . In this model, new members of the network connect preferentially to those who already have a large number of contacts (i.e. analogous to individuals befriending the most popular members of a network). The resulting number of contacts per individual takes a power-law distribution. The recent epidemic of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) was such an example where a significant proportion of the infections were due to 'super-spreaders' [42] . These networks resemble patterns observed in the spread of information along social networks and obesity in geographic areas giving rise to amazing patterns of spread [43] .

Characterizing outcomes of the human condition (including health inequalities) as patterns that emerge in a complex adaptive system has several implications. Firstly, isolating health outcomes from the other human conditions are problematic because they are features or dimensions of a larger picture and therefore more sophisticated forms of systems analyses will be required to shed light on SDHI. Secondly, emerging patterns of a complex adaptive system cannot be estimated with precision by using the known interactions among its components (such as economic development, political freedom, health system, culture etc.). Different combinations of the same bundle of factors or determinants can give rise to similar patterns or outcomes (i.e. property of convergence), and minor variations in the initial condition could give rise to widely divergent outcomes. This questions the ability to generalize with precision, the determinants of health outcomes from one contextual environment to another. Thus the favoured models would be those developed for the particular context using longitudinal data and using systems dynamics of feedback and interrelationships. Finally, computer simulation models (e.g. agent-based models) would shed light on possible mechanisms as to how factors or determinants interact and lead to emergent patterns of health outcomes of populations. The metaphor needs to shift from the current visualizations of health outcomes as rigid bar diagrams demonstrating the step-wise gradient to a more vibrant multi-coloured canvass with changing hues.

BMC Public Health Identifying strategies to improve access to credible and relevant information for public health professionals: a qualitative study,"Background: Movement towards evidence-based practices in many fields suggests that public health (PH) challenges may be better addressed if credible information about health risks and effective PH practices is readily available. However, research has shown that many PH information needs are unmet. In addition to reviewing relevant literature, this study performed a comprehensive review of existing information resources and collected data from two representative PH groups, focusing on identifying current practices, expressed information needs, and ideal systems for information access.","The need for improved access to high quality public health (PH) information has been echoed in various forums involving public health professionals, librarians, and information professionals since the mid 1990s [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] . The information needs of the PH workforce have become all the more urgent with the increasing frequency of emergence of new infectious diseases such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Asian bird flu, as well as the increasing concern about acts of bioterrorism, such as spreading anthrax spores via the US Postal Service in 2001.

A major difficulty in meeting these needs is the great breadth of the PH discipline which makes it difficult to identify and collect a body of evidence-based literature to address the growing multitude of specific PH information needs. The PH workforce may be more diverse than any other group of health professionals [6] and includes professionals trained in dozens of disciplines [3, 5] , ranging from environmental health to veterinary medicine, from sanitary engineering to epidemiology.

Studies of the information needs of PH professionals have addressed information seeking behaviors of PH workers, obstacles to information access, and defining and classifying the specific types of information needed. Reports of studies focusing on how PH workers look for the information they need note that many PH professionals have been slow to adopt electronic information-seeking behaviors, sometimes because of the time required for users to acquire the requisite skills and other times because access to electronic databases is not available [7] [8] [9] . Studies focusing on obstacles to electronic access to and use of evidence-based information in the PH field [1] [2] [3] 5, [10] [11] [12] [13] have identified many relevant obstacles including: (1) limited awareness of the importance of evidence-based information to inform practice and lack of encouragement from opinion leaders to seek it; (2) limited awareness of what information is available electronically and from what sources; (3) limited access to computers, the Internet or email; (4) limited skills needed to access the information sources and lack of ease of use; (5) a diverse array of content needs requiring access to databases from many disciplines (and in other languages); (6) limited time to sift through the poorly filtered information that is returned by searches using sets of search terms inadequate for PH concerns; (7) limited ability of decision-makers to appraise the methodological quality of research; and (8) the paucity of systematic reviews of PH topics.

Lynch [14] suggested that information accessing needs among PH professionals often focus on immediate problem-solving and not on answering open-ended academic research questions. Investigators focusing on the kinds of information needed by PH professionals [5, 6, 14] have noted the need for diverse kinds of information including the grey literature and unpublished studies, practice guidelines, research studies and systematic reviews. These investigators also point out the need for information that is effectively summarized and synthesized. There is also a need for linkages among multiple databases as well as providing access to databases related to best practices, outcome measures, statistical information, policy updates, and information that may be unique to a particular location or region. Nutbeam [4] has formalized a valuable four-level typology of increasingly informative levels of research knowledge in the PH field. Nutbeam's model does not, however, include grey literature that may be needed to assist PH decision makers when the evidence needed to inform urgent PH issues is incomplete.

Access to evidence-based public health information has become a growing concern for medical librarians. In 1997, the National Library of Medicine along with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and other agencies launched the Partners in Information Access for the Public Health Workforce project to begin to address this concern. The Evidence-Based Practice for Public Health (EBPPH) Project at the Lamar Soutter Library of the University of Massachusetts Medical School was initiated in 2001. This Project initially focused on identifying resources available to clinical medical practitioners and PH practitioners for locating, summarizing, synthesizing and disseminating evidence-based information. It then compared resources available to clinical medical practitioners to those available to PH practitioners. We found that there were many more types of resources focused on clinical medical practice than on PH practice. The clinical medical resources were based on several different models of information search, summary, synthesis and delivery, and some of the most promising models had little or no presence in the PH arena.

To explore and address this gap, the EBPPH project sought to examine and classify the features of the clinical evidence-based medicine resources, to assess their potential for improving access to the PH literature, and to develop new models that could effectively address the unique needs of PH professionals. EBPPH also works on identifying other existing projects aimed at synthesizing, summarizing or improving access to evidence-based PH information and publishes links to effective evidencebased resources it has identified via its website [15] .

This article presents the results from a qualitative study undertaken by the EBPPH project that combined three objectives that previous investigators had generally pursued individually: (1) characterization of information needs of PH practitioners, (2) identification of typical information seeking behaviors, and (3) assessment of barriers to information access. We have used the insights gained from the study to inform the construction of an extended classification of the types of information needed by PH professionals and of a hypothetical model for PH information access that could meet their needs for access to diverse credible sources.

Jenicek [16] defines evidence-based public health practice as the conscientious, explicit, and judicious use of current best evidence in making decisions about the care of communities and populations in the domain of health protection, disease prevention, health promotion, and health maintenance and improvement. We too are using the term ""evidence-based"" to refer to the best available evidence that is both credible and of the highest known quality.

The research project team of four consisted of 1) the Lamar Soutter Library Director with a DA degree, 2) one of her staff members with an MPH degree (both had formal training in qualitative research techniques provided by the qualitative research consultant), 3) a medical consultant with an MD and expertise in medical informatics (quantitatively trained with prior experience working with the qualitative research consultant on other qualitative studies), and 4) a qualitative research consultant with a background in software development, a PhD in organizational and human development, and expertise in teaching and applying qualitative methods in a variety of studies related to medical and PH interventions. All four participated in the development of interview questions and the conduct of focus groups as well as reviewing the findings and developing the models.

The EBPPH research process was a seven-step process (See Figure 1 ). The first step was to identify and characterize existing information resources available to medical and PH professionals. The second step was to collect data on information accessing needs, behaviors, and barriers via individual interviews from one domain of PH practice, communicable disease control. Thirdly, after findings were analyzed, they were presented to a focus group of PH professionals previously interviewed along with examples of information accessing resources currently available to gather additional input on information accessing needs.

In the fourth process step we used information gathered to revise the individual interview script and make it more specific for interviewees in a second, but related domain of PH practice -community health promotion. The fifth step involved analysis of this new data and construction of a preliminary hypothetical model with features to meet the information accessing needs identified by the participants. In step 6 an analysis of the findings from both domains, examples of existing resources, and the hypothetical model were reviewed in a focus group with Community Health Promotion staff previously interviewed. As a result of step 6, we revised the hypothetical model to reflect the feedback gathered in the last focus group.

The research protocol used for this study was approved by the Committee for the Protection of Human Subjects in Research at the University of Massachusetts Medical School, IRB Docket #H-10507.

We chose subjects for our study from the Massachusetts Department of Public Health (MDPH) because of ongoing relationships between investigators and MDPH employees and because of the proximity of the Department offices to the EBPPH project site. We focused on the Bureau of Communicable Disease Control (BCDC) and

EBPPH research process steps Figure 1 EBPPH research process steps.

Step 1 -Identify existing PH and medical information resources and features

Step 2 -Develop individual interview script and interview participants from Communicable Disease Control

Step 3 -Focus group to present findings and existing information access resources & features to Communicable Disease Control participants for feedback

Step 4 -Revise individual interview script and interview participants from Community Health Promotion

Step 5 -Develop hypothetical model system for collecting, organizing and disseminating information responsive to findings of our research

Step 6 -Focus group to present findings from both groups, existing information access resources, and hypothetical model and features to Community Health Promotion participants for feedback

Step 7 -Revise hypothetical model in response to reactions of focus group the Bureau of Family and Community Services' Community Health Promotion (CHP) groups because they are both relatively large groups and because these two groups were likely to represent a significant portion of the broad spectrum of information needs in PH in general. One group deals primarily with prevention and control of communicable diseases (BCDC) and the other with health promotion related to prevention and control of chronic disease (CHP).

The Director of each sample work group was asked to provide names of individuals in his/her group who most often needed access to information from multiple sources. Twelve potential interviewees were selected by the BCDC Director from the program areas of tuberculosis prevention and control; epidemiology and immunization; sexually transmitted disease (STD) prevention and control; refugee and immigrant health; and library services. Eight potential interviewees from the CHP group were selected by their Director in the areas of cancer, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease prevention and control; nutrition and physical activity; and women's, men's and elder health. An email message was sent to each of those selected requesting agreement to participate and interviews were scheduled by either email or telephone. All twelve of the BCDC interviewees suggested participated in the individual interviews while seven of the eight approached from CHP participated. Seven of the BCDC informants (60%) participated in a follow-on focus group at a later time. Three CHP employees previously interviewed (43%) participated in the CHP follow-on focus group. The professionals in our sample ranged from information technologists, librarians, trainers and program directors to medical directors and division directors. Informants held various degrees in nursing, public health, medicine, veterinary medicine, and other specialties.

Data were collected from the two sample groups first via 45-minute individual interviews with all participants. During later focus groups, lasting about an hour and a half, preliminary findings were reviewed and validated and additional data were collected as participants reacted to PowerPoint slides presented describing existing information sources and accessing features. A hypothetical model for PH information access was also presented at the second sample focus group for feedback. All individual and group interviews were audiotaped. Individual interviews were transcribed verbatim, and the qualitative research consultant listened to the focus group tapes and took notes of study participants' comments related to information accessing features presented as close to verbatim as possible.

Based on a technique developed by LaPelle [17] , we employed Microsoft Word to transcribe data into tables of text responses where coding and sorting of text segments can be done based on theme codes. Our thematic analysis approach rests heavily on the qualitative research techniques described by Crabtree and Miller [18] [19] [20] , Miles and Huberman [21] , and Patton [22] . Transcribed textual data from interviews were reviewed by the qualitative research consultant through a continuous process of comparing data segments to other data segments, looking for similar or repeated ideas to be conceptualized as themes.

A continuously evolving codebook was developed defining themes identified in the interview script as well as subthemes as they emerged from repeated readings of the data. The transcripts in the Microsoft Word table structures were coded thematically in a table column adjacent to the relevant text segment using the preliminary draft of the codebook. Codebook development and coding were conducted solely by the qualitative research consultant. After sorting coded text segments via the Microsoft Word Table Sort function, coding validity was assured by reviewing the text that sorted into each code, correcting those that were miscoded and resorting. Some themes were further deconstructed creating additional subthemes after sorting when this seemed appropriate. Within-transcript analyses and data reduction were done, proceeding to cross-transcript analyses. A comparison table was constructed to compare summarized responses related to each significant theme across participants for each group. Subsequently findings were compared across groups. At each stage in the data analysis and reduction, findings were reviewed with other members of the project team. Additionally, findings were reviewed with participants from each sample at the focus groups for further validation.

The EBBPH medical consultant identified existing resources delivering information to medical practitioners and to PH professionals. These were advertised via mailings, email promotions, and vendor displays at academic meetings and identified in discussions with clinical and PH professionals who were intensive consumers of medical and PH information. He also performed informal Internet searches using Google. Through the use of trial and full subscriptions, the consultant informally explored the resources he identified and catalogued the features of these resources. The key access, formatting and content features these resources offered are listed in Table 1 : (1) keywords for searching large collections of research reports and reviews, (2) pre-formulated search filters, (3) automatic notification (e.g. periodic emails to subscribers with information on recently published research reports), (4) abstracts or summaries of research reports sometimes associated with commentaries, (5) systematic reviews, (6) evidence-based guidelines, (7) comprehensive knowledge sources, (8) within article indexing with links that allows access to the specific information needed, and (9) archiving capabilities.

The individual interview script was developed by the project team. The BCDC script included questions about the types of work tasks informants performed that required access to information, currently used and preferred information sources, preferred format for research information, current barriers to information access, and desired enhancements for access [see Additional file 1]. Individual interviews with BCDC professionals were done in person at their workplace by the project's qualitative research consultant hoping to observe their electronic information accessing behavior where possible. Those who were very computer literate or had sizeable offices met with her in their offices and were comfortable demonstrating how they accessed their preferred electronic sources. However, many either had no space in their offices to hold the interview or accessed most of their information in ways that were not easy for us to observe. The individual interviews with BCDC informants took place in the fall of 2003.

A follow-on focus group was held in the spring of 2004. The focus group agenda for BCDC included reviewing a summary of findings from their interviews for validation followed by a PowerPoint presentation on several existing website examples of PH information organization and dissemination (see Table 1 ) to ascertain their familiarity and preference for specific features of these models. The focus group was conducted by project team members without a detailed script.

The individual interview script for CHP participants used the BCDC script as a basis but was modified by the project team to add more specific questions regarding listservs providing links to current information, systematic reviews and comprehensive knowledge bases based on inconclusive findings in these areas from interviews with the BCDC participants [see Additional file 2]. Individual interviews with CHP professionals were conducted by the project's qualitative research consultant by telephone since most in-person interviews with BCDC participants had not yielded opportunities to observe their information accessing behavior directly. The individual interviews with CHP informants took place in the summer and fall of 2004.

Step 5 -hypothetical model development Following the individual interviews with CHP informants, we developed a preliminary hypothetical model of information reformulation, organization and access based on our interpretation of CHP informants' responses to the interview questions and prior findings from the BCDC informants.

The focus group agenda for CHP included reviewing a comparison of findings from BCDC and CHP, validation of CHP findings and a review of existing information accessing website examples (see Table 1 

Professionals at MDPH have a wide variety of needs for information and varied significantly in their level of skill in accessing it. All MDPH staff we interviewed had desktop computers and access to the Internet. MDPH itself hosts a multi-faceted website that provides access both for employees and for the general public to programmatic information, statistical databases and MDPH documents.

The main MDPH offices are located in multiple sites in the Boston area. The CHP group and the BCDC are located in different office buildings, each of which includes a small library staffed by part-time librarians offering document search and retrieval services. However, the urgency of information needs differed widely within and across programs, and use of external electronic information sources also differed widely due to variation in both need and skills.

The nature of the work of the two groups also differs. BCDC is concerned with both established and emerging communicable diseases and needs fast-breaking news about emerging diseases such as SARS as well as evidencebased information about more established diseases like tuberculosis. CHP deals primarily with health promotion related to chronic diseases and is involved in working with external coalitions to develop statewide collaborative prevention and control plans for diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular disease and diabetes. However, there is also significant overlap in the information accessing needs of these two groups.

Six distinct categories of information emerged from the participants' statements about the kinds of information they required in their work: (1) early reports on newly identified health risks and preventive behaviors; (2) Examples of the kind of information currently accessed by the participants in each of the six categories and typical associated sources of information can be found in Table 2 .

Those we interviewed in their offices demonstrated how they accessed many of the source examples in Table 2 , provided website information, or gave us sample copies of information available from these sources. The sources included websites, electronic automatic notifications often via listservs, journals, presentations at meetings, and personal communications. Websites and general search engines were commonly used to seek out the most relevant information. Email was a key means for receiving automatic notification via listservs and exchanging a variety of types of information. Existing listservs for PH professionals typically provide information from news sources and selected titles, abstracts, and links to recently published journal articles and other documents relevant to specific disciplines or diseases. A few informants who were less comfortable with Internet access to information still relied on hard copies of relevant journals that were circulated within their workgroup. The telephone and attendance at conferences provided other important means of accessing information, especially on emerging health threats and new PH practices.

We found that there were significant limitations on the available means of information access identified by participants that could be met by improving electronic access mechanisms. Stating that there were too many relevant websites to search them all effectively or regularly, both groups wanted one portal access to all categories of information via a good search engine. To address delays in becoming aware of important new information, they also wanted automatic notification of newly available information in areas specific to individual interests. They felt websites and automatic notification systems such as listservs were complimentary. Participants in both groups reported feeling bombarded with unfiltered, often duplicative information in emails and from participation in listservs with no way to screen out irrelevant information. They reported similar difficulties dealing with irrelevant and duplicative returns from searching websites because PH-specific keywords are not standardized or used effectively by search engines. Both groups expressed a need for better mechanisms for selecting and filtering information sought from listservs and via search engines.

Both groups noted limitations on access to information in selected PH sub-domains of interest. BCDC professionals noted information gaps in the areas of STDs and refugee and immigrant health. CHP professionals cited limitations on information in areas such as environmental links to cancer, elder health, legislative and policy change nationally and in other states, and newly identified health risks and healthy behaviors. CHP and BCDC informants identified problems in accessing relevant information from related domains outside of traditional PH domains such as in the literatures of marketing, human resources management, organizational behavior, operations management, and others. They would like to be able to formu-late searches, for example, that could access a broad range of databases to find evidence related to: (1) return on investment for worksites implementing health programs;

(2) programs that have been developed in worksites related to communicable or chronic disease prevention;

(3) effective educational strategies to reach employees in worksites; (4) effective interventions to motivate, men, women, elders and other specific population groups to take care of their health; (5) effective quality improvement projects in healthcare organizations; and (6) best practices related to communicable diseases in emergency rooms. They also identified limitations on access to grey literature as well as systematic reviews and full-text of journal articles. Informants stated that not many extensive sources exist for systematic reviews and summary information of interest to PH; however, a few participants were not aware of those that do exist, e.g., the Guide to Community Preventive Services [24] .

Many also expressed difficulty keeping track of information they wanted to save for future access and wanted better mechanisms to archive information accessed earlier in a way that could facilitate easy retrieval. Informants also expressed needs for training in electronic accessing skills and the availability of human-mediated searching via article retrieval services.

In response to the information content, format and access concerns raised by informants we developed a hypotheti-cal model for PH information access grounded in findings from our data analysis [See Additional file 5 for quotes supporting the features included in the model.] The model (See figure 2) includes PH-specific keywords, userselected filters, and pre-formulated search criteria for tailoring information sought via both automatic notification systems and search engines; an automatic notification mechanism that would send information to users that has been filtered according to the user's filtering requests; a scanning and reviewing system to locate, critique/review, and provide links to newly published information relevant to PH professionals, and a customized archiving database of credible information accessed by system users.

In early 2005 when we presented this model to the CHP participants, the component at the top right said simply ""newly published PH information."" We initially presented the model as an approach to accessing and delivering information that appeared in PubMed. Respondents stated that to be very useful the model would have to facilitate access to information from other sources and disciplines not represented in PubMed. It should also reference descriptions of best PH practices and other information often found in the grey literature. In response to this concern, we added the phrase ""in diverse disciplines of interest"" to the model component on sources of information in the upper right of figure 2 . Respondents liked the idea that information would be reviewed before it was disseminated. They expressed a desire to receive a narrative cri- tique of the information from the reviewers and not just numerical ratings expressing the reviewers' findings.

Other information accessing needs identified fell primarily into the category of grey literature and statistical data. These included the ability to search conference websites via a single portal for cutting edge information and expert contact information; access via keyword search to information the CDC has on programs being implemented in other states; easy access to news articles about what is happening statewide related to health programs in schools and other venues; and a database ""mecca"" for surveillance data.

In general, our respondents confirmed many of the findings of others who have investigated PH information needs [5, 6, 14] including the need for access to a wide variety of types of information from a number of different disciplines and the need for improved means to effectively and efficiently identify the information most relevant to specific problems. We believe that our study also adds detail, depth, and updating to preexisting characterizations of PH information needs in several areas: (1) categories of information needed, (2) typical present-day sources of information and common means of accessing information, and (3) perceived limitations of access and proposals for overcoming those limitations.

Six categories of PH information emerged from both groups in our study (see Table 2 ). The six categories can be arrayed along a continuum based on the amount of available research evidence supporting each of the categories. On the continuum shown in figure 3 , we have separated category 5 into two categories: published research reports and meta-analyses/systematic reviews to emphasize the difference between these two resources. The resulting seven-category continuum ranges from limited research support for early descriptions of emerging health threats and new interventions on the lower end of the continuum, through increasing amounts and quality of evidence for the types of information farther along the continuum.

Our classification of PH information extends the typology developed by Nutbeam [4] in that it covers the full range of information needed to inform PH decision-making from basic descriptive data to evidence-based guidelines. Our categories 3-7 are also an expansion of what Brownson [25] calls type 2 evidence or evidence that focuses on the relative effectiveness of specific interventions to address a particular health condition.

Like clinicians practicing medicine, PH practitioners are regularly confronted with new problems and complex tasks that require a timely response, often before researchers can complete studies to offer guidance. Our study con-

Hypothetical model for PH information access presented to CHP informants. firms the findings of others that PH practitioners need access to information at all levels of research support on the continuum in figure 3 . Anderson et al [26] highlighted the need for PH practitioners to access information supported by limited evidence and to weigh the credibility of this information before using it in PH decision-making related to urgent issues that cannot wait for conclusive evidence to accumulate.

Participants identified several limitations in information access and in some cases suggested means for overcoming those limitations. The limitations could be classified in three broad categories: (1) limitations affecting timely and convenient delivery of information including limited access to electronic full text of journals, (2) limitations in access to all categories of information in some content areas (i.e., disciplines outside traditional PH) and in the grey literature, and (3) limitations in locating information that is available, including problems with search terms and in organizing archives.

Participants did not specifically identify as a problem the very limited availability of summaries, commentaries and critiques of PH studies, even after we had presented to them examples of these resources from both PH and clinical medicine. We hypothesize that one reason informants did not report this limitation is that they have had little or no experience working with these types of resources. It is possible that as more summaries, commentaries and critiques become available to PH practitioners that their desire for more of these resources may increase. Participants did identify the need for access to systematic reviews of interventions that are more population-based and PHoriented. One of the few resources we identified that has begun addressing this need broadly is the recently developed Health-Evidence.ca website [27] that provides an online registry of systematic reviews of PH interventions. This project, funded by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research and conducted by Dr. Maureen Dobbins, searches for systematic reviews in a variety of databases of published literature including PubMed, CINAHL (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature) [28] , EMBASE [29] , Sociological Abstracts [30], BIOSIS [31] , and PsycINFO [32]. Selected reviews are rated by two independent reviewers. Review information is stored in a searchable registry. The site also provides summaries of the reviews but has not yet included access to unpublished work. Other databases that present summaries of synthesized evidence-based practice information for public health professionals are more limited, such as the Cochrane Health Promotion and Public Health Field website [33] which addresses only a tiny fraction of common public health issues currently, or more specialized, such as the Australian databases for occupational thera-pists, OTseeker [34, 35] , and physiotherapists, PeDro [36, 37] .

The informants offered a number of potential approaches for overcoming the limitations they identified in timely delivery, access, and location of information. They stated a preference for overcoming these limitations via enhancements made to sources and means of information access they were already using such as PubMed and listservs.

To overcome limitations in timely delivery of information, participants suggested that improved access to the full text of journals in electronic form would be critical. Many of the biomedical journals that publish articles relevant to PH professionals are already available in electronic versions, but the cost of offering access to these journals to dozens or hundreds of PH practitioners can be daunting for any local or state public health entity. However, there are some examples in other countries where this has happened. The Clinical Information Access Program (CIAP) [38, 39] in New South Wales, Australia, and similar systems in other Australian states, have provided access to over 55,000 clinicians in the public health workforce with access to in excess of 400 such publications by government negotiations for reasonable cost licenses for very large populations. An extensive evaluation of this system is being undertaken to examine how availability of such information influences practices.

Many informants from both groups in this study were already receiving news and automatic notification of newly published studies via listservs. Unfortunately comprehensive listservs are available for only a few PH disciplines (e.g., TB Update [60]). Our findings suggest that developing listservs that organize and deliver relevant new information for more PH disciplines may be an effective way to meet some key information needs.

A serious limitation of listservs identified by several subjects is that they tend to deliver large amounts of information in formats that make it difficult for a user to quickly seek out specific information relevant to his/her interests. We are aware of several technical means that some listserv administrators are using to deal with this problem. Items in an email can be linked to an index that appears as the first entry in the email. Links take the user to content contained in the email or on a website. Content developers for clinical medical automatic notification services are using two other techniques to help users avoid receiving irrelevant content: (1) breaking content into many subdomains and allowing users to select to receive information from specified subdomains and (2) engaging volunteer users in a process of filtering content by having them rate the quality and relevance of new information before it is delivered to all the users. Adoption of some or all of these strategies by the developers of PH listservs could effectively address some of the concerns raised in our study.

The request for access to a broader base of information from fields outside of traditional PH disciplines was driven by the need to develop effective evidence-based policies in emerging areas of PH practice such as designing environments to promote physical activity or increase pedestrian safety and developing economic justifications to encourage businesses to introduce health-related programs. CHP informants suggested that access to information from other industries, professions and disciplines would be needed including information from the realms of social marketing, advertising, sociology, engineering, human resources management, and others. Some of this information is contained in journals serving the disciplines of interest, which can be searched through reference databases such as CINAHL, EMBASE, Sociological Abstracts, BIOSIS, PsycINFO, and others. Access to infor-mation in these journals by PH professionals would require establishing access to the reference databases and to print and/or electronic access to the journals themselves. In domains beyond the biomedical, it is likely many PH professionals, like those in this study, do not have skills to efficiently gather evidence or formulate searches. Either the appropriate keywords and data sources are not known to PH professionals, or concepts and keywords that are familiar to them, such as ""intervention venues"" or the ""built environment"" related to injury prevention, are not used in the other disciplines.

Even when PH professionals have ready access to a database of relevant biomedical information such as PubMed, our subjects indicated that locating useful information is hindered by the paucity of PH-oriented search terms. For example, they stated a need for search terms like ""evaluated"", ""cost-effective"", and/or ""population-based interventions"". Development and adoption of more standardized PH search terms could make searches more effective and also facilitate the task of filtering listserv emails. Developers of the Health-Evidence.ca website Continuum of research support for common categories of public health information have not only provided access to systematic reviews of PH interventions but have also made strides in addressing the need for PH-specific search terms. These developers have generated their own set of PH keywords related to domains of PH, population characteristics, intervention sites, intervention strategies and types of reviews (metaanalysis, narrative or systematic).

Pre-formulated search filters use combinations of existing search terms to facilitate identification of information that meet predefined criteria. In clinical medicine, a set of filters aimed at identifying publications reporting high quality, evidence-based studies has been developed, tested and made accessible for routine use in PubMed (PubMed Clinical Queries [41] ). The Partners for Information Access for the Public Health Workforce project [42] has developed dozens of pre-formulated searches aimed at locating information in PubMed relevant to specific Healthy People 2010 goals [43] . Wilczynski et al [44] have developed a set of search filters for PubMed to enable efficient retrieval of articles relevant to healthcare quality and costs based on several criteria related to methodological rigor (appropriateness, process assessment, outcomes assessment, costs, economics, and qualitative research) [45] . Although some of our respondents were familiar with some available filters, they did not appear to be using filters on a regular basis to access information. There is clearly a need to develop and promote more and better search terms and filters for PH since these will be important for locating studies for reviews and for skilled and interested users.

The field of public health is so broad that any study of this sort is limited to collecting data in a few domains in a limited number of settings. Caution is advised in generalizing our findings more broadly to communicable and chronic disease prevention and control practitioners, especially those in city or county health departments or working at the federal level. Also, further investigation is needed in other unrelated PH disciplines to test applicability of findings in these areas because of the wide variation in content and nature of PH practices. Another limitation is that our interviews and group discussions may have been biased towards PH workers with the most interest in information issues.

It seems clear from our study that it is likely that many critical information needs of PH practitioners are not being met efficiently or at all; however, incremental improvements to PH information access are being made. Projects like Health-Evidence.ca and Partners in Information Access for the Public Health Workforce are emerging.

The increasing availability of all types of information on the Internet and ongoing improvements in search methodology and website organization are also occurring, but the task is complex and enormous, and progress seems to be slow. It is our assessment that tools and resources available to clinical medical practitioners are more advanced and sophisticated than those available to PH practitioners. The former include tools such as information sources that summarize and critique findings from research reports (e.g., Cochrane Systematic Reviews) [46] ; those for identifying and accessing a broad range of information including basic facts, research findings, expert opinion, and sometimes associated evidence ratings (e.g., electronic texts such as UpToDate) [47] ; automatic notification services (e.g., bmj.com Email alerting service) [48]; and periodic, discipline-specific literature updates with summaries and commentaries (e.g., Journal Watch) [49]. We believe one reason for this is that the market for information-related products for medical practitioners is large enough and lucrative enough to attract large investments in many new and creative ventures. The result is a proliferation of well-designed electronic texts, multiple sources of expert summary and critique of the literature, sophisticated and highly tailored automatic notification systems, and many other resources. A second reason that PH practitioners have fewer resources available to them is a lack of good primary research in PH that can be systematically reviewed [3, 26] ; however, PH practitioners also do not always have ready access to the best evidence that is available such as basic facts and expert opinion.

Based on our findings from this study, we believe that PH could benefit from a dual strategy for advancing information access. One strategy is the promotion of incremental improvements in existing information sources and access mechanisms, such as providing better and more PH-specific search filters for PubMed and developing more sophisticated listserv applications for disseminating automatic notifications. Initially respondents in this study seemed to favor improvements in simple tools and resources they were familiar with over new and more complex models of information access. This suggests that incremental changes may be more rapidly accepted and adopted than new and unfamiliar systems. However, the generally positive reception to our proposed information access model by the CHP informants, suggests that a welldesigned new system that clearly addresses expressed needs could be well received. Given that products are emerging that address some of these needs such as Health-Evidence.ca, the Partners in Information Access for the Public Health Workforce website, and the PubMed Health Services Research Queries discussed earlier, there is a clear need to integrate complementary efforts rather than duplicating what has already been done. This cannot be accomplished without collaboration across projects, stakeholders, funding sources, and even national borders.

Unraveling the complexities of disaster management: A framework for critical social infrastructure to promote population health and resilience,"Complexity is a useful frame of reference for disaster management and understanding population health. An important means to unraveling the complexities of disaster management is to recognize the interdependencies between health care and broader social systems and how they intersect to promote health and resilience before, during and after a crisis. While recent literature has expanded our understanding of the complexity of disasters at the macro level, few studies have examined empirically how dynamic elements of critical social infrastructure at the micro level influence community capacity. The purpose of this study was to explore empirically the complexity of disasters, to determine levers for action where interventions can be used to facilitate collaborative action and promote health among high risk populations. A second purpose was to build a framework for critical social infrastructure and develop a model to identify potential points of intervention to promote population health and resilience. A community-based participatory research design was used in nine focus group consultations (n ¼ 143) held in five communities in Canada, between October 2010 and March 2011, using the Structured Interview Matrix facilitation technique. The findings underscore the importance of interconnectedness of hard and soft systems at the micro level, with culture providing the backdrop for the social fabric of each community. Open coding drawing upon the tenets of complexity theory was used to develop four core themes that provide structure for the framework that evolved; they relate to dynamic context, situational awareness and connectedness, flexible planning, and collaboration, which are needed to foster adaptive responses to disasters. Seven action recommendations are presented, to promote community resilience and population health.","Recent disasters, such as the oil spill in the Gulf, the tsunami and nuclear reactor leak in Japan, global pandemic, and the earthquake in Haiti have all demonstrated the complexity of responding to events which cross jurisdictional, organizational and other forms of boundaries. Complexity is a characteristic of large scale events, but also manifests in routine disasters such as floods, tornados, outbreaks and hazmat events that occur more frequently. All these events present high levels of uncertainty and require collaborative action between multiple sectors, which are part of complex adaptive systems (Ansell, Boin, & Keller, 2010; Okros, Verdun, & Chouinard, 2011; Wyche, Pfefferbaum, Pfefferbaum, & Norris, 2011) .

Complexity theory and its basic tenets such as emergence, self organization, non-linearity, adaptiveness, and connectivity, are well suited for studying the dynamic and collaborative nature of disaster management. This theory has been useful in the analysis of complex adaptive systems, such as health care organizations, providing knowledge to assist with policy development, and design of information technology and work environments that support nonlinear processes that characterize the provision of patient care (Burns, 2001; Coiera, 2011) . Systems characterized by change, particularly those crossing jurisdictional boundaries, cannot be analyzed without consideration of the dynamic context influencing operations (Ansell et al., 2010; Cilliers, 1998) . The complexity frame of reference recognizes the interactions among system components, and between a given system and the larger environment (Coiera, 2011) , and is now recognized as an essential lens for disaster management and resilience-oriented development (Kahan, Allen, George, & Thompson, 2009) .

Each phase of a disaster has distinct objectives and its own degree of complexity, including time demands, organizational involvement, and functional needs for collaboration (Kahan et al., 2009; Wyche et al., 2011) . As observed during the 2009 influenza A pandemic, the response phase tends to be the most visible, yet depending on the event, the response can be quite short, whereas recovery efforts may extend for weeks, months and years (Norris, Stevens, Pfefferbaum, Wyche, & Pfefferbaum, 2008) . The 2010 earthquake in Haiti exemplifies this. The acute response spanned several months, yet recovery will continue for years, and will continue to require extensive collaboration between Haitian and international agencies to develop the infrastructure to promote population health and resilience in the country. Likewise, following the relatively short response phase for the 2003 outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), recovery and planning efforts to prepare for the next global outbreak have been ongoing for nearly a decade (Public Health Agency of Canada, 2009; Reissman, Watson, Klomp, Tanielian, & Prior, 2006; World Health Organization [WHO] , 2009).

Disasters are typically managed locally, however they become increasingly complex when the impacts cross jurisdictional boundaries and outstrip community resources (McConnell & Drennan, 2006) . Discussions of systems of critical infrastructure tend to focus on securing and protecting hard capital resources, such as facilities, supplies (e.g. vaccines), technology, and equipment. Recognition of soft capital (e.g. people and knowledge) has been slower, and there is a need for deeper understanding of the dynamics of critical social infrastructure and how it influences community capacity. Several authors have recognized this gap and suggest more empirical studies focused on social infrastructure such as communication networks, social capital, collaboration and community engagement, and methods for evaluating resilienceoriented intervention activities which focus on soft infrastructure are needed (Chandra et al., 2011; Sherrieb, Norris, & Galea, 2010; Wyche et al., 2011) .

Complexity theory provides an appropriate lens for modeling social infrastructure in a disaster context for several reasons. First, disaster management, which is dynamic and adaptive, involves cross boundary integration and a diverse mix of people. Second, previous literature has expanded our understanding of the complexity of disasters, but few studies have examined empirically what the necessary ingredients for crisis management are at the grass roots, micro level, and how dynamic elements of critical social infrastructure influence community capacity. This gap in the literature is particularly apparent with respect to protecting and promoting the health of high risk populations, who are people at heightened risk for negative impacts from a crisis, due to the intersection of the social determinants of health (O'Sullivan & Bourgoin, 2010) . These groups are reliant on community supports for activities of daily living, and when these supports are compromised, high risk populations, particularly people with complex medical needs, are at even greater risk for health and social problems, which create additional demands for health and social services.

Interventions to support disaster management have been published, such as checklists of essential tasks to be completed during disaster response and information systems to support aspects of complex collaboration, such as awareness and development of communities of practice (Carroll, Rosson, Farooq, & Xiao, 2009 ). However many interventions focus on macro outcomes, without relating to the complexity of inputs at the micro level, and there is a lack of emphasis on upstream initiatives to address the complexity. Mapping of hard and soft system infrastructure, and how they contribute to managing uncertainty in disaster management, is a gap that has not been adequately addressed in the literature. We suggest the development of resilience-oriented interventions requires unpacking of the complexity at the micro level, and that interventions must emerge from the underlying complex structure including dynamic organizations, processes, technology and people; therefore an essential first step is to model the complexity inherent in the social infrastructure of a community.

The purpose of this study was to explore empirically the complexity of disasters at the micro level, emphasizing the voices of community stakeholders, to determine levers for action where intervention strategies can facilitate collaborative action and promote health among high risk populations. A second purpose was to build a framework for critical social infrastructure informed by the emergent themes from this study and existing literature on community resilience, and develop a model to identify potential points of intervention. This study was conducted as part of The EnRiCH Project, which is a community-based participatory research study focused on enhancing resilience and emergency preparedness among high risk populations.

This study employs a community-based participatory research design. Over the past two years, partnerships have been established with emergency management, health, and social service agencies in five communities in Canada to promote community resilience and emergency preparedness among high risk populations. The communities were selected to represent different geographic and linguistic groups, as well as the presence of complex hazards (e.g. trepid climate; being a hub for transportation; or being located on a flood plain). As part of the broader project objectives, asset/need assessments were conducted in each of the communities between October 2010 and March 2011. The theoretical framework used to guide data collection combined Norris et al.'s (2008) components of resilient communities and Kailes and Enders's (2007) functional needs framework. The tenets of complexity theory were used for data analysis to 1) unpack issues around resilience and functional capabilities assessment, and 2) identify potential points of intervention.

The asset/need assessments involved nine focus group consultations across five communities, using the Structured Interview Matrix (SIM) facilitation technique (O'Sullivan et al., 2009) . We planned two focus groups per community (one evening and one daytime session), to ensure broad representation, however, in one community we canceled the evening session due to low recruitment. In another community, the second session was held on a Saturday, rather than an evening.

The number of participants per session ranged from (n ¼ 9) to (n ¼ 26), with lower participation in the evening sessions. Participants (N ¼ 143) were recruited for the focus groups via distribution of email notices, using purposeful sampling to recruit professionals and volunteers from emergency management, health and social service organizations. Additional recruitment techniques involved snowball sampling as the community members became aware of the sessions and disseminated information through their networks. Broad inclusion criteria ensured representation from different sectors, and fostered inclusion of community groups representing high risk populations. In each community there was representation from municipal or regional emergency management, public health, tri-services (e.g. fire, police, paramedic), emergency service organizations, food banks, and associations which advocate or provide direct care for people with disabilities. Multi-generational representatives from high risk groups participated in the focus groups, including stroke survivors and their family caregivers, several people who are hard-of-hearing or Deaf, people with low (or no) vision, and people who use assistive devices, such as a cane, wheelchair or service animal. The focus groups were conducted in English in three communities and French for the other two. Sign interpreters were provided for participants from the Deaf community and notetakers were provided for people with limited vision or fine motor control, to ensure they could participate. All participants signed a consent form approved by the university ethics review board prior to participating in the focus groups. Ethics approval for the study was obtained on July 23, 2010.

The SIM format for the focus groups involves three phases of data generation and collection. The room is set up with four tables and each table is assigned a different question. The first phase is a series of one-on-one interviews where each participant spends 5 min with a participant from another table and asks them to respond to a specific question. The participant who is the interviewer writes down the response in the form of field notes, whereas the participant being interviewed voices his/her thoughts about the question without the pressure of speaking in front of the whole group. The process is repeated until each participant has interviewed one person from each of the other tables and also responded to the questions from each table. The facilitator guides the group so participants know how to proceed through the matrix. Following the interview matrix, the participants return to their assigned table for the small group deliberation phase, to review and summarize the data from the interviews. Data during this phase is in the form of conversations as the people at each table discuss the responses they received to their question during the interview phase. Each group identifies 3 main findings to present to the larger group during the next phase, which is a facilitated plenary discussion with all the participants.

The SIM design has been used in previous studies to address common pitfalls in traditional focus groups (O'Sullivan et al., 2009) . It is designed for larger groups (10e40 people), yet enables voices of all participants to be heard, and provides a structure to reduce power differentials within the group. In this study, we repeated the phases twice, to generate data for eight questions which focused on strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats to disaster preparedness in each community, with emphasis on protection of high risk populations with functional needs related to communication, complex medical needs, supervision, independence and transportation. The questions were informed by the CMIST functional needs framework (Kailes & Enders, 2007) . Sample questions included: ""What are the strengths/assets/resources within your community that contribute to preparedness for, response to, and recovery from a disaster?"" (the same question was asked in relation to weaknesses/vulnerabilities) and ""In a disaster in your community, what supports and challenges would appear for people who have limited ability to communicate (due to disabilities affecting communication, being socially isolated, or communication technology being down)?""

The data generated from the focus groups was divided into three levels of analysis. The first was the field notes from the interview matrix, which were typically formatted as lists. They were transcribed and open coding was used to organize the data and create a coding grid. The second and third units of analysis were the audio recordings from the small group and plenary discussions. Following transcription and accuracy checks, the transcripts were coded by the first author, using the grid developed from the interview matrix; and additional nodes were added as needed. Preliminary themes were identified and then discussed and revised by all the authors until consensus was reached. The emergent themes, which related to the complexity of disasters, were used to develop a framework to depict the interdependencies and dynamics of critical social infrastructure at the community level.

There were two primary objectives of our analysis. First was to identify core themes that unpack the complexity of community resilience and population health as it pertains to disaster and emergency management. Second, we identified a set of action recommendations as potential intervention strategies, to address the complexity from the core themes. This approach is consistent with recommendations from several authors (Chandra et al., 2011; Coiera, 2011) who suggest it is important to map systems and reduce complexity to identify 'levers' which can be used to overcome system inertia and resistance to change. Hence, through a complexity lens we identified the core themes and action recommendations and mapped them (with directional relationships) into a framework of critical social infrastructure.

The results of this study are presented in two parts. First we discuss the core themes and action recommendations that emerged from our analyses. They provide an understanding of the complexity of disaster management and highlight the hard and soft system aspects of that complexity, as well as potential intervention strategies. Second we show a formalized model which maps the complexity from the themes with existing literature, and highlights the relationships between the components of critical social infrastructure ( Fig. 1) . This model depicts a framework for critical social infrastructure which can be used to protect high risk populations in the context of disaster management, but has broader applications for identifying levers which can be targeted for interventions to promote community resilience and population health.

What became clear during our analyses was the interconnectedness of the various components of the hard and soft systems in a community, and how culture provides the backdrop for the social fabric for both. The four core themes (dynamic context, awareness and connectedness, adaptive response and collaboration) underscore this interconnectivity and represent the structure for the framework, as shown by the darker line around these components in the model (Fig. 1) . From the action recommendations we identified micro level inputs that support core components in the model and represent levers for action to managing the dynamic complexity.

Interconnectivity and emergence are basic tenets of complexity theory and emerged in the discussions of how community context continually changes. This theme is represented in Fig. 1 as 'dynamic context', which changes in response to restructuring, political pressure, emerging hazards, generation of information, changes in human needs and capabilities, and the influence of increased situational awareness.

The factors influencing the context of a community in all phases of a disaster are multi-directional, and they interact with the culture. Political priorities influence funding structures and priorities and trickle down to the municipal level, while at the same time grass roots initiatives exert upward pressure to influence political priorities. Disasters highlight gaps in community systems and stimulate change in protocols to prepare for the next disaster.

Expanding knowledge and skills, social networks, emergent opportunities for collaboration, evolving relationships, lessons from previous disasters, and changing attitudes with increased awareness, all contribute to the dynamic context of a community and the complexity of the inputs that lead to an adaptive response. The following quotation from a participant in Community A exemplifies how vulnerability is a dynamic context: ""Vulnerability is an area that can change. We have a changing demographic .

[that] makes a difference in the makeup of your population, but if a new facility is built into your community, then it tends to draw people there, you've perhaps within a very short time frame changed the level of vulnerability within your community.."" Build situational awareness and connect the dots A second core theme was the need for awareness and connectedness in each community. Awareness develops in a nonlinear pattern, is influenced by a variety of processes, and loops back to exert influences on the inputs themselves, creating a catalyst for sustainable action. Along with connectedness, it exemplifies the tenets of emergence, self-organization, and connectivity in complexity theory. The participants listed numerous assets available in the communities, and there was a defined need to be more aware of various organizations, the services they offer, and the resources that could be drawn on to assist with a community response. Awareness and connectedness emerged as the foundation for a resilient community, to maximize the use of critical social infrastructure and enact a collaborative, adaptive response to a disaster.

All 5 communities emphasized the importance of relationships founded on trust, and learning from others who have expertise that could contribute to situational awareness, particularly around the needs of people with functional limitations. The following quotation from Community B exemplifies how this theme relates to resilience:

"". there is agency to agency communication, but it seems to be in pockets. how do we make that widespread? . [it is important to] broaden our links and make better use of our human capacity, so we're talking about person to person, whether that's through email or other links, making use of those.""

The stroke club is a group of people who are caregivers and stroke survivors who support people in the community who are recovering from stroke. This group was largely unknown to participants in the focus groups, yet it represents an important resource in the community with connections to a population at risk of being forgotten in disaster planning and response, due to changes in social connections, functional abilities, and participation in home, work and community life. During the focus groups the participants gained awareness about the important role the stroke club assumes in any community, and their connectedness to this high risk group. The population of people who have had a stroke in any community changes on a daily basis. Therefore, it is essential to leverage the knowledge organizations such as the stroke club have, because they monitor and actively seek connections with families coping with stroke.

One challenge in creating a more connected and aware community is the availability of time and opportunities to get to know people. In each community there was a need and willingness, but systemic barriers make it difficult for people to take time to develop connections and learn from each other. The following quotation depicts how participants in Community D felt leadership is needed to create opportunities for connectedness:

"". it does take leadership though, to bring people together and then to keep them together even if there is a willingness to do so. I'm not sure if we really know where the leadership needs to come from. . Provincially they're trying to do it, but the province is just so big and so diverse that there are pockets of activity.. Often it takes somebody who is not involved in any of the organizations that has a passion for it to happen."" 

The third core theme emphasizes how planning is important, but plans need to be pliable, so response activities and protocols can adapt to changing contextual demands. As plans become more complex, there is a risk that the response will become rigid and unrealistic, whereas optimal response relies on organizational adaptive capacity, to respond to the changing needs of a disaster. Plans provide a good structure to consider the 'what ifs', however, it is essential to have flexibility when the context changes quickly, and what was planned may not be easily implemented. This really underscores the importance of the collaborative process and the strengthening of relationships as the foundation of a good response.

Creative solutions emerge when people are open to new ways of thinking. It demands a shift in paradigm, which may require revisions to protocols or authoritative structure, and fluidity in sharing resources. Pliable planning and open mindsets align with resilience-oriented solutions that focus on assets and embrace complexity, as opposed to accounting for every imaginable risk and trying to control dynamic contexts. This core theme intersects with awareness, as the knowledge of resources and knowing where to find information provides empowerment among the population.

Participants in Community D expressed the need for "".agencies to move beyond their mandates to support clients where there might be a gap in service"". This comment was specifically oriented toward assisting high risk populations with complex functional needs, where privacy policies, resource constraints, and rigid authoritative structures often restrict organizations from collaborating in client care. The group was concerned about the risk of people ""falling through the cracks"" during disaster response, when gaps in service are likely to occur.

When systems are overwhelmed and demands for resources increase, a collaborative lens is needed. This theme crosses several tenets of complexity such as emergence, self-organization, connectivity and adaptiveness. Understanding how assets in the community can be used to assist with the response, and engaging non-traditional stakeholders (e.g. companies that sell RVs or snowmobile clubs) may provide new solutions to help systems cope with overwhelming demands. Redundancy in assets and services provides a safety net when capacity diminishes, but also duplicates efforts that could be used elsewhere; this is part of the complexity of resource distribution.

As described by one participant in Community D who was referring to surge capacity in hospitals:

""How do we move people around? The system is at capacity now, so how do we extend that in a disaster situation? We need to look at alternate supports . we need to get over the 'silo-ing' of our resources and be more flexible""

""We need to know what's out there because there's lots we've all said and there's different supports for different target populations but we're not always sure where they are and then you know you can marry those together with the needs. But it's what do we have? Who needs it? How do we bring it together?""

Seven action recommendations emerged in our analysis and are depicted as micro level inputs in the formal model (Fig. 1) . Each recommendation has embedded complexity to guide preparatory, response and recovery actions in disaster management and contribute to building social infrastructure for adaptive response.

They are presented as levers or intervention strategies to promote population health and community resilience.

The first action recommendation relates to the opportunity/ crisis dichotomy of how community assets often present vulnerabilities or challenges as well. It depicts non-linearity in complex systems and how interdependencies emerge as assets, but also liabilities when the system becomes disrupted.

The good news in each community was the extensive lists of available assets, particularly the knowledge within response organizations and community associations. The bad news, or challenge, was how to manage the complexity of coordinating the assets. Connectedness is considered to be an asset and is good news for disaster management, as it expands possibilities for resource sharing, training and access to information. However, the inherent challenge with increased engagement of community organizations is that the enhanced awareness prompts more demands for preparedness activities, information and support.

New technologies present good news because they expand possibilities for interoperability between organizations, however technologies also present vulnerability because of the dependencies that are created. Many technologies, such as electronic health records, resource databases, transportation, surveillance systems, and social media, assist with disaster response, but are reliant on power, hardware, and the skills and willingness of people to use them. When systems are disrupted, processes such as communication protocols, surge capacity, access to information, risk management, and supply chains dependent on transportation systems, are all affected because they rely on interoperability between humans and technology. The following quotations are from discussions in Communities E and D, respectively:

""We are at the technology era, with Blackberry and all the network gadgets. But one of the first things to fall apart during a catastrophe is electricity. We have our Blackberry but we still carry around our pager in case the system falls and we need to communicate with each other. I also always carry around my good old papers which inform me how to contact my people when something serious happens."" ""I think typically people rely on television for that source of communication. It could be through radio or now it's twitter, it's facebook, it's other forms of social media, and if those systems go down, it's how do you reach the population?""

The action lever recommended here is for communities to recognize that pliable contingency planning is influenced by awareness of the good news and bad news associated with each asset. Collaborative asset mapping which acknowledges the opportunities and threats associated with different resources or aspects of the community context enables organizations and support personnel to be open-minded and adapt to changing circumstances and demands.

Inherent in the complexity of planning and preparing for disasters is the matrix of uncertainty surrounding potential impacts of extreme events. There is often uncertainty about roles and responsibilities of various actors in the health care sector and extended community, the needs of the population, and potential solutions to minimize the damage and restore system functions as quickly as possible. Individuals need information about what to do in an emergency and how to prepare, while organizations need to know about resources and continuity planning, and how to align organizational plans with those at the macro level, The emergency management sector needs to become aware of the assets and needs of high risk populations and how to incorporate them into contingency planning activities. As discussed in Community B:

""As we were going around [during the focus groups] we found out that many organizations have incredible resources available already. that's where this whole knowledge, access, mobilization came in. Because we started talking about the different things, and everybody went 'wow I didn't know about that' and it's like none of us knew. And probably a lot of the rest of you didn't know, so we think that's really important""

Assumptions are part of the complexity in disaster management and the matrix of uncertainty. People are part of critical social infrastructure in a community, and they bring assumptions about how needs should be prioritized, what information is known or unknown about the situation, and what supports will be available. Situational awareness about available resources and potential solutions fosters adaptive responses to uncertain events, and these outputs are influenced by how people and organizations use information. As described by a participant in Community B: ""We all have to look at the bigger picture and make sure that we have our back up plan and our back-up-back-up plan"".

The availability of new communication technologies has streamlined many operations in disaster management, however there are complexities surrounding the sharing of information, both vertically and horizontally, formally and informally. Peoples' skills in using new technologies also contribute to interoperability of new information systems. Connectedness and having ample information are assets, however it is essential not to provide people with too much information that it becomes overwhelming and the messages confusing. The participants recommended having a central hub to manage communication. Sociotechnical considerations, such as training people how to use communication systems, making them convenient so people will use them, and ensuring they are interoperable between organizations are paramount to ensuring the flow of information is efficient and effective. These complexities around sharing and accessing information as a micro level input are represented in Fig. 1 .

The action lever recommended here is to ensure the complexity of pushing and pulling information across individual, organizational and broader societal levels is recognized and simplified as much as possible, to ensure essential information is accessible, but not overwhelming. Community engagement can contribute to determining what type of information should be shared, in what format, and through which channels.

The participants emphasized the need for target populations and agencies which advocate for high risk populations to be engaged in disaster management activities, particularly providing guidance on specific functional needs and how responders can identify and act when providing services. Community organizations can suggest strategies for talking to people with cognitive or emotional limitations during evacuation efforts, such as asking the individual how best to assist him/her. One person in Community D said: ""If I'm injured or something happens, I'll say, hey look, I don't have my hearing aids, I need you to look at me . so sometimes the support can be from the actual person that has the chronic condition"". During the large group discussion, a participant from Community C commented:

""Community organisations' field expertise is one of the strengths we can rely on for better emergency preparedness, response and recovery. Their leadership and sense of innovation along with their close contact and good knowledge of the high risk populations are of great value before, during and after disaster interventions.""

As shown in Fig. 1 , people and their skills and networks are part of critical social infrastructure. Engagement of target populations is not always a simple task. Opportunities for connectivity, collaboration and sharing knowledge require investment of effort, time and money, which in turn requires higher authoritative support and structures. However, the lever for action recommended here is for communities to invest in efforts to identify expertise among the population, and to reach out to the population and invite them to be part of planning and training for the response community. Inclusiveness and reaching out is an important antecedent for people to be willing to share their expertise and contribute to their community.

Organizational resilience requires diversification of skills and strategic redundancies to ensure key functions are maintained. It demands a paradigm shift where staff are trained to do tasks required for their own job as well as other jobs, in case a co-worker becomes injured, ill, or has competing demands at home (such as caregiving responsibilities, damage to their own home, or they have been displaced as a result of the event). This crosses the tenets of emergence and non-linearity in complexity theory. One group in Community E emphasized the need for surge capacity and the dilemma of being understaffed:

""Sometimes there's contradiction among contingency plans. In the case of pandemics, hospital recruitment plans would ask our staff, notably social workers and other stakeholders e already dealing with the crisis in our establishment e to give hospitals assistance. We would then become understaffed and have difficulty maintaining our services to the population""

The micro inputs identified in this theme are people, their knowledge and their skills. The action lever recommended is to build redundancies within the system and invest in human development, so people can step in and provide an adaptive response when context changes and the everyday protocols don't work, or the people typically responsible for a given task are unable to respond.

A recurring question was 'who would I call for this?' This theme speaks to the emergence of networks in a community, which is one aspect of the complexity. The value of fostering an inclusive culture must compete with the backdrop of the inherent challenges of having an enormous guest list for planning activities. Participants from one city noted there are 5000 organizations in their community, therefore the dilemma became one of balancing the complexity of identifying which organizations need to be at the table, and ensuring collaboration and engagement could reasonably be facilitated. However, to align with the predominant themes which endorse efforts to foster connectedness and draw on the expertise in the community, inclusivity must be front and center when fine tuning the invitation list for collaborative planning activities, to ensure high risk populations are represented and their functional needs are acknowledged.

Several participants emphasized stigma and lack of awareness about 'how' to include high risk populations in planning activities. An invitation to participate is a first step, however it is important to ensure people who are invited are provided with the means to support their engagement (such as support for communication through sign interpreters, ensuring barrier-free meeting spaces, and providing a safe atmosphere to feel comfortable expressing their needs). The following quotation is from a discussion that occurred among participants in Community D:

""I think most of us here are dealing with vulnerable populations.the very nature of our business has a certain stigma attached to [it] ..So that becomes one of those things that you have to get over in order to engage these other groups that could be a support""

Culture and networks were added to the model as micro level inputs to represent this theme. The action lever recommended is for communities to foster a culture where inclusion of people with different functional capabilities is valued, desired and expected. However, the extension of an invitation to the planning table must be backed with a commitment to accommodate needs so everyone can truly participate.

Invest time and effort in relationships . with haste Solid, trusted relationships were identified as the foundation on which collaboration, communication, mobilization of resources, and knowledge of population needs are based. The development of trust occurs as people recognize other peoples' competencies and intentions, and have the opportunity to work together. 'Knowing' that you can rely on someone for information or assistance contributes to trust and confidence in relationships as organizations and individuals let go of power, egos and rigid protocols to facilitate creative solutions and collaborative action.

An inherent complexity in collaboration is the need to invest time in developing and nurturing relationships, but few participants believed they had the time to do it, and some doubted whether their organizations would support it. Yet willingness to collaborate was expressed by this participant in Community E and was prominent throughout the discussions in each community:

""Maybe we shouldn't wait until the next meeting convened by a university research to get back to each other. I think we have the willingness to collaborate, we all wish to get together to be able to help one another.""

The micro level inputs from this theme are represented in the model as networks, people, and structures. They all feed into connectedness, willingness to collaborate, opportunities to share information and activities to foster awareness. The action lever recommended here is to invest time and resources in building relationships and establishing trust and common ground. This strategy supports the development of social capital and ultimately adaptive response to changing context.

Identifying high risk populations is a complex process and many communities have considered developing databases to assist response organizations in knowing who requires additional support during a response. However, because of privacy laws and other issues related to having lists of 'vulnerable people', there are strong arguments against the development of central databases. An alternative strategy is to engage community organizations that already have established relationships with high risk groups and contact lists for people who need particular supports. The following quotation is an excerpt from the focus group in Community D where the group discussed the merits and challenges with having a central database for people with disabilities:

""So the question is, should there be some sort of database available for all the people with disabilities that has a basic fact sheet? Their name, their family contact, their medication, their basic limitations, like not a big long 8 page summary, but their basic information.I don't know. I don't know what the answer is."" . ""it's a bit of a dilemma . you want to know where people are and help them, but on the other side respect their privacy...""

In our model, the micro level inputs relating to this theme are informal and formal protocols, structures, information and boundaries. These inputs require coordination, resources, and collaboration to foster awareness of who is most at risk during daily living, and in a disaster context. The action lever recommended here is to invest time, energy and human resources toward helping response organizations connect with community groups who are aware of and have established relationships with high risk groups. This fosters connectivity, which is one of the main tenets of complexity theory and an essential component of community social infrastructure. Fig. 1 depicts the Framework for Critical Social Infrastructure to Promote Population Health and Resilience which emerged as the summation of data analysis, informed by knowledge from previous studies on disasters, complexity, communication, awareness, collaboration, and community resilience. The model shows integrated complexity at the micro level where the inputs are continually in flux and interacting to influence the type and availability of resources, the coordination of hard and soft resources, and the willingness and empowerment of the population to collaborate, before, during and after a community crisis. All of these elements intersect to determine community capacity at a given time, and within a given context, and ultimately influence situational awareness and adaptive response.

The inputs in the model are potential levers for action, which can be targeted for interventions to enhance community capacity for adaptive response. For example, policies and structures respond to different political pressures, such as recognition of the need to provide more accessible spaces and services for people with disabilities. This has an impact on people, organizations, and demands for information. It also influences subsequent awareness, attitudes, willingness to collaborate, and the culture within a community. Because dynamic context requires continual adjustment, a 'new normal' is continually defined within a community and influences its resilience at any time. When a traumatic event exerts an impact on a community, the shift requires a tailored response and all the inputs represented in the model are drawn on to update situational awareness and adapt to the changes.

Each of the core themes were placed into the model with a label (e.g. dynamic context, awareness, connectedness, collaboration, and adaptive response). The themes align with different components of complexity theory, and show the interconnectivity of dependencies within a system. The action recommendations were also assigned a label and placed within the model to show how the micro inputs (e.g. people/information/structures/networks) feed into the core structures. The macro outputs exert critical influences on how a community responds to a disaster in an adaptive way. These outputs in turn loop back to influence micro level inputs such as formal and informal social networks, information, structures and protocols, and people's knowledge, attitudes, and skills. Many of these inputs change in response to previous experience or new context, such as hazard identification, new resources or political pressures within a community, vicarious experience from disasters in other regions, and people leaving or entering the community. They all influence community capacity and resilience, and should be considered when designing community and organizational interventions.

Complexity occurs across different levels and between and within different systems, including agent complexity (e.g. individuals and families), organizational complexity (within formal and informal community groups), and cross-boundary complexity (between organizations and across jurisdictions). Previous studies have emphasized the need to unpack complexity and identify levers for action to improve health system performance (Coiera, 2011) and community resilience (Chandra et al., 2011) . In this empirical study we explored the complexity of community disasters at the micro level, to determine levers for action where intervention strategies can be used to facilitate collaborative action and promote health among high risk populations. The emergent themes were formalized into a model and combined with knowledge from existing literature to present a framework for critical social infrastructure, to simplify the complexity within health and social systems and identify potential points of intervention to promote population health and resilience.

The four core themes which emerged in this study showed complexity related to: a) managing dynamic contexts; b) situational awareness and interconnectivity; c) flexible planning to ensure adaptive response; and d) active engagement and the challenges of collaborative work. These themes created the structure for the emergent framework and are consistent with the suggestion by Okros et al. (2011) that complexity can be understood by analyzing adaptive systems which operate according to chaotic, spontaneous, unpredictable changes from ""dynamic interactions amongst multiple entities"" (p. 43). The key to unraveling complexity in disaster management is to understand how these issues intersect and develop interventions to enhance community capacity and promote collaborative activities, to increase situational awareness and facilitate adaptive responses to dynamic, complex events.

The inputs we identified are contained within and across all types of boundaries, such as those identified by Ansell et al. (2010) (e.g. political, geographic, functional, time) . The outputs in our framework are consistent with previous literature (Carroll et al., 2009; Chandra et al., 2011; McConnell & Drennan, 2006; Pfefferbaum, Reissman, Pfefferbaum, Klomp, & Gurwitch, 2007) , however an important finding from our study is that complexity is a constant at each input and output of the system, and is an integral part of interactions with other systems. Our results support the objectives of resilience (resistance, absorption and restoration) outlined by Kahan et al. (2009) and the guiding principles outlined in the FEMA National Response Framework (2008), which emphasize ""engaged partnership; tiered response; scalable, flexible and adaptable operational capacity; unity of effort through unified command; and readiness to act"" (p. 8). While the participants in our study acknowledged the need for leadership and centralized coordination, more prominent themes emphasized collaboration, awareness, and flexible planning, with the understanding that coordination of resources and protocols is a way of building relationships and situational awareness for better understanding of community assets and needs. These themes support suggestions by Kahan et al. (2009) that complexity is the backdrop for community resilience and must be integrated into any intervention strategies designed to support high risk populations who are dependent on the health and social system supports. Chandra et al. (2011) also emphasized the need for empirical studies to unpack complexities and provide specific mechanisms or levers for action which can be used to tailor intervention strategies, such as the action recommendations provided here.

The intersection between health and social services systems is a good example of how community crises naturally cross system boundaries. In Canada, and worldwide, the transboundary nature 2006) . These examples underscore the need to consider how the impact of massive demands on the acute health care system radiate into other parts of the health sector where service delivery is provided, including public health and home care, as well as occupational health and safety, employee assistance programs, and other sectors which ultimately influence population health. There is extensive literature on the need for coordination and collaboration for unified, comprehensive response to disasters, and national frameworks for disaster response acknowledge the need for multisector engagement and action. Population health and resilience requires collaboration between multi-disciplinary sectors, to ensure there is adequate surge capacity, as well as efficient and effective communication, particularly when infrastructure and operating systems are disrupted (Chandra et al., 2011; FEMA, 2008; Okros et al., 2011; WHO, 2009) .

Contingency planning is an important community process, and the complexity of developing coordinated emergency plans amidst a matrix of uncertainty was a central point of discussion in each of the communities, consistent with extant literature promoting allhazards planning (McConnell & Drennan, 2006 ) and a whole-ofsociety approach (Chandra et al., 2011; WHO, 2009) . Coordinated plans provide structure to consider the possible scenarios and response strategies, however flexibility is essential because selforganization, a central tenet of complexity theory, is often what evolves during a disaster when the context changes quickly (Norris et al., 2008) . Action recommendations from our study, supported by the literature, include interventions designed to facilitate openminded, pliable contingency planning, to ensure organizational adaptive capacity (Cilliers & Preiser, 2010; Kahan et al., 2009) . Wyche et al. (2011) emphasized the role of flexible protocols in the provision of support for people evacuated after Hurricane Katrina. The responders were empowered when they were able to appropriately bend protocols to meet the immediate needs of the survivors and adapt to the emergent issues that arose in the shelters. In the context of pandemic, the WHO (2009) recommends contingency planning include designating and training alternate people for critical positions in any organization, to ensure back-up is available to sustain operations. This represents an important action lever for interventions at the micro level to utilize redundancy as a key strategy for surge capacity.

The need for situational awareness was the most prominent theme in this study, and the complexity of increasing awareness amongst organizations and the public was something each community struggled with. In particular, communities were challenged to connect the dots by identifying organizations with resources that could be used in training, information-sharing, and service provision. This finding is consistent with previous studies (Chandra et al., 2011; Norris et al., 2008) emphasizing organizational and individual linkages as key components of community resilience. Our results underscore the need for possibility thinking, to allow organizations to dismantle silos, create functional and informational linkages, and cross boundaries more easily to manage the dynamic context during a disaster.

Collaboration emerged as an important output in our study, with an emphasis on inclusion of people with functional needs, and community organizations who are not traditionally involved in disaster planning. This is consistent with the findings from Chandra et al. (2011) suggesting engagement and partnerships are critical for community resilience, but that opportunities to engage in resilienceoriented activities are limited. Part of the complexity of fostering collaborative activities is the culture clash between different sectors and organizations, which McConnell and Drennan (2006) describe as institutional fragmentation. The expense and logistics of engaging a wide variety of organizations create additional barriers, yet interventions which foster collaborative activities can be useful for sharing information, social learning, and building collaborative relationships (Carroll et al., 2009; Kuziemsky & Varpio, 2010) .

Two important limitations of this study should be considered. First, the data from this study is limited to five communities in Canada, therefore cannot be generalized. Second, recruitment for this study was broad, including participants in full time paid positions with extensive expertise in emergency management, as well as volunteers and employees from community organizations with little to no experience with disaster planning. Our study provides an empirical model to map critical social infrastructure within a community and identify levers for action to promote community resilience. It represents an assets-based lens for identifying resources and opportunities to reduce vulnerabilities for high risk populations, but can also be applied to the broader community to promote well-being. Future studies could explore the directional relationships depicted in the model and effectiveness, feasibility and appropriateness of different intervention strategies targeting each of the inputs in the framework of critical social infrastructure presented in this paper. In particular it will be important to determine how to fully engage representatives of high risk populations and non-traditional organizations not typically involved in disaster planning activities.

Promoting population health in a disaster context requires a shift from risk management to one of resilience, which by its very nature acknowledges changing complexities. The results from this study underscore the need to move from a command and control model to one of collaboration, which is at the core of the Framework for Critical Social Infrastructure to Promote Population Health and Resilience presented in this paper. By unraveling the complexities of the inputs and outputs influencing adaptive community response, it simplifies the identification of target points for intervention to enhance resilience. 'One size fits all' solutions are not adequate to promote community resilience. Instead, intervention design must emerge from the complexity of the situation and be tailored to the community context at any point in time.

Risk Management and Healthcare Policy Dovepress Critical role of ethics in clinical management and public health response to the West Africa Ebola epidemic,"The devastation caused by the Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in West Africa has brought to the fore a number of important ethical debates about how best to respond to a health crisis. These debates include issues related to prevention and containment, management of the health care workforce, clinical care, and research design, all of which are situated within the overarching moral problem of severe transnational disadvantage, which has very real and specific impacts upon the ability of citizens of EVD-affected countries to respond to a disease outbreak. Ethical issues related to prevention and containment include the appropriateness and scope of quarantine and isolation within and outside affected countries. The possibility of infection in health care workers impelled consideration of whether there is an obligation to provide health services where personal protection equipment is inadequate, alongside the issue of whether the health care workforce should have special access to experimental treatment and care interventions under development. In clinical care, ethical issues include the standards of care owed to people who comply with quarantine and isolation restrictions. Ethical issues in research include appropriate study design related to experimental vaccines and treatment interventions, and the sharing of data and biospecimens between research groups. The compassionate use of experimental drugs intersects both with research ethics and clinical care. The role of developed countries also came under scrutiny, and we concluded that developed countries have an obligation to contribute to the containment of EVD infection by contributing to the strengthening of local health care systems and infrastructure in an effort to provide fair benefits to communities engaged in research, ensuring that affected countries have ready and affordable access to any therapeutic or preventative interventions developed, and supporting affected countries on their way to recovery from the impact of EVD on their social and economic lives.","The magnitude of the recent Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in West Africa has been unprecedented in many ways. This is the first time an EVD outbreak has occurred in West Africa although EVD outbreaks in Africa have been documented since 1976. This outbreak is unique in its size, duration, and spatial extent. 1 It has generated intense debates on appropriate international responses to infectious disease emergencies, the processes of researching new treatments and vaccines during an epidemic outbreak, and standards for prevention and care. These debates have also focused national and international attention on disparities in health care standards between developed and developing countries, on differing applications of ethical standards governing the right to health between developed and developing countries arising from these disparities, and the ethical responsibilities of various agencies in the current and future infectious disease outbreaks.

In this paper, we analyzed the ethical considerations that arose from the clinical management and public health responses to EVD outbreak in West Africa, identified the similarities and differences in the application of these ethical standards in developed and developing countries, and considered the implications of our findings for future global health emergency responses. Our analysis is based on a reflection of the social-ecological model widely used in health behavior research and practice to assess the multiple levels that influence a health issue. More specifically, this model is unique because it allows the researcher or practitioner to identify the individual, interpersonal, organizational, community, and public policy factors that contribute to a particular health issue or event so that health professionals and/or researchers may identify the best intervention or research methods. Therefore, we will detail the ethical issues that impact the Ebola epidemic from a social-ecological model analysis.

The West African EVD epidemic resulted in the death of five times as many people as every other known EVD outbreak combined. 2 It is also the largest ever emergency operation in the 70 year history of the World Health Organization (WHO). 3 Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Guinea bore the brunt of the epidemic, though cases were also reported in Nigeria, Mali, Senegal, the United States, and Spain. Only three infections occurred outside West Africa (two in the US and one in Spain). At the time of the EVD epidemic in West Africa, another EVD epidemic caused by an unrelated EVD strain occurred in the Democratic Republic of Congo in August 2014, with 66 cases and 49 deaths. This was contained, and the country has remained EVD free since November 2014. The West African region had been on the brink of being declared EVD-free several times but for instances of new case identification in Sierra Leone 4 and Liberia. 5 The region was finally declared EVD free on January 14, 2016. 6 There are, however, potentials for multiple flare-ups in the region as some survivors could sexually transmit infection. 7, 8 The West Africa epidemic was different in many respects to past EVD epidemics. First, it is the largest and longest EVD outbreak in history, 3 involving several developed and developing countries. Fears of cross-border transmission resulted in over 50 countries around the world issuing travel restrictions to and from EVD-affected countries. 9 Second, the epidemic garnered international support, including significant investment in the research and development of vaccines 10 and therapies 11, 12 for EVD infection, although the response was slow and arguably inadequate. 13, 14 Third, it stimulated debates at many international, regional, and national fora about compassionate access to experimental regimens for therapy during epidemics and alternative clinical trial designs to test the efficacy and effectiveness of vaccines and therapies. The debates resulted in guidelines being developed, 15 and considerations for revised ethical guidance on clinical trial design and sharing of biospecimens and data. 16 Actions are also being taken to institute structural measures for improved emergency response capacities around the world. 3 One of the ethical debates was the overarching moral problem of severe transnational disadvantage, which has very real and specific impacts upon the ability of citizens in Liberia, Guinea, and Sierra Leone to proactively exercise their right to health under normal conditions, let alone when their countries were in the grip of an epidemic. 17 Of note, Liberia had 51 doctors for its population of 4.3 million people. 18 The drastically under-resourced health care structures and systems in these countries constitute moral problems in themselves and both heighten and complicate the other ethical issues that arose in relation to the epidemic. Accordingly, we reviewed the literature and discuss ethical considerations in the West African EVD outbreak from a perspective that is grounded in a critique of the social and structural elements that contributed to the deprivation of the individuals and communities that bore the brunt of the epidemic. These include ethical analysis of public health measures such as quarantine, isolation, protection of health care workers, and travel restrictions. We also analyzed the debates that had taken place regarding research ethics, including the conduct of research during public health emergencies, the ethics of randomization, standards of care both within and outside research studies, and the sharing of biospecimens and related data internationally. Finally we considered the ethical issues surrounding the topic of EVD survivors.

Three months elapsed (from December 6, 2013 to March 10, 2014) between the first death now attributed to the West African outbreak, and the first notification of national health authorities. By this time, there were clusters of infection in four districts. 19 The recent histories of civil war, unstable government, and political violence in the affected countries negatively impacted the ability of the health systems to meet the care and containment demands of an exploding public 

Ethics, Ebola, and public health health crisis. Also, the civil distrust of and misgivings toward the government, due to long years of neglect of health services and systems, slowed down the public response. 18, 20, 21 At the time of the outbreak, many international donor agencies that had handled past emergency health problems were establishing fledgling transitional systems intended to reduce donor dependence in the region and were therefore not operating at maximum potential. [22] [23] [24] [25] Also, individuals had grown to depend on alternative health care providers in view of the dilapidated health care structures and systems. 25 Thus, the initial calls by the government to take precautions against EVD infection were treated with levity. The disease was unknown in the region, and the public health messages stigmatized cherished traditional practices as ""risky behaviors"", arising from the logical clinical and epidemiological framings of contagion. 26 For example, the cultural practice of burial rites, which were designed as a means of parting with the dead through a show of dignity and respect, were now labeled ""bad"", and people were requested to make immediate and extensive changes in their core practices and ways of relating and interacting to curb EVD spread. 26 Also, the sudden urgent need for clean water for regular hand washing brought with it its own challenges as access to regular clean water was limited. 27 Public myths and misconceptions soon grew from the government actions, with many believing that the government was merely interested in sourcing for new foreign aid for further personal enrichment. 28 With increasing cases of EVD infection, poor standards of care in health facilities, 29, 30 high case fatality, 31 and large numbers of people turned back from treatment centers, 32 many individuals also had to become personally responsible for their individual care. Care of the sick at home became the backup for managing many cases, 33, 34 and in such situations, individuals had to learn to provide care for infected and affected loved ones while ensuring personal protection.

Quarantine helps to contain new infections during an infectious disease outbreak. 35 One of the criticisms of the initial outbreak response was that the quarantine was poorly managed. Koch 35 and Barbisch et al 36 argue that quarantine of whole communities could be ethically justified, particularly if the containment area included the entire area within which individuals from a community would usually travel. Koch 35 describes this as a spatial focus for quarantine rather than one focused on a targeted population. It allows for better concentration on humanitarian medicine for the infected, as far greater concentration of resources would be available for a smaller pool of infected people. A call for ""spatial"" quarantine for EVD containment may be at odds with the ""principle of least infringement"", an ethical principle applied in public health contexts to curtail the use of liberty-restricting interventions to the least restrictive action required to meet a public health goal. But when the public health goal is containment of an infectious disease to meet the dual goals of enabling the best possible care for the sick within the quarantine zone, as well as to reduce the spread of infection, such a measure could be ethically justified. Restrictions should therefore be done in a way that is relevant, legitimate, and necessary, and stakeholders should be fully informed about the risks and benefits, especially as they affects their health, well-being, and personal liberty. 37 Those quarantined should also not suffer unfair economic penalties. 37 The tension between quarantine as a public health measure and individual rights to privacy, liberty, and freedom of movement is well recognized, and the need to strike a balance between the utilitarian aim of promoting public health, on the one hand, and libertarian aims of protecting privacy and freedom of movement on the other hand, have been widely discussed. [37] [38] [39] There is a reasonable expectation that when people are asked to surrender their liberty through quarantine, there is a reciprocal obligation to provide adequate care for individuals who have complied. When such care is not forthcoming or when it is inadequate, it can be argued that the individual, who is legally required to report for quarantine, does not have a moral obligation to do so.

For a situation like the EVD epidemic where scientific uncertainty about the disease was pervasive, respect for the rights and dignity of affected persons required commitment to planning to address the associated challenges. 38, 39 The lack of consideration for the needs of the most affected individuals when quarantines were instituted during the EVD epidemic affected the success of quarantines measures to quickly contain the epidemic: 3 the associated unmet basic needs and economic constraints resulting in the need for food were common reasons given for the breach when affected cities were ""shut down"", 35 thereby limiting the effectiveness of instituted quarantine.

As part of the ""fear"" response to EVD in the USA, asymptomatic health care workers returning from West Africa were required to be quarantined for 21 days. 9 This form of quarantine is similar to one proposed by American law Risk Management and Healthcare Policy 2016:9 submit your manuscript | www.dovepress.com

Folayan et al professor Gostin 39 who, in another infectious disease context, suggested that citizens may be forcefully excluded from returning to their home for a period of time when an infectious individual poses a risk to others on international conveyances. We consider, however, that the probable benefits of a restrictive measure for health care workers returning to their home country are not sufficient to justify any burden placed on individuals through the restriction of their liberty, taking into consideration any probability. 40 Subsequently, the quarantine order for health care workers returning to their homeland from the EVD zone was deemed counterproductive and ""morally wrong"" by the President's Bioethics Commission. 41 The action was also not evidence based, infringed the right to liberty of affected individuals, 42 fueled stigma, 43, 44 and constituted a roadblock to the ongoing EVD response. 45 It imposed barriers to the movement of health care workers to and from affected areas and impeded their ability to contribute their skills to the management of the public health emergency. 45 

Isolation of individuals sick with EVD during the period when they could transmit infection is an appropriate public health response. Confinement should, however, be in safe places, and isolated individuals should have access to adequate health care, food, clothing, and means of communication with families and friends. 39 The appalling state of many isolation units 46 and the poor treatment of infected persons in West Africa 47 was a disincentive for anyone to self-report at EVD treatment units. Sick patients in West Africa may not be morally obliged to seek isolation, regardless of the law, knowing that isolation likely implies dying alone without family and friends. WHO 3 noted this as one of its main challenges for EVD containment: people continued to stay at home and secretly bury their dead even when sufficient treatment beds and burial teams were available. Sick patients in developed countries will, however, be morally obliged to seek isolation, since optimal care will be provided in well-equipped care centers.

For a situation like the EVD outbreak where no curative medicine was available and where access to a reasonable standard of supportive care was the best that treatment facilities could offer, equitable distribution of such care is of great ethical importance, given the public health imperative for people to show up at treatment units. No preferential treatment should be offered on the basis of profession as a show of respect for the rights and dignity of infected persons.

Concerns about the potential for EVD to travel across borders resulted in travel restrictions in many countries, and screening for fever was recommended at the airports in Liberia, Guinea, and Sierra Leone and instituted in many airports worldwide. 9 The possibility of Ebola being used for bioterrorism intensified concern about cross-border movement of people who may have been exposed to EVD. 48 Instituting travel bans far from the Ebola epicenter, however, defies the public health ethics principle of least infringement, which recognizes the need to respect and protect individual and community needs, interests, rights, and liberties and to ensure that these are curtailed to the minimum degree required to curtail a public health threat. 41 The international laws recognize the right to freedom of movement to leave and return to one's country of origin. 49, 50 While restricting travel of persons infected with EVD may seem intuitively right to contain the epidemic, such restriction would reduce the opportunity for medical evacuations, which was demonstrated to increase rates of survival. 51 In addition, allowing travel in and out of Ebola-affected nations facilitated the movement of humanitarian workers and supportive materials for EVD prevention, care, and infection control.

Ethical dilemmas that informed health care workers' response to the epidemic Health professionals of all kinds, from a village midwife to hospital doctors, featured in the transmission chains. 52 The poor infrastructure and support systems for sick persons 53 resulted in health care workers in some facilities being afraid to provide care 54 -a reasonable fear, given the high number of infections affecting the health force. 55 Yakubu et al 56 recognized the fundamental issues that underscored health workers concerns and possible reluctance to offer services during the epidemic in West Africa and advocated that health care workers are under no obligation to provide medical care for patients with EVD when the government cannot provide them with required personal protective equipment and training to play their role safely and effectively.

For health professionals working outside the West African region, the risk of exposure was remote, but nonetheless did occur due to people with EVD either traveling while ill 57, 58 or being medically evacuated. 57, 59 Some of the health professionals who handled patients' care were not adequately trained to provide care for patients with EVD and were left vulnerable to infection. 60 The infection of foreigners who traveled to the West African region resulted in considerable debate about which categories of health care workers are obliged to provide care and which are not, and whether there are particular medical procedures that should be barred for patients with EVD because of the risk posed. 63, 64 In addition, public concerns focused on the obligation of employers to ensure provision of adequate equipment for health care workers faced with the risk for EVD infection. Debate over the optimal design of protective equipment 65 resulted in protocols recommending different levels of respiratory protection 66 and detailed training on the use of personal protective equipment.

The EVD outbreak catalyzed a flurry of scientific activity to consider investigational compounds under development and to hasten their pathway into human trials. In 2014, the Ethics Advisory Committee to the WHO met and issued a statement that supported the use of unregistered interventions in the EVD epidemic. 15 This gave credence both to EVD research efforts and to compassionate use of unproven agents. There were intense debates about the appropriate design and conduct of EVD vaccine and drug trials. Much of this debate centered on the ethics of randomization in the midst of an epidemic with high case fatality. [67] [68] [69] [70] [71] Those in favor of randomized clinical trial argued that EVD clinical trials present a situation of genuine uncertainty, and therefore justified randomization to experimental treatment versus placebo. [72] [73] [74] Also, drug registration for licensure would require data generated through randomized clinical trials. 70, 71 Those in favor of alternative trial designs 67,68,75-78 noted that ethical standards guiding therapeutic research should be flexible enough to give the dying ""a chance at rescue"". 78 Also, alternative research designs facilitated access of persons to experimental products to reduce the risk of fatality, especially with promising experimental products. 67, 78, 79 The Ebola ca Suffit trial provided evidence on the suitability of an alternative vaccine trial design to generate evidence on the effectiveness of a vaccine. 80 Ethical dilemmas informing policy response to the epidemic Within a public health emergency, values defined by public health ethics -an overriding priority afforded to ""greater good"" considerations 57,81 -should take precedence over individual concerns, according to ethicist Dawson. 82 Dawson was particularly concerned that the WHO Advisory Panel meeting held in September 2014 83 focused on ""individualistic"" values -the use of unregistered interventions for clinical care or prevention -rather than on the ""old fashioned public health methods"" such as quarantine, contact tracing, and social distancing. 82 In response, Haire and Folayan 79 argued that access to treatment, whether experimental or not, should not be separated from ""public health ethics"", given that community support for and compliance with public health containment measures requires some reciprocity. Also, some hope of an effective treatment, however remote, could assist individuals and communities in accepting otherwise unwelcome public health measures.

Some scholars argued that developed countries have an ethical obligation to support countries in the EVD zone. 20 Countries in the EVD zone were in dire need of support to control an outbreak that was out of hand, and such support would be at minimal cost to the developed country. 84, 85 As sponsors of EVD therapeutic research, the developed countries had an ethical obligation to contribute to the containment of EVD infection by strengthening local health care systems and infrastructure in an effort to provide fair benefits to communities that are engaged in research. 20 Also, recognizing that relationships with others will inevitably require mutuality and reciprocity implies that developed countries need to provide support for affected West African countries at their time of need. 45 The strengthening of the health care systems to enhance EVD response and support current and future research should be considered a social response to the needs of developing countries by developed countries. 20 Ethical considerations on sharing of data and biospecimens for EVD response

The collection of biospecimens is critically important for advancing research into treatment and preventative interventions and for improving understanding of the pathogenesis and genetic variation of EVD. 86 As such, specimens must necessarily be collected during an outbreak and shared with other researchers working on developing treatment and vaccines long after the epidemic is over. This raises ethical issues about informed consent. While informed consent ought to be obtained before taking any specimen, caring for very ill people focused on survival in often suboptimal treatment units makes this difficult. Also, there are concerns about obtaining informed consent from minors who may not have parents or guardian present while quarantined, or the parents may have died as a result of the epidemic. In 

Folayan et al the case of deceased people, the USA regulations do not require consent before taking biospecimens. It is, however, recognized that deceased people may have had interests and values regarding the use of their specimens that should be respected. 86 Similarly, the USA does not require consent for use of deidentified specimens, but the ethical concerns still hold, since genomic research, where data cannot truly be deidentified given that every human genome is unique, is possible. 48 Jecker et al 87 therefore identified the need for additional guidance on the challenges of obtaining informed consent for collecting and sharing biospecimens in the context of a public health emergency.

Concerns about sharing of benefits accruing from biospecimen and data sharing has been raised in view of the competitive and privatized nature of EVD research and drug development and the reality that most of the EVD-related research would need to be conducted in high-tech Biological Safety Level-4 laboratories found more readily in developed countries. 88 Lessons from the 2009 influenza A (H1N1) vaccine development process, and how financially empowered economies bought up manufactured vaccines, are recent examples that cause concern about future access to EVD treatments and vaccine. 89 It is proposed that before data sharing of any kind occurs, there should be clear and equitable benefit sharing arrangements created through legally enforceable contractual obligations to ensure that people in EVD-affected countries have ready and affordable access to any therapeutic or preventative interventions that result from research. This proposal is in line with the principles enshrined in the 2011 Pandemic Influenza Preparedness Framework 90 and respects the principle of reciprocity. 91

For EVD survivors, a different set of dynamics come into play. Many survivors are left impoverished. EVD infection means that personal property is confiscated with little or no support to replace these assets upon recovery. 92 Misconception about the likelihood of contagion of EVD post-recovery gives rise to stigma and discrimination resulting in many survivors not being able to retain their jobs or get new jobs. 93 The high demand for the blood of EVD survivors for therapeutic purposes meant that selling of blood, even in the black market, was a good means of income generation for many survivors. 94 The sale of blood and blood in exchange for income by the poor is a well-recognized practice in many countries, including those affected by the Ebola outbreak. 95 This consideration posed an ethical dilemma for the Global Emerging Pathogens Consortium when considering how to compensate blood donors for their research on use of EVD survivors' blood for EVD therapy research, recognizing that EVD survivors have a right to the income they make from sale of their blood. 96

The EVD epidemic resulted in extensive loss of life and property. Altogether, 26,350 persons were managed for EVD infection and 11,315 lives were lost. 97 The extensive casualty and the embargoes on travels and movements during the outbreak also affected trade and agriculture, resulting in food insecurity in affected countries. 98 The impact of the epidemic on education remains unmeasured, yet the fact that schooling was extensively disrupted would have short-, medium-, and long-term consequences at the individual, family, and community/national level. Extensive donor investment in the EVD response also has implications for funding of other research in the region as research funds were moved away from other disease areas to address the EVD emergency response needs. 99 The instituted infection control measures also affected social interactions, although the scope of impact of EVD epidemic on the social dynamic of affected countries remains largely unknown and would be difficult to measure because pre-epidemic data are rarely available due to the unpredictable nature of disease outbreaks. However, it is known that infectious diseases have severe impact on biodiversity. [100] [101] [102] The WHO's report on lessons learned from the 2014 EVD outbreak in West Africa 3 identified four big lessons all related to the structural interventions provided during the epidemic. The report failed to recognize the immense changes in the dynamics of life and livelihood of affected individuals, communities, and the country and the need to support affected countries on their way back from recovering from the social, environmental, cultural, and economic tolls of the epidemic. Such support would involve long-term commitment from international partners and donors. Unfortunately, the outcomes of such long-term support are difficult to measure. Yet, the people in West Africa impacted by EVD outbreak need such long-term support.

At the individual level, support is needed to help survivors resume normal lives and to address challenges such as emotional distress, health issues, loss of possessions, and difficulty regaining their livelihoods. 103 

Ethics, Ebola, and public health face stigma, rejection, loss of jobs, 104 and have to deal with posttraumatic stress disorders and health challenges associated with EVD. 105, 106 If affected countries organize their EVD surveillance systems in line with WHO requirements, 3 it will be possible to organize the provision of support for survivors in need. However, surveillance systems as an epidemiological measure and a potential tool for intervention come with ethical challenges. First, it limits privacy as names of persons with EVD diseases will need to be reported. The use of namebased surveillance for HIV infection 107 set the precedent for this public health measure. Such surveillance systems must however, be less intrusive. Affected communities need to be consulted on its importance, design and use, and the data must be used for legitimate purposes 39 only, such as providing relief materials for interested individuals, as we have identified.

While confidential handling of data may not be a challenge in developed countries, this will likely be so for countries in the EVD zone, which have poorly developed health systems in general and surveillance systems in particular. 108 This once again highlights the need for support to build the health systems in affected countries not just to be able to respond to the EVD epidemic but also respond appropriately to the management of infectious diseases in general. The absence of basic essential elements of public health is a recognized vector for EVD in affected countries. 28, 38 The call to strengthen health care systems in EVD-affected countries is an ethical and moral call.

Effective EVD responses require extensive consultations and discussions with communities on appropriate measures of and support for instituted mechanisms to respond to the epidemic. The privacy-limiting nature of name-reporting associated with the operations of surveillance systems to monitor EVD requires that the public be educated about this measure and consulted on how best to undertake contact tracing. EVD survivors should also be consulted about how best to institute surveillance and contact tracing systems that reduce the risk for stigma. 39 Social interventions at the community level include galvanizing support for members of the extended families who have adopted children orphaned by EVD. 109 The possibility of supporting prompt adoption of orphaned children by qualified persons should also be explored. International support programs or projects should not seek to subsume these community practices of orphaned and vulnerable chil-dren's support with attractive alternatives. Rather, safe local practices of child care should be promoted. 110 Ethical obligation for EVD response at the country level At the country level, it is the ethical obligation of governments and appropriate authorities to ensure that hospitals maintain resources and adequate health care professionals to isolate and treat new patients with EVD. With depleted numbers of experienced health care workers in EVD-affected countries resulting from the high case fatality rate (as high as 59%), 111 affected countries will need regional and international support to augment health care delivery for citizens beyond providing support for those infected with EVD. The global community needs to continue to support medical personnel to travel to affected countries to help provide medical care for the short and medium term while the country makes effort to train more medical staff. There have been such past practices between national governments through North-South Collaborations and South-South Collaborations. 112 Public policies on management and control of epidemiccausing infectious diseases in general, and EVD management and control specifically, need to be developed. For example, in the wake of the EVD outbreak in Nigeria, the national research ethics code was revised to allow for country access and use of experimental drugs on compassionate grounds for the management of EVD. The absence of this policy was a disincentive for the use of experimental drugs for Dr Sheik Humarr Khan in Sierra Leone. 113 Public health policies in developing countries would also need to be revised to address the obligations of health care personnel to work in the time of an infectious disease outbreak. Policies that can guide the scientific and ethical conduct of research at the time of a national emergency would also be helpful and a welcome development. Policies on isolation of infected persons and quarantine of affected persons need to be based on robust legal and ethical justification. For EVD, where the probability of transmission and severity of harm justifies the need to restrict movements of people for public health purposes, consultation and communication with affected communities on ""why"" and ""how"" to implement measures is an ethical imperative. The options for practicing quarantine and isolation should not create divides between social classes and result in unjust treatment of the poor, such as creating food insecurity. 38, 39 Resources should also be committed to providing support for those who lose income through isolation and quarantine, as equity requires that those who 

Folayan et al forgo their freedom for the public good through quarantine and isolation should be compensated. 39 A broad public debate in each country is, however, required on how best to achieve equity. The outcome of the debate should inform policy and guidelines development.

Ethical obligation for EVD response at the global level While travel advice and warnings about EVD-affected countries are welcome and appropriate global EVD public health responses, travel bans are not an effective response, but rather have significant negative consequences. Global solidarity for responding to a regional crisis can make significant difference to a health crisis at the individual, community, and national levels, as lessons from the field of HIV studies have demonstrated. The success of the US response to global HIV epidemics through its PEPFAR (President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief) program is a testimony to this. 113 US funding for the global HIV response is less than 1% of the annual budget. 114 Yet, this minor budgetary allocation has had tremendous impact on the epidemic in developing countries. The same could be done for EVD-affected countries in West Africa.

As we go into the future, one of the ethical responsibilities of the global community is ensuring prompt unconditional access of low-income countries to developed therapies for EVD management. EVD outbreaks could still occur in the future. In view of the health and social development challenges of countries affected by EVD, the focus of the EVD response in West Africa should be one that combines genuine respect for the dignity of people with the idea of human development. 115 This, therefore, requires that the global community should plan ahead for future outbreaks. While current EVD therapeutics are being developed by pharmaceutical companies and researchers in the North, plans need to be instituted for future access of these therapies by affected communities in the South. The WHO and appropriate entities like Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization need to start discussing modalities for future access to developed therapeutics ahead of product licensure and future outbreaks.

A global response to the EVD epidemic in West Africa is an ethical requirement of national, regional, and international governments in view of globalization and the diminishing relevance of national boundaries. The EVD outbreak dem-onstrated the magnitude of what can be achieved within a short time with global solidarity. We live in a time of fluid borders brought on by ease of travel, technological innovations, and an aggressive global media. This denies us the intellectual luxury of viewing global issues such as HIV infection, global warming, and, now, EVD from the narrow lens of a domestic crisis. It is a global crisis with impact at the individual, community, national, and international levels associated with ethical responsibilities for individuals, collectives, governments, and donor agencies.

Risk communication and management in public health crises,"As the world faces its first influenza pandemic in 40 years, it has been argued that we have never been better prepared. Concern about emerging infectious diseases has fuelled significant public health and political developments, such as the coming into force of the International Health Regulations (IHR). Since the turn of the century, the World Health Organization (WHO) has documented a historically unprecedented number of emerging infectious disease outbreaks, and lessons drawn from their management have confirmed the critical importance of effective communications, specifically through formal channels such as WHO and in the public domain.","As the world faces its first influenza pandemic in 40 years, it has been argued that we have never been better prepared. Concern about emerging infectious diseases has fuelled significant public health and political developments, such as the coming into force of the International Health Regulations (IHR). Since the turn of the century, the World Health Organization (WHO) has documented a historically unprecedented number of emerging infectious disease outbreaks, and lessons drawn from their management have confirmed the critical importance of effective communications, specifically through formal channels such as WHO and in the public domain.

In concert with novel emerging infectious diseases, the communication landscape itself has also changed radically. We now live in an era of real-time electronic communications; consequently, approaches to surveillance are being transformed. Data sources, information messengers, mechanisms of data and information transfer and audiences are all changing. Instant and global transmission of information has become a powerful ally, along with peer pressure, for WHO in ensuring that member states comply with new obligations to swiftly declare outbreaks considered to be of public health importance. There is now significant global attention and accompanying investment which should, the authors suggest, be used as an opportunity to improve strategic and operational communication capacity to respond not only to pandemic influenza but also to other public health threats.

There are many concepts of communication in relation to risk associated with outbreaks. As these are relatively new concepts, this article will consider approaches relating to highlighting public health threats and supporting operational management, addressing these as the communication of risk and subsequent risk management. Strategic considerations are critical to both, although information, messengers, communication tools and audiences may differ. The communication of risk refers to the process by which information regarding outbreaks is identified and shared with the purpose of increasing awareness amongst key stakeholders of the threat. Key stakeholders for public health threats include WHO, national governments and the public. Risk management, by contrast, refers to the management processes associated with response to the outbreak, for which communication is crucial at each stage. Three examples are used to explore the challenges and demands of communicating effectively and coherently given this changing landscape. This brief paper will attempt to show the progress made, draw lessons to be learned and outline the ways forward.

The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2002-2003 was an unprecedented public health emergency played out on the international stage. The disease, caused by a novel coronavirus, resulted from spread of the virus from civet cats to humans in the food markets of southern China; once individuals were hospitalized, the virus spread nosocomially to infect other patients and staff. The first reports of this novel disease outbreak came from the local media, and were later substantiated by e-mail messages. These caused international concern, in part because it was feared that a new influenza pandemic was emerging, and heightened as formal confirmation from Chinese authorities was not forthcoming. 1 Whilst the international community remained largely powerless, there being no legal mandate to ensure that China clarified what was occurring, cases appeared in other countries, further raising the stakes.

Thus, the SARS story highlighted a number of challenges to the communication of risk. First, with the advent of, and wide access to, the Internet and e-mail, information through informal and largely unverifiable sources can be transmitted to worldwide audiences within the public domain ahead of information sharing through formal channels. Second, because of the speed of movement of people, diseases can emerge in countries far from their source before outbreaks or the pathogens that cause them have been confirmed or identified.

SARS galvanized the international community to finally conclude drafting of the revised IHR. The IHR bind WHO member countries to not only notify all events that may constitute a public health emergency, but also to respond to requests for verification of information. WHO has also produced outbreak communication guidelines to aid in the dissemination of information to the public, recognizing that 'expertise [in communications] has become as essential to outbreak control as epidemiological training and laboratory analysis'. 2 The boundaries between risk communication and management are not, however, sharply delineated, as illustrated by the controversy surrounding H5N1 influenza virus sharing. Indonesia is one of the countries hardest hit by outbreaks of H5N1. Virus sharing with the international community is the mechanism by which, first, viruses developing pandemic potential can be tracked (risk communication), and second, vaccines can be developed to meet global need (risk management). Indonesia refused to virus share, not because it was opposed to the sharing of technical information to better understand the threat posed by H5N1 avian influenza, but because it felt excluded from equitable access to the resulting vaccine, meaning that its management of a subsequent pandemic would be constrained. 3 It could be argued that Indonesian authorities currently view virus sharing as an important element in risk management and thus a sovereign issue, although the international community, by contrast, views virus sharing as a critical element of risk communication and, by extension, a global risk management issue. Differing interpretations of international treaties are possible and resolution is proving challenging. 4 Ultimately, the debate is centred on the boundary between the governance of risk communication and risk management, the former now being mandated through international laws, with the latter remaining, to a large degree, a national sovereignty responsibility.

Implicit to better risk communication is a belief that better risk management will automatically follow. Surveillance is, after all, 'information for action'. Communication, co-operation and coordination are necessary at an international level. However, they are also, as the illustration below highlights, necessary at national and subnational levels.

In August 2005, Hurricane Katrina made landfall on the Gulf coast of the USA. The worst consequences were felt in New Orleans, Louisiana, where the levee system was breached and billions of dollars of damage occurred. The storm also caused significant loss of life and many people were displaced from their homes. The magnitude of the hurricane was anticipated, the risk having been communicated at both local and national level. However, this risk warning was not heeded appropriately. For example, although mandatory evacuation was eventually ordered, there was little provision for the large numbers involved or for those citizens who could not evacuate themselves. The aftermath of the storm, with many people left living in squalid conditions, also revealed a risk management process that left much to be desired. 5 One notable example was in the coordination of a bi-partisan emergency federal health policy response, attempts at which were blocked by the White House, citing multiple concerns including relevance and cost. The subsequent delay resulted in profound health, economic and political consequences. 6 Several lessons may be drawn for the risk management of disease outbreaks. Firstly, although risk communication may occur, it does not automatically result in a co-ordinated risk management response. Second, this occurred in the USA, a country which clearly has the public health and disaster management resources to deal with such a problem. However, these resources were not mobilized effectively, efficiently or in a timely manner. At the heart of many of the problems were fractured communication systems. Among operational problems, there were failures in communication technologies subsequent to the weather conditions and, whilst some decisions required extensive information, others were made on the basis of unverified rumours reported by the media, leading to incoherent responses. 5 Communication failures occurred between the local, state and federal agencies, and there was a lack of clear roles and responsibilities. Although New Orleans had experienced previous hurricanes and had a disaster management plan, the plan was clearly operationally fragile.

It is important to ensure that national strategic plans are operational. Recent reviews have reported that this does not yet seem to be the case. [7] [8] [9] The confusion and lack of clarity in the response to Hurricane Katrina show that traditional ways of working and their dependency on traditional communication systems may falter in the heat of a crisis. New ways of communicating allied to clearly defined roles and responsibilities may be needed.

In the changing landscape outlined, there are clearly many challenges for effective risk communication and risk management. In terms of the communication of risk, this article has focused on progress on the international stage. It is recognized that challenges still remain at national level, but the diversity of these is beyond the scope of this brief paper.

As illustrated by the examples above, tensions exist at national level between international commitments to communicate risk and risk management responses. However, because of the speed of movement of people and goods, global risk management is now as fragile as the weakest link in the community of nations. The challenge is, as with risk communication, to develop an operational framework that acknowledges national sovereignty but is also cognisant of national and individual interdependencies and connectedness.

The global response is building effectively upon the 'dry-run' of SARS, and lessons can be drawn from other public health crises such as Hurricane Katrina. The current global influenza pandemic and the attendant international attention offer an opportunity that should not be squandered. The almost unprecedented energy, political commitment and resources committed to this need to be built upon and harnessed, integrated and extended to support effective responses to public health threats. As the current H1N1 pandemic unfolds, it will be interesting to see how well lessons drawn from earlier public health emergencies have been learned. 10 Ethical approval None sought.
