The Evolution and Genetics of Virus Host Shifts,"Emerging viral diseases are often the product of a host shift, where a pathogen jumps from its original host into a novel species. Phylogenetic studies show that host shifts are a frequent event in the evolution of most pathogens, but why pathogens successfully jump between some host species but not others is only just becoming clear. The susceptibility of potential new hosts can vary enormously, with close relatives of the natural host typically being the most susceptible. Often, pathogens must adapt to successfully infect a novel host, for example by evolving to use different cell surface receptors, to escape the immune response, or to ensure they are transmitted by the new host. In viruses there are often limited molecular solutions to achieve this, and the same sequence changes are often seen each time a virus infects a particular host. These changes may come at a cost to other aspects of the pathogen's fitness, and this may sometimes prevent host shifts from occurring. Here we examine how these evolutionary factors affect patterns of host shifts and disease emergence.","Emerging infectious diseases affecting humans, wildlife, and agriculture are often the result of a pathogen jumping from its original host into a novel host species. This can take the form of spillover events that result in dead end infections or short stuttering transmission chains, or a host shift with successful infection and sustained transmission in the new host (Box 1). Host shifts have resulted in multiple human pandemics, such as HIV from chimps [1] and the H1N1 ''Spanish flu'' from birds [2] , which have both killed tens of millions of people. Other important human pathogens have originated from other host species, including Plasmodium falciparum [3] , SARS coronavirus [4] , Hendra and Nipah viruses [5] , and the measles virus [6] . Past host shifts can be detected when the phylogenies of hosts and their pathogens are different (phylogenetic incongruence-Box 1). This is very common, with a survey of the published literature finding 93% of studies comparing host and pathogen phylogenies showed evidence of host shifts [7] , and there are relatively few cases where the pathogen phylogeny mirrors that of its host completely [8] .

Here we examine the evolutionary factors that affect a pathogen's ability to infect a novel host and then discuss how the ability of a pathogen to adapt to be transmitted efficiently by a novel host can allow its long-term persistence. Following a host shift, selection will favour mutations that allow a pathogen to (a) enter a host cell with greater efficiency and (b) ''fine tune'' or optimise their fitness in the new host, for example by better utilising cellular machinery, enhancing immune avoidance, optimising virulence, and maximising transmission potential. Our focus is on viruses, owing to a wealth of recent studies, and because RNA viruses are the most likely group of pathogens to jump between hosts, possibly because of their ability to rapidly adapt to new hosts [9] [10] [11] [12] . While we focus on genetics in this review, behaviour and ecological processes are clearly a hugely important factor in determining whether a novel host is exposed to a novel pathogen, and whether onward transmission occurs [10, [13] [14] [15] .

The susceptibility of potential hosts varies enormously, and an important predictor of susceptibility is how closely related a novel host is to a pathogen's natural host ( Figure 1A ). This ''phylogenetic distance effect'' has been repeatedly found using experimental cross infections in all major pathogen groups, including studies of fruit flies and viruses [16] , plants and fungi [17, 18] , beetles and Spiroplasma bacteria [19] , insects and Wolbachia [20] , and fruit flies and nematodes [21] . This is presumably because close relatives of the natural host offer a similar environment to that which the pathogen is adapted to. This is likely to be especially important for pathogens because of the myriad of molecular interactions pathogens have with their hosts to infect cells, utilise resources, and avoid or suppress the host immune response.

Reconstructions of host shifts in nature have confirmed that pathogens are more likely to shift between closely related species. By reconstructing the phylogeny of rabies viruses isolated from various species of bat in North America, it has been possible to look at the patterns of cross species transmission in the wild. The rate of cross species transmission was greatest for closely related species [22] whether looking at spillover events (recent infections that might not persist long-term) or host shifts that successfully became established [13] . Similarly, viruses and other parasites of mammals are most likely to be shared by more closely related hosts [10, 23, 24, 25, 26] . Additionally, the phylogenies of hantaviruses and their rodent and insectivore hosts show evidence for host switching, with data suggestive of preferential shifts between closely related species [27] . However, within these examples there are cases of pathogens transferring successfully over great phylogenetic distances [28, 29] .

Closely related species may also have similar levels of susceptibility, regardless of their distance from the pathogen's natural host ( Figure 1B ) [16] , which we call the ''phylogenetic clade effect.'' Such effects could be due to certain host clades having lost or gained immune or cellular components that affect susceptibility to a given pathogen [30] . This may mean that the host phylogeny is a patchwork of clades with varying levels of susceptibility, with clades of susceptible hosts scattered across the tree, sometimes in taxa distantly related to the pathogen's natural host. This has been demonstrated in experimental cross infections of fruit flies and sigma viruses [16] , where after accounting for distance from the viruses' natural hosts, the effect of the host phylogeny explained almost all of the remaining variation in viral load. If this pattern is common, it may explain cases where viruses and other pathogens recurrently shift between distantly related taxa, such as transmission of influenza viruses among birds, pigs, and humans [2] , or human to bovid transmission of Staphylococcus aureus [31] , although host ecology likely also plays a role in these instances.

The strength of these effects of the host phylogeny varies between pathogen groups, with RNA viruses and pathogens that already have a broad host range being particularly prone to jumping between distantly related species [10, 12, 32] .

At the molecular level, the availability of suitable cell surface receptors to allow viruses to enter cells may be a cause of phylogenetic effects on host shifts. For example, the ability of an avian influenza virus to infect a host is initially, at least partly, determined by the presence and within-host distribution of a2,3-linked host sialic acid (SA) receptors [33] .

Some pathogens may already be pre-adapted to a novel host, but specific mutations are often required to enhance a pathogen's fitness in the new host if it is to establish successfully. A diversity of traits may change to adapt the pathogen to its new host, such as the efficiency of replication, and avoidance or suppression of host immunity, but the binding of host cell receptors is commonly especially important.

In bacteriophage (viruses of bacteria), mutations that enhance a virus' ability to bind to host cells are important in determining a virus' ability to infect a host. One mechanism is spontaneous mutations, which typically change host range by altering amino acid sequences in host-binding proteins, including tail fibres and capsid proteins [34, 35] . Similarly, experimentally evolved phage selected to infect previously resistant bacterial genotypes or different bacterial lineages also acquire mutations in genes encoding host-binding proteins [36] [37] [38] .

In vertebrates, the importance of receptors is supported by an analysis of 64 human viruses, which found that those with the broadest host range used receptors whose amino acid sequences are the most conserved [39] . Furthermore, changes in the ability to bind host cells can also be essential for host shifts by viruses of vertebrates. This is the case for the influenza virus, which binds to sialic acid receptors, of which there are two basic types (SAa-2,3-and SAa-2,6-Gal-terminated saccharides) [33] . Avian influenza viruses bind SAa-2,3 receptors in the respiratory The pathogen is less successful in host clades more distantly related to its natural host. (B) ''Patches'' of highly susceptible-or highly resistant-clades of hosts, may be scattered across the host phylogeny independently from their distance from the natural host. All of the species in the clade labelled ''a'' are equally distantly related from the pathogen's natural host. However, the species in the clade marked ''b'' are highly susceptible, despite being distantly related to the natural host. doi:10.1371/journal.ppat.1004395.g001 Box 1. Glossary Host shift. We define a host shift as a parasite shifting to infect a new species of host. Spillover infection. An infection that results in a deadend infection with no onward transmission or a stuttering chain of limited transmission in the new host. Phylogenetic incongruence. If the topologies of host and parasite phylogenies are not the same, it suggests that the parasites have switched between host species during their evolution. Clade. A group of related species with the same common ancestor (they are monophyletic). and gastrointestinal tracts of birds. Conversely, human seasonal influenza viruses predominantly bind to SAa-2,6 receptors in the upper respiratory tract of humans. However, humans possess SAa-2,3-sialic acid receptors in the lower respiratory tract. Though it is relatively difficult for influenza viruses to get into and out of the lower respiratory tract, avian influenza viruses do occasionally infect humans. Such infections typically result in severe disease with little or no secondary transmission. Successful adaptation to humans requires mutations to the SA receptor binding site in the hemagglutinin gene that allow the virus to utilise SAa-2,6 receptors and thus increase the potential for efficient transmission between humans [33] . A related example of the importance of changes in receptor binding is the switch of parvoviruses from cats to dogs, which was due to two mutations in the viral capsid gene that allow it to bind the canine transferrin receptor [40] . Table 1 . Factors that evolutionary theory predicts will affect the likelihood that the correct set of mutations will arise to adapt a pathogen to a new host.

Factors favouring a host shift

The fewer mutations required to adapt to a new host, the more likely it is that they will all occur Epistasis and mutation order If mutations have to occur in particular combinations to confer high fitness, then the chances of adaptation may be reduced Mutational target size If many different sites in the genome can be mutated to adapt to a new host, then the correct mutations are more likely to occur

Trade-offs If mutations reduce other components of a pathogen's fitness, such as replication in alternative hosts, they may be less likely to spread in the pathogen population.

Mutation rate High per nucleotide mutation rates increase the chance of specific mutations occurring, but can also slow rates of adaptation as many mutations are deleterious

Recombination rate Genetic exchange, such as the exchange of plasmids, homologous recombination, and the reassortment of viral genomes, can allow the acquisition of adaptations to new hosts Effective population size (N e ) Natural selection is more effective when the effective population size is large, and large N e populations generally have more standing genetic variation, which can accelerate adaptation Generation time Short generation times can increase rates of adaptation Such theoretical predictions as listed above have been shown to be important for adaptation per se [87] , and these population genetic parameters will also be important in determining the ability of a pathogen to adapt to a novel host. doi:10.1371/journal.ppat.1004395.t001 The virus naturally infects Hibiscus plants, but following five passages in an alternate host, (Chenopodium quinoa) the same eight mutations repeatedly occur [57] . (B) Parallel genetic changes in codon 30 of the gag gene (Met to Arg) following three independent transfers of SIVcpz into humans [59] . When a chimp was subsequently infected with HIV-1, the residue reverted back to Met. The coloured blocks represent either a Met (yellow) or Arg (blue) at codon position 30 in the HIV gag gene. (C) Parallel changes in protein function following independent transfers of SIVs from chimpanzees (HIV-1) and sooty mangabeys (HIV-2) into humans. SIV Nef protein does not antagonise tetherin in humans, and so other HIV proteins have evolved the ability to antagonise tetherin [64] . The exception to this is HIV-1 group O viruses, which do not appear to have evolved anti-tetherin activity. In HIV-1 group N viruses the evolution of antitetherin activity in Vpu may have come at a cost, as Vpu no longer degrades CD4 receptors to aid the release of viral particles [61] . The coloured gene names in the schematic represent the gene that provides the anti-tetherin function in that host and viral lineage. doi:10.1371/journal.ppat.1004395.g002

If pathogens need to adapt for a host shift to be successful, then the risk of a host shift will depend on the likelihood that the necessary set of mutations can accumulate in the newly infected host (Table 1 ). If specific new mutations are essential for survival in a novel host, high mutation rates may be especially advantageous [41] . Accordingly, the high mutation rate of RNA viruses may explain why they host shift more frequently than other pathogens [12] . However, most mutations will be deleterious or lethal [42, 43] , so the chances of a host shift will be maximised at an intermediate mutation rate [41, 44] (although it has been shown in a plant virus that the fraction of mutations that are deleterious can be reduced in a novel host [45] ). How close the mutation rate of different pathogen groups is to this optimum for host shifting is unclear, so it is uncertain whether high mutation rates can explain why RNA viruses frequently jump between species.

The probability of a host shift will also depend on the number of mutations required to adapt to novel hosts. At one extreme, a single mutation allowed Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus to replicate efficiently in horses when it switched from rodents in the early 1990s [46] . Similarly, single mutations can underlie the expansion of the host range of RNA phages [47] . In contrast, five amino acid changes are predicted to be required for some Avian A/H5N1 influenza viruses to acquire the ability to be transmitted between ferrets [48] . If multiple mutations are required to successfully host shift, their availability can impose a constraint on host range evolution. This is illustrated by experiments on a DNA phage of Pseudomonas fluorescens [36] . The phage rapidly evolved to infect certain host genotypes but never adapted to others. The successful shifts were associated with one to three mutations in genes affecting host binding, whilst more mutations were required to infect the other hosts (these could be acquired through a process of coevolution; see below).

If multiple mutations are required, then the number of ways that the mutations might be fixed is important; are mutations adaptive in all genetic backgrounds, or does fitness epistasis require that they fix simultaneously or in a particular order? There Each column shows the presence of a different pathogen, with a coloured circle representing the presence of that pathogen. In panel A, pathogens preferentially shift between closely related hosts, while in B closely related host species have similar levels of susceptibility to infection, regardless of the source of the pathogen (with two increases in host resistance occurring at the asterisks on the host phylogeny). Both processes result in closely related host species harbouring similar pathogens, and in some host clades harbouring more pathogen species. However, in A, but not B, host species with more close relatives tend to have more pathogens. For example, the phylogenetically isolated species at the bottom of the tree is not infected by any of the three pathogens in A, but is in B. doi:10.1371/journal.ppat.1004395.g003

have been several outbreaks of Chikungunya virus linked to the virus shifting from being predominantly vectored by the mosquito Aedes aegypti to Aedes albopictus. A single amino acid change adapts the virus to the new vector [49] , but despite A. albopictus being common in Asia, this mutation did not occur for 60 years, and when it did, it was in a Chikungunya virus lineage of African origin. Here, the host shift mutation had no effect in the genetic background of the Asian strains, due to an epistatic interaction with a single amino acid difference elsewhere in the genome [49] .

The likelihood that the mutations required to adapt to a novel host occur will also depend on the size of the mutational target in the pathogen-the number of different potential changes in the pathogen genome that adapt it to the new host. In some viruses it is common to see the same parallel mutations occurring each time a virus adapts to a particular host species [50, 51] , suggesting there may be limited molecular solutions to infecting a new host species (i.e., the more parallel changes observed, the smaller the mutational target). This may act as a significant constraint on host shifts by reducing the supply of adaptive mutations.

The size of the mutational target has been most studied in phage, where host adaptation can be highly parallel, such that the same mutations become fixed in independent replicate populations [51, 52] . The importance of these mutations is illustrated by experiments that ''rewind the evolutionary tape'' by adapting hostshifted phages back onto the ancestral host and observe reversion mutations restoring the sequence back to the ancestral state [38] . When 40 host range mutants of phi6 phage were isolated, it was found that there were 17 unique mutations underlying this shift [35] . Furthermore, it was estimated that 56 different mutations in the phage genome have the potential to adapt it to the novel host [35] . Therefore, despite some parallelism, in this case the size of the mutational target is significant, but the possible number of combinations is large, so genetic constraints on this host shift are relatively weak. Parallel evolution at the molecular level is also common in experiments using viruses of eukaryotes (Figure 2A) . When vesicular stomatitis virus is evolved in human or dog cells, parallel mutations tend to occur within the same cell type [50] . Similarly in plants, experimental evolution of Tobacco etch potyvirus on four host species found that parallel mutations only occurred when viruses were passaged in the same host species [53] . A number of other studies in plants have found parallel mutations occurring, often after only a few passages on the novel host [54] [55] [56] [57] . Experimental studies finding parallel mutations often enforce transmission and so bypass the critical barrier of successful transmission in the new host. Therefore, looking at the mutations that occur in chains of natural transmission is an important future direction, as, for example, the size of the mutational target may be different for cell entry compared to transmission [58] .

Host shifts into humans have also involved parallel mutations ( Figure 2B ). In HIV-1, codon 30 of the gag gene has independently undergone the same change in all three human lineages of the virus that transferred from chimps [1] . This change increases viral replication rate in human cells [59] , and when a chimp was infected with HIV-1 it reverted to the residue seen in SIVcpz [59] . Similarly, five parallel mutations have been observed in two independent epidemics of SARs coronavirus following the shift from palm civets to humans [60] .

Parallel phenotypic changes may sometimes have different solutions at the molecular level. This has occurred in different HIV lineages that shifted into humans from other primates ( Figure 2C ). HIV-1 group M, which is responsible for the global pandemic, arose following a host shift by the chimpanzee virus SIVcpz [1] . In both human and chimp cells a restriction factor called tetherin can prevent the release of viral particles from infected cells [61] . In chimps, the SIVcpz protein Nef has anti-tetherin activity, but this is ineffective in humans due to a deletion in the cytoplasmic tail of tetherin that is targeted by Nef. Instead, in HIV-1 group M, the Vpu protein has evolved to perform the same function [61] . This was paralleled in HIV-2, which originates from sooty mangabeys ( Figure 2C ). The sooty mangabey virus also uses Nef as a tetherin antagonist and again this is ineffective in humans, but in this case the function has been acquired by the Env protein (HIV-2 lacks the Vpu protein) [61] .

In cases where mutational targets are small and multiple mutations are required, several factors may help overcome mutational constraint and allow host shifts to occur. For example, the ability of avian influenza to establish infections in the eyes and lower respiratory tract of humans [33] may give time and sufficient population size for the mutations that facilitate efficient human-tohuman transmission to arise. In laboratory studies of interactions between DNA phage and bacteria, it has been found that reciprocal coevolution allows phage to build up broad host ranges through the stepwise accumulation of multiple mutations in genes associated with host binding [36] . Additionally pathogens may circulate in host populations at low levels before becoming a detectable outbreak, and this may provide time for the pathogen to evolve adaptations to optimise its fitness in the novel host [62] .

The number and taxonomic diversity of pathogens infecting each host species is different, and the processes that shape the composition of these pathogen communities are poorly understood. The distribution of pathogens across host species is the consequence of a balance between the rate at which new host-pathogen associations are ''born'' following host shifts (or speciation) and ''die'' when the pathogen goes extinct in a host [24, 85, 86] . If host shifts occur far more frequently than host speciation, then the process is similar to the theory of island biogeography, where species richness of island communities is a balance between the rate at which new species colonise the island and existing species go extinct [88] . Therefore, this hypothesis predicts that species that have properties that increase the rate that pathogens host shift will tend to harbour more pathogens. Because host shifts tend to occur most readily between related species, on the rare occasions a host acquires a pathogen from a distant relative (Figure 1 ), that pathogen may then rapidly jump into other closely related hosts. This process can generate a clumped distribution of pathogens, where related hosts share related pathogens ( Figure 3A ) [24, 85] . Furthermore, phylogenetically isolated hosts that have few close relatives are predicted to have fewer pathogens, and their pathogen communities may be dominated by classes of pathogens such as RNA viruses that are prone to move between distantly related hosts. Alternatively, the host phylogeny may consist of clades of intrinsically resistant and susceptible species, and the resistant clades will tend to have lower pathogen diversity ( Figure 3B ). These processes have been little studied for pathogens [24] , but support comes from plant feeding insects, which have lower species richness on phylogenetically isolated hosts [89] . This conceptual framework combined with our understanding of host shifts may prove to be a powerful way to explain the community composition of pathogens.

Adapting to a new host may have deleterious effects on other pathogen traits, and such trade-offs may reduce the chances of a host shift occurring. A possible example of this is seen in the shift of HIV-1 from chimpanzees to humans. HIV-1 group M and HIV-1 group N have independently shifted from chimpanzees to humans [1] , and in both cases the Vpu protein has evolved to antagonise the restriction factor tetherin (see above). Vpu also binds and degrades CD4 receptors in SIV to aid the release of viral particles [63] , but this function has been lost in group N viruses, possibly as a pleiotropic consequence of the protein gaining anti-tetherin activity [64] . It has been speculated that this may explain why HIV group N has remained a rare pathogen in Africa, while HIV group M-where the ability to degrade CD4 was retained-has become a pandemic [64] .

A common trade-off of adapting to novel hosts is that performance on the original host is reduced. For example, host range mutations in the P3 protein of the RNA phage phi6 generally reduce growth on the ancestral host, although rare, costfree mutations do exist [35, 65] . Observations of similar effects in other phage suggest that this may be a general property of phage host range expansion [38, 66] . Similar patterns have been observed following virus adaptation to different cell culture types [67, 68] , plant species [54, 55] , and animal species [69] . For example, in a host switch of parvoviruses from cats to dogs, the virus responsible for the initial outbreak in dogs (CPV-2) lost the ability to infect cats, although this was later regained [40] .

Once a pathogen has infected a new host, the long-term success of the host shift can be independent of reduced performance in the original host if the pathogen does not require transmission to and from the original host for survival. However, trade-offs between performance in the two hosts can prevent adaptation to a new host if the pathogen is transmitted back to the original host at a high rate. For example, a vector borne pathogen may be unlikely to shift from a common mosquito species to a rare one as it will normally end up back in the original mosquito vector. In contrast, directly transmitted pathogens like influenza may be able to establish a continuous transmission chain in the new host, so reduced performance on the original host is not important.

Another important trade-off in the novel host may be between virulence (the harm a pathogen does to a host) and the transmission potential of the pathogen. A number of theoretical and empirical studies have demonstrated that an intermediate level of virulence is often optimal to maximise transmission [70] [71] [72] [73] [74] . However, following a host shift, a pathogen may produce maladaptive levels of virulence as the novel host-parasite association has not been under direct selection. For example, when the myxoma virus from South American Sylvilagus rabbits was transferred to European rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus), initial case mortality rates were as high as 99.8% in Australia. The rapid mortality is thought to have reduced the window of time that rabbits were able to transmit the virus, and as a consequence virulence rapidly dropped to case mortality rates of ,90% due to the spread of attenuated virus strains [75, 76] . There appear to be large mutational targets to evolve changes in virulence in the myxoma virus (a DNA virus with a large 162 kb genome), with no mutations common to specific virulence grades [77] . Failure to evolve lower levels of virulence may explain the stuttering chains of transmission seen in some spillover events [78, 79] ; however, it is difficult to disentangle whether the low rates of transmission are due to maladaptive levels of virulence or from human intervention.

One aim of studying host shifts is to predict future disease emergence, but it is unclear whether this will ever be possible with an accuracy that makes it practically useful [80] . While we have rules of thumb as to which groups of pathogens are most likely to host shift, and which donor species they are likely to come from [32] , there will always be exceptions. This means that predicting disease emergence by fine scale surveillance of potential donor species and the individuals they are most likely to infect is a hugely difficult task [81] . The observation that specific mutations are often required in host shifts has led to studies looking at whether these mutations can be predicted in advance. For H5N1 avian influenza viruses, mammalian transmissible forms have been evolved in laboratory settings, and identified mutations may be markers for potential epidemics [82] [83] [84] . However, even in this exceptionally well-studied case, predictive power remains low and highly system specific.

While we increasingly understand the genetic details that underlie host shifts, there are still important questions unanswered. The literature is overwhelmingly skewed towards viruses, but do bacterial and eukaryotic parasites have similar properties? Under what conditions do trade-offs between performance on the original and new host prevent host shifts from happening? Do the mutations involved in host shifts originate as de novo mutations in the new host or come from standing variation in the original host? What determines the size of the mutational target, and does this depend on what the barrier to a host shift is? For example, mutational targets seem to be small for relatively simple traits like changes in receptor use, but may be larger for complex traits like virulence and transmissibility.

One little-explored consequence of host shifts is how they affect the distribution of pathogens across host species [85] . The number and type of pathogens infecting a host is partly a result of past ''acquisitions'' following host shifts (Box 2), and new theory is showing how our understanding of host shifts can allow us to understand the composition of pathogen communities [24, 86] , but these ideas remain largely untested.

Finding tractable methods to monitor emerging diseases presents a significant challenge for the future. Studying the genetics of host shifts has the potential to uncover the evolutionary processes that pathogens undergo when they find themselves in a novel host, and may allow us to begin to address this challenge.

viruses The Broad Host Range and Genetic Diversity of Mammalian and Avian Astroviruses,"Astroviruses are a diverse family of viruses that infect a wide range of mammalian and avian hosts. Here we describe the phylogenetic diversity and current classification methodology of astroviruses based on the ORF1b and ORF2 genes, highlighting the propensity of astroviruses to undergo interspecies transmission and genetic recombination which greatly increase diversity and complicate attempts at a unified and comprehensive classification strategy.","Astroviruses (AstVs) were first described in 1975 as small viruses that are 28-30 nm in diameter with icosahedral morphology. Astroviruses are named due to the distinct five-pointed or six-pointed star-like appearance of some virions when visualized under an electron microscope (EM); astrovirus is derived from the Greek word astron meaning star [1] [2] [3] . Astroviruses were first described from human infants with diarrhea and were subsequently identified in the young of numerous mammalian and avian species [4, 5] .

Human astroviurses (HAstVs) have been recognized as one of the major causes of acute gastroenteritis in children, associated with 2-8% of infections [6] . Transmission of HAstV occurs via the fecal-oral route, person-to-person contact, or contaminated food or water. Following an incubation period of 3-4 days, symptoms including diarrhea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and fever are often reported [7, 8] . Whilst primarily associated with asymptomatic or diarrheal disease in humans, there are several reports of central nervous system (CNS) complications such as acute flaccid paralysis [9] , meningitis, and encephalitis [10, 11] . Animal astroviurses, have been isolated from numerous mammalian and avian species. In animals, astrovirus infection may be asymptomatic or associated with enteric disease and a range of other symptoms indicative of the involvement of other organ systems including hepatitis and nephritis in avian species [12, 13] , and neurological symptoms in cattle [14] [15] [16] and mink [17] .

Astroviruses are classified within the unassigned Astroviridae family and are non-enveloped viruses characterized by a positive sense, single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) genome 6.4-7.9 kb long comprised of a 5 -untranslated region (UTR), three open reading frames (ORFs)-ORF1a, ORF1b, and ORF2, a 3 -UTR, and a poly A tail [18] . The ORF1a region encodes a non-structural polyprotein (serine protease), ORF1b encodes a polyprotein including the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), and ORF2 encodes the viral capsid protein [18] . A further ORF, termed ORFX, has been observed in classic HAstVs and some mammalian astroviurses, overlapping the 5 end of ORF2 which may be translated through a leaking scanning mechanism [19] . Astroviruses exhibit several distinctive features in addition to a distinctive morphology. The viruses lack a RNA-helicase domain encoded within the genome and utilize a ribosomal frameshifting mechanism to translate the RdRp, which distinguishes the Astroviridae family from other non-enveloped ssRNA virus families such as Picornaviridae and Caliciviridae [20, 21] . The greatest diversity in the genome is within the ORF2 region, which is characterized by a highly-conserved N-terminal domain (amino acids (aa) 1-424), a hypervariable domain (aa 425-688) which is believed to form the capsid spike and contribute to receptor binding, and a highly acidic C-terminal domain [22, 23] .

The wide host range of astroviruses and the high degree of genetic diversity present within the Astroviridae family have complicated attempts at a unified classification method. Astroviruses are classified within the unassigned Astroviridae family, which was initially comprised of a single genus (Astrovirus) based on virion morphology [18] . The classification of the Astrovirus genus within the family Astroviridae was recognized by the International Committee for Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) in 1995 and the classification scheme has been modified numerous times over the intervening years [24] . In 2004, two genera were recognized; Mamastrovirus (MAstV) and Avastrovirus (AAstV), that were known to infect mammalian and avian species, respectively, and viruses were classified solely on the species of origin [24] . However, the advent of sequence based characterization rendered this approach inadequate, revealing that viruses isolated from different species can be genetically similar (reflecting prevalent interspecies transmission of viruses) and also revealing a large range of diversity of viruses within a single host species. With this in mind, the classification system proposed by the ICTV Astroviridae Study Group in 2010 recommended classification based on the amino acid sequence of the ORF2 genome region, recommending that different strains of the same astrovirus species should share >75% identity in the capsid proteins [25] . Additionally, there are proposals to define distinct variants within a recognized astrovirus species, with a variant defined as sharing <93-95% nucleotide similarity to the reference or prototype strain of each species or if phylogenetic analysis is used, a distance of >0.05 based on analysis of the capsid protein [12, 18] .

Astroviruses within the Mamastrovirus genus are derived from numerous mammalian species in addition to humans (HAstV), including farmed species such as pigs (PAstV), sheep (OAstV), cattle (BoAstV), domesticated animals including cats (FAstV), and dogs (CaAstV), rodents and small mammals including mink (MiAstV), bats (BAstV), rats (RAstV), mice, rabbit (RabAstV), fox, marmot (HHMastV), porcupine, shrew, vole, and larger species including deer (CcAstV), monkeys, water buffalo (BufAstV), yak, camel (DcAstV), and cheetah (ChAstV) (Figure 1a,b) . Viruses from the Mamastrovirus genus have also been characterized from marine mammals including stellar sea lion (SslAstV) and California sea lions (CslAstV), minke whale, orca whale, and bottlenose dolphins (BdAstV) (Figure 1a ,b) [26] . The current ICTV classification reveals 19 recognized species of Mamastrovirus (MAstV-1-19) within two genogroups GI and GII; Mamastrovirus 1 (GI.A-human); Mamastrovirus 2 (GI.B-feline); Mamastrovirus 3 (GI.C-porcine); Mamastrovirus 4 (GI.D-California sea lion); Mamastrovirus 5 (GI.E-canine); Mamastrovirus 6 (GI.F-human); Mamastrovirus 7 (GI.G-bottlenose dolphin); Mamastrovirus 8 (GII.A-human); Mamastrovirus 9 (GII.B-human); Mamastrovirus 10 (GII.C-mink); Mamastrovirus 11 (GII.D-California sea lion), Mamastrovirus 12 (GII.E-bat); Mamastrovirus 13 (GII.F-ovine); and Mamastroviruses 14-19 (GII.G to GII.L-bat species), and numerous other strains awaiting classification, some of which are considered as tentative new species (designated by a ∧ symbol in the phylogenetic trees) (Figure 1a ) [27, 28] . Viruses from the Avastrovirus genus have been characterized from numerous farmed avian species including turkeys (TAstV), ducks (DAstV), chicken (CAstV), guineafowl (GFAstV), pigeon (PiAstV), goose, as well as wild aquatic and terrestrial birds including heron, doves, penguins, and many other species (Figure 2a) . The three species originally recognized within the genus were Avastrovirus GI.A comprised of turkey astrovirus 1 (TAstV-1), Avastrovirus GI.B comprised of avian nephritis virus 1 (ANV-1), avian nephritis virus 2 (ANV-2), and Avastrovirus GII.A comprised of turkey astrovirus 2 (TAstV-2) and duck astrovirus DAstV/C-NGB [25] . Avastrovirus GI.A, Avastrovirus GI.B, and Avastrovirus GII.A were renamed Avastrovirus 1 (AAstV-1), Avastrovirus 2 (AAstV-2), and Avastrovirus 3 (AAstV-3), respectively [25] . Viruses from the Avastrovirus genus have been characterized from numerous farmed avian species including turkeys (TAstV), ducks (DAstV), chicken (CAstV), guineafowl (GFAstV), pigeon (PiAstV), goose, as well as wild aquatic and terrestrial birds including heron, doves, penguins, and many other species (Figure 2a) . The three species originally recognized within the genus were Avastrovirus GI.A comprised of turkey astrovirus 1 (TAstV-1), Avastrovirus GI.B comprised of avian nephritis virus 1 (ANV-1), avian nephritis virus 2 (ANV-2), and Avastrovirus GII.A comprised of turkey astrovirus 2 (TAstV-2) and duck astrovirus DAstV/C-NGB [25] . Avastrovirus GI.A, Avastrovirus GI.B, and Avastrovirus GII.A were renamed Avastrovirus 1 (AAstV-1), Avastrovirus 2 (AAstV-2), and Avastrovirus 3 (AAstV-3), respectively [25] . Currently, classification into species is based on the phylogenetic analysis of the amino acid sequence of the full length ORF2 region of the genome that encodes the capsid. However, the limited number of capsid sequences available compared to RdRp sequences makes consistent classification difficult, especially with some novel viruses incompletely sequenced. There are numerous unclassified astroviruses, particularly isolated from aquatic and terrestrial wild birds which, according to the ICTV, are ""related viruses which may be members of the Avastrovirus genus but have not been approved as species"" [18] .

Astrovirus infection in humans has been primarily associated with diarrhea and vomiting, accounting for up to 10% of sporadic gastroenteritis cases in some regions [29] . CNS complications associated with astrovirus infection have been reported in recent years, including acute flaccid paralysis, with some fatalities reported in children with underlying immune disorders [30, 31] .

Historically human astroviruses (HAstV) were classified into five serotypes in 1984 [32] . Subsequent molecular characterization based on viral reactivity to polyclonal antibodies and nucleotide sequence analysis led to the recognition of eight serotypes (HAstV-1-8), now termed ""classic"" HAstV [18, 33, 34] . The relatively recent advent of next generation sequencing (NGS) and metagenomic analysis has led to the identification of numerous novel strains considered ""non-classic"" HAstV [18] . Currently, HAstVs are classified within the species MAstV-1 (HAstV-1-8), MAstV-6 (MLB1-3), MAstV-8 (VA2/HMO-A, VA4, VA5, BF34), and MAstV-9 (VA1/HMO-C, VA3/HMO-B) [18] (Figure 1a ).

The MAstV-1 species is comprised of HAstV-1-8, and surveillance has revealed that HAstV-1 is the most commonly detected type in children, followed by HAstV-2-5, whereas HAstV-6-8 have been rarely detected [35] . HAstV-4 and HAstV-8 have been associated with infection of older children and longer duration of diarrhea (>7 days) [36, 37] . A HAstV-4 strain was also isolated from an infant with fatal meningoencephalitis [30] . Based upon the phylogenetic analysis of the ORF2 region, different lineages within each HAstV type have been proposed; HAstV-1 (HAstV-1a-d) and HAstV-2 (HAstV-2a-d) have been divided into four lineages, whereas HAstV-3 (HAstV-3a-b) and HAstV-4 (HAstV-4a-c) have been classified into two and three lineages, respectively [38] .

The first ""non-classic"" HAstV strain characterized was MLB1, the virus was detected in a stool sample from a 3 year old Australian child with acute diarrhea in 1999; the child had previously received a liver transplant [39] . The majority of MLB1 strains characterized to date have been detected in India, Kenya, and Japan with limited detected in the USA, China, Bhutan, Egypt, Brazil, and Italy and prevalence has been reported in the range of 0.2% to 9% [40] . However, a seroepidemiologic study in the USA revealed that primary exposure to MLB1 occurs in childhood and that seropositivity reached 100% by adulthood suggesting the widespread circulation of the virus in the human population [41] . MLB2 viruses were first identified in Vellore, India [42] with the majority of strains subsequently identified in Japan, The Gambia, and Switzerland with limited detection in Turkey, USA, Kenya, China, and Thailand and prevalence reported in the range of 0.3% to 1.5% [40] . MLB2 has been associated with meningitis and other CNS complications and has been detected in immunocompromised children [10] . MLB3 viruses were first detected in India in 2004 [43] , with subsequent detection in Kenya and The Gambia and the prevalence in stools ranges from 0.6% to 3.1% [40, 44] .

There is a dual naming system for some HAstV species due to the simultaneous characterization of these viruses by different researchers; these viruses are termed VA/HMO named for VA-Virginia and HMO-Human-Mink-Ovine-like viruses, due to their genetic relatedness to previously characterized mink and sheep viruses [9] . In 2009, VA2/HMO-A strains were detected in children with non-polio acute flaccid paralysis in Nigeria, Pakistan [9] , and India [42] . The prevalence of VA2/HMO-A viruses in stools ranges from 0.3% to 2.3%, with strains also detected in Egypt, Japan, USA, Kenya, and China [40] . VA4 has only been detected in Nepal [43] and the BF34 strain has only detected in Burkina Faso [45] .

The VA3/HMO-B viruses were first identified in Vellore, India [42] with sporadic detection in Nigeria, Pakistan, and Nepal with prevalence ranging from 0.1% to 2.3% [40] . VA1/HMO-C viruses were first detected in 2009 during an outbreak of diarrhea in children in Virginia, USA [46] . VA1/HMO-C viruses have been detected and associated with encephalitis in immunocompromized children and adults [11, 40, 47] and acute respiratory disease [48] . The prevalence of VA1/HMO-C viruses in stools ranges from 0.2% to 1.6% in diarrheic and non-diarrheic subjects worldwide, with limited detection in Nepal, Japan, Tanzania, The Gambia, France, and the U.K. [9, 44, 47] . Seroprevalence of VA1/HMO-C has been reported at 65% in adults [49] .

The divergent human astrovirus-like virus tentatively named Bastrovirus was isolated from patients in The Netherlands. The capsid region is homologous to the capsid of HAstV whilst the RdRp region is more closely related to members of the Hepeviridae family. This virus remains to be classified by the ICVT, however the capsid regions clusters closest to the MLB1-3 viruses suggesting an evolutionary relationship to these divergent human astroviruses [50] (Figure 1a ). Revealing the geographic and host diversity of this virus, divergent Bastrovirus strains have also been isolated from bat, pig, and rat species in Vietnam, forming a distinct cluster of strains that also await classification (Figure 1a ).

Mamastroviruses are capable of infecting a wide range of mammalian species including companion animals (cats and dogs), intensively farmed species (pigs and cattle), as well as terrestrial and aquatic wild mammalian species. Unexpectedly there is no clear clustering of viruses separated by hosts of terrestrial or aquatic origins (Figure 1a,b) . In addition to the classified MAstV species, there are numerous divergent viruses isolated from diverse species which likely represent new species awaiting formal classification (Figure 1a ) [51] .

Not surprisingly, domesticated animals such as cats and dogs harbor astrovirus strains more closely related to HAstV than the viruses harboured by many other animal species. Feline astrovirus was first identified in 1981, and feline strains form a small discrete cluster defined as the species MAstV-2, closely related to the human strains comprising the species MAstV-1 [52] (Figure 1a ). Based on evolutionary analysis, an interspecies transmission pathway has been hypothesised whereby porcine strains may have been transmitted to cats and subsequently to humans, possibly involving other intermediary species suggesting sustained interspecies transmission events [53] . Characterization of an outbreak of diarrhea in a group of captive cheetahs in a breeding facility identified an astrovirus strain most closely related to feline strains (Figure 1a ), however it is not clear if this is a recent transmission from domesticated cats or if the virus is circulating independently in cheetahs [54] . Despite dogs also being a companion animal, canine astrovirus, first described in the 1980s, are not as closely related to human strains as feline strains appear to be, based on phylogenetic analysis (Figure 1a,b) . Canine strains form a small, discrete cluster comprising species MAstV-5, within a lineage comprised of dolphin and sea lion clades representing species MAstV-4 and -11 [55, 56] , and feline, porcine, and human strains are more distantly related within the same lineage (Figure 1a) .

A large diverse lineage, largely comprised of unclassified viruses or tentatively classified viruses awaiting approval encompasses divergent marmot and rabbit strains (MAstV-23), small, discrete clusters of porcine/ovine/bovine strains (MAstV-24), divergent rat strains (MAstV-25), and unclassified mouse and mink strains forming a small discrete cluster (Figure 1a) . Numerous porcine strains also cluster within this lineage; PAstV comprise Mamastrovirus 3 and were first detected by EM in pigs in the U.K. and the USA [57] , and are now recognized to have worldwide distribution [12] . There is a high prevalence of astrovirus detection in pigs, up to 80% in some studies, suggesting that pigs may be persistently infected with various strains of PAstV [58] . There are five recognized lineages (PAstV1-5) reflecting the diversity of strains, suggesting swine are highly permissive to astrovirus infection often without symptoms of disease (Figure 1a,b) . This diversity likely reflects the varying origins of these viruses, in particular highlighting frequent interspecies transmission and recombination events [58] [59] [60] . A study in the USA revealed the high level of co-infections in pigs (13.9%), revealing the frequent opportunity for recombination, especially between viruses of different lineages [61] . The close clustering between some porcine and humans strains, in particular MAstV-3 and MAstV-1 viruses, reflects the close contact between these species with the close sharing of environments and co-housing documented in some countries facilitating frequent interspecies transmission [62] . Wild boars showing no symptoms of enteric disease, housed in a captive breeding park with no contact with domesticated pigs, were found to harbor astrovirus strains with a high degree of genetic similarity to porcine strains comprising MAstV-26 and suggests that the virus may be derived from commonly circulating porcine strains [63] (Figure 1a,b) . Porcupine strains isolated in China also cluster with unclassified PAstV-2 strains suggesting further interspecies transmission of these viruses (Figure 1a ) [64] .

Unexpectedly, limited astrovirus strains have been isolated from sheep. Ovine astrovirus was first identified by EM in 1977 [4] , and OAstV-1 clusters with bovine strains comprising MAstV-13 and a second strain from a healthy sheep characterized in 2009, OAstV-2, clusters with porcine and bovine strains comprising MAstV-24 [65] (Figure 1a) . Similarly, astroviruses are not associated with a significant burden of diarrheal disease in bovine species. The first bovine astrovirus was detected in England in 1978 [66] and bovine astrovirus strains have been detection in association with neurological disease, including encephalitis (BoAstV-CH13/NeuroS1) [14] [15] [16] [67] [68] [69] and diarrheal disease in calves in South Korea [70] and cattle and buffalo calves in China [71] . Two serotypes were previously recognized, BoAstV-1 and BoAstV-2 [72] , however based on phylogenetic analysis there are multiple lineages of BoAstV strains circulating in farmed bovine populations, and the close clustering of bovine, porcine, and ovine strains in multiple lineages reflects the common interspecies transmission events that occur between farmed animals (Figure 1a,b) . Phylogenetic analysis also reveals that bovine-like astrovirus strains have been isolated from numerous wild species including water buffalo, yak, and European roe deer (CcAstV-1 and CcAstV-2) suffering from gastroenteritis [73] . Unclassified astroviruses from dromedary camels (DcAstV) [27] also cluster in a lineage comprised of porcine and bovine strains, further suggesting multiple interspecies transmission events (Figure 1a) . Substantial astrovirus strain diversity has been observed in small mammals, primarily rodents and bats, forming both species-specific clusters reflecting endemic transmission and co-clustering of strains with other host species reflecting widespread interspecies transmission (Figure 1a,b) . Novel murine astrovirus strains have been isolated from laboratory mice in the USA and Japan [74, 75] . Divergent viruses have also been detected, such as those detected in rats (MAstV-25), highlighting the need for more detailed detection and characterization of these viruses to better understand the role these animals play in astrovirus transmission between varied species. One of the mammalian species with the highest burden of symptomatic astrovirus infection is mink; infection is associated with pre-weaning diarrhea syndrome and the neurological condition ""shaking mink syndrome"" [17, 76] . Mink viruses cluster within multiple lineages suggesting that the species is permissive to infection with multiple, diverse lineages of viruses (Figure 1a) . Bat astroviruses were first detected in 2008 in Hong Kong [77] and subsequently detected in bats in China [78, 79] , North America [80] , Germany [81] , Hungary [82] , and the Czech Republic [83] from numerous bat species, with detection rates ranging from 36% to 100% in Miniopterus magnater bats and from 50% to 70% of Miniopterus pusillus bats sampled in Hong Kong [77] . A diverse population of viruses appears to be highly prevalent in bats without causing disease [12] (Figures 1 and 2) . The majority of bat astroviruses are divergent from other characterized mammalian astroviruses, and display a high degree of genetic diversity forming numerous recognized and proposed species (Figure 1a) . Some bat sequences clustered with strains from other species including fox, cattle, and mice, suggesting that bats are highly permissive to infection with diverse astrovirus strains from multiple hosts and play a key role in astrovirus diversity and interspecies transmission (Figure 1a,b) .

Astroviruses have been detected in aquatic mammalian species including Californian sea lions, Steller sea lion, bottlenose dolphin, killer whale, and minke whale [26] . The strains from these aquatic species do not cluster together, instead forming multiple discrete clusters, suggesting several transmission events from terrestrial mammals to aquatic mammals (Figure 1a) . Minke whale and BdAstV-3 strains are divergent to characterized astrovirus strains, with BdAstV-1 strains comprising MAstV-7 and a diverse group of sea lion viruses comprising the MAstV-4 cluster with porcine and canine strains (Figure 1a ).

There are numerous divergent strains that are yet to be classified that may reflect interspecies transmission events. A single divergent feline strain along with a fox strain cluster within a diverse lineage comprised of human HMO strains (MAstV-8 and -9), sea lion (MAstV-11), unclassified sea lion, mink (MAstV-21), and bat (MAstV-12) strains. A Himalayan marmot strain clusters with MAstV-6 strains (Figure 1a,b ). There appears to be a large diversity of MAstV strains not captured by the currently available sequences, highlighting the need for more detailed sampling and characterization of animal strains.

The isolation of astroviruses from avian species predates their isolation in humans, with disease in ducklings described in 1965, however the virus was not formally recognized as an astrovirus until 1984 [5, 84] . Avian astroviruses have been documented to cause infection in poultry leading to economic losses in farms and affecting food production worldwide [85] . Avian astroviruses have been associated with a spectrum of disease ranging from subclinical infection in seemingly healthy adult birds to heavy flock losses. Pleomorphic symptoms include enteritis in turkeys, chickens, and guineafowl, mild growth depression and nephritis in chickens, and hepatitis in ducklings [86] . Astrovirus infection has been implicated in pre-hatching mortality in ducklings and goslings [87] .

In addition to AAstV-1 comprised of TAstV-1, AAstV-2 comprised of ANV1 and ANV2, and AAstV-3 comprised of TAstV-2 and duck astrovirus 1 (DAstV-1), there are numerous yet-to-be classified viruses, including Turkey astrovirus 3 (TAstV-3), chicken astrovirus A (CAstV-A), chicken astrovirus B (CAstV-B) [88, 89] , GFAstV, and multiple viruses isolated from ducks including duck hepatitis virus 3 (DHV-3/DAstV-2) [88] , DHV-3/DAstV-2-like viruses, DAstV-CPH (DAstV-3) [90] , DAstV-4, DAstV-YP/DAstV-4-like, and diverse viruses isolated from wild birds [86] .

Avian astrovirus have been detected in outbreaks of enteric disease in turkey poults, and avian astrovirus were first reported as an agent of gastroenteritis and mortality in young turkeys in 1980, associated with a condition known as poult enteritis mortality syndrome (PEMS) [91, 92] . Subsequently there have been sporadic reports of astrovirus outbreaks in turkeys, associated with enteritis and growth depression [93] . Based on serological and genetic analysis, two types of TAstV have been recognized (TAstV-1 and TAstV-2). TAstV-1 comprises the Avastrovirus 1 species and was first described in the U.K. [91] . TAstV-1 has limited detection in other avian species with sporadic detection in chicken and ducks and forms a discrete cluster in both the capsid and RdRp phylogenetic analysis (Figure 2a,b) . TAstV-2 was identified in 1996 [94] , and is likely to be classified within the species Avastrovirus 3 and is primarily associated with PEMS [95] . TAstV-2 is the predominant TAstV lineage, with a wider global circulation and greater genetic diversity compared to TAstV-1, reflected by the co-circulation of multiple sub-lineages (Figure 2a,b) . Based on phylogenetic analysis of the RdRp gene there appears to be limited interspecies transmission of TAstV-2-like viruses detected in chicken and duck (Figure 2b) . Astroviruses infecting guineafowl are closely related to TAstV-2 strains based on analysis of the RdRp region [96] , however the capsid region is distinct to TAstV-2 strains, forming a discrete cluster in a lineage of unassigned viruses suggesting they are closely related to CAstV-B strains (Figure 2a) . These GFAstVs were possibly derived from recombination and interspecies events followed by sustained transmission in the guineafowl population. This highlights the limitation of classifying viruses based on a single region of the genome.

Chicken astrovirus has been associated with runting-stunting syndrome (RSS) in chickens characterized by poor weight gain, lower feed conversion, and mortality resulting in economic losses [97] , and ""white chicks"" disease associated with increased mortality of embryos and chicks, weakness, and white plumage [98] . Currently two serotypes of CAstV have been described [97] , and both serotypes form discrete clusters in the phylogenetic analysis of the capsid region within a lineage of unclassified viruses (likely to be classified within AAstV-1). The CAstV-A viruses form a smaller, discrete lineage, clustering closest to DAstV-2 strains (Figure 2a) . CAstV-B strains form a large lineage clustering closest to GFAstV strains. Based on phylogenetic analysis of the small region of the RdRp gene commonly sequenced, it does not allow CAstV-A and -B strains to form discrete clusters as seen in the capsid analysis, possibly reflecting multiple recombination events in CAstV strains (Figure 2b ). CAstV strains have limited detection in other avian species with sporadic detection in pigeon and duck (Figure 2a,b) .

Avian nephritis virus was identified in association with intestinal nephritis in chickens and growth retardation. The first serotype of ANV (ANV-1) was isolated from a healthy broiler chick in 1976 [99] and was initially regarded as a picornavirus, subsequently reclassified within the Astroviridae family in 2000 [100] . Based on capsid phylogenetic analysis, ANV-1 strains cluster within the AAstV-2 lineage forming a small, discrete, relatively conserved cluster (Figure 2a) . The second serotype (ANV-2) was later described from chicks with stunted growth [101] . Based on capsid phylogenetic analysis, ANV-2 strains cluster within the AAstV-2 lineage, forming a larger, more diverse sub-lineage compared to ANV-1. ANV-1 and ANV-2 viruses have also been sporadically detected in ducks and turkeys (Figure 2a) . A third serotype (ANV-3) detected in chickens and turkeys with RSS and locomotion impairment has been proposed based on sequencing of the ORF1a region, however complete genome sequences are unavailable for adequate comparisons to the recognized serotypes [102] . The virus designated pigeon ANV (P-ANV) was detected during an outbreak of gastrointestinal illness in young pigeons in China [103] . P-ANV represents an interspecies transmission event from chickens to pigeon; based on phylogenetic analysis, P-ANV strains share a high degree of genetic similarity to ANV-2 strains and cluster closely with strains also circulating in China suggesting a localized transmission event, and these viruses should be considered as ANV-2 viruses and do not require a distinct designation (Figure 2a ) [104] . Based on phylogenetic analysis of the small region of the RdRp gene commonly sequenced, it does not allow ANV 1 and 2 strains to form discrete clusters as characterized in the capsid analysis (Figure 2b ). Whilst this may reflect common recombination events between ANV strains, the analysis of a small region does not adequately allow for distinct clustering.

Astrovirus infection in ducks has been associated with a highly contagious and fatal hepatitis, historically known as duck hepatitis virus type 2 (DHV-2), which was described in the U.K. and subsequently serotype DHV-3 was isolated in the USA [5, 84, 105, 106] . The 9th ICTV report classified DHV-2 and DHV-3 as DAstV-1 and DAstV-2, respectively [25] . DAstV-1 strains form a small, discrete cluster within the AAstV-3 lineage based on phylogenetic analysis of the capsid region, clustering closest to TAstV-2 strains (Figure 2a) . DAstV-2 viruses, currently unclassified, form a discrete, highly conserved cluster closest to CAstV-A strains (Figure 2a) . Based on phylogenetic analysis of the RdRp region, DAstV-1 is closely related to other unclassified duck strains whilst DAstV-2 strains are more closely related to TAstV-2 strains (Figure 2b ). Further unclassified serotypes have been described; DAstV-3-CPH, DAstV/C-NGB, and DAstV-4 [107] . Duck astrovirus DAstV-3/CPH has been suggested to transmit horizontally and vertically [108] and DAstV-3/CPH viruses have also been detected in goslings [107] . Phylogenetic analysis of the RdRp region highlights the diversity of AAstV strains circulating in duck species (Figure 2b) . Strains endemic to ducks have limited detection in other avian species including geese (Figure 2a,b) .

Astroviruses have been detected in numerous wild aquatic species including teals, pintails, and shovelers (belonging to the order Anseriformes), sanderlings (order Charadriiformes), and herons and spoonbills (order Pelecaniformes) [86, 109] . Fewer land dwelling wild birds have been found to harbor avian astroviruses including doves and pigeons (order Colombiformes), European roller (order Coraciiformes), and black-naped monarch (order Passeriformes) [51, 104, 110, 111] . These viruses are highly divergent and largely unclassified, suggesting these viruses are endemic to the wild bird population (Figure 2a,b) . The migratory behavior of some of these species provides ideal conditions for virus dissemination and diversification as during migration there is a high degree of co-mingling and increased density of birds of different species that may originate from varied geographic regions [112] .

Phylogenies indicate that the genetic diversity of mamastroviruses has been shaped by extensive interspecies transmission events that have occurred in the past between wild and domestic species and humans. However, the inference of astrovirus interspecies transmission events is hampered due to (a) sequencing of only a small portion of the genome; (b) inadequate sampling; or (c) that the event occurred early during the divergence of astrovirus lineages. A few exceptions where host-jumps are apparent have been in livestock where a greater level of sampling has occurred. This includes hosts with a greater level of interaction (e.g., MAstV-13 in ovine and bovine) or host genetic similarly (e.g., MAstV-26 in wild boars and domestic pigs). With the exception of HAstV-4 strains associated with fatal meningoencephalitis, it is interesting to note that viruses from multiple species, all recognized to cause neurological symptoms, are closely related including human VA1/HMO-C viruses and mink and bovine viruses also associated with neurological symptoms, suggesting that these related viruses may have a distinct phenotype compared to other MAstV strains (Figure 1a,b) . Astrovirus strains identified from fecal samples of multiple non-human primate species from wild, captive, and peri-urban environments in Bangladesh and Cambodia reveal multiple interspecies transmission events, with viruses closely related to the VA/HMO lineage of human viruses, and non-human mammalian and avian astroviruses (Figure 1a,b) [28] .

Similarly, there appears to be evidence for a high degree of cross species transmission of avian astroviruses between farmed poultry species as described in the above sections. There also appears to be transmission between avian and mammalian species. The highly divergent strains isolated from European roller (Er/SZAL6/HUN/2011 and Er/BMTK529/HUN/2011) exhibited low identity to avian and mammalian astroviruses, cluster within the MAstV lineage, and were likely derived from multiple recombination and interspecies transmission events [51] . The carnivorous diet of this avian species may have facilitated the interspecies transmission event between a rodent or small mammal species. This is the only report of a Mamastrovirus strain in an avian species; in contrast, there have been more reports of Avastrovirus strains detected in mammalian species which may reflect greater sampling density of the mammalian population. A highly divergent group of mink strains detected in China represent a novel clade of astroviruses that were distantly related to previously described mink astrovirus and were closely related to chicken and turkey astroviruses (Figure 2a,b) [113] .

These viruses are recombinant strains with the capsid region clustering with CAstV-B strains and the RdRp region clustering with human MAstV strains and CAstV strains (Figure 2a,b) . There have been two Avastrovirus strains detected in humans; a strain clustering close to ANV-1 strains detected in turkey and chicken was isolated from a child in The Gambia, and a strain clustering with ANV-2 strains detected in chicken was isolated from a child in Kenya [44] . Serological studies have been used to screen human sera from poultry workers for antibodies to TAstV-2, with up to 26% of participants positive with the highest detection in abattoir workers and turkey growers [114] , suggesting avian strains may be readily transmitted to humans under prolonged close contact.

The important role that ecotones play in astrovirus cross-species transmission has been proposed [112] . Ecotones are ecological transition areas such as small and medium sized farms which rear multiple species. The co-rearing of poultry such as domestic ducks, chickens, turkey, and guineafowl can facilitate transmission between these species but also transmission to wild birds [112] . Farms and abattoirs have also been recognized as environments facilitating transmission between livestock species and to farm and abattoir workers [114] . Many other species have contact with livestock in a farming environment; in addition to wild species, companion animals such as cats and dogs and other peri-domestic animals have contact with livestock and their biological waste providing substantial opportunities for cross-species transmission. Astroviruses also persist in bodies of water making the aquatic environment ideal for the transmission of viruses infecting avian species, aquatic mammalian species, and possible transmission between terrestrial and aquatic species. Untreated or inadequately treated sewage and waste water from domestic and farmed areas can reach fresh and marine bodies of water transmitting human and animal viruses. Astroviruses have been detected in the environment and the durability of the virus in this environment may greatly contribute to cross-species transmission within and between terrestrial and aquatic species, generating significant diversity [115] .

In addition to interspecies transmission which generates significant diversity in astrovirus species, both intra-species and inter-species recombination can rapidly generate novel, divergent viruses. Full-and partial-genome sequence analysis has identified multiple strains that have undergone recombination events, which are predominately located within the ORF1b/ORF2 junction region of the genome, which is a region with an RNA secondary structure predicted to contain a stable hairpin structure [21, 34, [116] [117] [118] [119] . A virus with a recombination event within the ORF1a region has been identified [119] . Some recombinants appear to be highly stable and show widespread detection [21] , whilst others are detected sporadically as single strains. Numerous human recombinant strains have been reported between HAstV strains, including strains with HAstV-1 (ORF1b) and HAstV-4 (ORF2) parental viruses, HAstV-1 (ORF1b) and HAstV-3 (ORF2) parental viruses, HAstV-3 (ORF1b) and HAstV-2 (ORF2), and VA2 (ORF1b) and MLB1 (ORF2) parental viruses [116, [119] [120] [121] .

Divergent species often represent recombination events between strains of different species. In 2010, the study conducted by Rivera et al. suggested the possibility of a recombination event between human and California sea lion astrovirus strains [26] . A recombinant strain derived from porcine astrovirus and human HAstV-3 strains was reported from piglets and children from various regions of Colombia [62] . ANV strains that appear to be derived from recombination events between ANV-1 (ORF1b) and ANV-2 (ORF2) have been described in the USA [85] .

The increased sampling density of numerous host species combined with the more prevalent use of NGS technologies and viral metagenomic studies will increase the detection of novel strains, further driving the need for a unified, complex, and encompassing classification system. The previously common practice of sequencing a relatively conserved RdRp amplicon of 300-400 bp renders many sequences available in GenBank of little use in detailed phylogenetic analysis, as does the frequent missing metadata regarding species of isolation, country, and date of collection. Sequencing small regions is not adequate to determine if a virus strain is a novel, divergent strain or a recombinant virus. Recommendations should be made to encourage full genome sequencing where possible and the deposition of associated host and demographic information. Although analysis of amino acid sequences of the capsid region is required for classification, it leads to confusion regarding appropriate phylogenetic analysis, with highly inconsistent publication of nucleotide and amino acid trees further complicating attempts to clarify diversity and classification. The topologies of amino acid trees differ to those of nucleotide trees, particularly for the analysis of MAstV, and whilst amino acid trees are required for classification, nucleotide trees may be more appropriate for describing within species diversity (Figures S1 and S2) . Incorporating a standardized nomenclature to aid in classification has proven invaluable in the classification of numerous viruses, including rotavirus and influenza [122] . Adopting a nomenclature that records the appropriate metadata associated with sample collection including host, location, date of collection, and determined species and serotype as proposed by Martella and colleagues would vastly improve the usability of strains for more complex analyses [38] .

Despite a substantial increase in our knowledge of the biodiversity and evolution of vertebrate RNA viruses, far less is known about the diversity, evolution and origin of RNA viruses across the diverse phylogenetic range of viruses, and particularly in healthy animals that are often only rarely utilized for virological sampling. Fortunately, recent advances in virus discovery using metagenomic approaches are beginning to reveal a multitude of RNA viruses in vertebrates other than birds and mammals. In particular, fish harbor a remarkable array of RNA viruses, including the relatives of important pathogens. In addition, despite frequent cross-species transmission, the RNA viruses in vertebrates generally follow the evolutionary history of their hosts, which began in the oceans and then moved to terrestrial habitats over timescales covering hundreds of millions of years.

RNA viruses are responsible for a wide range of human diseases, from the relatively mild respiratory infections associated with some rhinoviruses and coronaviruses, to life threatening hemorrhagic fevers. The association between viruses and disease dates to the beginning of virology at the junction of the 19th and 20th centuries, when the first viruses were identified in plants and animals suffering from overt diseases (tobacco mosaic virus and foot-and-mouth disease virus, respectively). As mammals and birds often experience relatively similar infectious disease to humans, and live in close proximity to us, they are commonly thought to be the natural reservoir hosts of the RNA viruses that subsequently emerge and cause diseases in humans through a process of cross-species transmission [1, 2] . Consequently, considerable effort has been directed towards investigating the diversity, evolution and origins of RNA viruses associated with mammalian and bird hosts. To date, a multitude of related RNA viruses have been identified from mammalian and bird hosts, including those that have emerged or reemerged in humans or domestic animals. Important examples include coronaviruses in bats [3 ] , hantaviruses in rodents and shrews [4] , and influenza A viruses in birds and a variety of mammals [5] . Although these results are of importance, mammals and birds represent only a small proportion (less than 25%) of total number of vertebrates, and little is known about the natural viromes of the vast number of vertebrate species. Indeed, recent metagenomic studies [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] suggest that our understanding of the true biodiversity and evolution of vertebrate RNA viruses is limited, fragmentary and biased.

Viruses likely infect all cellular organisms, and are ubiquitous in all natural environments, such that they can be considered the most abundant source of nucleic on earth [12] . Compared with birds and mammals, 'lower' vertebrates, which we define here as all vertebrates other than birds and mammals (i.e. amphibians, reptiles and various groups of fish, and jawless vertebrates), exhibit a far greater biological diversity with approximately 33 000 documented species. In particular, fish exhibit a remarkable diversity and abundance in both fresh water and marine environments, and account for approximately 50% of total described number of vertebrate species. It is therefore possible, if not likely, that fish also harbor an enormous diversity of as yet uncharacterized RNA viruses. Indeed, those fish viruses described to date have largely been sampled from animals experiencing overt disease and that the potential to cause huge losses in aquaculture [13] [14] [15] . In addition, despite an enormous increase in the number of invertebrate RNA viruses described in recent years [16 ,17 ] , we still know little about the evolutionary links between RNA viruses carried by invertebrates and vertebrates, again reflecting a lack of the sampling of the key taxa.

Within individual virus families or genera, those RNA viruses associated with vertebrates tend to form monophyletic groups and are often distantly related to those sampled from invertebrates [16 ,17 ] . This suggests that there are likely major evolutionary gaps between invertebrate and vertebrate RNA viruses, although whether this will withstand more intensive sampling is unknown. Additionally, the time scale of evolutionary history of RNA viruses remains unclear, with very different inferences estimated using a suite of different methods. Molecular clock-based analyses of individual viruses have often suggested very recent origins, even for wellknown etiologic agents with a documented historical record, such as rabies virus, which may be only a few thousand years old [9, 18] . By contrast, far old evolutionary histories, on the scales of millions of years, have been revealed at the level of virus families, either by using endogenous viral elements (EVEs) that are integrated into host genomes to calibrate molecular clocks [19] , or through patterns of host-virus association inferred through phylogenetic trees (see below). Although we know a great deal more about the diversity and evolution of RNA viruses than we did before the start of this millennium, it is also apparent that we are only just starting to scratch the surface of their true biodiversity and evolution of vertebrate RNA viruses.

Fortunately, a remarkable number and diversity of RNA viruses have recently been discovered in lower vertebrates through meta-transcriptomic approaches [20 ] . Indeed, all types of virus family identified in mammals have now been found in lower vertebrates ( Figure 1 ). In particular, an amazing diversity of RNA viruses (>17 families) has now been documented in fish, including viruses that are related to those that cause severe human disease today. This strongly suggests that these families of RNA viruses have an evolutionary history that may stretch back to the entire history of the vertebrates. In what follows we briefly review some of the key advances in our understanding of the diversity and evolution of vertebrate RNA viruses, and discuss some of the challenges for the future.

Due to intense interest in the ongoing occurrence of emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases (including avian influenza, SARS, and Ebola disease) in recent decades, the number of known RNA viruses from mammals and birds has increased rapidly [21,22 ,23,24,25 ] . However, the situation is very different in the case of lower vertebrates. Prior to 2000, very few of RNA viruses had been identified from amphibians, reptiles, and fish, and these are always associated with overt disease that could result in huge economic losses [15, 26, 27] . However, following the extensive use of PCR and the Sanger sequencing methods for virus identification over the past decade, the number of RNA viruses sampled from lower vertebrates has steadily increased [28] , with notable examples being arenavirus and paramyxoviruses in reptiles [29] , and novirhabdoviruses and other RNA viruses from fish [30] , although these numbers were still very limited compared to the viruses described in birds and mammals. Also of importance was that the viruses sampled from lower vertebrates are usually divergent from those in birds and mammals, such as arenavirus and coronavirus [24, 31] , in turn suggesting that there is a huge diversity of unsampled viruses that occupy the 'long branches' separating these taxa.

The most dramatic increase in the biodiversity of RNA viruses from lower vertebrates has been achieved by using a bulk RNA-sequencing approach known as meta-transcriptomics [20 ] . For example, this approach has led to the discovery of more than 200 novel viruses in 186 species of vertebrates sampled from both terrestrial and aquatic environments in China [20 ] . These vertebrates represent the phylogenetic diversity in vertebrates that had not been screened previously, including lancelets (Leptocardii), jawless fish (Agnatha), cartilaginous fish (Chondrichthyes), ray-finned fish (Actinopterygii), lobefinned fish (Sarcopterygii), amphibians (Amphibia), and reptiles (Reptilia). Of these newly discovered viruses, the majority (196 viruses) are vertebrate-specific that are thought only to infect vertebrate hosts, with the remaining 18 viruses thought to represent can be thought of as 'vector-borne' viruses that are able to infect both vertebrate and invertebrate hosts. Strikingly, these viruses cover virtually all known types of viruses previously identified in avian and mammalian hosts. Additionally, some of the newly discovered viruses (such as vertebrate associated astro-like viruses) may represent new vertebrate-associated virus families [20 ] , implying that far greater numbers and diversity of RNA viruses are present in lower vertebrates than previously realized and identified to date.

Similarly, fish also contain viruses that are relatively closely related to known human pathogens. For example, Lassa hemorrhagic fever, Ebola virus disease, and hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, are well known due to the extensive damage they cause in human patients and represent a major threat to public health. Importantly, in all these cases, those viruses identified in ray-finned fish were the most closely related to those of the Arenaviridae, Filoviridae, and Hantaviridae, showing that these previously mammal-dominated and disease-causing viruses have relatives in aquatic vertebrates [20 ] . Additionally, influenza-like viruses were also discovered from jawless fish, ray-finned fish, and amphibians, with those from ray-finned fish currently the closest known relative to human influenza B virus. Remarkably, although they were sampled in lower vertebrates, and hence likely separated from mammals hundreds of millions of years ago, these viruses exhibited similar tissue tropisms as their mammalian counterparts, again arguing for the antiquity of these vertebrate-specific viruses in nature.

In sum, all these data imply that the viruses that infect us today have once infected vertebrates that ultimately occupied aquatic environments (Figure 2) , although it is possible that some even extend back to the origin of animals that may have occupied terrestrial habitats.

Although RNA viruses have universally small genomes, recent data suggests that they experience as complex processes of genome evolution as those large DNA viruses and utilize a wide range of replication-expression strategies [32 ] . Recent meta-genomic studies reveal that invertebrates appear to be a particularly rich source of genomic diversity for RNA viruses [17 ,33 ] . Indeed, the genomes of invertebrate RNA viruses are more complex in both size and structure than those of related viruses from vertebrates [32 ] . For example, the genome of Chuviruses, which likely represent at least a new family, are more diverse and have more intricate structures -including mixtures of segmented, unsegmented, and even circular genomes -than all other virus families [16 ] . Although the newly discovered RNA viruses from lower vertebrates have relatively simple genomes in both size and structure than those sampled from invertebrates [20 ,33 ] , their genomes still show greater variation in architectures than their counterparts in mammalian and avian hosts. These include variations in genome length, organization of open reading frames, changes in the order and number of glycoproteins, and even number of segments. For example, two arenaviruses, which were discovered from marine fish, have three RNA segments instead of two seen in mammalian or reptile hosts [20 ] . Interestingly, arenaviruses with three RNA segments have also been found in arthropods [17 ] , all known arenaviruses form a monophyletic cluster within the order Bunyavirales in trees of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) [16 ] . Additional studies are needed to reveal the true history of evolutionary events: that is, whether there has been a decrease in segment number (but not gene content) from three to two in the arenaviruses, or an increase in segment numbers from two to three in the arenavirus-bunyavirus group.

Each cellular organism likely possesses multiple DNA and RNA viruses. Indeed, an increasing number of studies have shown that RNA viruses can have a broad spectrum of hosts [21,22 ,23,24,25 ] . In particular, recent metagenomic studies have shown that the host spectrum of invertebrate RNA viruses is remarkably broad, including different phyla and sometimes different kingdoms [16 ,17 ] . However, due to major sampling biases, the hosts of vertebrate RNA viruses are mainly dominated by 12 Viral evolution mammals, and to a lesser extent birds [32 ] . Therefore, our understanding of the host spectrum and virus-host association of vertebrate RNA viruses is clearly far from complete. Fortunately, the discovery of diverse viruses from a diverse range of lower vertebrates is helping to fills these gaps, revealing that the host spectrum of vertebrate RNA viruses is broad [20 ] , although still markedly narrower than that seen in invertebrates [16 ,17 ] . The difference between invertebrates and vertebrates most likely reflects differences in species numbers, population size, abundance, and the evolution of adaptive immunity in the latter.

That RNA viruses may co-diverge with their mammalian hosts has been known for several decades, and is well documented in some groups such as the hantaviruses (Figure 3 ) [34] . Even in the case of invertebrate RNA viruses, viruses tend to form separate phylogenetic groups loosely based on the evolutionary relationships of their host taxa [16 ,17 ] , reflecting the long-term co-divergence between viruses and their invertebrate hosts (although with relatively frequent host-jumping; see below). With the exception of some interesting cases such as influenza virus and rotaviruses, the same general pattern also seems to be true of those RNA viruses newly described in lower vertebrates, in which there is a general clustering of related viruses from related hosts [20 ] . In particular, it is striking that the RNA viruses sampled from fish tend to fall basal to those sampled from amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals, reflecting their divergent phylogenetic position within vertebrates (Figure 1) . Hence, at the broad-scale, the phylogeny of vertebrate RNA viruses overall mirrors that of their vertebrate hosts, with a transition from ocean to land (Figure 2 ). This overall co-phylogenetic match between RNA viruses and their vertebrate hosts strongly suggests that the viruses that still infect us today are ancient and have evolutionary histories that date back to first vertebrates, and even perhaps the first animals.

However, despite the overall co-divergence between RNA viruses and their vertebrate hosts, it is also clear that host-switching events have frequently occurred during evolutionary history. Previous studies have revealed the important role of the cross-species transmission in the evolution and the emergence of RNA viruses in humans [4, 35] . As in the case of many RNA viruses from birds and mammals (e.g. influenza virus [35] and hantavirus [36] ), host-switching events are also commonplace among lower vertebrates [20 ] . For example, that an influenza virus from a fish is the closest known relative of mammalian influenza B virus, clearly conflicts with the host phylogeny. Similar host-switching events also observed for the viruses sampled from lungfish (in the Picornaviridae, hepacivirus and aquareovirus) that exhibited a closer evolutionary relationship with those from ray-finned fish rather than those from tetrapods to which they are more closely related. In addition, as in the case of mammalian Coordination of phytovirus long-distance movement Zhang et al. 13 viruses such as Seoul (hanta) virus in rats and SARSrelated virus in bats [37, 38] , single viruses are occasionally associated with multiple host species or even multiple host orders. Indeed, across the phylogenies as a whole it is possible that host-switching has been more common during the evolutionary history of vertebrate RNA viruses than co-divergence, particularly among hosts that share similar environments [20 ,36,38] . Together, these results suggest that virus evolution is a complex interaction between virus-host co-divergence over many millions of years and frequent cross-species transmission, with the evolutionary history of many virus groups reflecting an interweaving of both processes [39 ] .

Despite an increasingly large scale of meta-transcriptomic surveys of invertebrates globally, some vertebrate RNA viruses (e.g. arenaviruses, filoviruses, hantaviruses, and paramyxoviruses) have not yet been identified in invertebrates, implying that they only originated in the latter (or that the wrong invertebrates have thus far been sampled). Similarly, although the phylum Echinodermata and the subphylum Tunicata of Chordata are more closely related to vertebrates than invertebrates, it is notable that the viruses identified in these animals were closely related to those associated with invertebrates, suggesting that there is a major phylogenetic 'break' in virus biodiversity following their divergence from the vertebrate lineage [16 ] . The reasons for these disjunct patterns of virus distributions across phylogenies are currently unclear.

The antiquity of vertebrate RNA viruses is also apparent from some molecular clock based dating schemes, particularly using endogenous virus elements (EVEs). Comparisons of exogenous viruses and their endogenous relatives have shown that the Filoviridae and Bornaviridae emerged at least 30 million years (Myr) ago and 50 Myr ago, respectively, again indicative of an ancient evolutionary history [40, 41] . Remarkably, however, the discovery of the divergent filoviruses and bornavivirus from rayfinned fish indicates that both viruses have great ancient evolutionary histories that greatly extend beyond the calibration dates achieved with endogenous viruses.

Our knowledge of the biodiversity and evolution of vertebrate RNA viruses has expanded dramatically since the millennium, and especially so following the metagenomic evolution of recent years. It is now clear that the virosphere is far larger and complex than previously envisioned, and that we have only sampled a tiny fraction of this remarkable biodiversity [32 ] . Although the most studied group, it is also the case that we have only sampled a small subset of total described vertebrate species, particularly for screening viruses using unbiased meta-transcriptomic approaches. It is also likely that lower vertebrates, and other animals, harbor RNA viruses are so divergent from known viruses that they cannot be detected using available Blast-based approaches [32 ] , so that our sampling is necessarily biased toward 'detectable' viruses. It is therefore clear that more expensive and better sampling worldwide, especially in uncommon vertebrate species, and more powerful approaches for virus characterization are needed to help us to find these divergent viruses, such as led to the discovery of the chuviruses and the jingmenviruses [16 ,42] , which will in turn help fill the evolutionary gaps of RNA viruses.

Although we know that vertebrate RNA viruses have an ancient evolutionary history, it is difficult at present to paint a clear picture about their origin and evolution, including their evolutionary relationship with invertebrate viruses which is likely to be complex, particularly as our sampling of basal vertebrates remains poor. That some RNA viruses seemingly only infect vertebrates suggest that they are 'vertebrate-specific' viruses, while another 'vector-borne' class are able to simultaneously infect both vertebrate and invertebrate hosts. However, it is important to note that for well known vector-borne viruses (such as dengue and Zika viruses), their true natural hosts are likely to be arthropods, and that they secondarily evolved to infect vertebrates. Indeed, it is striking that some of vertebrate viruses, including recently discovered viruses from lower vertebrates, fall to the basal of the classic vector-borne viruses [20 ] . Overall, the evolutionary history of vertebrate RNA viruses seems to reflect a complex interplay between long-term virus-host co-divergence and frequent hostswitching. Greater taxonomic sampling is clearly the goal for the future, and the discovery of viruses that fill the gaps between vertebrate and invertebrate viruses will clearly be important in helping to resolve virus origins.

Although only a miniscule proportion of RNA viruses have been known to cause diseases in humans, some of uncharacterized viruses will surely be able to cross interspecies genetic barrier and emerge in humans. Identifying this subset will be difficult, particularly as the mechanisms that enhance or prevent the successful crossspecies transmission of viruses remain unclear. Although we now know that the evolutionary history of vertebrate RNA viruses is characterized by frequent cross-species transmission on the background of co-divergence, it is not clear whether RNA viruses with a history of cross-species transmission and multiple hosts emerge more frequently in humans compared to those with specific virus-host association [32 ,36] , or whether emergence is strongly dependent on local epidemiological and ecological features with less impact of virus phylogenetic history. In addition, far less is known about the interaction between viruses each other, viruses and other micro-organisms, and their hosts, especially how these interactions act to prevent or enhance diseases in humans even though this is likely to be central to understanding disease emergence [43] . Finally, although of fundamental scientific importance, we contend that rather than simply surveying biodiversity and classifying new viruses, the goal for the future of metagenomic studies should be to perform research focused on reveal the fundamental patterns and processes of virus evolution [20 ] , which will be greatly enhanced by a better understanding of the virus.

Evolution and Genetic Diversity of Porcine Circovirus 3 in China,"The identification of a new circovirus (Porcine Circovirus 3, PCV3) has raised concern because its impact on swine health is not fully known. In Fujian Province in eastern China, even its circulating status and genetic characteristics are unclear. Here, we tested 127 tissue samples from swine from Fujian Province that presented respiratory symptoms. All of the PCV3 positive samples were negative for many other pathogens involved in respiratory diseases like PCV2, PRRSV, and CSFV, suggesting that PCV3 is potentially pathogenic. From phylogenetic analysis, PCV3 strains are divided into two main clades and five sub-clades; PCV3a-1, PCV3a-2, PCV3a-3, PCV3b-1, and PCV3b-2. Our identified strains belong to genotypes PCV3a-1, PCV3a-2, PCV3a-3, and PCV3b-2, indicating a high degree of genetic diversity of PCV3 in Fujian province until 2019. Interestingly, we found the time of the most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) of PCV3 was dated to the 1950s, and PCV3 has a similar evolutionary rate as PCV2 (the main epidemic genotypes PCV2b and PCV2d). In addition, positive selection sites N56D/S and S77T/N on the capsid gene are located on the PCV3 antigen epitope, indicating that PCV3 is gradually adaptive in swine. In summary, our results provide important insights into the epidemiology of PCV3.","The Circovirus genus claimed veterinarians' attention shortly after its discovery, most members infect avian species but swine also serve as natural hosts [1, 2] . PCV1 and PCV2 are infectious agents in swine [3] ; PCV1 was first detected as a contaminant of PK-15 cell cultures and has not been associated with clinical disease, PCV2 is a ubiquitous, economically important pathogen to the swine industry [4] . PCV2 infection leads to a diverse range of clinical diseases collectively termed PCV2-associated disease (PCVAD), which includes post-weaning multi-systemic wasting syndrome (PMWS), porcine dermatitis and nephropathy syndrome (PDNS), interstitial pneumonia, enteric disease, and reproductive failure [5] . Porcine Circovirus 3 (PCV3) is the third member of the Circovirus genus to infect swine [6] , it has a circular ssDNA genome of approximatively 2000 bases containing three identified ORFs [6] , although only ORF1 and ORF2 have been characterized. ORF1, located on the positive strand, apparently codes for a single replication-associated protein (Rep) of 296-297 aa [6] . ORF2 is on the negative strand and encodes the capsid protein (Cap). Despite the common genomic organization, PCV3 is distantly related to other known circoviruses, although a relatively close relationship with bat circoviruses has been suggested based on phylogenetic analysis [7] . There is also some unresolved opinion on the genotyping of PCV3. For example, Li et al. divide PCV3 into 3a and 3b, while Ouyang et al. suggest that PCV3 can be divided into PCV3a, 3b and 3c [7, 8] .

PCV3 was first identified in the USA in 2015; from tissues of animals presenting porcine dermatitis and nephropathy syndrome (PNDS) and reproductive disorders, but that had tested negative for PCV2; a metagenomics approach revealed an uncharacterized virus [6] . PCV3 has since been identified in Asia [9] [10] [11] , South America, and Europe [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] in swine with various clinical syndromes [6] . Its comparable prevalence in healthy swine [17] and wild boar [18, 19] however, raises questions about its role in swine pathogenesis.

In China, the presence of PCV3 has been confirmed in more than 24 provinces and regions, but its prevalence on swine farms (especially in asymptomatic herds) is not well established and specific genetic information is lacking, particularly in eastern China. The aim of this study was to determine the infection status and genetic characteristics of PCV3 in swine presenting respiratory symptoms on farms in Fujian province, eastern China. In addition, we aimed to elucidate the evolution and genetic diversity of PCV3 at the national scale.

One hundred and twenty-seven lung samples were collected from one hundred and twenty-seven swine on fifty-five farms in Fujian province, China. Samples were homogenated then subjected to three cycles of freeze-thaw followed by centrifugation at 5000 rpm for 10 min at 4 • C, after which supernatants were collected for DNA extraction. Viral DNA was extracted using the Virus Genomics DNA Isolation Kit (Tianlong Biotech, Suzhou, China) following the manufacturer's instructions. PCR with pair specific primers (Table 1) was used for detecting PCV3, PCV2, CSFV, and PRRSV [20, 21] . PCR conditions were as follows: for each sample 12.5 µL of 2× Taq Master mix (Vazyme Biotech, Shanghai, China), 9.5 µL of double distilled water (ddH2O), 1 µL of template DNA, 0.4 nmol/L forward and 0.4 nmol/L reverse primer were combined. Thermocycler conditions were 95 • C for 5 min, followed by 35 cycles of denaturation at 95 • C for 30 s, annealing at 59 • C for 30 s, and extension at 72 • C for 30 s, with a final extension at 72 • C for 10 min. Samples were held at 4 • C until further use. Complete genomes were amplified using the Phanta Max Super-Fidelity DNA polymerase (Vazyme Biotech, Shanghai, China) with the same amplification conditions, subjected to 1% agarose gel electrophoresis, then sent to Tsingke (Nanjing, China) for sequencing. Sequences were assembled using the BioEdit software [22] . Table 1 . Primers used in this study.

Amplicon Length (bp) 

Three hundred and six complete PCV3 genomes, collected between 1996 and 2019 from different countries, were downloaded from GenBank at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/). All sequences were separated by Rep and Cap according coding region, then the coding area was spliced together (Supplementary Table S1 ). MUSCLE [23] was used to align sequences, and manual adjustments were made to the alignment using MEGA7.0 [24] . After poor quality sequences were removed, 272 reference sequences remained. The best fit nucleotide substitution model was selected using ModelFind in IQ-tree [25] . The maximum likelihood (ML) tree was reconstructed using RAxML (version 2.8.10) [26] . For nucleotide substitution, we used the General Time Reversible parameter plus the GAMMA distribution model (GTR + G) pre-estimated, with 1000 bootstrap replicates. To estimate the time elapsed since the most recent common ancestor and the rate of PCV3 evolution, we constructed a maximum clade credibility (MCC) tree using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, using BEAST (v1.8.4) [27] and the Cap protein sequences. The substitution model was set to GTR + G with a relaxed molecular clock (lognormal), and the tree prior was coalescent (Bayesian skyline) according to model comparison built in Tracer (http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/tracer/). The total chain length was 1 × 10 8 , with sampling every 10,000 steps. Two independent runs were performed and then combined using LogCombiner. The final MCC tree was annotated using TreeAnnotator and visualized using Figtree.

The ML tree based on full-length sequences (spliced ORF1 and ORF2 coding region) was uploaded to DataMonkey (www.datamonkey.org) to estimate branching and sites under selection. Selected sites were identified using four algorithms: single-likelihood ancestor counting (SLAC), mixed effects model of evolution (MEME), fixed effects likelihood (FEL), and fast unconstrained Bayesian approximation (FUBAR). Positively selected branches were identified using the adaptive branch-site REL test for episodic diversification (aBSREL) [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] . A site was considered to be under positive selection only if it satisfied at least two algorithms (p < 0.1 in SLAC, p < 0.05 in FEL and MEME, p > 0.9 in FUBAR). Cap sequences from strains PCV3a and PCV3b were used to predict protein structures in I-TASSER (https://zhanglab.ccmb.med.umich.edu/I-TASSER/) [33] . Structures were visualized using PyMoL. Table S2 ). It should be noted that these seven samples were negative for PCV2, CSFV and PRRSV. All the PCV3 genomes we sequenced here were 2000 bp. Sequencing analysis of the full-length genomes, and Rep and Cap genes revealed maximum nucleotide sequence similarities amongst each other of 98.85-99.80%, 99.00-100% and 98.60-99.80% respectively, and to reference strains from GenBank of 91.24-99.90%, 98.2-100% and 96.7-100% respectively. Maximum amino acid sequence similarities for Rep and Cap were 99.3-100% and 98.1-100% within the strains, and compared to reference strains were 97.2-100% and 96.7-100% (Table 2) 

After removal of poor-quality data from an initial set of 306 PCV3 sequences obtained from GenBank, 272 reference sequences from the 14 countries remained (Figure 1 ). We used these, along with PCV3 sequences generated in our study, to reconstruct phylogenetic trees. Based on the ML tree ( Figure 2 ), PCV3 can be classified into two main clades, PCV3a and PCV3b. At a higher level of resolution, PCV3a can be divided into PCV3a-1, PCV3a-2, and PCV3a-3, while PCV3b is comprised of PCV3b-1 and PCV3b-2. Globally, PCV3a strains outnumber PCV3b strains. Similarly, of the sequences from the PCV3 strains we isolated, five of seven were classified as PCV3a and two as PCV3b. From the tree, we found that the strains we isolated in Fujian were PCV3a-1, PCV3a-2, PCV3a-3 and PCV3b-2. In addition, these strains were close to the strains found in Jilin, Guangxi, Jiangxi, and Jiangsu provinces. The tMRCA was estimated to be 1954.25 with 95% highest probability density (HPD) between 1940.70 and 1984.90, while the evolutionary rate was estimated to be 2.41 × 10 −4 with 95% HPD between 1.53 × 10 −4 and 3.40 × 10 −4 ( Figure 3A ). 

After removal of poor-quality data from an initial set of 306 PCV3 sequences obtained from GenBank, 272 reference sequences from the 14 countries remained (Figure 1 ). We used these, along with PCV3 sequences generated in our study, to reconstruct phylogenetic trees. Based on the ML tree (Figure 2 ), PCV3 can be classified into two main clades, PCV3a and PCV3b. At a higher level of resolution, PCV3a can be divided into PCV3a-1, PCV3a-2, and PCV3a-3, while PCV3b is comprised of PCV3b-1 and PCV3b-2. Globally, PCV3a strains outnumber PCV3b strains. Similarly, of the sequences from the PCV3 strains we isolated, five of seven were classified as PCV3a and two as PCV3b. From the tree, we found that the strains we isolated in Fujian were PCV3a-1, PCV3a-2, PCV3a-3 and PCV3b-2. In addition, these strains were close to the strains found in Jilin, Guangxi, Jiangxi, and Jiangsu provinces. The tMRCA was estimated to be 1954.25 with 95% highest probability density (HPD) between 1940.70 and 1984.90, while the evolutionary rate was estimated to be 2.41 × 10 −4 with 95% HPD between 1.53 × 10 −4 and 3.40 × 10 −4 ( Figure 3A ).

The scaled effective population size (Neτ) for PCV3 was also estimated. Figure 3B shows that the population size increased from 1985 to 2012, then stabilized until 2016. From 2016 to 2019, the population size declined slightly but was still at a high level (about 5 × 10 2 ). 

Selective pressure analysis demonstrated a clear dominance of sites under negative pressure both in the Rep and Cap proteins [34] . We detected four positively selected amino acid sites, one at residue 122 in the Rep protein, and three at residues 24, 56, and 77 in Cap (Table 3) . Residues 122 in Rep and 24 in Cap were detected by all methods (SLAC, FEL, FUBAR and MEME). In contrast, residues 56 and 77 were detected only by FEL and FUBAR. However, there was no positively selected branch in the PCV3 ML tree. Interestingly, several positively selected sites were associated with functional activities. Cap residues 24, 56, and 77 were in the epitope region and were classified as positively selected sites by Li et al. and Sun et al. [7, 9] (Figure 4 ). Residue 122 in Rep was also described as positively selected by Li et al. The scaled effective population size (Neτ) for PCV3 was also estimated. Figure 3B shows that the population size increased from 1985 to 2012, then stabilized until 2016. From 2016 to 2019, the population size declined slightly but was still at a high level (about 5 × 10 2 ).

The identification of PCV3, a new porcine circovirus resembling the significantly pathogenic PCV2, has raised a great interest in its evolution and epidemiology. In China, the number of emerging swine viruses has increased in the last years [7, 35] raising two pressing questions. i) Are swine novel hosts to these viruses? ii) What is the epidemic character of PCV3 in China? Although PCV3 strains from most parts of China have been well studied, there is no systematic analysis of the prevalence and evolutionary characteristics of strains in eastern China, especially in Fujian Province. Fujian is a large aquaculture province with a subtropical monsoon climate that provides favorable conditions for the prevalence and evolution of disease.

Although some evidence supports an association between PCV3 infection and clinical disease [6] , contradictory reports have been published [36] , and more extensive studies are needed. Fu et al., 2018 found that in southern China 22.3% of samples were co-infected with PCV2. Ku et al., 2017 found that 45.4% of PCV3 positive samples were also positive for PCV2, while Zhang et al., 2018 found coinfection of PCV2 and PCV3 in 6.8% of the 265 clinical samples screened in that study. In a survey of samples from Shandong province we found 59.4% were infected with PCV3 alone and 39.3% were co-infected with PCV2 [37] . In this study, we found that all the samples from swine with respiratory symptoms were positive for PCV3 only. Although there are some people think PCV3 is suspicious of the pathogenicity of the herd [38] , research on PCV3 pathogenicity should be further studied. Additionally, there are differing views of the phylogenetic analysis of PCV3; we found that PCV3 can be divided into two clades: PCV3a, PCV3b, and five sub-clades PCV3a-1, PCV3a-2, PCV3a-3, PCV3b-1, and PCV3b-2. This agrees with the report by Li et al. [7] , but not fully with Ouyang et al., who are using ORF2 gene for analysis [8] . PCV3a is the most wide spread genotype in Fujian province 

The identification of PCV3, a new porcine circovirus resembling the significantly pathogenic PCV2, has raised a great interest in its evolution and epidemiology.

This agrees with the report by Li et al. [7] , but not fully with Ouyang et al., who are using ORF2 gene for analysis [8] . PCV3a is the most wide spread genotype in Fujian province consisting of PCV3a-1, PC3a-2 and PCV3a-3. Meanwhile, PCV3b-2but not PCV3b-1 was also found in Fujian province. Thus, in Fujian province, PCV3 has a high genetic diversity, in addition, the tMRCA of PCV3 is estimated later than in Saraiva et al. [39] . From previous important studies [7] , it is known that an alanine at amino acid number 24 distinguishes PCV3a from PCV3b, which has a valine at that site. In our study the strain PCV3-CN-FJ27-2018 had a valine at position 24 but it belongs to the PCV3a group. This prompts us to propose that PCV3 subtypes might recombine with each other during infections, similar to PCV2. After MCMC analysis we found that the evolutionary rate of PCV3 exceeds that of canine parvovirus or porcine pseudorabies virus but is similar to PCV2b and PCV2d [40, 41] , this result is similar to that reported by Li et al. [7] . However, based on more reference sequences than used in the studies of Li et al., the tMRCA of PCV3 is earlier than reported in those studies. The estimated Neτ value of PCV3 is greater than that of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus. We expect scaled effective population size Neτ to follow I/2β, where β is the equilibrium rate of transmission and I is the equilibrium number of infections. Although the duration of infection time of PCV3 in swine is unknown, given the large population size, its true value should also be similar to or greater than the estimated value.

Additionally, we found some amino acids on the antigen epitope that have been subject to positive selection during evolution. Similar to previous reports, amino acid 24 and 77 were found to be subjected to positive selection [7, 8] , however, amino acid 56 was first found in the Cap protein. Our results indicate the action of the host immune response in shaping PCV3 evolution. Swine with respiratory symptoms were positive only for PCV3, which may indicate that PCV3 has gradually adapted to swine and even become pathogenic to swine.

Although the number of sequences in PCV3 is increasing, we found that the analysis results are very similar to those reported previously after removal of poor quality sequences [7] . Pcv3 is still one of the DNA viruses with the highest evolutionary rate. In addition, it is of great concern that the inaccuracy of early samples' epidemiological results may be caused by many laboratory pollutions. This situation will greatly misleading the evolution rate analysis of certain viruses, especially for new emerging viruses, so the evolutionary dynamics of PCV3 deserve further study. Our study has increased the information on the genetics and molecular characteristics of PCV3. These results will contribute to the evaluation of the relevance of PCV3 to the swine industry, and to the planning of effective control strategies in China.

Does genetic diversity limit disease spread in natural host populations?,"It is a commonly held view that genetically homogenous host populations are more vulnerable to infection than genetically diverse populations. The underlying idea, known as the 'monoculture effect,' is well documented in agricultural studies. Low genetic diversity in the wild can result from bottlenecks (that is, founder effects), biparental inbreeding or self-fertilization, any of which might increase the risk of epidemics. Host genetic diversity could buffer populations against epidemics in nature, but it is not clear how much diversity is required to prevent disease spread. Recent theoretical and empirical studies, particularly in Daphnia populations, have helped to establish that genetic diversity can reduce parasite transmission. Here, we review the present theoretical work and empirical evidence, and we suggest a new focus on finding 'diversity thresholds.'","It seems to be conventional wisdom that genetically homogeneous populations suffer from more severe pathogen outbreaks than diverse populations (Elton, 1958; Sherman et al., 1988; Schmid-Hempel, 1998; Altizer et al., 2003) . Infection is more likely to be transmitted between genetically similar hosts (Anderson and May, 1986) , and upon encountering resistant hosts, parasites would likely die, fail to successfully reproduce (Anderson and May, 1986) , or otherwise be removed from the population (Keesing et al., 2006) . As such, the risk of infection, especially by virulent pathogens, may select for outcrossing over uniparental forms reproduction, such as self-fertilization or parthenogenesis King et al., 2009; Morran et al., 2011) , resulting in an overall increase in genetic diversity (King et al., 2011) . There may not seem to be an escape from disease, but genetic diversity in host populations may reduce the risk of infection.

The empirical link between disease spread and genetic diversity has its origin in agricultural research. Agricultural fields represent environments in which plants are selected for high yield, and may therefore exhibit less genetic polymorphism than those in the wild. It is well known that disease epidemics have devastated agricultural monocultures (for example, rice blast, Zhu et al., 2000) , and that monocultures are typically more susceptible to outbreaks than diverse mixtures of crops (Mundt, 2002) . This association between low diversity and high disease incidence is called the 'monoculture effect' (for example, Elton, 1958; Leonard, 1969; Garrett and Mundt, 1999; Zhu et al., 2000; Pilet et al., 2006) . Here, we examine how genetic diversity affects the spread of disease in natural populations. We also consider the theoretical basis for the monoculture effect in host populations, and suggest that there may be a 'diversity threshold' for disease spread.

The most notable examples of the monoculture effect in natural populations come from the dramatic epidemics in small populations of endangered species, particularly mammals (for example, O'Brien et al., 1985; Thorne and Williams, 1988) . Genetic bottlenecks have reduced the genetic variability in cheetahs, particularly at the major histocompatibility complex, and endangered populations of these animals have been decimated by coronavirus epizootics (O'Brien et al., 1985) . Similarly, the endangered black-footed ferret may have been extirpated from its natural habitat, because low genetic diversity aided the spread of a virulent canine distemper epizootic (Thorne and Williams, 1988) .

Range expansion and habitat isolation caused by human activities can also generate small, founder populations with low genetic diversity. Newly-colonised, western populations of Italian agile frogs (Rana latastei) are genetically depauperate, and they have an increased susceptibility to a novel, emerging Ranavirus (Pearman and Garner, 2005) . Similarly, dam construction in the Senegal river basin likely permitted the rapid expansion of snails (Biomphalaria pfeifferi ), which serve as the first-intermediate host for the human disease schistosomiasis (Campbell et al., 2010) . Recently established Biomphalaria snail populations are genetically homogenous compared with those in natural habitats in Zimbabwe; they are also more susceptible to infection and this increases the opportunity for parasite transmission to humans (Campbell et al., 2010) .

By reducing individual-level and population-level genetic heterozygosity, inbreeding can increase host susceptibility to infectious parasites (Dwyer et al., 1997; Acevedo-Whitehouse et al., 2003; Spielman et al., 2004; Ellison et al., 2011) . In wild populations, Acevedo-Whitehouse et al. (2003) found that heavily inbred California sea lions were more infected, and consequently, may act as pathogen reservoirs, spreading parasites in sea lion populations. But, is increased susceptibility directly due to reduced diversity, or does inbreeding depression have an effect by compromising host condition? By manipulating the levels of inbreeding in Drosophila melanogaster, in laboratory experiments Spielman et al. (2004) confirmed that the increase in disease susceptibility resulted from a lower frequency of resistance alleles in the population, and not by generalized inbreeding effects. Inbreeding effects were similarly excluded as a reason for why offspring from inbred populations of Daphnia, a freshwater crustacean, were more susceptible to a vertically-transmitted parasite than those from outbred populations (Ebert et al., 2007) . Finally, Kerstes and Wagner (2012) found that inbreeding increased parasite-induced mortality in the red flour beetle (Tribolium castaneum) by prolonging development time, but it did not increase susceptibility to infection.

Founder populations provide the opportunity to examine the effects of inbreeding and small population size on the link between genetic diversity and parasite resistance. For example, in a comparison of founder versus ancestral mainland populations of deer mice, Meagher (1999) found that inbred, island populations in Lake Michigan had higher infection levels and lower genetic diversity. The link between diversity and parasite spread has even been revealed when comparing large and small founder populations. Hawks colonizing smaller Galápagos Islands possessed lower genetic diversity, produced low antibody titer, and had a higher abundance of parasites than more outbred populations on larger islands (Whiteman et al., 2006) .

Uniparental forms of reproduction, such as self-fertilization or parthenogenesis, should have similar consequences for parasite resistance as biparental inbreeding. Along these lines, self-fertilizing populations and inbred sexual populations were both found to have higher infection rates by a trematode parasite compared with outbred sexual populations of topminnows (Poeciliopsis monacha) (Lively et al., 1990) . In another species of partially-selfing fish (Kryptolebias marmoratus), Ellison et al. (2011) found that outcrossing increased the genetic diversity of wild populations and decreased their susceptibility to multiple parasites.

Mating systems can also directly affect genetic diversity and parasite resistance (Busch et al., 2004; Williams et al., 2011) . For example, in eusocial insect colonies, queens can mate with a single male or with multiple males (polyandry), which determines the level of relatedness among individuals within a colony. High relatedness among individuals in a population can enhance the evolution of cooperation (Hamilton, 1964a (Hamilton, , b, 1987 , but the genetic similarity between individuals may also facilitate the spread of parasites (Shykoff and Schmid-Hempel, 1991; Schmid-Hempel, 1998) . As such, multiple mating has been suggested as an evolutionary response to parasite pressure (Hamilton, 1987; Sherman et al., 1988) , which may counteract the high risk of parasite transmission and increase the overall productivity of the colony (Schmid-Hempel, 1994; Schmid-Hempel and Crozier, 1999; Brown and Schmid-Hempel, 2003) .

Numerous studies on ants and bees have indeed found that multiply mated queens form more resistant colonies Schmid-Hempel, 1999, 2001; Tarpy, 2003; Hughes and Boomsma, 2004; Tarpy and Seeley, 2006; Seeley and Tarpy, 2007) , and that offspring fathered by different males do vary in susceptibility to infection (Baer and Schmid-Hempel, 2003) . Ultimately, the balance between the costs (for example, within-colony conflict, reduced offspring output) and benefits (for example, resistance to a range of parasites) associated with heterogeneity in colonies may determine the optimal level of polyandry (Baer and Schmid-Hempel, 2001; Van Baalen and Beekman, 2006) . Polygyny (the presence of multiple queens within a single colony) can also decrease the relatedness among individuals and increase the variety of resistance alleles in the colony. Studies in which the number of founding queens was experimentally manipulated have confirmed that colonies founded by multiple queens have lower parasite loads (Liersch and Schmid-Hempel, 1998; Reber et al., 2008) . In addition, workers from polygynous colonies of an ant (Cardiocondyla obscurior) were better at detecting disease and removing infected individuals from the nest than workers from nests having a single queen (Ugelvig et al., 2010) .

Increases in infection prevalence in the wild is associated with genetic bottlenecking and inbreeding, induced by founder effects or mating systems. Thus, host population genetic diversity seems to have an important role in buffering populations against epidemics. But, how exactly does genetic diversity reduce disease spread?

HOW MUCH DIVERSITY IS NECESSARY? An association between genetic diversity and disease spread might be detected by categorizing populations as being either genetically homogenous or diverse. This comparative method can tell us that diversity matters, but does not indicate the amount of genetic diversity required for a population to be resistant, or the 'diversity threshold' . Recently, two insightful empirical studies have quantified the effect of genetic diversity on resistance in host populations. Altermatt and Ebert (2008) and Ganz and Ebert (2010) conducted semi-natural mesocosm and lab experiments, respectively, whereby monoclonal and polyclonal Daphnia populations were exposed to microparasites. Parasites spread significantly faster (Altermatt and Ebert, 2008) and infection rates are higher (Ganz and Ebert, 2010) in host monocultures compared with 'polycultures' of several genotypes with higher allelic diversity. These studies suggest that the relationship between host diversity and infection may not be complex, and that a 'handful' of host genotypes in the population can be enough to hamper parasite transmission.

The benefits of host genetic diversity, however, may also depend on the genetic diversity of the parasite population (Boomsma and Ratnieks, 1996; Van Baalen and Beekman, 2006; Ganz and Ebert, 2010) . If the parasite population is genetically homogenous, increases in host population genetic diversity might boost the opportunity for parasites to encounter a susceptible host (Boomsma and Ratnieks, 1996; Van Baalen and Beekman, 2006) . Alternatively, in a diverse parasite population, there is a high probability that one of a diverse set of parasite genotypes can infect a homogeneous host population (Van Baalen and Beekman, 2006) and genetically diverse host populations are at an advantage. Consistent with these ideas, Ganz and Ebert (2010) found no difference in infection levels among experimental Daphnia monocultures and polycultures when populations were exposed to a single-parasite genotype; however, polycultures were more resistant when populations were exposed to multiple parasite genotypes.

There has been surprisingly little theoretical work on the effect of genetic diversity on disease spread. Two models suggest that genetic variation in host susceptibility would not affect infectious disease spread (Springbett et al., 2003; Yates et al., 2006) , but it might reduce the severity of infection (Springbett et al., 2003) . In these models, hosts varied in susceptibility to a single pathogen strain, but no host genotype was completely resistant to infection. In contrast, Lively (2010a) found that host genetic diversity could reduce the risk of disease spread, assuming that each host genotype was susceptible to a different parasite genotype. This assumption is consistent with the 'matching-alleles' model for infection (Frank, 1993; Otto and Michalakis, 1998) . The matching-alleles model is a useful framework for studying self/non-selfrecognition systems in animals, and it is supported by studies on invertebrate immunity (Grosberg and Hart, 2000; Carius et al., 2001; Dybdahl et al., 2008; Duneau et al., 2011; Luijckx et al., 2011) . In addition, the framework seems robust to the assumption of singlegenotype specificity (Agrawal and Lively, 2002; Engelstaedter and Bonhoeffer, 2009) . The more recent model suggests that increases in the genetic diversity of host populations could have a large effect on disease spread and prevalence at equilibrium (Lively, 2010a) . The model assumes that there are no co-infections, and that each parasite genotype can only infect one genetically determined resistance phenotype in the host population, which is the standard assumption of the matching-alleles model for infection. The results suggest that R 0 for each parasite genotype i depends on total host density, as well as the frequency of the matching host genotype, where matches between host and parasite genotypes yield an infection. Thus, disease transmission is both density and frequency dependent. The effect of host density on R 0 is asymptotic on Bg i , where g i is the frequency of the matching host genotype, and B is the number of parasite propagules produced by each infection that make contact with a host (Lively, 2010a) . Thus, B is equal to the total number of propagules produced by an infection multiplied by the frequency of propagules that contact a host. For large host populations (N4200) the effect of further increasing the host population size has little effect; but, increasing the number of host genotypes has a large effect, because increasing the number of host genotypes decreases the frequency (g i ) of each genotype. Under parasite-mediated, frequency-dependent selection, the frequency of each host genotype would be expected on average to be approximately 1/G, where G is the total number of host genotypes in the population. Under these conditions, R 0 for large populations is approximately B/G. This result suggests that experimentally doubling the number of host genotypes in the population would reduce R 0 by one half, and that this would be roughly true even if the experiment increased the total number of hosts in the population (assuming the population is already large). The analytical results also suggest that the parasite would die out, following the addition of genetic diversity to the host population, provided that the frequency of each host genotype declines to less than 1/B. We used computer simulations to examine the gist of these ideas. The simulations assumed a haploid host with two loci coding for resistance. Each locus could have up to three alleles for a total of nine different genotypes. Each of the host genotypes could be infected by one of nine different parasite genotypes, consistent with the matching-alleles model for infection. In these simulations, birth rates of the host were density dependent, and infection reduced the intrinsic birth rate by 30% (the parameters where chosen for illustrative purposes). The details of the simulation are given in Lively (2010b) .

We began the simulation with two alleles at one locus and three alleles at the other locus, giving six possible host genotypes. An uninfected host population was initiated at carrying capacity (K ¼ 40 000), where the number of hosts of each genotype was determined by randomly assigning allele frequencies at the two loci. At generation 1, one host of each genotype was introduced as infected. Thereafter, the infected hosts of each genotype were introduced into the population with a probability of 0.02 per generation, to simulate immigration of infected individuals. We started by assuming B ¼ 9, meaning each infection produced nine propagules that contacted a host. From the analytical results we would expect under that the average value for R 0 would be B/G ¼ 9/6 ¼ 1.5 (where G is the number of genotypes). As such, the pathogen would be expected to spread in the population, as was indeed the case (Figure 1a) . After an initial oscillatory period, the gene frequency dynamics stabilized (Figure 1a) , and the prevalence of infection also stabilized for the parameter values considered here (Figure 1b) . R 0 converged on the predicted value of 1.5 (Figure 1c) .

We then introduced a third allele at the second locus at generation 100, which increased the number of possible genotypes from six to nine. The allele quickly spread, as it conferred resistance on three of the nine possible genotypes for which there was no matching parasite genotype (Figure 1a ). Average R 0 quickly dropped to below 1 as the allele spread in the population (Figure 1c) , and the frequency of infection declined sharply (Figure 1b) . Matching parasite genotypes were introduced into the population by migration (at a rate of 0.02 per genotype per generation), which lead to selection against the new allele after it became common, as well as to a slight increase in R 0 (Figure 1c ). This resulted in sufficient selection to equalize allele frequencies so that the frequency of each genotype approximated 1/G. At this point, R 0 was equal to one (B/G ¼ 9/9 ¼ 1), and parasite prevalence fell close to zero, but was maintained at a low level by immigration (Figure 1b) . The point is that introducing a single novel allele in the host population increased the number of possible genotypes by 50%. This lead to virtual elimination of the parasite, as the prevalence of infection plummeted from about 60% to near zero. A reduction in prevalence occurred despite the fact that matching parasite genotypes were also introduced into the population, and that the host population size remained large (that is, close to 40 000 individuals; results not shown). Clearly, under the assumptions of the present model, small increases in allelic diversity can cause dramatic reductions in parasitism, even in very large host populations. In addition, elimination of the pathogen is not necessarily followed by a loss of genetic diversity in the host population, as the different host genotypes are selectively neutral in the absence of parasite pressure (Figure 1a) .

The available data and the model are consistent with the idea that genetic diversity in host populations can reduce the spread of disease. However, a practical question arises: would the beneficial effect of adding hosts with novel genotypes, in order to increase local genetic diversity, outweigh the positive effect of increasing population size on R 0 ? A possible answer is also suggested by the model, which suggests that the effect of increasing population size on R 0 shows diminishing returns with host density, such that R 0 is asymptotic on B/G ( Figure 2 ). As such, while increasing host population size does strongly affect R 0 in small host populations, it has a small effect in large host populations (Figure 2 ). This suggests that increasing genetic diversity can still reduce parasite prevalence, even though host population size is also increased. The results in Figure 2 suggest that boosting genetic diversity could overcome the effect of increasing host population size, even when the latter is increased by fourfold.

Critically, the diversity threshold does not work by simply reducing the population size of the individual genotypes. The threshold, in fact, was calculated by assuming an infinite host population size. Rather it works by reducing the probability of successful infection by reducing the frequency of matching host genotypes for each parasite genotype.

Consistent with results from agricultural populations, the existing literature suggests that high genetic diversity could buffer host populations against disease spread. Although observational studies from natural populations of vertebrates (for example, cheetahs, sea lions, fish and frogs) may have limitations, they strongly suggest that diversity matters, and their results are consistent with experimental studies on freshwater crustaceans and social insects. However, several questions remain:

(1) Does a diversity threshold exist? In other words, can parasites be eliminated by increasing host genetic diversity above some threshold value? (2) What are the relative effects of host density and host genetic diversity on disease spread? (3) What are the effects of genetic diversity in the parasite population versus that of the host population? (4) What is the heritability of parasite resistance in natural populations? Very little is known about the heritability for resistance in natural populations. It should be high in populations where genetic diversity is maintained by parasite-mediated frequencydependent selection.

These issues would be best addressed by data from natural populations. If parasites take hold or die out depending on how much host genetic diversity exists relative to the threshold, determining whether diversity thresholds exist in natural populations may have great value. This may be particularly helpful for conserving endangered species and mediating vector-human-parasite transmission.

There were no data to deposit. Figure 2 The effect of increasing genetic diversity on R 0 by adding new hosts. Suppose we have 100 hosts, with 10 genotypes in equal frequency (Point A). Now suppose that we experimentally double the host population size, without affecting the genetic diversity (Point B). We see an increase in R 0 , but the increase is not large. Now suppose we double the host population size, but also increase the number of genotypes from 10 to 20 (Point C). We now see a large decrease in R 0 , but it does not go below 1, so the disease can still spread. Finally, suppose that we experimentally double the host population size, but we also increase the number of genotypes by fourfold (Point D). Now R 0 not only deceases, but it goes below 1, so the disease will die out. Redrawn from Lively (2010a).

Molecular evolution and emergence of avian gammacoronaviruses,"Coronaviruses, which are single stranded, positive sense RNA viruses, are responsible for a wide variety of existing and emerging diseases in humans and other animals. The gammacoronaviruses primarily infect avian hosts. Within this genus of coronaviruses, the avian coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) causes a highly infectious upper-respiratory tract disease in commercial poultry. IBV shows rapid evolution in chickens, frequently producing new antigenic types, which adds to the multiple serotypes of the virus that do not cross protect. Rapid evolution in IBV is facilitated by strong selection, large population sizes and high genetic diversity within hosts, and transmission bottlenecks between hosts. Genetic diversity within a host arises primarily by mutation, which includes substitutions, insertions and deletions. Mutations are caused both by the high error rate, and limited proof reading capability, of the viral RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase, and by recombination. Recombination also generates new haplotype diversity by recombining existing variants. Rapid evolution of avian coronavirus IBV makes this virus extremely difficult to diagnose and control, but also makes it an excellent model system to study viral genetic diversity and the mechanisms behind the emergence of coronaviruses in their natural host.","The majority of emerging infectious diseases are caused by RNA viruses. High rates of mutation, short generation times and large population sizes drive their rapid evolution. A wide variety of animals, including humans, are affected and examples include severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), influenza virus, human immunodeficiency virus, poliovirus, hepatitis A, B, and C virus, yellow fever virus, dengue virus, West Nile virus, and many others (Lai and Holmes, 2001) . Understanding viral evolution is important because it can lead to outbreaks of known diseases (e.g. the 2009 human pandemic H1N1 influenza virus), host shifts and the emergence of new diseases (e.g. hantavirus), as well as escape from immune response and antiviral drugs (e.g. human immunodeficiency virus).

Because of their high mutation rates, RNA viruses exist as a genetically diverse population of related virus particles within a host. Genetic diversity, defined as a measure of all the genotypes (genetic variation), as well as the frequency of those genotypes in the population, is created by mutations, including substitutions, deletions, and insertions, and recombination events that occur when the viral genome is replicated. Viral evolution is the result of a combination of high mutational input and the forces that act on the genetic diversity: selection both within and between hosts, which will increase the frequency of adaptive mutations and decrease the frequency of deleterious ones, and genetic drift during severe transmission bottlenecks, which will stochastically and indiscriminately affect the frequency of all types of mutation (Elena and Sanjuan, 2007; Manrubia and Lazaro, 2006) . The processes involved in the emergence and spread of RNA viruses can often be measured in real time, making them perfect candidates for the study of the evolution of infectious diseases (Holmes, 2009 ).

Coronaviruses are positive sense single stranded RNA viruses. Their viral genome is approximately 27-31 Kb in length, which is the largest of the positive sense single stranded RNA viruses. Recently, the Coronavirus Study Group of the International Committee for Taxonomy of Viruses reorganized the family Coronaviridae (http://talk.ictvonline.org/media/p/1230.aspx). The Coronaviridae, in the order Nidovirales, are now divided into two subfamilies Coronavirinae and Torovirinae. The Coronavirinae are further subdivided into genus Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus and Gammacoronavirus based on genetic analysis of the conserved domains in the replicase protein pp1ab and on the structural proteins spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N). The alpha and betacoronaviruses infect and cause disease in mammals whereas the gammacoronaviruses are largely avian viruses.

The most infamous coronavirus is SARS-CoV, which is currently placed in the betacoronavirus group. However, SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-like viruses have a different gene order and sequence divergence distinct from many of the viruses in that group. In only a few months the virus rapidly spread to over 24 countries, infecting 8098 people and killing 774 (www.who.int/csr/sars/en/). Extensive testing and quarantine of infected individuals contained the outbreak. Although there are currently no known cases of SARS, surveillance continues and rapid recognition and response plans have been put into place. The SARS-CoV emerged from a reservoir of coronaviruses in bats that transmitted to an intermediate host then to humans . Thankfully it has not reemerged in humans.

Gammacoronaviruses frequently emerge in avian species. One example is turkey coronavirus (TCoV), which emerged from a recombination event that replaced the spike gene of avian coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), a virus of chickens, with a spike from an as yet unknown source. Another example is the repeated emergence of new genetic and antigenic types of IBV in chickens ( Fig. 1) , which leads to multiple serotypes of the virus that do not result in immunological cross protection.

Infectious bronchitis is a highly contagious upper-respiratory tract disease of chickens and a severe economic burden on the poultry industry worldwide (Cavanagh and Gelb, 2008) . The causative agent, IBV, has also been found in peafowl (Galliformes) and IBV-like viruses have been isolated from teal (Anas crecca), geese (Anserinae), pigeons (Columbiformes), and ducks (Anseriformes) (Cavanagh, 2007) . Clinical signs of the disease in chickens are watery eyes, mucus in the nares and trachea, gasping, coughing, and tracheal rales. The disease can also cause a decrease in egg production and egg quality, and some strains of the virus can cause an interstitial nephritis. When secondary pathogens like avian mycoplasmas, Escherichia coli, Ornithobacterium rhinotrachealie, and/or Bordetella avium complicate the disease, pneumonia, airsaculitis and peritonitis can occur. Morbidity is almost always 100% Fig. 1 . Phylogenetic tree of different strains of avian coronavirus IBV showing S1 glycoprotein amino acid sequence relatedness. The sequences were aligned using Clustal W and the Neighbor-Joining method was used to reconstruct the phylogeny (DNASTAR, Inc., v.8.0.2, Madison, WI).

whereas mortality can be quite variable depending on the age of the birds, strain of the virus and secondary pathogens involved in the disease and can range from 14% to 82% (Cavanagh and Gelb, 2008) . The virus replicates in epithelial cells causing lesions in the nasal turbinates, trachea, kidney, gonads, oviduct, lungs and airsacs. Lesions can also be found in the gastrointestinal tract, bursa of Fabricius and cecal tonsils.

The IBV virion has a typical coronavirus pleomorphic shape with the characteristic club-shaped surface projections designated spikes (Perlman et al., 2008 ). The enveloped virus particle is heat labile, unstable at extreme pH, and sensitive to most disinfectants. The viral genome is 5 0 capped, with a poly-A tail and the gene organization is 5 0 UTR-1a/1ab-S-3a-3b-E-M-5a-5b-N-3 0 UTR.

The 5 0 and 3 0 UTRs contain structural motifs that are involved with interactions between the UTRs as well as with viral encoded replicase proteins and possibly host proteins (Li et al., 2008) . The UTRs play a key role in viral RNA transcription and replication. The 1a and 1ab ORFs encode polyproteins that are post-translationally cleaved into 15 nonstructural proteins (Nsps) by two viral proteases, a papain-like protease (PLP) and the main protease (Mpro) or 3C-like protease (van Hemert et al., 2008) . In contrast to the alpha and betacoronaviruses, which have 16 nsps, nsp1 is lacking in gammacoronaviruses (see Table 1 ).

The 1ab polyprotein is translated through a À 1 frame-shift at nucleotide position 12,466 (in IBV/Mass41/41, AY851295) that occurs approximately 20-40% of the time (Imbert et al., 2008) . The Nsp 2 has been shown to play a role in facilitating de novo IBV protein synthesis by blocking protein kinase R (PKR) phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF-2alpha), which shuts down protein synthesis. In addition, Nsp 2 induces expression of GADD34, a component of the protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) complex, which dephosphorylates eIF-2alpha (Wang et al., 2009 ). The Nsp 3 contains multiple domains including an acidic domain, an ADP-ribose 1 phosphatase, the papain-like protease (PLP), a Y domain and a transmembrane domain (Imbert et al., 2008; Neuman et al., 2008) . The PLP of IBV and, interestingly, also SARS-CoV, is orthologous to PLP2 of other coronaviruses like mouse hepatitis virus (MHV). The PLP1 in IBV is truncated whereas in SARS-CoV it is missing altogether (Barretto et al., 2005; Ziebuhr et al., 2007) . The PLP is responsible for cleaving between Nsps 2-3 and 3-4 and has been shown to contain deubiquitinating and interferon antagonism activities (Clementz et al., 2010; Frieman et al., 2009; Lindner et al., 2005) . The Nsp 4 is a membrane spanning protein and along with Nsps 2 and 6 is thought to anchor the viral replication complex in double membrane vesicles at the golgi (Graham et al., 2008) . Nonstructural protein 5 contains Mpro, a cysteine protease with a Cys-His catalytic dyad (Ziebuhr, 2006) . The Mpro is responsible for cleaving Nsps 4 through 16. Nonstructural proteins 6 through 10 are membrane-localized proteins some of which have RNA binding activity and likely play a role in formation of the viral replication complex (Johnson et al., 2010; Kumar et al., 2007; Tangudu et al., 2007; Zhai et al., 2005; Ziebuhr, 2006) . Nonstructural protein 11/12 is the RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase (RdRp), Nsp 13 contains the RNA helicase, Nsp 14 contains an exoribonuclease domain, Nsp 15 has an endoribonuclease domain, and Nsp 16 is a methyltransferase (Graham et al., 2008; Ivanov et al., 2004; Ziebuhr, 2005 Ziebuhr, , 2006 .

Structural protein genes are located at the 3 0 end of the genome. The S glycoprotein is post-translationally cleaved in IBV into S1 and S2 subunits. The S1 subunit contains a receptor-binding domain responsible for virus attachment to host cells and the S2 subunit, which is noncovalently attached to S1 has a trans-membrane domain that spans the viral membrane and anchoring the spikes to the virion. The S glycoprotein is also involved in virus and cell membrane fusion and entry into the host cell, and it contains epitopes that induce neutralizing antibodies. Variability in the S1 gene is responsible for the multiple different genetic and antigenic types of the virus (see Fig. 1 ). The E protein is an integral membrane protein and the M protein is a membrane spanning protein. Both are involved with virus assembly. The N protein binds to the viral genome, plays a role in viral RNA replication and in virion assembly.

It is well documented that multiple serotypes of IBV exist that do not cross-neutralize (Fabricant, 1998) . Genetic information for the S gene strongly suggests that different serotypes, as defined by neutralizing antibodies, exist for many other coronaviruses. However, they have only been reported for feline coronavirus (FCoV) types I and II, and there is some evidence that two serotypes may exist for SARS-CoV (Decaro et al., 2009; Hohdatsu et al., 1991) . In addition to multiple serotypes of IBV, there are countless variant viruses, some of which may also fail to cross react in a virus neutralization test. Multiple different serotypes with little or no cross protection makes control of IBV, which is primarily through the use of attenuated live vaccines, extremely challenging.

Avian coronavirus IBV creates genetic diversity through rapid replication and large population sizes coupled with a high mutation rate and recombination. Mutations include substitutions, which are the result of a high error rate and limited proof reading 

The average rate of synonymous mutation in all coronaviruses including IBV is approximately 1.2 Â 10 À3 substitutions/site/year (Hanada et al., 2004; Holmes, 2009 ). The rate of other RNA viruses with smaller genomes can be as high as 1 Â 10 À1 substitutions/ site/year. The difference is presumably due to the presence of a 3 0 to 5 0 exoribonuclease (ExoN) domain in Nsp 14, which contains similarities to host proteins involved in proofreading and repair (Minskaia et al., 2006; Snijder et al., 2003) . Using an nsp 14-ExoN mutant SARS-CoV, Eckerle et al. (2010) showed impaired growth and a 21-fold increase in mutation rate for the mutant virus compared to wild type. That data and their previous work with a mouse hepatitis virus coronavirus (MHV-CoV) ExoN mutant (Eckerle et al., 2007) , confirms that ExoN, which is conserved in all coronaviruses, does contribute to the fidelity of the viral RdRp. High fidelity of the polymerase results in a higher ''error threshold'' and likely permits the virus to maintain a large genome size (Holmes, 2009) .

The emergence of new strains and serotypes of IBV is largely due to the accumulation of mutations in the S gene over time as opposed to recombination events. This is thought to be the primary method of cross-species transmission and was shown to lead to the emergence of SARS-CoV (Holmes and Rambaut, 2004; Hon et al., 2008) .

Recombination can reduce mutational load, create genetic variants that may be very different from parental strains, and result in the emergence of new strains (Worobey and Holmes, 1999) . Recombination has been reported in many coronaviruses (Brooks et al., 2004; Lee and Jackwood, 2000; Magiorkinis et al., 2004; Thor et al., 2011) . Recombination hot spots, or regions of the viral genome with higher incidences of recombination breakpoints, have been reported in IBV. Hot spots (see Fig. 2 ) tend to lie immediately upstream of the S glycoprotein gene, as well as in nsp 2, nsp 3, and nsp 16 (Armesto et al., 2009; Hagemeijer et al., 2010; Thor et al., 2011) . Recombination in the nonstructural proteins associated with the RdRp can alter replication efficiency of the virus, which can in turn affect pathogenicity.

Because the S glycoprotein gene is involved in host cell attachment and contains viral neutralizing epitopes, recombination in the S glycoprotein gene can result in the emergence of new strains or serotypes of the virus as well as new viruses capable of causing disease in other host species. The emergence of new variants and serotypes of IBV, whether the result of mutations or recombination, occurs continuously (Jackwood et al., 2005) . Recombination directly leading to the emergence of a new avian coronavirus in turkeys (TCoV) was recently documented. The S gene of IBV recombined with an unknown virus, which altered its pathotype (respiratory to enteric) and host specificity (chicken to turkey), resulting in the emergence of TCoV (Jackwood et al., 2010) . Data from that study showed that the full-length genomes of IBV and TCoV are greater than 86% similar whereas the spike glycoproteins are less than 36% similar with clear recombination break points at the 3 0 end of gene 1ab (nucleotide position 20,173) immediately upstream of the S gene and in the 3 0 end of the spike gene (nucleotide position 23,849) (Jackwood et al., 2010) . It is likely that the unknown virus contributing S gene sequences in the emergence of TCoV is another avian coronavirus, since the only evidence of a gamma coronavirus recombining with either an alpha or beta coronavirus is the mosaic composition reported for the SARS-CoV .

Control of infectious bronchitis virus in commercial poultry is through the use of live attenuated and killed vaccines. Since little or no cross-protection occurs between different serotypes or different variants of the virus, a variety of different virus antigenic types are used in vaccines. Typically more than one immunization is given and multivalent vaccines containing two or more antigenic types are used in an attempt to provide broad protection. It is not uncommon for vaccines to induce only partial protection against varied antigenic types of the virus, which allows some viruses to continue to replicate and persist in a flock. Presumably replication of the virus in a vaccinated host provides it with an opportunity to further adapt and evade the immune response (Gandon and Day, 2008; Gandon et al., 2001) .

The use of modified live vaccine can result in faster evolutionary rates in IBV. Mutation rates for the 793/B IBV type where vaccines against that specific serotype were not used have been estimated to be 3 Â 10 À3 substitutions/site/year (Cavanagh et al., 1998) , whereas the GA98 virus, which emerged in the face of vaccination with the closely related DE072 type was reported to have a mutation rate of 1.5 Â 10 À2 substitutions/site/year (Lee and Jackwood, 2001) . However, caution must be exercised when estimating mutation rates of IBV antigenic types when live attenuated vaccines against that same virus type are used. Mutation rates for Mass and Conn IBV types, where live vaccines against those types are commonly used, were estimated to be 1.9 Â 10 À3 and 1.5 Â 10 À4 nucleotide changes/site/year, respectively (McKinley et al., 2011) . Reisolation of vaccine viruses that are continuously introduced into the field and circulating in birds for a relatively short period of time likely contributed to the apparently low mutation rates.

Emergence of new variants or serotypes of IBV is dependent on the ability of existing strains to be transmitted from one individual to another. The average number of new infections caused by one infected individual (reproductive number, R), is a measure of the sustainability of a virus in the host population. For R < 1, the chain of transmission is not sustainable and the disease slowly dies out. For R > 1, the number of infected hosts increases, which in some cases can result in an epidemic. Eventually the pool of susceptible hosts is sufficiently depleted (or intervention measures are imple- mented) and R drops to below 1. The reproductive number for the situation where all hosts are susceptible (basic reproductive number, R 0 ) is a measure of the transmissibility of a given pathogen. The R 0 value for IBV has been estimated to be 19.95, which is extremely high (comparable to highly transmissible human diseases such as measles) and reflects the highly infectious nature of this virus (de Wit et al., 1998) . Vaccination with a homologous antigenic type of the virus was found to reduce R 0 to 0.69 indicating that proper and careful vaccination with a well-matched vaccine is an effective control strategy for IBV (de Wit et al., 1998) .

Transmission of a virus from one individual to another individual often involves a bottleneck where only a small number of virions are transmitted. Severely restricted transmission bottlenecks have been predicted for HIV, where studies suggest that new infections are started by a single virion (Abrahams et al., 2009) . In contrast, a more recent study on equine influenza virus showed that although the consensus sequence did not vary, genetically distinct subpopulations of the virus were transmitted to a new susceptible host, suggesting a somewhat less restrictive transmission bottleneck .

Theoretically, transmission through a restrictive bottleneck followed by rapid expansion of the number of virus particles in the host can take a rare virus subpopulation and make it the predominant type, potentially leading to the emergence of a new genotype. Whether this is the mechanism behind the emergence of new types of IBV is not known because there exists little in vivo experimental data on bottlenecks and expansion of viruses transmitting and replicating in their natural animal host. There is a substantial body of experimental studies in the laboratory, especially using bacteriophages, that have addressed a variety of evolutionary factors including transmission bottlenecks and the dynamics of adaptation, (reviewed in (Elena and Sanjuan, 2007) ). However, in vivo experiments in animal hosts have usually involved only two or a few individuals, which makes predicting viral evolution as a virus is transmitted through several hosts (i.e. over many transmission events) extremely difficult (Bouma et al., 2009; Coffey et al., 2008; Hoelzer et al., 2010; van der Goot et al., 2005) . While studies are being performed to try to bridge the gap between the laboratory and nature, it is a challenging task. Consequently, there is a critical need for studies that utilize multiplehost chains of transmission similar to those used in vitro, but where host to host transmission events involve natural infections, in an experimental setting that allows for accurate measurements of viral evolution at critical time points. Understanding transmission and development of viral genetic diversity in a natural setting will hopefully elucidate the mechanisms behind the emergence of different genetic and antigenic types of IBV, allowing us to prevent, or at least to better predict the emergence of new coronavirus diseases. The rapid evolution of IBV makes this virus an excellent model to study viral genetic diversity and the mechanisms behind the emergence of coronaviruses in their natural host.

Mathematical models, on their own or in combination with experimental data, have proven to be useful for understanding various aspects of viral dynamics and evolution. Examples of topics that have received significant modeling attention are the estimation of transmissibility (R 0 ) (Kenah, 2011; Roberts, 2007) , the evolution of drug resistance Lipsitch et al., 2007; Temime et al., 2008; Wodarz and Nowak, 2000) , the impact of bottlenecks (Campos and Wahl, 2009; Elena et al., 2001; Escarmis et al., 2006; Handel and Bennett, 2008; Manrubia et al., 2005; Novella et al., 2008) , and the impact of different fitness landscapes on evolutionary trajectories (Antia et al., 2003; Clune et al., 2008; Handel and Rozen, 2009) .

Some of these mathematical modeling approaches have been applied to coronaviruses, specifically the SARS-CoV. Early in the SARS epidemic, data was used to estimate the reproductive number and the impact of potential control strategies (Lipsitch et al., 2003; Riley et al., 2003) . Other modeling studies investigated aspects such as the likely route of transmission of SARS-CoV (Yu et al., 2004) , the impact of contact structure (Meyers et al., 2005) , the impact of control measures that were implemented (Wallinga and Teunis, 2004) and the impact of travel on possible future SARS outbreaks (Ruan, 2009) . With regard to evolutionary questions, models have been used to estimate the timing of the emergence of the common ancestor of the SARS-CoV epidemic strain (Lu et al., 2004) and to better understand its reservoir (Song et al., 2005) .

Other coronaviruses, including IBV, have to our knowledge not been modeled, but a combination of the experimental approaches outlined above with appropriate models seems to be a promising direction to gain general insights into evolutionary dynamics, as well as to help with the further development of effective IBV control strategies. The recent availability and reduced cost of quantitative, deep-sequencing methods should aid in providing data in the future that will be ideally suited for mathematical and statistical modeling to estimate relevant parameters, and predict transmission dynamics.

Compared to other coronaviruses, multiple serotypes and variant viruses that continue to adapt and change appears to be unique to IBV, and makes diagnosis and control of IBV extremely challenging. Traditional virus neutralization tests conducted in embryonated eggs are expensive and time consuming, taking weeks or months to type only a few viruses. Currently, molecular typing tests that involve RT-PCR amplification of the S1 gene followed by nucleotide sequence analysis is being used to inexpensively determine the genetic type of a number of viruses in a short period of time. In addition, since the S1 gene of inactivated viruses can be amplified and sequenced, viruses can be imported (with the proper permits) from abroad. This along with an explosion of genetic data available in GenBank (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) has allowed genetic comparison of IBV isolates from all over the world, significantly improving epidemiological data and attempts to control the disease (Callison et al., 2001) .

Identification of the IBV type causing an outbreak in commercial poultry is necessary to be able to choose the appropriate vaccine(s) capable of inducing a protective immune response. Because only a few vaccine types, and in many countries only one vaccine (Mass type H120) can be used, variant viruses persist and outbreaks continue to occur (Gelb et al., 1991; Ignjatovic et al., 2006; Jackwood et al., 2005 Jackwood et al., , 2009 . Evolutionary rates for IBV are so rapid that even live attenuated vaccines undergo selection and mutation following only a single round of infection in the host. One study compared reisolated vaccine viruses with the original vaccine virus administered to the bird and found that selection of subpopulations as well as mutations were occurring in the S1 gene (McKinley et al., 2008) . Another study found distinct virus subpopulations in the S1 gene were selected when chickens were vaccinated with the Ark-DPI strain of IBV (van Santen and Toro, 2008) . Further analysis found that virus subpopulations were different in the microenvironment of distinct tissues of the host (Gallardo et al., 2010) . These data indicate that different selection pressures leading to evolution of the virus during replication in the host can result in an even higher degree of virus diversity.

A wide variety of genetic and antigenic variants of avian coronavirus IBV, coupled with continuous emergence of new types, make this virus an ideal model to study viral evolution. Multiple infected hosts, high replication within hosts, and high mutation rates, lead to an extraordinarily diverse population of virus particles, which facilitates the evolution of the virus. Determining the size of bottlenecks during transmission, and the changes in virus genetic diversity during single and multiple infection cycles and how these affect transmission is important for evaluating the role of drift and selection on evolution, which is critical for the control of outbreaks of infectious bronchitis as well as other known coronaviral diseases. In addition, that knowledge is an important step in understanding the evolution of RNA viruses, which will make it possible to take a proactive approach to preventing the emergence of new coronaviral diseases.

"Origin, Genetic Diversity, and Evolutionary Dynamics of Novel Porcine Circovirus 3","(porcine dermatitis and nephropathy syndrome)-like clinical signs identified by metagenomic sequencing from swine. Its high occurrence may pose a potential threat to the swine industry worldwide. The processes resulting in the emergence and spread of PCV3 remain poorly understood. Herein, the possible origin, genotypes, and evolutionary dynamics of PCV3 based on available genomic sequences are determined. The closest ancestor of PCV3 is found to be within the clade 1 bat CVs. Using different phylogenetic methods, two major genotypes are identified, PCV3a and PCV3b. It is found that the effective population size of PCV3 increased rapidly during late 2013 to early 2014 and this is associated with the diversification of PCV3a and PCV3b. A relatively high effective reproductive number (Re) value and higher evolutionary rate were found compared to other single-stranded DNA viruses, and positive selection on codons 122 and 320 (24 of ORF2) is identified. It is hypothesized that this, together with the prediction of a potential change of an antigenic epitope at position 320, might have allowed PCV3 to escape from the host immune response. Overall, this study has important implications for understanding the ongoing PCV3 cases worldwide and will guide future efforts to develop effective preventive and control measures.","Continuous epidemiological surveillance of emerging viruses is crucial to control widespread. [1] According to the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV), the family Circoviridae comprises two genera: Cyclovirus and Circovirus. Viruses from the genus Cyclovirus have been found in humans and chimpanzees. [2] Circoviruses have a wide host range, including human, [2, 3] birds, [4, 5] pigs, [6, 7] dogs, [8] and cattle. [9, 10] Before to 2015, porcine circovirus 1 (PCV1) and PCV2 were considered the only types of porcine circoviruses. PCV1 is nonpathogenic to pigs and was identified in the porcine kidney cell line PK-15. [6, 11] PCV2 is associated with significant clinical signs such as postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS), porcine circovirus-associated diseases (PCVAD), and immunosuppression. [2, 6, 10] In the late 1990s, the first PCV2 outbreak was identified [12, 13] and soon PCV2 became endemic causing severe economic losses in the swine industry. Its high evolutionary rate, the highest recorded for a single-stranded DNA virus until now, could allow an evolutionary dynamics similar to that of single-stranded RNA viruses. [13] The genotype identification of PCV2 was first proposed by the European project in 2008 based on p-distance of neighbor joining (NJ) trees. [14] However, it was questioned by Franzo et al. and others [12, 15, 16] when more sequences became available. Until now, there are three major confirmed genotypes including: PCV2a, PCV2b, and PCV2d, and two genotypes with low prevalence, PCV2c and PCV2e. [16] [17] [18] [19] Genotype shifts may be associated with differences in pathogenicity and vaccine immunity. [12] New standard methods to define PCV2 genotypes are necessary to adapt vaccines to the rapid emergence of new genotypes. [20] Although PCV2 is the cause of big economic losses to the pig industry, there is uncertainty surrounding its origin and evolution. Recently, a novel circovirus was identified by next generation sequence (NGS) analysis of aborted fetuses of sows and named PCV3. [21, 22] The newly discovered virus was associated with PDNS. [23] PCV3 infection might contribute to PDNS and reproductive failure, cardiac, and multisystemic inflammation. [10, 21, 24] It has also been shown that PCV3 found in aborted fetuses is the result of vertical transmission. [21] Like PCV2, there are two major open reading frames (ORFs) in the genome of PCV3: ORF1 encodes proteins involved in viral replication (Rep) and ORF2 encodes a major structural protein, the capsid protein (Cap). [25] PCV3 sequences were detected widely in the USA, [21] China, [26] [27] [28] Brazil, [29] Thailand, [30] Korea, [23] and many European countries, [22, [31] [32] [33] [34] including Poland, Italy, Spain, Denmark, Germany, the UK among others. The PCV3 that was first identified in the USA was more closely related to canine circovirus although with weak bootstrap support. [21] Subsequently, with PCV3 detected in China and other countries, a study reported that it was closely related to some bat circoviruses. [24] Additionally, it was considered that canine CVs and some bat CVs may share a common ancestor within the cluster containing PCV1 and PCV2. [35] Previous studies on the origin of PCV3 are difficult to interpret and compare since different phylogenetic methods and reference sequences were applied. [21, 24, 26] Although phylogenetic analysis is a powerful tool and is now widely used for investigating the evolution of PCV3, there are a large number of different inference methods and a lack of uniformity in the use of these methods by different studies. [22, [24] [25] [26] [27] 29, 31, 33] Considering the controversy of the origin of PCV3 (bat or canine), [21, 24, 26] we analyzed the selected available ORF1 circovirus sequences using maximum-likelihood (ML) and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods to trace more accurately the origin of PCV3. Additionally, all available complete PCV3 sequences deposited in GenBank until November 2017 were analyzed by NJ, ML, and MCMC methods to study the molecular genetic relationship. Our results provide a global view of the origin, genetic divergence, and evolutionary dynamics of PCV3 and indicate positive selection and high evolutionary rate, supporting the ongoing genotype shift and outbreaks.

RDP4 was used to detect recombination. We detected no recombination. However, the KY418606 sequence was removed due to low quality. To trace the origin of PCV3, a ML tree (Figure 1a ) was reconstructed using ORF1 gene sequences. We found that all the PCV3 strains were closely related to the clade 1 bat CVs (which were isolated in China from 2011 to 2013) with a high confidence (bootstrap = 86). The bat virus Rhinolophus ferrumequinum circovirus 1 from China (JQ814849) acted as an outgroup of the clade 1 bat CVs and the PCV3 strains, indicating a potential bat CV origin. Additionally, we also found that the PCV2 and PCV1 strains were closely related to the clade 2 bat CVs in the study of Wu et al. [35] We also discovered that canine CVs are closely related to clade 2 bat CVs and PCV1 and PCV2 strains. However, it was previously reported that canine CVs were closely related to PCV3 strains when comparing complete genomes, although with low bootstrap values. [21] This supports the idea that the conserved Rep protein should be used when inferring the origin of porcine circoviruses in the future. Furthermore, the maximum clade credibility (MCC) tree reconstructed with 81 of the 101 ORF1 sequences (Figure 1b ) showed similar topology with the ML tree, and evidenced a close relationship with clade 1 bat CVs with uncertain divergence time due to the insufficient numbers of sequences currently available (Table S1, Supporting Information).

We used ML, MCC, and NJ methods to reconstruct the phylogenies of PCV3 complete coding sequences (ORF1+ORF2). Two independent clades were observed in the three different trees which displayed similar structures (Figure 2a [21] Moreover, the PCV3a clade could be separated into two individual subclades with stable structures, termed PCV3a-1 and PCV3a-2. We observed that the distribution of several strains was random in the PCV3a clade and we referred to these strains as intermediate strains (IM).

However, the NJ and ML tree constructed using ORF2 did not display clear clusters, especially in NJ tree. For example, in the NJ tree constructed with 109 ORF2 sequences, some of the strains in PCV3a-IM clustered with PCV3b ( Figure S1 , Supporting Information). The phylogenies did not remain consistent when the number of reference sequences of the ORF2 gene increased. Therefore, we suggest using complete coding sequences for PCV3 genotyping.

The time of most recent ancestor (tMRCA) and nucleotide substitution rate of the complete coding sequences and individual genes were estimated using BEAST (v1.8.4). Both the mean value and 95% HPD (high posterior destiny) were included (Figure 4 ). The tMRCA of PCV3a was 2013.04 (95% HPD: 2011.69-2013.99). In detailed, the estimations of the tMRCA of PCV3a-1, PCV3a-2, and PCV3b were 2013.80, 2013.61, 2013.44, respectively, which suggests that the PCV3a clade experienced a rapid expansion in 2013. Additionally, the tMRCA of ORF2 and ORF1 was also estimated and showed a similar pattern with complete coding sequences (Table S2 , Supporting Information). Overall, the mean tMRCA of PCV3 of the last three years was in late 2013 based on individual gene or complete coding sequence analysis.

Additionally, the mean substitution rate of the complete coding sequences of all the strains was 1.69 × 10 −3 substitutions/site/year, which was higher than previously reported for PCV1 (1.15 × 10 −5 ), [36] but closer to PCV2 (1.2 × 10 −3 ) (Table S2 , Supporting Information). [13] Furthermore, to get more detailed information on the phylogenetic evolution of PCV3, the substitution rates were estimated according to specific clades and the individual genes. As shown in Figure 4 , the substitution rates of different clades in terms of the complete coding sequences were 2.1 × 10 −3 in the PCV3a-1 and PCV3b clades and 1.6 × 10 −3 in the PCV3a-2 clade. Additionally, we observed that the ORF2 gene experienced similar evolution compared to the ORF1 gene (Table S2, Supporting  Information) .

Based on the skyline plot and MCC tree, we found that PCV3 might have diversified from the second half of 2013 to the first half of 2014 ( Figure 3a ). In addition, the various branches of PCV3 (PCV3a-1, PCV3a-2, and PCV3b) also formed around this time ( Figure 3b ).

Moreover, we investigated the epidemiological dynamics of emerging PCV3 worldwide. We found considerable temporal variation in the estimates of the effective reproductive number (Re) using sequences from 2015-2017. Despite distinct phylogenetic histories, PCV3a and PCV3b exhibited similar Re values of 3.08 (PCV3a, 95% HPD: 0.82-7.96) and 1.82 (PCV3b, 95% HPD: 0.63-4.86) ( Figure S2 , Supporting Information) based on epidemiological modeling in 2016. This suggests the potential to become endemic in pigs, at least if compared to human influenza viruses. [37] Considering the limited number of sequences for 2015 and 2017, the Re value of 2016 was considered valid.

The association of geographical distribution of PCV3 indicated that the p value of both association index (AI) and parsimony score (PS) were less than 0.05. The p value of monophyletic clade (MC) observed in China was less than 0.05 (Table 1), indicating that the geographic relevance of PCV3 in China is significant (a significant association was also observed in Italy but a low number of sequences was analyzed). However, the p values of the USA, South Korea, and Brazil were greater than 0.05. The association of the geographical distribution of PCV3 is displayed in the Figure S3 (Supporting Information) map. In general, there was a correlation between PCV3 and geography, although the correlation was weak based on the relatively small number of available sequences.

A total of 56 PCV3 complete coding sequences were used for amino acid analysis of the related clades (Table S3 , Supporting Information). Amino acid sites 122, 320, and 323 were crucial to distinguish PCV3a and PCV3b. Compared to PCV3a, these amino acid sites were S122A, A320V, R323K, respectively, in PCV3b while R323K in PCV3a-IM. These results further validate the genotyping results we obtained based on the phylogenetic structure. In addition, epitope prediction indicated that there are seven potential epitopes in PCV3a and PCV3b (Table S4 , Supporting Information). For PCV3, the epitopes span almost the whole surface of the protein, which are indicated with different colors in Figure 5 . The detailed information about the epitopes is shown in Table S4 (Supporting Information). Combining epitope prediction with amino acid analysis, we found that amino acid site 24 of ORF2 (corresponding to site 320 of the complete coding sequence) is located in a predicted epitope region. As mentioned before, site 24 of PCV3a and PCV3b was different and, as seen in Figure 5 , the epitope structures of PCV3a and PCV3b are different. This may indicate that the antigenicity of PCV3a and PCV3b is different. Further experimental studies are warranted to verify the differences in the immunogenicity of the predicted epitope regions.

We found that among the individual codons, 3 codons (sites 5, 122, and 320) were considered to be under positive selection with p values less than 0.1 ( Table 2) . Codons 122, located in the ORF1 coding region, and 320, corresponding to the amino acid site 24 of the ORF2 coding region, were confirmed to be under positive selection by at least two methods with p < 0.05 by FEL (fixed effects likelihood) and MEME (mixed effects model of evolution), p < 0.1 by SLAC (single-likelihood ancestor counting), and a posterior probability >0.9 by FUBAR (fast, unconstrained Bayesian approximation).

Since the discovery of PCV3 in 2015, most studies have focused on the genetic characterization of individual isolates and on clinical and epidemiological investigations. [22, 23, 25, 38] Here, we provide new insight into the origin, epidemiology, and evolution of PCV3. We determined, with better accuracy than previous reports, the origin of PCV3 and proposed an evolutionary pathway that led to the emergence of PCV3 worldwide. First, we used conserved coding sequences (ORF1) to trace the potential origin, which was a better and more accurate approach than those previously applied to complete genomes. [21, 24, 26] We found that clade 1 bat CVs which were isolated in China from 2011 to 2013 shared the most recent common ancestor with PCV3. Interestingly, we found several differences with previous reports. First, the pig NW2/USA/2009 strain clustered with the PCV3 clade, which was previously reported to sit as a sole outgroup in the phylogeny. [24] Therefore, we assume that the emergence of PCV3 was before its first detection in 2009 in pigs. However, the accurate origin and divergence time need deep epidemiological surveys to be confirmed. Second, compared to previous studies, [21, 24, 26] more reference sequences were included and we confirmed that PCV3 actually diversified from a clade 1 bat CVs. [35] Furthermore, in accordance with a previous study, we found that PCV1 and PCV2 were closely related to the clade 2 Bat CVs, [35] but not birds. [13] Overall, clade 1 bat CVs are the most likely origin of PCV3 based on the currently available sequences. Generally, bats are considered to be important reservoirs of novel emerging infectious diseases. Circovirus host jumps may be a risk for both the pig industry and public health, similar to the recently reported bat-origin coronavirus detected in pigs. [39, 40] Given that previously recognized NJ p-distance methods that identified PCV2 genotype were questioned by Franzo et al., [15] we explored the phylogenetic history of PCV3 based on recent outbreak strains. [41, 42] For the genotype identification of PCV3, three different algorithms, NJ, ML, and MCC, were used and two stable clades were identified (PCV3a and PCV3b). Additionally, within the PCV3a clade, two stable subclades and flexible IM clades were identified. Compared to previous studies, [24, 31] Adv. Sci. 2018, 5, 1800275 the topologies of the trees provided here, deduced using complete coding sequences, were more stable and accurate ( Figure S4 , Supporting Information). On the other hand, amino acid analysis revealed that S122A and A320V were vital in differentiating the PCV3a and PCV3b clades. Although genotype identification combined with amino acid analysis has been reported by Fu et al. [24] and Fux et al., [31] it is essential to note that: i) both studies included the low sequencing quality strain KY418606 (which has been revised after the two studies were published), misleading the topology of the phylogeny; ii) the subgenotype identification of the two studies was not based on full genomes, while complete coding sequences were used The bold representing the p < 0.05 and posterior probability >0.9, with significant difference. here; and iii) the stable topologies observed in our phylogenetic trees reconstructed with complete coding sequences were confirmed by principle component analysis (PCA) using different sequences in one of our unpublished studies. Therefore, accurate phylogenetic trees and genotype identification of PCV3 should be deduced using unrooted ML trees of complete coding sequences in the future. Phylodynamic analysis revealed that the divergence of PCV3a was earlier than PCV3b. We believe that the short divergence time identified for PCV3a and PCV3b is due to a lack of adequate number of PCV3 sequences. The skyline plot revealed a rapid increase and expansion of the PCV3 population from late 2013 to early 2014. In addition, during this period, PCV3a and PCV3b were formed. The initial phase of an epidemic is usually associated with exponential growth (corresponding to Re = R0). Re must always be less than or equal to R0 by definition. If the value of R0 or Re is more than one, an epidemic may occur. [43] We estimated that the Re of PCV3a and 3b were 3.18 (CI: 0.82-7.96) and 1.82 (CI: 0.63-4.86) in 2016, respectively. Additionally, the high substitution rate of PCV2 within single stranded DNA virus, enabled it to experience an evolutionary dynamics similar to single stranded RNA viruses and, therefore, enhanced the global emergence of PCVD. [13] Interestingly, the substitution rate of PCV3 was relatively higher than PCV2, which might facilitate PCV3 to adapt to different biological conditions and pose a greater threat to the swine population. Overall, these estimated results were consistent with the actual epidemic of PCV3 and indicate that both PCV3a and 3b have high potential for widespread transmission in the future. Thus, epidemiological investigation to prevent this novel disease is crucial. Moreover, our analysis revealed epidemiological features associated with the geographical distribution in China, which might indicate that once PCV3 strains establish into specific areas, they might adapt to the local hosts. Importantly, amino acid site 24 of the ORF2 protein (codon of 320 in the complete coding region) was predicted as a potential epitope and to be under positive selection. This site may be pivotal to the escape of PCV3 from the host immune system leading to a prolonged period of circulation and the divergence of the PCV3a to the PCV3b clade. [44] In conclusion, we confirmed the more accurate bat origin of PCV3, and provided a comprehensive genotype identification. Additionally, we report for the first time that PCV3 replaced PCV2 and became the single stranded DNA virus with highest substitution rate. The rapid increase population and relative high Re value reveals the possibility of a continuous outbreak in the future. Overall, our study aids the understanding of ongoing PCV3 cases worldwide and will guide future efforts to develop effective preventive and control measures.

Sequence Datasets-Multiple Circoviruses Datasets: All the sequences were obtained from the GenBank database of NCBI (November 2017, Table S1, Supporting Information) (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/). A total of 57 PCV3 strains were analyzed in this study. In addition, 101 ORF1 coding sequences of different circoviruses which were previously reported, [12, 21, 24, 35] including 13 PCV2 strains, 2 PCV1 strains, 9 bat CVs, 20 other host circoviruses, and 1 strain detected from a pork sample were also included.

Sequence Datasets-PCV3 Datasets: A total of 57 complete coding sequences (ORF1 + ORF2) were analyzed. The noncoding regions were deleted and the coding sequences were split into two representing ORF1 (Rep) and ORF2 (Cap). Given that ORF2 is in the opposite orientation, the individual ORFs were downloaded and then concatenated. Additionally, 109 individual ORF2 gene encoding capsid proteins were included.

Recombination Detection: Recombination analysis was performed based on the approaches applied in RDP4. [45] A total of seven methods were applied, including GENECONV, [46] RDP, [47] Chimaera, [48] SiScan, [49] 3Seq, [50] MaxChi, [51] LARD. [52] Recombination had to be confirmed by at least four of the seven methods with p value cut-off of 0.05. Bonferroni correction was applied throughout the analysis.

Sequence Alignment and Model Test: Sequences were aligned by ClustalW implemented in MEGA 7. [53] The best substitution model was selected by jModelTest according to the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) score.

Origin and Phylogenetic Analysis: To date the origin of PCV3, a ML tree was reconstructed with 101 amino acid sequences of the Rep protein using RAxML with PROTCATLG model and 1000 bootstrap replicates. The lineages closely related to PCV3, PCV2, and PCV1 were used to infer the divergence time. The MCC trees were inferred by BEAST (v1. 8.4) with the nucleotide sequences of the ORF1 gene using the Hasegawa-Kishino-Yano model with four discrete gamma categories (HKY + G). Additionally, to identified PCV3 genotypes, three distinct methods were used including: MCC tree using BEAST (v1.8.4), [54] ML tree using RAxML, [55] and NJ tree using MEGA7. [53] The p-distance methods were used to infer the NJ tree with 1000 bootstraps replication.

Evolutionary Dynamics of PCV3: Bayesian MCMC methods within the BEAST (v1.8.4) package were used to estimate the time of the most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) and the evolutionary rates. [56] The nucleotide substitution model was general time reversible substitution model with a proportion of invariant sites and gamma distributed rate heterogeneity (GTR+I+G), assuming an uncorrected relaxed clock (lognormal). A Bayesian skyline coalescent model was set to estimate the efficient population size. Two independent runs were operated with a chain length of 1 × 10 8 generations and sampled at every 10 000 generations. [57] Convergence was estimated based on the software Tracer (v1.6) (http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/tracer/) after a burn-in of 10%. Parameters with effective sampling size (ESS) > 200 were accepted. The final MCC trees were replayed in Figtree (v1.4.3) (http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree/). BaTS (Bayesian tip-significance testing) was used to analyze the correlation among the PCV3 sequences and geographical structure. [58] The countries of each sequence were used as the taxon labels, such as China, USA, Korea, Italy, and Brazil. The AI and PS statistic were calculated using the BEAST MCC tree to obtain statistical support. A p value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Also, the worldwide geographical distribution of PCV3 was marked in the map ( Figure S3 , Supporting Information).

Effective Reproduction Number (Re): Re values were calculated using follow formula (1)

Among these parameters, R is the effective reproduction number, λ is the birth rate, μ is the death rate, ρ is the sampling probability. [59] BEAST (v2.4.7) was used to estimate the Re. The GTR+G nucleotide substitution model was chosen and the Birth death skyline contemporary model with sampling proportion was set to 0. The chain length was 1 × 10 7 , every 1000 generations resampled one time. Two independent runs were performed and log files were combined using LogCombiner.

Predicting the Structure of PCV3a and PCV3b: The tertiary structure models of PCV3a and PCV3b ORF2 protein were built using the I-TASSER online tool [60] (https://zhanglab.ccmb.med.umich.edu) based on the structure of PCV2. PCV3a (Strain: KX778720 PCV3-US/MO2015) and PCV3b (Strain:MF589105 PCV3/CN/Guangdong-SG1/2016) sequences www.advancedscience.com were used for the comparative analysis of epitopes and viral structure. The viral surface and structure were depicted in PyMOL (v1.5.0.4). [61] The epitopes of the PCV3 cap protein were predicted using the online server: (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/BepiPred/) (epitope threshold set up at 0.5).

Selection Analysis: The detection of selection on the complete coding sequences of PCV3 was performed using DATAMONKEY (http://www. datamonkey.org/). The methods used to investigate positive codon sites included FEL, SLAC, FUBAR, MEME, [62] [63] [64] the branch site REL and the GA-branch site models were chosen to determine the selection pressure on the individual branches. [65, 66] Methods with p < 0.1 in SLAC, p < 0.05 in FEL and MEME and the posterior probability >0.9 in FUBAR, were considered to be more conservative positive selection pressure.

viruses Reliable and Standardized Animal Models to Study the Pathogenesis of Bluetongue and Schmallenberg Viruses in Ruminant Natural Host Species with Special Emphasis on Placental Crossing,"Starting in 2006, bluetongue virus serotype 8 (BTV8) was responsible for a major epizootic in Western and Northern Europe. The magnitude and spread of the disease were surprisingly high and the control of BTV improved significantly with the marketing of BTV8 inactivated vaccines in 2008. During late summer of 2011, a first cluster of reduced milk yield, fever, and diarrhoea was reported in the Netherlands. Congenital malformations appeared in March 2012 and Schmallenberg virus (SBV) was identified, becoming one of the very few orthobunyaviruses distributed in Europe. At the start of both epizootics, little was known about the pathogenesis and epidemiology of these viruses in the European context and most assumptions were extrapolated based on other related viruses and/or other regions of the World. Standardized and repeatable models potentially mimicking clinical signs observed in the field are required to study the pathogenesis of these infections, and to clarify their ability to cross the placental barrier. This review presents some of the latest experimental designs for infectious disease challenges with BTV or SBV. Infectious doses, routes of infection, inoculum preparation, and origin are discussed. Particular emphasis is given to the placental crossing associated with these two viruses.","Amongst pathogens, RNA viruses were a major source of emerging diseases during the last 30 years [1] . High mutation rate and in case of segmented genome, reassortment are responsible for genetic adaptability and variability of these viruses.

Two pathogens affecting cattle and sheep were responsible for major outbreaks in Mainland Europe in the past 15 years: Bluetongue virus (BTV) and Schmallenberg virus (SBV). These outbreaks were singular in several ways: the diseases were previously either never reported in such northern locations (bluetongue virus) or recently discovered (Schmallenberg virus); their emergence still has 2.1. 1 

A high quality infectious inoculum reproducing the pathogenesis of diseases was essential to investigate vaccine efficacy requirements or certain specific aspects of the pathogenesis of recently discovered viruses [10, 11] . Facing an emerging disease with epizootic potential, reproduction of clinical disease under experimental conditions might be more reliable using infectious animal products such as blood or serum. Nevertheless, it appears that in the majority of the most recent experimental infections involving BTV or SBV, cell culture grown inocula were preferred for challenges (Table 1) . Reasons to use cell-passaged viruses can be summarized as follow:

(1) Original isolate or any strain of particular interest can be shipped almost anywhere in the world, leading to great improvement of standardization; (2) Viral amplification by cell-passages allows a high increase in viral titre, subsequently allowing to inoculate lower volumes; (3) Screening for contamination or other pathogens is easier in cell culture and eliminate some veterinary public health concerns about using ruminant blood to infect other ruminants; and (4) Virulence in cell culture can be easily standardized. Table 1 . Inocula characteristics used in the 10 most recent experimental infection studies on BTV and SBV (as searched on PubMed (July 2019) with keywords ""experimental infection bluetongue"" and ""experimental infection Schmallenberg""). Only articles about experimental infection involving at least one ruminant species among cattle, sheep or goats were retained. The number of infected animals only takes into account actually infected ones, excluding control animals. In several recent studies [14] clinical signs reported in BTV infected animals were of a lesser extent than those reported from the field [14, 17, 27, 28, [32] [33] [34] . As modified live vaccines gain their attenuation through serial cell passages, the first and most obvious hypothesis to explain the mild severity of bluetongue disease in the experiment is the use of culture grown virus. Moreover, passage history of the inocula used involved mostly embryonated chicken eggs (ECE), BHK-21 and VERO cells. It was reported that BTV grown on KC cells (derived from Culicoides sonorensis) could induce a greater clinical signs severity [35] probably because KC cells better mimic natural vector-borne infection compared to virus passaged on other cell lines [36] .

Like other families of RNA viruses, Peribunyaviridae-RNA-dependent RNA polymerases and orbiviruses VP1 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase are prone to produce errors during viral genome replication. In general, RNA virus replication is characterized by high mutation rates (10 −5 -10 −3 misincorporations per nucleotide copied), short generation times and high progeny yields [37] . In addition, segmented RNA viruses also generate genomic variations through recombination and reassortment [38] . Therefore, RNA viruses form populations of closely related viral variants that started from a single clone: the quasispecies [39, 40] .

With arthropod vectors, SBV and BTV typically undergo an alternate two-host 'life cycle' and are therefore suggested to be more stable and to evolve slower than vector-independent viruses [41] . Both steps may put selective pressures on these viruses, but it remains unknown whether sequence divergence is related to the mammalian or arthropod portion of life cycle. However, it has been demonstrated that despite the lack of changes in the consensus sequence, the passage of BTV in Culicoides cells induces an increase of the number of low-frequency variants as well as an increase in virulence [42] . This phenomenon has been hypothesized to explain the reduced viraemia and clinical picture seen in the re-emerging BTV8 in 2017 versus the 2007 strain [12] .

As a matter of fact, it was also reported that the inoculation of infectious material from field isolates rarely produce a clinical picture as severe as in natural infection [19] . An additional hypothesis would be that Culicoides saliva might act as a catalyser enhancing the ability of BTV to produce severe clinical signs. Indeed Culicoides saliva was demonstrated to contain a trypsin-like protease able to cleave VP2, leading to infectious subviral particles formation with enhanced infectivity [43] .

We demonstrated the suitability of BTV8 passaged a few times on cell culture to both reproduce clinical signs and RNA detection in calves [33] . Other authors concluded to the benefits of culture-grown viruses to be used in experimental challenges in ruminants [44] , as well. Despite converging results, policy of the OIE remains unchanged regarding recommended vaccine efficacy requirements, i.e., challenging vaccinated and unvaccinated sheep with a virus ""passaged only in ruminant animals and with no or limited ECE or cell culture passages"" [45] .

Results regarding SBV do not show that much consistency. In cattle, Wernike et al. reported a reduced viral replication of cell culture-grown SBV when compared to natural host-passaged inoculum [46] . By contrast, one year later the same team concluded to the suitability of both infectious serum and low passage cell culture material for SBV experimental challenges in sheep [47] . In addition to the passage history, the origin of the isolated virus seems to be of importance as virus originating from the central nervous system failed to reproduce RNAemia in inoculated animals [47] . Successive serial passages in cell-culture usually result in decreased virulence. However, regarding SBV, Varela et al. reported an increased pathogenicity in a SBV strain passaged 32 times in INF-incompetent sheep CPT-Tert cells, associated with a faster spread of the virus in the brain of suckling mice [48] . SBV was demonstrated to grow efficiently in several cell lines including sheep CPT-Tert, bovine BFAE, human 293T, dog MDCK, hamster BHK-21, BSR, KC, and VERO cells [48, 49] . Whereas serial passages in CPT-Tert led to the accumulation of a variety of mutations mostly in the M and S segments, the porcine cell line SK-6 proved to be highly susceptible and to allow the genetic stability of SBV throughout successive passages [50] . Therefore, depending on the cell line used to grow SBV, serial passages can lead to attenuation, increased virulence, or efficient propagation with a low frequency of nucleotide exchanges.

When it comes to arboviruses the choice of the route of inoculation can be driven by two main considerations:

(1) The need for a route that best mimics the behaviour of the vector in field conditions. Usually haematophagous arthropods are either telmophagous or solenophagous; depending on the vector species the route might be intradermal (ID), subcutaneous (SC), or intravenous (IV). In experimental infections the inoculated viral load and volume are usually higher than the ones inoculated through naturally occurring feeding given the size of the arthropods and the size of their mouthparts [51] . Another drawback already mentioned is the lack of vector saliva components, which can modify the structure and infectivity of Reoviridae and Peribunyaviridae viral particles [43, 52] . (2) The need for a route that will ensure the virus to reach the blood stream. Quite obviously this is the intravenous route. Since vector saliva components can enhance the infectivity of arboviruses there is a risk that the inoculation of the virus alone or at a distal site from the vector feeding site could result in a failed infection [53] . Therefore, the option to bypass the skin for reaching the bloodstream may be relevant.

Several authors including us [17] used mixed routes to overcome the respective disadvantages of each approach (Table 1 ; [34, 54] ). In a study of our group, we compared intranasal, intradermal and subcutaneous routes for experimental infections of ewes with SBV [28] . Intradermal is an interesting yet underused route: indeed most haematophagous arthropods do not pass the skin and their mouthparts only allow them to feed intradermally. Most of the cellular and fluid exchanges between the skin and the blood do occur in the dermis [55] . In addition, there are some evidences suggesting that intradermal inoculation can be more appropriate to reproduces many aspects of natural infection, including clinical disease, viral and immune responses [56] . The intradermic route was demonstrated to better mimic natural early stages of the infection, directly influencing the severity of the disease. BTV-induced immunosuppression is linked to the infection and disruption of follicular dendritic cells, which is mostly possible through intradermic inoculation [57] .

However, to perform an actual intradermal inoculation the volume to be injected has to be limited, the dermis being mostly composed of a dense network of collagen fibres. Therefore, it is required to multiply inoculation sites to reach desired total inoculum volume and infectious titre. To realize the inoculation itself, the most practical tools are Dermojet ® (Akra Dermojet) or special syringes for intradermal injections (used to perform bovine tuberculosis skin tests for example). These devices allow usually volumes between 0.1 and 0.4 mL, thus the need for multiple injections to reach the common 1-4 mL inoculation volume used in ruminant infectious challenges experiments (Table 1) . Moreover, with both systems the inoculum has to be transferred from its original vial to a small tank of the dermojet or to a special cartridge to be used with the intradermal syringe. This extra step increases the number of handlings, which should be limited especially in the case of BSL3 pathogens.

We investigated the intranasal route to test whether or not a potential direct SBV contamination between sheep could be achieved [28] . Regarding BTV several authors reported unexpected and inconclusive direct horizontal transmission with different serotypes (BTV8, BTV1, and BTV26 at least) [58] [59] [60] [61] .

Several authors reported a direct link between the inoculated viral doses and the onset of clinical signs and viraemia, i.e., the higher the dose the sooner the clinical signs and viral RNA detection [62] [63] [64] . In another study, we evaluated four 10-fold dilutions of a SBV infectious serum inoculum in ewes [30] . The undiluted original inoculum had a titre of 2 × 10 3 TCID 50 /mL. It appears there is a critical dose to be inoculated for reproducing field-like virological and immunological parameters, and once this threshold is reached, there is no dose-dependent effect anymore. In the successfully infected animals, no statistical differences between the different inoculation doses were found in the duration or quantity of viral RNA circulating in blood, nor in the amount of viral RNA present in virus positive lymphoid organs. Likewise Di Gialleonardo et al. compared three groups of cattle inoculated with 100-fold dilutions of BTV8; no significant differences in viraemia kinetics could be found [65] .

Inoculation by the bite of Culicoides was reported to be more efficient than intradermal inoculation, especially by delaying the early immune response of the host despite a generally lower inoculated viral dose when compared to needle inoculation [66] . Several mechanisms were hypothesized to explain this apparently enhanced infectivity in Culicoides transmitted BTV:

(1) The Culicoides saliva contains proteases able to cleave VP2, leading to the formation of infectious subviral particles (ISVP) displaying higher infectivity in KC cells and Culicoides [43] ; (2) The ratio of infectious BTV particles versus defective virions produced within Culicoides might be higher when compared with cell culture grown BTV [66] ; and (3) Pharmacological agents contained in Culicoides saliva might affect the host's immune response by anti-proliferative effects on leucocytes [67] or a reduced INF alpha/beta expression, as demonstrated with vesicular stomatitis virus and mosquito saliva [68] .

Nonetheless, the use of Culicoides to perform experimental challenges remains highly limited by practical constraints: to date besides C. nubeculosus, C. riethi, and C. sonorensis no other Culicoides species were successfully establish as lab-adapted colonies [69, 70] , the alternative being insects caught in the wild. In addition, prior to the infectious challenge on the ruminant host, the infection of Culicoides is particularly tricky given the size of the insect and the exact amount of virus delivered to each ruminant cannot be known.

Altogether, the subcutaneous route seems to represent the best compromise for BTV and SBV. The dose itself has to be sufficient but there is no gain in using massive viral load.

Bluetongue disease history is scarred with incidents of contamination of biological samples. In 1992, modified live vaccines against canine distemper, canine adenovirus type 2, canine parainfluenza, and canine parvovirus, reconstituted with a killed canine coronavirus vaccine, led to abortions in several bitches. A virus could be isolated and was eventually identified as BTV serotype 11 [71, 72] . More recently, a case of BTV11 contamination was reported by ANSES (Agence nationale de sécurité sanitaire de l'alimentation, de l'environnement et du travail, Maison-Alfort, France), in the context of an experimental infection of goats with BTV8. It appeared to be very closely related to the BTV11 isolated in Belgium [73] . We discussed a BTV15 contamination in a recent study [17] . This particular inoculum has been previously involved in two other experimental infections. Eschbaumer et al. used BTV1 culture supernatant that was then passaged once on VERO cells before being injected in calves and sheep [74] . That inoculum has been subsequently used by Dal Pozzo et al. [34] , with the exact same outcome, namely discovery of the BTV15 contamination. BTV inoculums were not only contaminated with BTV heterologous serotypes: Rasmussen et al. reported the use of a BTV2 inoculum contaminated with Border Disease Virus in sheep [75] .

So far, literature does not report experimental infections with a SBV inoculum that was contaminated by another virus belonging to the same or a different family. Broadly speaking contamination routes are most likely related to i) laboratory contamination during sample preparation or ii) natural multiple infection of the original donor animal [76] . Given the potential dramatic consequences of such contamination incidents, inocula should be tested for major pathogens affecting the host species used in challenge experiments but also for a set of BTV serotypes considered to be the most at risk. Despite the transient circulation of BTV6 [77] , BTV11 [76] , and BTV14 [78] of vaccine origin in Europe, the BTV11 contamination here above mentioned happened to be similar to BTV11 reference strain. Hence, the contamination of the inoculum is far from being necessarily related to an ongoing viral circulation even though it might remain silent because of the lack of clinical consequences. Thus, to rule out any potential BTV contamination all known BTV serotypes should be tested for. Such a recommendation would inevitably increase the constraints and costs of quality control of inocula prior to their use in experimental infections. Extensive screening could however be considered on a case-by-case basis.

Vertical transmission from pregnant dams to their offspring is one of the major consequences for both SBV and BTV. Many pathogens are able of crossing the placenta to cause foetal injury. Most maternal virus infections are not transmitted to the foetus. However, certain viruses are able of crossing the placental barrier possibly causing developmental defects (teratogenesis). The teratogenesis is the production of a permanent abnormality in structure or function, restriction of growth, or death of the embryo or foetus [79] . The outcome of in utero infection depends on the susceptibility of the foetus to the infecting virus, which in turn, is a reflection of the gestational age of the foetus at exposure as well as the virulence characteristics of the infecting virus [80] . Nervous tissues are important targets for both BTV and SBV: usually the younger the foetus, the more severe the lesions [81, 82] .

To colonize the foetus viruses need a way in. Therefore, it is considered that SBV in utero infection can only occur once the first placentomes were established, around day 30 of pregnancy in cattle and slightly earlier in sheep [83] [84] [85] . At implantation, several changes occur: the papillae in the uterine glands immobilize the conceptus and it starts to elongate (cattle: 15 days post coitum (dpc); sheep: 13-16 dpc). Subsequently the cells of the trophectoderm and the uterine epithelium get interdigitated and binucleate cells start to be seen. Then binucleate cells start to differentiate and to migrate (cattle: 20-22 dpc; sheep: 16-18 dpc). Foetal villi develop in the caruncular areas starting at 24-26 dpc in small ruminants and 28-30 dpc in cattle, thus defining the end of the implantation and the start of the placental development [86] . Table 2 summarizes some of the essential events in the course of the prenatal development in cattle and sheep. In a recent study, we decided to infect with BTV8 vaccinated and non-vaccinated pregnant heifers at 120 days of pregnancy (BTV pregnant heifers study [32] ). We also challenged pregnant ewes with SBV at 45 and 60 days of pregnancy (SBV pregnant ewes study [27] ). Thus, for both viruses the experimental infection took place within the critical timeframe, between 30 and 150 days for cattle and between 30 and 70 days of pregnancy for sheep (Figure 1, [85] ). Moreover, in experimental conditions the most frequent BTV transplacental infection was reported to occur at mid-term gestation, around 70 days of pregnancy in sheep [58, 59] .

The prenatal period can be divided into four main periods: i) fertilization; ii) blastogenesis; iii) embryogenesis; and iv) foetogenesis [94] . The embryo develops tissues and organ structures from the three original germ layers (ecto-, meso-, and endoderm). Once the organs are differentiated the embryo becomes a foetus [95] . The foetal phase is characterized by a fast growth of the conceptus. In cattle and sheep the foetogenesis starts around 45 and 38 dpc, respectively [90] . Thus, the critical timeframe for BTV and SBV infection overlaps the end of the embryo stage and the beginning of the foetal stage. Moreover, although in ruminants gamma globulins are unable to go through the placental barrier from the mother to the foetus it is admitted that cow and sheep foetuses become sequentially and increasingly immunocompetent to a larger variety of antigens throughout the pregnancy [96, 97] . The critical timeframe for BTV and SBV infection also spans over the course of several important events during the immune system development ( Table 2 ). Although the sequence of antigens to be successively and progressively recognized by the foetal ruminant through pregnancy seems to be quite conserved between individuals, these antigens can be recognized starting with a difference of a few days between individuals [98] . This individual variability could explain the findings by De Clercq et al. (2008) , who reported all possible combinations of serological status/RTqPCR results in dam/calf pairs in a context of high BTV8 suspicion along with results which were interpreted as apparent immunotolerance [99] . Likewise, malformed calves and lambs were reported to be SBV viropositive or vironegative with or without SBV antibodies, suggesting the possibility of an in utero clearance of the virus. Moreover, most of the malformed calves that were negative in both SBV antibodies and RTqPCR were born from seropositive mothers [100] .

In our studies, none of these evocative lesions was reported either in the BTV pregnant heifers study or in the SBV pregnant ewes study [27, 32] .

Following the infection of pregnant dams we reported the reddening of the muzzle and haemorrhages in the wall of the pulmonary artery in calves born from non-vaccinated mothers. Haemorrhages of the pulmonary artery is a BTV typical yet not pathognomonic lesion [101] . These findings were associated with the absence of any anti-BTV antibodies prior to the colostrum intake [32] . Melzi et al. reported the early infection and destruction of follicular dendritic cells following BTV infection. Consequently, antibody production is notably impaired and could be an element explaining the lack of BTV antibody detection in those calves [57] . This result provides an interesting perspective to the many petechial haemorrhages we observed on lymph nodes in several of our own experimental infections [14, 17, 32, 33] .

Following the infection of pregnant ewes with SBV, out of the 22 born-alive lambs none had any anti-SBV neutralizing antibodies prior to colostrum intake [27] .

In both these experiments, timing of inoculation was optimal to achieve transplacental infection of the foetus with regard to data available from the literature yet no malformations could be seen. No antibodies against the virus used to infect the mothers could be detected as well. These striking results might even question the success of the infection, notwithstanding the positive RNA detection in the mothers. In our BTV pregnant heifers study, the report of similar lesions and serology results in another experiment on goats [102] , and in our SBV pregnant ewes study the detection of SBV nucleic acids in organs of several lambs and many extraembryonic structures provided support to an actual transplacental infection. In addition, in another study [103] we managed to isolate SBV from foetal envelopes in the animals from the SBV pregnant ewes study at birth, thus 90 and 105 days post infection.

The very low ratio of precolostral seroconversion in immunocompetent foetuses was also reported following the infection of pregnant cattle with SBV [104] .

Transplacental transmission of BTV8 based on field data was reported to range from 16% [105, 106] to 35% [107, 108] . In experimental infections, passage of BTV8 from the mother to the foetus could be demonstrated in 43% of infected ewes whereas BTV1 could be detected in up to 67% of the foetus [59] . The highest susceptibility could be observed around 35-42 days of pregnancy in sheep [109] and infections after day 75 were reported to result in much lighter consequences [110] . Placental crossing, depending on the gestational stage, the BTV serotype and the inoculated dose, was reported to cause congenital defect in up to 40% of the offspring of infected ewes [111] . Other authors observed a BTV8 vertical transmission rate of 33% in goats infected at 61 days of pregnancy [112] .

During the BTV epizootic of 2007-2008, Darpel et al., estimated transplacental infection rate of 33%, which is consistent with the latter result [107] .

The lesions potentially presented by the calves affected in utero by SBV could be distinguished according to two entities: a hydrocephaly/hydranencephaly syndrome and a torticollis/arthrogryposis syndrome. By analogy with Akabane virus the infection during the first 6 months seems to be critical: an infection of the foetus between 76 and 104 days usually gives rise to hydranencephaly/porencephaly type lesions, and from 103 to 174 it is predominantly arthrogryposis [113] . The latest lesions have been observed for infection at 249 days of gestation and it appears that foetuses less than two months old (after conception) could be protected from in utero infection [113] . In contrast to SBV torticollis was hardly seen after a BTV8 in utero infection during the BTV epidemic in 2006-2009 but was more dominated by hydranencephaly in sheep [114] .

Also in contrast to SBV, BTV in utero infection is in the vast majority of cases associated to BTV lab adapted strains (i.e., passaged on cell culture like modified live vaccine strains) or more recently with the European BTV8 wild type virus. By the end of the 20th century, at least five BTV serotypes of modified live vaccine origin (BTV4, BTV10, BTV11, BTV13, BTV17) were reported to be able to cross the placental barrier and possibly causing teratogenic effects [115] [116] [117] [118] . In utero infection caused by wild-type strains was considered uncommon [119] yet documented [120] .

SBV vertical transmission seems to be lower when compared to BTV, especially in cattle [121] . The rate of malformations caused by SBV was reported to be about 0.5% in cattle [122] although the rate of intrauterine infection-based on serological results of the calves prior to colostrum intake-was reported to be up to 28% [83] . Other authors documented field data about congenital malformations affecting 3% of the calves but 8-10% of the lambs in farms at the beginning of the SBV epizootic [123, 124] . In Belgium based on a survey targeting farmers we also found an estimated 10% of malformed sheep in SBV positive flocks [125] . Table 3 summarizes the most common in utero malformations and nervous lesions induced by some of the most common viruses inducing BTV and SBV-like lesions in ruminants. [27, 32, 81, 85, 104, 127, 128] . In utero potential BTV (blue shades) and SBV induced defects (green shades) following infection of the pregnant dams along the whole gestation time for cattle and small ruminants. Time is expressed as a fraction of the total gestational time. A more detailed timeline is available as supplementary file. [27, 32, 81, 85, 104, 127, 128] .

Time is expressed as a fraction of the total gestational time. A more detailed timeline is available as supplementary file.

Embryonic losses represent a key factor affecting ruminant production systems. In cattle, as well as in sheep, most of the spontaneous embryo mortalities occur in the early embryonic life, namely before 16-18 dpc [129, 130] . In cattle early embryonic losses under normal conditions were reported to range from 20 to 44% whereas in sheep in ranges from 12 to 30%, with a clear increase of embryo deaths with the ovulation rate [129, 131] . The impact of both BTV and SBV on reproductive parameters other than teratogenesis is well documented. BTV8 was reported to increase the 56-days-return to service rate and the number of AI (Artificial Insemination) required to achieve pregnancy [132, 133] . During the SBV epizootic the number of AI to get cattle pregnant was slightly yet significantly increased regardless of whether or not they were part of a herd reporting malformations indicative of an actual infection [134] .

Although SBV and especially BTV had a tremendous economic impact on livestock industry, it is worthwhile highlighting the relative poor efficiency of the placental crossing and more specifically the overall low rate of congenital deformities induced by those viruses. However, congenital malformations underestimate the actual rates of BTV and SBV transplacental infections [128] .

The number of ruminants used in experimental infections is chosen based on welfare and statistical concerns but also quite unfortunately on economic and practical grounds [8] . We performed our experimental infections with BTV in the BSL3 facilities of Sciensano (Ukkel, Belgium) and with SBV in BSL2+/BSL3 facilities depending the phase of the experiment. Indeed, the Belgian Service of Biosafety and Biotechnology as well as the Belgian law classify BTV as a class 3 pathogen whereas there is no recommendation for SBV. Our biosafety measures for SBV were based on the analogy with AKAV, also classified as a class 3 pathogen [135] . Domestic ruminants being herd animals, need to be housed in groups or at least not individually. Euthanasia methods have to be the most humane as possible and clear end points have to be defined. Given the scarcity of clinical signs caused by BTV and SBV in the field and the individual variations in the response to the infection the number of animals to be included has to be chosen very carefully to comply with the Reduction objective (Three Rs concept) but has to be sufficient to limit the risk of not being able to provide useful data in the context of the ongoing scientific investigation. This is particularly difficult for experimental infection of pregnant ruminants with low malformation rates following transplacental transmission.

The most objective parameter to assess a vaccine efficacy against a virus and especially a RNA vector-borne virus is the evaluation of the viral RNA detection by RTqPCR in the host target [44] . BTV and SBV virulence was demonstrated to vary depending on the ruminant host whether it is cattle, sheep or goat. In addition, pregnancy length differs between cattle and small ruminants while the placentation and the development of the foetal envelopes present slight differences [136] . Consequently, to study any of the specific aspects related to a ruminant species there are no other animal models or any alternative able to mimic the natural situation in a proper way [8] .

The results presented in our latest studies provide new insights in viruses that spread through Europe causing severe losses in livestock industry. In addition, these aspects open new perspectives to expand the knowledge on emerging vector-borne viruses targeting ruminants. More specifically, according to our experiments, the subcutaneous route with an inoculum passaged a limited number of times on cell culture seems to represent the best compromise between a high probability to reproduce an infection similar to what happens in the field and logistics concerning the preparation/storage/management of the inoculum. To prevent the loss of viral variability and limit the risks of attenuation, isolation of BTV could be done on KC cells [35] , whereas SBV could benefit from an isolation on the highly susceptible SK-6 cell line [50] . Screening for concomitant pathogens should be considered on a case by case basis, if required. The dose should be chosen based on literature data yet no advantage is provided by inoculating a massive viral load.

Since some data from other authors suggest a better reproduction of the diseases with intradermal inoculation, it could be further investigated, especially if more user-friendly devices would be available.

A major breakthrough would be the successful adaptation of a colony of Palearctic BTV and SBV vector Culicoides species (C. obsoletus/scoticus, pulicaris) to laboratory conditions and subsequent use in infectious challenges. Vector-borne transmission of BTV implies the puncture of the skin at some point. There is growing evidence that under certain circumstances additional routes of transmission can be observed: a goat was reported to be infected by BTV2 without direct contact [75] . The recently discovered BTV26 also displayed the ability to infect goats through direct contact [61] . In other experimental infections control ewes were found positive with BTV1 and BTV8 [58, 59] . The study of the virus factors affecting this modified/underreported transmission feature should allow a better understanding of the epidemiology of the disease.

In conclusion, targeting ruminant host species in experimental infections especially with BSL3 Culicoides borne pathogens is very expensive, time consuming, subject to stringent animal welfare constraints and critical sample size analysis to meet optimal statistical requirements. However, ruminant model remains unavoidable to assess the disease impact and to study the pathogenesis of emerging vector-borne viruses.

Genomic organization and adaptive evolution of IGHC genes in marine mammals,"Immunoglobulins are important elements of the adaptive immune system that bind to an immense variety of microbial antigens to neutralize infectivity and specify effector functions. In the present study, the immunoglobulin heavy chain constant region (IGHC) genes from marine mammals were identified and compared with those of their terrestrial relatives to explore their genomic organization and evolutionary characteristics. The genomic organization of marine mammal IGHC genes was shown to be conservative with other eutherian mammals. Stronger signals of positive selection on IGHC were revealed in terrestrial mammals than that in marine mammals with the branch-site model, displaying different selective pressure, which might suggest their divergent adaptations to contrasted environments.","Immunoglobulins (Igs) are glycoprotein molecules that function as antibodies and are only expressed in jawed vertebrates (Flajnik and Kasahara, 2010) . Typically, Igs compose two identical heavy (IgH) and two identical light chains (IgL). Both heavy and light chains can be divided into two regions, i.e., the constant region and the variable region, based on the variability of amino acid sequences. In general, the variable region recognizes antigens, whereas the constant region specifies critical effector or signaling functions, such as phagocytosis, binding Fc (fragment crystallizable) receptors and activation of complement (Schroeder and Cavacini et al., 2010) . The classification of Igs is based on their heavy chain constant (IGHC) genes (Bengtén et al., 2000) . To date, several IgH isotypes, including IgM, IgD, IgG, IgE, and IgA, have been identified in multiple vertebrates, and they are encoded by the IGHM, IGHD, IGHG, IGHE and IGHA genes respectively (Schroeder and Cavacini et al., 2010) . Both IgM and IgD have been reported to be the most ancient IgH isotypes among jawed vertebrates, with IgM very conserved but IgD showing a high degree of structural and (presumably) functional diversity and even being lost in some species over evolutionary time (Sun et al., 2011; Ohta and Flajnik, 2006) . IgG and IgE are both exclusively present in mammals (Bengtén et al., 2000; Flajnik and Kasahara, 2010) , the former being the predominant serum antibody and binding receptors on phagocytic cells and the latter predominantly functioning in immunity against parasites (Maizels, 2005) . Additionally, IgA was found in reptiles first, with similar functions in all animals (Flajnik and Kasahara, 2010) . Participating in mucosal immunity, IgA coats pathogens to prevent proliferation and defend against local infection (Macpherson et al., 2008) .

Extant marine mammals descended from terrestrial ancestors that re-entered in the aquatic environment at different times (Uhen, 2010) . There are five main groups of extant marine mammals: Cetacea (dolphins, porpoises and whales), Sirenia (manatees, dugongs), Pinnipedia (walruses, sea lions and seals), polar bear (Ursus maritimus) and sea otter (Enhydra lutris) (Uhen, 2007) . Cetacea and Sirenia are the only known completely aquatic mammals, and they appeared to return to the aquatic environment at approximately the same time, i.e. ∼50 Mya (million years ago) (Uhen, 2010; Thewissen et al., 2007) . In contrast, semi-aquatic pinnipeds, with a close relationship to Musteloidea, later transferred to water environment at ∼28 Mya (Uhen, 2010; Flynn et al., 2005) . Despite the independent evolutionary origins of these marine mammals groups, they have developed a series of specializations for aquatic lifestyles, such as loss of hair, thickened blubber, derivation of echolocation, and so on (Uhen, 2007) .

During their transition from terrestrial environment to the sea, marine mammals must have faced dramatic changes in pathogens. Recent studies have shown that cetacean TLR4 and MHC were subjected to adaptive evolution, particularly in the lineages with dramatic habitat transition (e.g. the lineage leading to hippo + whale representing the early stage of aquatic adaptation) or rapid radiation lineages such as extant dolphins (Shen et al., 2012; Zhang et al., 2016) . However, the evolution of Ig in the aquatic adaptation of marine mammals remains poorly explored, except for a few reports about the cloning and sequencing of IGHC genes in bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) (Mancia et al., 2006 (Mancia et al., , 2007 Lundqvist et al., 2002) and the Florida manatee (Trichechus manatus latirostris) (Breaux et al., 2017) and the identification of IgM, IgG and IgA and lineage-specific IGHG gene duplication in some cetaceans (Mancia et al., 2006) , and so on. Therefore, in the present study, we first retrieved IGHC genes from the genomes of ten representative marine mammals. The genomic organization of IGHC cluster was identified and positive selection on the marine mammals was detected to address whether they experienced adaptive evolution in response to aquatic environments.

We first downloaded the IGHC genes of 13 terrestrial mammals, including cow (Bos taurus), pig (Sus scrofa), horse (Equus caballus), dog (Canis lupus familiaris), giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca), black flying fox (Pteropus alecto), little brown bat (Myotis lucifugus), human (Homo sapiens), rhesus monkey (Macaca mulatta), rat (Rattus norvegicus), rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus), opossum (Monodelphis domestica) and platypus (Ornithorhynchus anatinus) from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), Ensemble databases and the International ImMunoGeneTics information system (IMGT). The accession numbers of these sequences are compiled in Supplemental  Table 1 . Then we used IGHC sequences of these terrestrial relatives as a query to search for the orthologous genes from 10 marine mammal genomes with TBLASTN and BLASTN approaches, including bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus), killer whale (Orcinus orca), Yangtze finless porpoise (Neophocuena asiaeorientalis), baiji (Lipotes vexillifer), sperm whale (Physeter catodon), minke whale (Balaena acutorostrata), bowhead whale (Balaena mysticetus), Weddell seal (Leptonychotes weddellii), Pacific walrus (Odobenus rosmarus), and Florida manatee (Trichechus manatus latirostris). In addition, IGHC genes were also scanned from the genomes of three additional terrestrial mammals, i.e., hedgehog (Erinaceus europaeus), European shrew (Sorex araneus), and elephant (Loxodonta africana). The detailed information about the genome assemblies used in this study is given in Table 1 . Finally, we checked whether the newly identified putative IGHC genes were their best hit by a blast search against the non-redundant database from GenBank. The newly identified IGHC genes were further separated into intact genes, partial genes and pseudogenes based on the amino acid alignment and blast results. The genomic coordinates of the newly identified IGHC genes are listed in Supplemental Table 2 .

To confirm that the regions of alignment had sufficient confidence to test for positive selection and determine phylogenetic relationships, the unaligned multiple sequence alignment (MSA) of IGHC genes translated to amino-acid sequences and further back-translated into the corresponding codon were submitted to GUIDANCE (Penn et al., 2010a, b) to obtain alignment confidence scores. GUIDANCE used a PRANK alignment program (version 140,110) and returned a colored MSA that allowed to delimit aligned regions ambiguously. Then the columns with confidence scores lower than the threshold were excluded from further analyses.

Phylogenetic trees were reconstructed using Bayesian inference (BI) in MrBayes 3.2.2 (Huelsenbeck and Ronquist, 2001) and Maximum likelihood (ML) in RAxML 8.0.26 (Stamatakis, 2006) . The best-fit evolutionary model for each dataset was chosen by MrModeltest 2.3 (Nylander, 2004) with the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). Bayesian inference analysis was run for 10 6 generations with one cold and three heated Markov chains to ensure the analysis remaining in global rather than local optima and trees were sampled every 100 generations. The first 1000 trees were discarded as the ""burn-in"". Because the samples from the beginning of the chain are unreliable. For ML analysis, the maximum likelihood tree was reconstructed with 1000 bootstrap replications.

The rate of nonsynonymous (d N ) and synonymous (d S ) substitution (d N /d S or omega, ω) measures the direction and intensity of natural selection, with ω = 1, ω > 1 and ω < 1 indicating neutral evolution, positive and purifying selection, respectively. To detect the impact of natural selection on IGHC genes, we performed a number of statistical tests based on calculating the ω values using the CODEML program implemented in PAML 4.7 package (Yang, 2007) . The selection analyses using the gene tree reconstructed by BI and ML methods generated nearly the same results as those from the well-supported species phylogeny (Perelman et al., 2011; Zhou et al., 2011a) ; thus, only the latter analysis is shown here.

To detect positively selected sites on IGHC genes, we first performed the site specific models, i.e., M8a (nearly neutral, beta distribution: 0 < ω 0 < 1 and ω 1 = 1) versus M8 (positive selection, beta distribution: 0 < ω 0 < 1 and ω 1 > 1), as implemented in CODEML program. In addition, positively selected sites were identified using Datamonkey, which incorporated the rate of synonymous substitution, whereas the d S was fixed in PAML. Three ML methods, i.e. the single likelihood ancestor counting (SLAC), fixed-effect likelihood (FEL), and random-effect likelihood (REL) implemented in the Datamonkey website (Pond and Frost, 2005a) , were used to infer the positively selected sites with default settings and significance levels of 0.1, 0.1, and 50, respectively. Although SLAC, a conservative method, is suitable for large data sets, it usually underestimates the substitution rate. FEL method seems to capture the pattern of rate variation better than SLAC and REL, but it tends to be less conservative than SLAC to detect selection in data sets of intermediate size. REL approach is more powerful than SLAC and FEL, but it has the higher rates of false positives for small data sets (Pond and Frost, 2005a,b) . These three predictions were conducted to estimating ω value of each site.

To further detect whether the possibility of positive selection was limited on specific lineages, we compared the free-ratio model, which estimated a separate ω ratio for each lineage, with the one-ratio model that estimated a same ω ratio for all lineages in the tree (Yang, 1998) . In addition, the branch-site model were conducted to detect evidence of positive selection on individual codon along a specific lineage (Zhang et al., 2005) . In branch-site model, we compared Ma (positive selection, 0 < ω 0 < 1, ω 1 = 1 and ω 2 ≥ 1) with Ma0 (neutral selection, 0 < ω 0 < 1, ω 1 = 1 and ω 2 = 1) to detect positive selection. The significance of the differences between two nested models was tested using likelihood ratio tests (LRT) statistic (-2[LogLikelihood1-LogLike-lihood2]) with a chi-square distribution. Bayes Empirical Bayes (BEB) approach implemented in the CODEML was used to test the posterior probabilities (PPs) of positively selected sites, where sites with PPs > 0.90 were considered as candidates undergoing positive selection. Finally, to support the PAML results, we employed a complementary protein-level approach implemented in TreeSAAP (Woolley et al., 2003) that detected the significant changes in amino acid physicochemical properties.

In the present study, we retrieved IGHC genes from the genomes of ten marine mammals (including seven cetaceans, one manatee and two pinnipeds) and compared them with those of terrestrial relatives to provide insights into the evolution of IGHC genes in marine mammals. We found that the genomic regions containing an IGHC cluster are conservative with special flanking sequences, i.e., the TMEM121 and IGH diversity gene cluster (Eguchi-Ogawa et al., 2012) , which helped us obtain the complete IGHC genes in mammalian genomes. A total of 182 IGHC genes were identified in the 26 mammals in our study (Fig. 1) , including 79 sequences that were newly identified in 13 species. For the 10 marine mammals, a total of 59 sequences were identified in this study.

To define the orthologous relationships among IGHC genes, we reconstructed phylogenetic trees for each gene, as well as a phylogenetic tree incorporating all members of IGHC genes from 26 mammals using two different methods (BI and ML). Similar tree topologies were inferred (Fig. 2, Supplemental Figs. 1-11) . The phylogenetic relationship showed that the IGHC genes of marine mammals could be clustered well with those of their terrestrial relatives, suggesting that marine mammals possess the typical isotype repertoire as other eutherian mammals. Similar to other mammals, marine mammals were found to contain a single IGHM, IGHD, IGHE, and IGHA genes, and several IGHG genes based on the phylogenetic reconstruction. The order of IGHC genes in the IgH locus of marine mammals was determined to be 5′-IGHM-IGHD-IGHG-IGHE-IGHA-3′, which is in agreement with their terrestrial relatives (Supplemental Fig. 12) . Furthermore, we found that the first domain (CH1) of IGHM and the CH1 of IGHD of cetaceans shared nearly identical sequences, as shown in artiodactylas (Zhao et al., 2002) (Supplemental Fig. 13 ). The genomic organization of marine mammal IGHC genes is similar to that of other species examined, which suggested a constraint acting on their genomic arrangement and the conserved genomic organization of the IGHC genes.

The expansion of the IgG subclass is primarily a feature of mammals (Hsu et al., 2006) . The IgG-like Igs of chicken and lizard showed no subclass diversification (Butler et al., 2011) . The gene duplication of IGHG genes is believed to have occurred most recently, and it belongs to a lineage-specific event (Wagner et al., 2002) . In the present study, we found that there are usually two or four IGHG genes in marine mammals (Fig. 1) . Like other mammals, the IGHG gene in marine mammals comprises three CH domains and a hinge segment. Furthermore, they have close sequence similarities to the IGHG genes in their terrestrial relatives. Based on the phylogenetic tree, it was found that IGHG genes within one species clustered together rather than with those of other species (Fig. 2) . However, the IGHG genes of five species grouped together with their true orthologues in closely related species, including bottlenose dolphin, killer whale, Yangtze finless porpoise, Weddell seal and Pacific walrus, likely due to the species of Delphinidae (e.g., dolphin, killer whale) rapidly diverging during a very narrow time frame of ∼3 million years (Zhou et al., 2011b) from the last common ancestral IGHG genes. These observations provided evidence to support the view that species-specific duplication of IGHG genes occurred during the evolution of mammalian species (Wagner et al., 2002) . Overall, the presence of IgG subclasses and species-specific duplication of IGHG genes in marine mammals further confirmed the finding that IGHC genes of marine mammals fit the canonical pattern of their terrestrial relatives.

The number of IGHC genes has been noted to vary among different mammals. For example, 2 IGHA genes were present in humans and platypuses (Mage et al., 2006) , whereas 13 IGHA genes were found in rabbits (Mccallum et al., 2004) . For IGHG genes, seven copies were found in horses (Wagner et al., 2004) , five in humans (Takahashi et al., 1982) , and only one in rabbits (Mage et al., 2006) and opossum . No IGHG gene was detected in the bowhead whale and little brown bat (Fig. 1) , which may due to the bad genomic assembly of both species considering that IgG subclasses have been identified in other whales (Mancia et al., 2006) and partial sequence encoding of IgG in little brown bat (Myotis lucifugus) was recovered by PCR (Butler et al., 2011) . We also failed to retrieve IGHD genes from the genomes of sperm whale, hedgehog, European shrew, little brown bat, black flying fox and elephant despite considerable efforts (Fig. 1) . One possible explanation is the poor genome quality, and the an alternative explanation is that the IGHD gene might have really been lost in evolution, similar to the situation in opossums ) and rabbits (Mage et al., 2006) . Further investigations to recover IGHD transcript by PCR will be needed in the future. Despite necessary further verification of IGHC genes in some species(e.g. with transcript evidence), changes in the copy number of IGHC genes among different mammalian lineages might reflect the rapid evolution of Ig genes (Hsu et al., 2006) , corresponding to the marked variability found in the pathogens in different environments.

To detect the possible roles of positive selection during the evolution of IGHC genes in mammalian lineages, evolutionary analyses were conducted using a series of selection models implemented in the CODEML program and DataMonkey website. Because of the absence of intact IGHD genes in many mammals and the species-specific duplication of IGHG genes, only datasets of the IGHM, IGHE and IGHA genes were used to test the selection. Site model analysis of all mammals revealed that the models incorporating positive selection (M8) fit the data significantly better than the neutral model (M8a) for both the IGHM and IGHA genes, whereas no evidence of positive selection was identified at the IGHE genes (Table 2) . Specially, M8 model detected nine positively selective sites at the IGHM and IGHA genes, whereas a total of 39 codons from the IGHM, IGHE and IGHA genes were also found to be under positive selection using the FEL, REL, and SLAC methods implemented in Datamonkey. Eleven codons from three genes (5 in IGHM, 2 in IGHE, 4 in IGHA) were predicted to be robust sites under positive selection identified by at least two ML methods. Furthermore, TreeSAAP analysis showed that these 11 positively selected sites have undergone radical changes in their physicochemical properties (Table 3) , and this may be regarded as another evidence to support significant positive selection. Then, we marked the putatively selected sites in the alignment and found that 36.4% (4/11) of these sites were located in, or close to, the functionally important regions of IGHC genes (Supplemental Fig. 14) . This result suggested that positive selection on mammals may be the major driving force for the evolution of IGHC genes to adapt to environmental pathogens. Besides, for expanded subclasses, such as the 13 IGHA genes of rabbit and multiple copies of IGHG gene in mammals, we tested whether this species-specific expansion has been influenced by positive selection. The site model analysis (M8 vs. M8a, M1a vs. M2a implemented in PAML) showed that the IGHA genes of rabbits were under positive selection with similar positively selected sites (Supplemental Table 3 ). The branch-site model was used to examine whether some branches leading to gene duplication of IGHG genes (branch a-o) have been positively selected. The results showed that signals of positive selection were detected in branches a (Delphinoidea), c (Physeter catodon), e (Bos taurus), f (Sus scrofa), g (Equus caballus), and h (Macaca mulatta) (Supplemental Table 4 , Supplemental Fig. 15 ). Overall, pervasive positive selection was detected on IGHC genes of mammals.

As is well known, many physicochemical properties, such as temperature, pressure, illumination and osmotic pressure, are different between water and land environments, possibly causing the difference in the diversity and abundance of pathogens. To date, there has been no deterministic conclusion on whether the pathogenic microbes in marine environment or in terrestrial environment are more diverse. Some early studies have supported weaker pathogenic pressure in the water environment (Zhang et al., 2016; Trowsdale et al., 1989; Slade, 1992) , while several recent studies have examined the microbiome of marine mammals, suggesting that although the taxonomic composition of microbial communities in marine mammals is distinct from those of terrestrial mammals, its diversity is not lower than that of terrestrial mammals (Bik et al., 2016; Nelson et al., 2015) .

To further test whether marine and terrestrial mammals were subjected to different pathogenic pressures during their evolution, we used the branch model in our study. The LRTs showed that the free-ratio model fits better than one-ratio model for IGHM, IGHE and IGHA genes, indicating heterogeneous selective pressures on different lineages. The ω values greater than 1 are limited to some branches in marine and terrestrial mammals, including the terminal branch of minke whale, the last common ancestral (LCA) branch of baleen whales, the LCA branch of Glires, and the LCA branch of Euarchontoglires at IGHA gene; the terminal branch of bowhead whale, and the LCA branch of Eulipotyphla at IGHE genes; the LCA branch of Laurasiatheria at IGHM gene (Fig. 1) , suggesting similar selective pressures acting on IGHC genes in marine and terrestrial mammals. This result could provide evidence to support that the diversity and abundance of pathogens in water was comparable to that in land.

We also used more stringent branch-site model to predict positive selection acting on specific sites in each lineage. Almost all signs of positive selection were identified in terrestrial lineages (e.g., artiodactyla, perissodactyla, chiroptera, eulipotyphla, primates, Glires, Fig. 1 . Positive selection at IGHC genes across the mammal phylogeny and the presence/absence patterns of mammal IGHC genes. A widely accepted phylogeny of mammals was used for selective pressure analysis in the free ratio model and the branch-site model. The branches indicated by vertical lines or circles show evidence of undergoing positive selection. The red font indicates marine mammals; black font indicates terrestrial mammals. The IGHC genes of corresponding species were listed in the right part of Fig. 1 . Each circle represents a gene member; circles represent a complete gene sequence; semicircles indicate a partial gene sequence; red cross means no sequences found by TBLASTN and BLASTN approaches; black cross means the gene really lost; the species highlighted with a black line mean a pseudogene. Table 4 ). By contrast, for marine mammal lineages, only the terminal branch of Florida manatee was subjected to positive selection (Fig. 1, Supplemental Table 4 ). This result supported that pathogenic pressure was weaker in aquatic environment than in terrestrial environment. Moreover, recent studies showed a very low number of variable genes that directly binds to antigens in marine mammals, which also supported this conclusion (Olivieri et al., 2014) . But further study on the variable region will be needed, providing insights to understand whether the difference in selective pressure between marine and terrestrial mammals existed and whether such a difference could respond to the different pathogenic pressure between aquatic and land environments.

In the present study, IGHC genes were determined to have undergone positive selection in Chiroptera, which is now known as notorious reservoir hosts for a number of pathogenic viruses, including Nipah, Hendra, Ebola, and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) responsible for severe human and livestock disease outbreaks. However, they rarely display clinical symptoms (Zhang et al., 2013; Wang, 2009 ). The ability of bats to coexist with viruses presents an interesting immunological problem. Previous studies have founded that some immunoglobulin gene superfamilies underwent expansion in Brandt's bat (Seim et al., 2013) and that some positively selected genes were involved in the immune response (Zhang et al., 2013) . Thus, IGHC genes subject to positive selection in chiropterans may be related to the longterm coexistence of bats and viruses. Evidences for positive selection has also been detected in some domesticated mammals such as pig, horse and cattle. Approximately 10,000 years ago, the domestication of farm animals by selection for biological, agricultural and biomedical importance began, leading to animals that slowly adapted to local condition. Approximately 200 years ago, selection pressures on livestock increased with the rise of the concept of breeds (Taberlet et al., 2008) . It has been previously proposed that artificial selection indirectly drove for rapid adaptation of domestic animals and pathogen genes (Smith et al., 2012) . Therefore, we postulated that artificial selection resulted in the adaptive evolution observed in IGHC genes of domestic animals.

This study has provided the first characterization of IGHC genes in marine mammals and explored their potential molecular genetic basis in the secondary aquatic adaptation. Our analyses revealed that the IGHC genes in marine mammals fit the canonical pattern of their terrestrial relatives. In addition, different levels of selection were detected between marine and terrestrial mammalian lineages with the branchsite model, suggesting a divergent adaptation to land and aquatic environments probably due to contrasting pathogenic pressures. Further investigation on the variable region of IgH genes is necessary to improve our understanding of the immune adaptation of marine mammals.

Animal virus ecology and evolution are shaped by the virus host-body,"12 The current classification of animal viruses primarily relates to the virus molecular world, the 13 genomic architecture and the corresponding host-cell infection cycle. This virus centered 14 perspective does not make allowance for the precept that virus fitness hinges on the virus 15 transmission success. Virus transmission reflects the infection-shedding-transmission 16 dynamics and, with it, the organ system involvement and other, macroscopic dimensions of 17 the host environment. This study examines the transmission ecology of the world main 18 livestock viruses, 36 in total, belonging to eleven different families, and a mix of RNA, DNA 19 and retroviruses.

Still, there is growing 34 awareness that viruses as biological replicators are subjected to ecological sorting and so 35 require a viable propagation strategy. In the current analysis I depart from the precept that 36 virus fitness hinges on the virus transmission success. I examine the transmission ecologies 37 of the world main livestock viruses, 36 in total, a collection of pathogens well described in 38 terms of the organ system involvement, infection course, the extent of host damage, virus 39 shedding profile, and virus transmission modes. The viruses are on this basis ranked in an 40 outer-to inner-body fashion, virtually.

Comparative analysis of rodent and small mammal viromes to better understand the wildlife origin of emerging infectious diseases,"Background: Rodents represent around 43% of all mammalian species, are widely distributed, and are the natural reservoirs of a diverse group of zoonotic viruses, including hantaviruses, Lassa viruses, and tick-borne encephalitis viruses. Thus, analyzing the viral diversity harbored by rodents could assist efforts to predict and reduce the risk of future emergence of zoonotic viral diseases. Results: We used next-generation sequencing metagenomic analysis to survey for a range of mammalian viral families in rodents and other small animals of the orders Rodentia, Lagomorpha, and Soricomorpha in China. We sampled 3,055 small animals from 20 provinces and then outlined the spectra of mammalian viruses within these individuals and the basic ecological and genetic characteristics of novel rodent and shrew viruses among the viral spectra. Further analysis revealed that host taxonomy plays a primary role and geographical location plays a secondary role in determining viral diversity. Many viruses were reported for the first time with distinct evolutionary lineages, and viruses related to known human or animal pathogens were identified. Phylogram comparison between viruses and hosts indicated that host shifts commonly happened in many different species during viral evolutionary history. Conclusions: These results expand our understanding of the viromes of rodents and insectivores in China and suggest that there is high diversity of viruses awaiting discovery in these species in Asia. These findings, combined with our previous bat virome data, greatly increase our knowledge of the viral community in wildlife in a densely populated country in an emerging disease hotspot.","Approximately two thirds of emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) that affect humans originate from bats, rodents, birds, and other wildlife [1] [2] [3] . In many of these reservoir host species, emerging viruses appear to be well adapted, with little or no evidence of clinical disease. However, when these viruses spill over into humans, the effects can sometimes be devastating [4] [5] [6] . Previously, our limited knowledge of the viral population and ecological diversity harbored by wildlife have complicated the study of EIDs. Thus, comprehensive understanding of the viral community present in wildlife, as well as the prevalence, genetic diversity, and geographical distribution of these viruses, could be valuable for prevention and control of wildlife-origin EIDs [7] .

The order Rodentia is the largest mammalian order, with 33 families and 2,277 species (~43% of all mammal species). They live in close contact with humans and their domestic animals and act as a bond between humans, domestic animals, arthropod vectors (ticks, mites, fleas), and other wildlife [8] [9] [10] . This interface with humans has led to the rodent origin of important zoonotic viruses including members of the family Arenaviridae, Hantaviridae, Reoviridae, Togaviridae, Picornaviridae, and Flaviviridae [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] . Many of these viruses cause severe disease in humans (e.g., Lassa virus; tick-borne encephalitis virus, TBEV; lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, LCMV; Sin Nombre virus; Hantaan virus, HTNV; Seoul virus, SEOV; and Puumala virus); have only recently been discovered (e.g., Whitewater Arroyo virus and Lujo virus); or appear to have a wider geographical range than originally thought (e.g., Junin virus, Guanarito virus, Machupo virus, and Sabia virus), suggesting that further viral discovery studies in wild rodent populations may be valuable for public health [8, 11-13, 15, 19-25] . Recent reports of rodent viruses have enabled new hypotheses regarding the evolution of hepaciviruses and the origin of coronaviruses (CoVs) and picornaviruses (PicoVs) such as hepatitis A virus [26] [27] [28] [29] .

China is a megadiversity country and harbors~200 rodent species from 12 families [30] . To develop baseline data on the origin of existing viral EIDs and identify other potential zoonotic viral reservoir hosts, we have conducted a series of viral surveys from rodents, bats, and other small animals and have simultaneously constructed online viral databases of these animals (DBatVir and DRodVir, http://www.mgc.ac.cn/) since 2010 [31] [32] [33] [34] . In the current study, 3,055 small mammal individuals of 55 species from the orders Rodentia, Lagomorpha, and Soricomorpha across China were sampled by pharyngeal and anal swabbing. Virome analysis was then conducted to outline the viral spectrum within these samples. On the basis of virome data, we describe the community, genetics, evolution, and ecological distribution characteristics of viruses and determined whether these features change with their host species and locations. The identification of novel mammal viruses provides new clues in the search for the origin or evolution pattern of human or animal pathogens such as hantaviruses (HVs), arenavirus (AreVs), CoVs, and arteriviruses (ArteVs).

Pharyngeal and anal swabs were collected from 3,055 individual small mammals captured from July 2013 to July 2016 in 20 provinces across China ( Fig. 1a and Additional file 1: Table S1 ). These comprised 50 rodent species of the families Muridae, Cricetidae, Sciuridae, Dipodidae, Chinchillidae, and Gliridae; two lagomorphs of the family Ochotonidae; and three soricomorphs of the family Soricidae that reside in urban, rural, and wild areas throughout China. The most common species sampled were Apodemus agrarius, Niviventer confucianus, Rattus norvegicus, Rattus tanezumi, Rattus losea, and Sorex araneus. Due to repeated sampling of some species in the same location, swabs were combined into 110 pools for analysis.

A total of 65.6 GB of nucleotide data (693,985,331 valid reads, 100 bp in length) was obtained. Reads classified as eukaryotes or prokaryotes and those with no significant similarity to any amino acid (aa) sequence in the NR database were discarded, leading to 12,073,729 reads best matched with viral protein sequences in the NR database (~1.7% of the total sequence reads). The number of virus-associated reads in each lane varied between 2,774 and 658,417.

A wide range of DNA and RNA virus groups were covered by these reads. Virus-associated reads were assigned into 70 families of double-stranded (ds)DNA viruses, dsRNA viruses, retro-transcribing viruses, single-stranded (ss)DNA viruses, and ssRNA viruses in the virus root (Additional file 1: Table S2 ). Dietary habits and other host traits were used to exclude insect viruses, fungal viruses, plant viruses, and phages as described previously [31] . The remaining 7,148,634 sequence reads (~59.2% of the total viral hits) were assigned into 23 families of mammalian viruses (Additional file 1: Tables S3 and Additional file 2:  Table S14 ). The prevalence diagram of each viral family related to province, animal species, and reads number was shown in Fig. 1b . The relative abundances of the 23 viral families in pooled samples of different provinces and animals were calculated by normalizing sequence reads and were shown in Fig. 1c . Viral reads from the families Herpesviridae, Picobirnaviridae, Anelloviridae, Circoviridae, Retroviridae, Astroviridae, Coronaviridae, and Picornaviridae, and the subfamily Parvovirinae, were widely distributed in different animal species from different regions of China. Viral reads from the families Adenoviridae, Poxviridae, Papillomaviridae, Reoviridae, Arenaviridae, Arteriviridae, Hantaviridae, Caliciviridae, Flaviviridae, Hepeviridae, Rhabdoviridae, and Paramyxoviridae were found in fewer species. Many of the sequence reads related to mammalian viruses showed low nucleotide (nt) and aa sequence identity with known viruses.

The abundance of virus strains in these mammalian viral families was further confirmed on a sample-by-sample basis by PCR screening. In total, 586 positive results were obtained, and 203 viruses from representative positive samples (representative virus strains represent viruses with identical or almost identical sequences (≥ 97% nt identity) from the same host species at the same location) were selected for genomic or partial genomic sequencing as quasi-species of these viruses (Additional file 1: Table S4 ). According to the genus and species demarcation criteria in each viral family established by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV; https://talk.ictvonline.org/), these viruses may represent 160 new species and at least seven new genera. Although sequence reads apparently from the families Hepadnaviridae and Poxviridae were occasionally present in some of the samples, it was not possible to amplify viral sequences from these samples, likely due to low viral loads. No virus was detected from samples of lagomorphs, this finding may reveal that the virome of lagomorphs is far less abundant than that of rodents and soricomorphs.

By classifying all positive results into each viral family and host genus and then normalizing the virus number according to the sampling number of each host genus, our analysis revealed significant differences among hosts in terms of virus composition and abundance (Fig. 2a) . Animals of the families Muridae and Cricetidae acted as major reservoirs for diverse mammalian viruses in China. Although HVs were detected in animals of the families Muridae, Cricetidae, Dipodidae, and Soricidae, most of them were of low abundance when compared with other RNA viruses. AreVs were only detected in animals of the families Muridae and Dipodidae with low abundance, and ArteVs were only detected in animals of the families Cricetidae and Dipodidae with low abundance. Animals of the family Muridae and the subfamily Arvicolinae were the main hosts of CoVs and astroviruses (AstVs) with high viral richness. Notably, although limited samples from animals of the family Dipodidae were collected (73 animals from four species) for virome analysis, Allactaga and Dipus still harbored diverse viruses with high abundance.

To further describe the viral diversity and abundance differences among geographical locations, the virus number of each family was assigned and normalized by the sample size in each province (Fig. 2b) . Since many host rodent species such as Rattus and Apodemus Table S1 . b The prevalence diagram of each viral family related to province, animal species, and reads number.

The species are listed in the right text column. Location information is provided in the life text column. The names of the mammalian viral families are presented in the top text row. The boxes colored from green to red represent the viral reads, which were normalized by average viral genome size and total sequencing reads in each pool species are broadly distributed throughout China, most RNA and DNA viruses with high (e.g., CoVs, AstVs, and PicoVs) or low (e.g., HVs and parvoviruses (ParVs)) richness were detected in diverse locations throughout China and showed no obvious geographical preference (except some regions that harbored unusual host species showed geographical restriction of certain viruses). However, ArteVs and flaviviruses tended to be frequently detected in provinces in the north, west, and middle of China with low or medium abundance, and such viruses were not detected in southern and coastal areas. In contrast, except Dipus-related AreVs detected in Inner Mongolia and showed distinct genome sequence, all other Old World AreVs were only present in three southern areas, Yunnan, Hunan, and Zhejiang.

An L-segment-based, pan-HV PCR was used to sequence HVs. A total of 32 samples from 11 provinces were positive for HV (Additional file 1: Table S4 ). In rodents, PCR products of the expected size were amplified from Niviventer confucianus, Apodemus peninsulae, Apodemus agrarius, and Rattus norvegicus of the family Muridae, Myodes rutilus, Microtus gregalis, and Caryomys eva; Eothenomys melanogaster of the family Cricetidae; and Dipus sagitta of the family Dipodidae. In Soricomorpha insectivores, expected PCR products were obtained from Sorex araneus of the family Soricidae. Thirteen representative viral strains of the 32 positive results were selected for phylogenetic analysis (Fig. 3a) . Eight viruses from three rodent families were assigned into phylogroup III. Four viruses clustered in the HTNV clade, and two viruses clustered in the SEOV clade, with high sequence similarities (95-99% aa identities). RtDs-HV/IM2014 identified from Dipus sagitta was located between HTNVs and SEOVs (85-93% aa identities). Shrew-HV/SX2014 was located outside the rodent HV clade within this phylogroup. Four Fig. 3 a Phylogenetic tree based on the partial L protein sequences of HVs. b Phylogenetic tree based on the complete L proteins of AreVs. The viruses found in this study are labeled in red font. The evolutionary lineages of involved hosts on the right were drawn based on mt-cyt b from genus to family according to previous reports [7, 9, [68] [69] [70] . The relationships between viruses and their hosts were linked by red lines viruses of cricetids were assigned to phylogroup IV and comprised Puumala virus and Tula virus (97% aa identity with known viruses), and two viruses, RtCe-HV/NX2015 and RtCl-HV/GZ2015, which formed a separate clade with < 90% aa identity with any other viruses from phylogroup IV. Another shrew HV, Shrew-HV/Tibet2014, was located in phylogroup I.

Nineteen rodent samples from Zhejiang, Hunan, Yunnan, and Inner Mongolia were positive for AreVs. Six strains were selected for genome sequencing and further analyses (Additional file 1: Table S4 ), and all were assigned to the Old World complex (Fig. 3b , Additional file 3: Figures S1 and S2 ). Four viruses identified from Rattus tanezumi, Rattus norvegicus, and Rattus losea captured in Zhejiang, Hunan, and Yunnan clustered in the Wenzhou virus (WENV) clade with high sequence similarity (87-89% aa identities for L, 93% for G, and 95% for N, Additional file 1: Table S5 ). RtMc-AreV/ YN2014 from Mus caroli was distant from other AreVs and clustered with DANV and LCMVs with short branch lengths. RtDs-AreV/IM2014 of Dipus sagitta appeared to represent a separate evolution being distant from all other AreVs in the Old World complex.

Twelve rodent samples of six species from six provinces were positive for ArteVs. Seven strains were determined for genome sequences (Additional file 1: Table S4 ). Five virus strains identified from Microtus clarkei, Eothenomys inez, Eothenomys melanogaster, Myodes rufocanus, and Cricetulus longicaudatus in five provinces appeared to be closely related to porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) with higher sequence similarity than those with other members of the family Arteriviridae (60.1-73.7% versus 25.7-54.2% aa identity for ORF1b, compared with equine arteritis virus, lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus (LDV) of mice, simian hemorrhagic fever virus, and wobbly possum disease virus; Additional file 1: Table S6 ). The other two viruses detected in Dipus sagitta showed low sequence similarity with known ArteVs (25.2-55.9% aa identity for ORF1b, Additional file 1: Table S6 ). Genomic structure and phylogenetic analysis (Fig. 4a , Additional file 3: Figures S3 and S4 ) indicated that four of the five PRRSV-related viruses were assigned into the PRRSV species as an intermediate between genotype 1 and 2. Furthermore, these four viruses showed a closer relationship to genotype 2 than genotype 1 in the PRRSV species. RtClan-Arterivirus/GZ2015 clustered with the clade of PRRSV species but appeared to represent a separate evolutionary lineage. The other two ArteVs identified from Dipus sagitta in Inner Mongolia formed separate branches that were evolutionarily distant from all known members of the Arteriviridae.

A total of 35 rodent samples were identified as containing members of the family Flaviviridae. Eleven strains (five hepaciviruses, five PestVs, and one TBEV) were selected for genome sequencing (Additional file 1: Table  S4 ). The five novel rodent hepaciviruses were assigned into different clades under the genus Hepacivirus with varied sequence similarity to other rodent hepaciviruses (14.1-65.6% aa identities; Fig 4b and Additional file 1: Table S7 ) [27] . The five PestVs showed low sequence similarity with known PestVs from artiodactylid hosts (< 40% aa identity) and formed a distinct novel rodent virus lineage distant from all other members of the genus Pestivirus. A TBEV, RtMg-TBEV/XJ2015 in Microtus gregalis from Xinjiang, showed high (> 99%) nt and aa identities with known TBEV found in ticks (Ixodes scapularis) in Xinjiang (Additional file 3: Figure S5 ).

Thirty-one rodent samples were HEV positive, and the genome sequences of nine viruses were confirmed (Additional file 1: Table S4 ). All had < 44.5% aa homology in ORF1 compared with HEVs from other hosts ( Fig. 4c and Additional file 1: Table S8 ). These nine viruses comprised five lineages; all of which represented novel clades of rodent HEVs, except lineage 4 which contained two novel rodent HEVs and known rat HEVs.

One hundred and eighteen rodent samples and five Sorex araneus samples were identified as CoV positive; 35 strains were selected for sequencing of partial RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), and 12 strains were characterized for genome sequences (Additional file 1: Table S4 ). Pairwise similarity and phylogenetic analysis ( Fig. 5a and Additional file 3: Figure S6 ) revealed that 29 viruses formed diverse evolutionary clades in lineage A under the genus Betacoronavirus, with sequence identities between 88.1 and 98.9% (RdRp aa identity). The other six viruses were all assigned to the genus Alphacoronavirus; five of these clustering as a rodent-borne clade within the Alphacoronavirus genus, with sequence identities between 98.4 and 98.8% (RdRp aa identity). One virus, Shrew-CoV/Tibet2014, identified in Sorex araneus from Tibet appeared to have undergone separate evolution, phylogenetically distant from all other α-CoVs with < 66.0% RdRp aa identity (Additional file 1: Tables S9 and S10).

Sixty rodent samples were identified as PicoV positive, and 23 strains underwent genome sequencing (Additional file 1: Table S4 ) [14] . Rodent Table S10 ). Viruses closely related to known PicoVs of other hosts were found (e.g., rodent viruses related to human aichivirus, human rosavirus, and bovine hunnivirus) [14] .

A larger number of AstVs were detected in both rodent and shrew samples (Additional file 1: Table S4 ). Fifty-five AstVs were selected for sequencing. Most of the rodent AstVs sequenced belonged to four main genetic lineages 1 to 4 within the genus Mamastrovirus and had less sequence similarity with AstVs in other hosts (Fig. 5c) . One rodent AstV, RtRn-AstV-1/GD2015, was closely related to AstVs of cattle, deer, and pigs with > 90% nt identity. Two shrew AstVs, Shrew-AstV/ SAX2015 and Shrew-AstV/GX2016, were related to mouse AstV with~70% nt identity in the genus Mamastrovirus. Lineage 5 contained one shrew AstV and one mouse AstV, with 79% nt identity with each other. Lineage 5 branched out of the genus Mamastrovirus and showed a closer relationship with the genus Avastrovius.

All reads of ParaVs from different rodent species were closely related to previously reported Beilong or Tailam viruses [35] [36] [37] . We obtained full-length sequence of RtAp-ParaV/ NX2015 from Apodemus peninsulae, which we assigned to Jeilongvirus close to the Beilong and Tailam virus clade (74.2-79.2% aa identities for L) (Additional file 3: Figure S7 and Additional file 1: Table S12 ).

We characterized Shrew-CalV/Tibet2014 in Sorex araneus as a novel species of the genus Norovirus with 34.5-51.2% aa identities with known Noroviruses (Additional file 3: Figure S8 ). The most closely related murine norovirus that was classified as genogroup V showed 51.2% aa identity with this shrew CalV. c Phylogenetic tree based on the complete ORF1 sequences of HEVs. The viruses found in this study are labeled in red font. The evolutionary lineages of involved hosts on the right were drawn based on mt-cyt b from genus to family according to previous reports [7, 9, [68] [69] [70] . The relationships between viruses and their hosts were linked by red lines

Thirty-three CV-positive samples were confirmed, and 18 CV strains were identified for genome sequencing (Additional file 1: Table S4 ). Pairwise alignment and phylogenetic analysis suggested that 10 of these belonged to the genera Circovirus and Cyclovirus. The other eight novel rodent or shrew CVs branched out of the root of the genera Circovirus and Cyclovirus (Fig. 6a) .

Twenty-eight ParV-positive samples were identified, and 16 virus strains were selected for genome sequencing (Additional file 1: Table S4 ). These viruses clustered phylogenetically with Bocaparvovirus, Dependoparvovirus, Amdoparvovirus, and Protoparvovirus (Fig. 6b) . Eight rodent ParVs clustered together and formed a novel lineage of Rodent Bocavirus under the genus Bocaparvovirus, with < 57.0% aa identity with bocaviruses of other hosts. Three ParVs were classified in the genus Protoparvovirus but formed novel evolutionary clades. One ParV was clustered with mink parvovirus (82.7% aa identity) under the genus Amdoparvovirus. The other four ParVs formed two lineages under the genus Dependoparvovirus with < 63.1% aa identity with known adeno-associated virus (Additional file 1: Table S13 ).

Thirty-one samples were AdV positive (Additional file 1: Table S4 ), and seven strains were selected for sequencing of partial DNA polymerase gene. Two rodent AdVs clustered with previously reported murine AdVs (MAdV-1, MAdV-2, and MAdV-3; 59.7-76.6% aa identities, Additional file 3: Figure S9 ) [38, 39] . Three rodent AdVs formed a separate genetic lineage within Mastadenovirus. Two shrew AdVs were also identified; one closely related to previously reported tree shrew AdV-1 and another located in a novel lineage related to Bat AdV-FBV1.

RtAc-PV/GZ2015 in Apodemus chevrieri and RtRn-PV/ GD2014 in Rattus norvegicus were full-length sequenced (Additional file 1: Table S4 ). These two rodent viruses showed high sequence similarities with known rodent PVs from Apodemus sylvaticus and Rattus norvegicus in Germany (90% and 100% aa identities) [40, 41] . 

When we mapped the viral phylogram to the evolutionary lineages of their hosts (Figs. 3 and 4, Additional file 3: Figures S10-S14), co-evolution or co-divergence between viruses and their rodent and insectivore hosts were observed in most cases such as HVs, AreVs, ArteVs, and HEVs. Most viruses in each family tended to form different lineages that were phylogenetically consistent with the phylogeny of their hosts from species to family. For example, the division of HV phylogroups was congruent with the phylogenies of their Arvicolinae, Sigmodontinae, Murinae, and Soricidae hosts; the separation of AreVs in the old world complex was congruent with the phylogenies of their Murinae and Dipodidae hosts. However, virus phylogeny was not always consistent with host phylogeny, and multiple incongruous relationships between the phylogenies of hosts and viruses were also found. For example, Dipus sagitta and RtDs-HV/IM2014, Rattus tanezumi and RtRf-AstV-2/YN2013, Cricetulus species and their HEVs, and rodent species and many of their hepaciviruses and PicoVs were phylogenetically incongruent. These suggested that host shifts seem to be common for several virus phylogenetic lineages.

Novel EIDs from animal reservoirs pose an increasing threat to global health and security. Comprehensive knowledge of the viral population and ecological community resident in animal reservoirs, especially in wildlife, could minimize the impact of potential animaloriginated EIDs on public health by providing meaningful basic data [3, 32] . A predictive analysis based on host and viral traits conducted by Olival et al. revealed that the present observed viral richness of wildlife is limited, and there is still an alarming number of ""missing viruses"" and ""missing zoonotic viruses"" that merit further systematic surveillance globally, especially in rodents, primates, and bats [7] .

By firstly characterizing the pharyngeal and anal viromes of representative rodents and other small mammals throughout China, the present study identified many novel viruses from rodents and insectivores. When added to our recent work on bats [31, 32] , the present results suggest that there is rich as-yet-undiscovered viral diversity in rodents, bats, insectivores, and other mammalian species in China. Viral diversity among different mammalian hosts is strikingly different. The presence of a large number of diverse RNA and DNA viruses with high prevalence and abundance highlights that both rodents and soricomorphs can tolerate diverse viruses, as we described previously in bats [32] . Animals in northern and western regions show similar or even higher viral diversity when compared with those of animals in central and southern areas of China. A recent report showed that Central and Southern China with higher human population density may have a high estimated risk of zoonotic EID events based on previous data [42] . Here, the identification of diverse viruses and even pathogen-related viruses in Northern and Western China indicates that the risk of EIDs originating from wildlife in these regions should not be underestimated.

In addition to the viral family-specific findings discussed below, our study has some potentially broad implications. First, we have characterized diverse HVs, AreVs, aeteriviruses, picobirnaviruses, CoVs, hepaciviruses, PestVs, PicoVs, HEVs, AstVs, herpesviruses, anelloviruses, AdVs, CVs, and ParVs, extending our knowledge for members of each viral family, and identifying new viral genera and species, albeit that the role of some viruses in human illness is unclear [43, 44] . Second, we showed that rodent species carry more viruses than previously thought (e.g., identification of viruses of the genera Bocaparvovirus and Pestivirus), extending the known host range of the viral family and suggesting that rodents should be considered potential carriers and disseminators of viruses in these genera or species. Third, we also found that many viruses (e.g., AreVs, CoVs, and PicoVs) identified from the same or different animal species from different locations shared high sequence identities and close genetic relationships; the phylogenetic relationships we uncovered suggest these rodent-and shrew-borne viruses have the potential for intra-or cross-species transmission concomitant with intra-or inter-species contact and then co-evolve with their hosts in a wide geographical area. Finally, the phylogenetic incongruence between hosts and their viruses in many cases suggests that host shifts have happened frequently during the viral evolutionary history, which may create opportunities for the emergence of new viruses that are able to adapt to new hosts.

Rodent origin HVs and AreVs are important causative agents of human hemorrhagic fever and related diseases [8] . Although prevention and control measures have been performed in recent years, hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) caused by HVs remains a serious public health problem in China, and the number of HFRS cases still accounts for~90% of the total cases worldwide [13, 24, 45] . Although many members of the genus Mammarenavirus in the family Arenaviridae are associated with human diseases worldwide, only LCMV and WENV have been reported in China [11, 46] . Although some cases of lymphocytic choriomeningitis were clinically diagnosed in China based on serology and pathology, LCMV has not been laboratory confirmed nor full-length sequenced in China. We identified diverse HVs and AreVs located in different phylogenetic positions that indicate the presence of novel viruses in new hosts such as Caryomys eva (RtCe-HV/NX2015), Eothenomys melanogaster (RtCl-HV/ GZ2015), and Dipus sagitta (RtDs-HV/IM2014 and RtDs-AreV/IM2014). These findings are important for the prevention of HVs and AreVs transmitted from rodents. We also identified novel AreVs in different Rattus species with high sequence identities from Yunnan, Hunan, and Zhejiang provinces. These Rattus species hosts have high potential for contact with people in rural China, and the clustering of these viruses from different provinces with WENV variants identified in humans suggests there is a broader geographical distribution of these potentially zoonotic viruses [11, 47] .

We identified diverse rodent ArteVs phylogenetically scattered throughout the Arteriviridae, and with higher genetic diversity than ArteVs of other host groups. This suggests that rodents are important wildlife hosts for a variety of ArteVs species with different evolutionary stages and that rodents may act as the main wildlife reservoirs of ArteVs. Infection by the ArteV PRRSV causes severe disease in swine and global economic losses to the swine industry [48, 49] . All previously reported PRRSV strains are only detected in swine and can be phylogenetically classified into genotype 1 (or European type, prototype: Lelystad virus) and genotype 2 (or North American type, prototype: VR-2332) without any intermediate genotype [50, 51] . Our characterization of four rodent ArteVs in the PRRSV species phylogenetically clustered between the two known genotypes suggests that the virus evolved independently in pigs and rats and finally formed at least three different genotypes under the PRRSV species. It also indicates the presence of a closer ancestor of PRRSV in rodents than the previously hypothesized mouse LDV.

Unlike bat CoVs which are grouped into various evolutionary clades of the genera Alphacoronavirus and Betacoronavirus [32, [52] [53] [54] [55] , CoVs identified in various rodent species from various regions can only be classified into two lineages: lineage A of Betacoronavirus and a separate lineage of Alphacoronavirus. Human CoV OC43, human CoV HKU1, and bovine CoV under lineage A of Betacoronavirus are human or animal pathogens that cause mild-to-severe diseases [28] . The identification of diverse lineage-A rodent β-CoVs confirms the hypothesis that rodents may be an important reservoir for ancestors of lineage-A β-CoVs [28, 29] . The identification of α-CoVs under separate lineage from diverse provinces suggests a broader geographical distribution of these rodent-specific viruses.

Although samples from individuals of the order Lagomorpha and Soricomorpha were limited, many novel viruses were identified from Soricomorpha insectivores, a group of mammals that is poorly sampled, but abundant in natural and human-dominated habitats. The characterization of a shrew-borne CoV (Shrew-CoV/Tibet2014), CalV (Shrew-CalV/Tibet2014), AstVs, and CVs (Shrew-CV/Tibet2014) and a distinctive lineage of the genera Alphacoronavirus and Norovirus indicates that these insectivores may harbor a diversity of these and other viruses; some of which may have zoonotic potential.

These findings, combined with our previous bat virome data, greatly increase our knowledge of the viral community in wildlife in a densely populated country in an emerging disease hotspot. Continued efforts in viral discovery in these and other mammalian hosts in China may reveal greater diversity of viral lineages, as shown recently for arthropods [56, 57] , and as hypothesized globally [58] .

Collection of animal samples was conducted within the National HFRS Surveillance Network and National Medical Vectors Surveillance Network. Capture was conducted using live traps supplied by the State Key Laboratory for Infectious Diseases Prevention and Control. Most animals captured were euthanized by carbon dioxide although some individuals of rare species (labeled in red with IUCN red list level in Additional file 1: Table S1 ) were released after sampling. Pharyngeal and anal swabs were placed in virus sampling tubes (Yocon, Beijing, China) containing maintenance medium and temporarily stored at − 20°C. After the sampling was finished, samples were transported to the laboratory and stored at − 80°C. Samples from the same species and from the same site were pooled. The voucher collection of specimens was deposited at − 80°C by the Department of Vector Biology and Control, National Institute for Communicable Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention.

Viral nucleic acid library construction, next-generation sequencing, and taxonomic assignments Swab samples in maintenance medium were re-suspended, processed with a viral particle-protected nucleic acid purification method, and amplified by sequence-independent RT-PCR as described previously [32] . Briefly, the samples were filtered through a 0.45-μm polyvinylidene difluoride filter (Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany) to remove eukaryotic and bacterium-sized particles. The filtered samples were then centrifuged at 150,000×g for 3 h at 4°C. The pellets were re-suspended in Hank's balanced salt solution. To remove naked DNA and RNA, the re-suspended pellet was digested in a cocktail of DNase and RNase enzymes, including Turbo DNase (Ambion, Austin, TX, USA), benzonase (Novagen, Darmstadt, Germany), and RNase One (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) at 37°C for 2 h. The viral DNA and RNA were simultaneously isolated using a QIAmp MinElute Virus Spin Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA). Viral first-strand cDNA was synthesized using the primer K-8N and a Superscript III system (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). To convert first-strand cDNA into dsDNA, the cDNA was incubated at 37°C for 1 h in the presence of Klenow fragment (NEB, Ipswich, MA, USA). Sequence-independent PCR amplification was conducted using primer K and Phusion DNA polymerase (NEB). The PCR products were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. All DNA smears larger than 500 bp were excised and extracted with a MinElute Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen).

Amplified viral nucleic acid libraries were analyzed using an Illumina HiSeq2500 sequencer (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) for a single read of 100 bp in length. Raw sequence reads were filtered using previously described criteria to obtain valid sequences [31, 32, 59] , reads with no call sites, reads with similarity to the sequencing adaptor, and the primer K sequence, and duplicate reads and low-complexity reads were culled. Each read was evaluated for viral origin by conducting alignments with the NCBI non-redundant nucleotide database (NT) and protein database (NR) using BLASTn and BLASTx (with parameters -e 1e-5 -F T). Reads with no hits in NT or NR were further assembled by metagenomics assemblers (e.g., MetaVelvet, IDBA-UD, and SOAPdenovo), and the contigs were again aligned with NT and NR to identify any viruses present. Taxonomy of the aligned reads with the best BLAST scores (E value < 10 −5 ) from all lanes was parsed and exported with MEGAN 4-MetaGenome Analyzer [60] . We also tested an assembly-first strategy to analyze sequence data.

Reads were first assembled by metagenomics assemblers, and output contigs were then aligned to NT and NR.

Sequence reads classified as the same virus family or genus by MEGAN 4 were extracted and assembled with SeqMan program (Lasergene; DNAstar, Madison, WI, USA). The accurate locations of the assembled reads and the relative distances between them were determined. A draft genome with several SNPs of each virus was obtained. Based on partial genomic sequences of viruses obtained by assembly, we designed specific nested primers for PCR and RT-PCR to screen for each virus in individual samples from each mammalian species. Different degenerate primers targeting conserved regions were also used to identify the presence and prevalence of viruses [12, [61] [62] [63] [64] [65] [66] .

Locations of reads and the distances between reads of the same virus were determined using alignment results exported by MEGAN 4. Representative positive samples for each virus were selected for genome sequencing. Reads with accurate genomic locations were then used for reads-based PCR to identify partial genomes. Based on the partial genomic sequences obtained by specific nested PCR, the remaining genomic sequences were determined using inverse PCR, genome walking, and 5′and 3′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE).

Nucleotide sequences of genomes and amino acid sequences of open reading frames (ORFs) were deduced by comparing them with other viral sequences. The conserved protein families and domains were predicted using Pfam and InterProScan 5 (available at: http://www.ebi.ac.uk/services/proteins). Routine sequence alignments were performed using Clustal Omega, Needle (available at: http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/), MegAlign (Lasergene), and T-coffee with manual curation. MEGA6.0 (Phoenix, AZ, USA) was used to align the nt and the deduced aa sequences using the MUSCLE package and default parameters. The best substitution model was evaluated using the Model Selection package. We used maximum-likelihood to process the phylogenetic analyses with 1,000 bootstrap replicates [67] . The aa identities and genetic distances were calculated using the ML method with a pairwise evolutionary distance calculation as the distance metric. The evolutionary lineages of involved hosts were drawn based on mitochondrial cytochrome b (mt-cyt b) according to previous reports [7, 9, [68] [69] [70] . The congruence between the phylogenies of viruses and their hosts were determined by tanglegram which is generated by matching each virus to their associated host [12, 71] .

All genome sequences were submitted to GenBank (accession numbers are given in Additional file 1: Table S4 ). The Illumina HiSeq2500 sequence data were deposited into the NCBI sequence reads archive (SRA) under accession number PRJNA375958.

Genome analysis of canine astroviruses reveals genetic heterogeneity and suggests possible inter-species transmission,"Canine astrovirus RNA was detected in the stools of 17/63 (26.9%) samples, using either a broadly reactive consensus RT-PCR for astroviruses or random RT-PCR coupled with massive deep sequencing. The complete or nearly complete genome sequence of five canine astroviruses was reconstructed that allowed mapping the genome organization and to investigate the genetic diversity of these viruses. The genome was about 6.6 kb in length and contained three open reading frames (ORFs) flanked by a 5 UTR, and a 3 UTR plus a poly-A tail. ORF1a and ORF1b overlapped by 43 nucleotides while the ORF2 overlapped by 8 nucleotides with the 3 end of ORF1b. Upon genome comparison, four strains (HUN/2012/2, HUN/2012/6, HUN/2012/115, and HUN/2012/135) were more related genetically to each other and to UK canine astroviruses (88-96% nt identity), whilst strain HUN/2012/126 was more divergent (75-76% nt identity). In the ORF1b and ORF2, strains HUN/2012/2, HUN/2012/6, and HUN/2012/135 were related genetically to other canine astroviruses identified formerly in Europe and China, whereas strain HUN/2012/126 was related genetically to a divergent canine astrovirus strain, ITA/2010/Zoid. For one canine astrovirus, HUN/2012/8, only a 3.2 kb portion of the genome, at the 3 end, could be determined. Interestingly, this strain possessed unique genetic signatures (including a longer ORF1b/ORF2 overlap and a longer 3 UTR) and it was divergent in both ORF1b and ORF2 from all other canine astroviruses, with the highest nucleotide sequence identity (68% and 63%, respectively) to a mink astrovirus, thus suggesting a possible event of interspecies transmission. The genetic heterogeneity of canine astroviruses may pose a challenge for the diagnostics and for future prophylaxis strategies.","Astroviruses (AstV), family Astroviridae, are non-enveloped viruses with a diameter of 28-30 nm and with a typical star-like shape. The genome is a single strand of positive sense, RNA of 6.4-7.3 kb in size, containing three overlapping ORFs (ORF1a, ORF1b and ORF2) with a 3 poly(A) tail (Mendez and Arias, 2007) . ORF1a encodes a serine 3C type of viral protease. ORF1b is separated from ORF1a by a heptameric frame shift signal (AAAAAAC) and encodes the viral RNA polymerase. ORF2 encodes an 87-kDa polypeptide, which functions as the capsid precursor. AstV infection is associated with gastroenteritis in many animal species and humans, and they are also associated with extra-intestinal diseases, such as nephritis in chickens, hepatitis in ducks and shaking syndrome in minks (Imada et al., 2000; Fu et al., 2009; Blomström et al., 2010) . The evolution of AstVs is driven by mechanisms of genetic drift, recombination and, possibly, inter-species transmission (Finkbeiner et al., 2008; De Benedictis et al., 2011; Martella et al., 2014) .

So far, AstVs are classified into two distinct genera, Mamastrovirus (MAstV) and Avastrovirus (AvAstV) with 19 MAstV (mammalian) species and 3 AvAstV (avian) species listed officially by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) (Bosch et al., 2010) . However, taking advantage of broad-range PCR primers for AstVs and metagenomic protocols, several novel AstVs have been identified in a number of mammalian and avian species (Chu et al., 2008; Finkbeiner et al., 2008; Bosch et al., 2010; De Benedictis et al., 2011) . Using the classification criteria adopted http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2016.12.005 0168-1702/© 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

in the 9th ICTV report that is based on genetic analysis of the full-length ORF2, an additional 14 MAstV and 4 AvAstV candidate species have been defined recently (Schultz-Cherry, 2013) .

AstV-like particles have been detected only occasionally in dogs by EM, either alone or in co-infection with other enteric viruses (Williams, 1980; Marshall et al., 1984; Vieler and Herbst, 1995; Toffan et al., 2009 ). More recently, AstVs have been identified in dogs with enteric signs and characterized molecularly, suggesting that the detected viruses may represent a distinct AstV species (Toffan et al., 2009) . Also, a canine AstV, strain ITA/08/Bari, was successfully adapted to replicate in vitro on MDCK cells, and AstV-specific antibodies were detected in convalescent canine sera (Martella et al., 2011a (Martella et al., ,b, 2012 . The prevalence of AstV infection seems higher in dogs with enteric disease than in asymptomatic animals (Martella et al., 2011a,b; Zhu et al., 2011; Caddy and Goodfellow, 2015; Takano et al., 2015) . Also, monitoring of natural infection by AstV in dogs has revealed that the acute phase of gastroenteritis overlaps with peaks of viral shedding (Martella et al., 2012) . At present, limited and partial information on canine AstV genomes is available in GenBank. This limited amount of information seems to suggest that canine AstVs are genetically heterogeneous (Martella et al., 2011a,b; Caddy and Goodfellow, 2015) , thus posing a challenge for the diagnostic and for the understanding of the genetic and biological properties of these viruses in dogs.

In this study, the complete or nearly complete genome sequence of five canine AstVs and the partial genome sequence of one canine AstV were determined and analysed, providing information on the genome organization and genetic diversity of these viruses.

During 2012 samples were collected from diarrheic and nondiarrheic dogs from a Hungarian shelter. There was no age restriction. A total of 63 samples obtained from 50 animals were tested for AstV by using a pan-astrovirus specific primer set (Chu et al., 2008) as described elsewhere (Mihalov-Kovács et al., 2014) and 37 (from 33 dogs) were randomly selected for viral metagenomics.

Fecal samples were diluted 1: 10 in PBS (phosphate buffered saline) and homogenized. The homogenates were centrifuged at 10000g for 5 min and the supernatant was collected for extraction of viral RNA (Zymo DirectZol viral RNA extraction kit, Zymo Research).

Templates for deep sequencing were prepared as described previously (Mihalov-Kovács et al., 2015) . In brief, viral RNA samples were denatured at 97 • C for 5 min in the presence of 10 M random hexamer tailed by a common PCR primer sequence (Djikeng et al., 2008) . Reverse transcription was performed with 1 U AMV reverse transcriptase (Promega, Madison, WI, USA), 400 M dNTP mixture, and 1× AMV RT buffer at 42 • C for 45 min following a 5 min incubation at room temperature. Then, 5 L cDNA was added to 45 L PCR mixture to obtain a final volume of 50 L and a concentration of 500 M for the PCR primer, 200 M for dNTP mixture, 1.5 mM for MgCl2, 1 × Taq DNA polymerase buffer, and 0.5 U for Taq DNA polymerase (Thermo Scientific, Vilnius, Lithuania). The reaction conditions consisted of an initial denaturation step at 95 • C for 3 min, followed by 40 cycles of amplification (95 • C for 30 s, 48 • C for 30 s, 72 • C for 2 min) and terminated at 72 • C for 8 min.

We subjected 0.1 g of random PCR product to enzymatic fragmentation and adaptor ligation (NEBNext Fast DNA Fragmentation & Library Prep Set for Ion Torrent kit, New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA). The barcoded adaptors were retrieved from the Ion Xpress Barcode Adapters (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA). The resulting cDNA libraries were measured on an Qubit 2.0 device using the Qubit dsDNA BR Assay kit (Invitrogen, Eugene, OR, USA). The emulsion PCR that produced clonally amplified libraries was carried out according to the manufacturer's protocol using the Ion PGM Template kit on an OneTouch v2 instrument. Enrichment of the templated beads (on an Ion One Touch ES machine) and further steps of presequencing setup were performed according to the Page 3 of 11 200-bp protocol of the manufacturer. The sequencing protocol recommended for Ion PGM Sequencing Kit on an 316 chip was strictly followed.

To determine the actual 5 end genomic sequence of two AstV strains, a 5 RACE protocol was used, following the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen Ltd). The amplicons were visualized on 1.5% agarose gel, and cleaned up with Qiagen Qiaquick Gel Extraction Kit, according to the manufacturer's instructions. The amplicons were cloned using TOPO XL PCR Cloning (Invitrogen Ltd) and the clones were subjected to sequencing in both directions using Big Dye v3.1 chemistry on a 3730xl instrument from Applied Biosystems (Foster, CA). For sequencing accuracy, a minimum of three independent clones for each fragment type were selected for sequencing in both directions using the universal M13F/R primers.

The First Strand III kit (Invitrogen Ltd) was used to generate cDNA from the poly-A tailed RNA target, as described previously (Martella et al., 2011a,b) . Forward primers were designed about 1 kb upstream of the 3 terminus of the genome of the various AstV strains and used with a reverse poly-T oligonucleotide with a 5anchored tail. The 3 RACE products were sequenced on Ion Torrent PGM.

Sequence data generated by the Ion Torrent PGM were trimmed and analysed by the CLC Bio software (www.clcbio.com). The same software package was utilized to map sequence reads to reference eucaryotic viral sequences retrieved from GenBank. Sequence editing, annotation and analysis were carried out using Geneious software v9.1.4 (Biomatters LTD, New Zealand). Open reading frames (ORF) were predicted with the ORF finder. Multiple alignments were prepared and manually adjusted, whereas phylogenetic analysis was performed by using the MEGA6 software (Tamura et al., 2013) with a neighbor-joining method, Jukes Cantor genetic distance model and bootstrapping over 1000 replicates. Mean amino acid genetic distances were computed using the p-distance method of MEGA6. The protein sequence analysis and classification were prepared with the aid of EMBL-EBI website (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/). Transmembrane domains were determined using Phobius web server (Käll et al., 2007) . Nuclear localization signals (NLS) were predicted by http://www.moseslab. csb.utoronto.ca/NLStradamus/.

AstV genomic sequences were deposited in the Gen-Bank with the following accession numbers: HUN 

During 2012, 63 stool specimens were screened for AstVs using broad-range AstV-specific primer set. Of these, seven tested positive; 4 out of 25 diarrheic animals (16%) and 3 out of 38 non-diarrheic animals (8%). The difference between groups was not statistically significant (chi-square value, 1.003; p = 0.316). A subset (n = 37) of samples was selected from 33 animals for viral metagenomics to detect virus diversity in canine fecal specimens. Among these 37 samples 26 specimens contained eukaryotic origin viral sequences (Fig. 1) . By viral metagenomics (Table 1) , AstV RNA was initially identified in 11 out of 37 fecal specimens (29.7%). However, the proportion of AstV specific reads ranged from 1 out of 18711 ( < 0.1%) to 1627 out of 1635 (99.5%) eukaryotic viral sequence reads, respectively, and five samples that had very low AstV sequence read numbers (range, 1-4) were not considered for further processing. Other enteric viruses detected in the stools included parvovirus (in 20 samples), coronavirus (in 14 samples), rotavirus (in 11 samples), picornavirus (in 7 samples), gyrovirus (in 1 sample), adenovirus (in 1 sample) and calicivirus (in 1 sample). Overall, by either the pan-astrovirus RT-PCR or by the viral metagenomic screening, we identified AstV RNA in 17/63 (26.9%) samples. Interestingly, some samples negative in RT-PCR generated AstV-specific reads by deep sequencing, whilst, in turn, some samples containing AstV-specific reads tested negative by the panastrovirus RT-PCR, indicating a weak correlation between the two methodologies (Table 1) .

For further analysis the complete, coding complete and partial genome sequence was determined for four, one and one AstV strains, respectively. In general, the length of the coding sequences ranged between 6441 and 6474 nucleotide (nt), with a GC content of 45.19-45.48%. The total genome length, considering the 5 and 3 UTRs, ranged between 6535 and 6587 nt. The 5 UTR was sequenced completely for strains HUN/2012/2, HUN/2012/115, HUN/2012/126 and HUN/2012/135, and ranged between 42 and 60 nt in length. The 3 UTR was sequenced completely for all the six strains and ranged between 49 and 100 nt in length.

The genome of strain HUN/2012/115 was 6569 nt long, excluding the polyA-tail. The 5 UTR and 3 UTR were, respectively, 45 nt and 83 nt long. The genome of strain HUN/2012/135 was 6587 nt long and it was organized similarly to strain HUN/2012/115, even if the 3 UTR was 2 nt longer. The genome of strain HUN/2012/2 was 6576 nt long and it differed for the longer 5 UTR region (60 nt) from the other canine AstVs. Despite several attempts, for strain HUN/2012/6, it was not possible to generate the actual 5 UTR sequence. The genome of this strain was organized in an identical manner to the canine AstV strain GBR/2014/Gillingham. The genome length of the AstV strain HUN/2012/126 was 6535 nt long, excluding the polyA-tail. The 5 UTR was 42 nt in length, with an additional in-frame ATG codon located 18 nt upstream (bases 25-27) of the ATG codon of ORF1. The 3 UTR was 49 nt long. Only the partial genome (3187 nt in length) of strain HUN/2012/8 was determined. The virus possessed an early stop codon in the ORF2, resulting in a longer (100 nt) 3 UTR ( Table 2) .

The coding sequences showed the typical organization of AstV genome. There were three overlapping ORFs, coding the non-structural and structural proteins. The predicted genome organization of the viruses is shown in Fig. 2 and summarized in Table 2 .

The complete ORF1a was 2670 nt long for all canine AstVs, except strain HUN/2012/126, and codes for a 889 aa long polyprotein. For strain HUN/2012/126, an in-frame start codon is located 18 nt upstream of the ORF1 start codon (the length of the ORF is 2667/2685 depending on the start). A ribosomal frameshift signal, the heptameric (slippery) AAAAAAC sequence, was recognized at nt 2622-2628 (2619/2637 in HUN/2012/126 depending on the start used), with the ORF1b initiating after the slippery sequence. The predicted 95 kDa nsp1a protein, encoded by ORF1a, contained conserved domains typical for the AstV serine protease between aa 439 and 583 aa. Five transmembrane domains were identified on the predicted ORF1a protein at residues aa151-168, aa240-266, aa287-313, aa319-339 and aa351-380. A possible coiled coil structure was also found at residues aa595-616 and aa635-656 (Fig. 2) .

Upon sequence comparison, strains HUN/2012/2, HUN/2012/6, HUN/2012/115 and HUN/2012/135 displayed 96-99% nt identity to each other and 93-98% nt to the canine strains UK/2014/Lincoln and UK/2014/Gillingham, whilst strain HUN/2012/126 displayed only 74% nt identity to the other canine AstVs. Identity to non-canine AstVs was markedly lower (33-51% nt) (Table 3) .

The complete ORF1b was 1530 nt long in all canine AstVs, except the partially sequenced strain, HUN/2012/8, where a 770 nt long portion was determined. The ORF1b begins with the last nucleotide of the slippery heptamer and with a −1 frameshift with respect to ORF1a. Also, the downstream stem loop structure was highly conserved among canine AstVs (Caddy and Goodfellow, For the ORF1a and ORF2, the ORF length is calculated considering the presence of an additional start codon. This value is also calculated for the ORF1b/ORF2 overlap. a Partial sequence. b An additonal ATG codon is present 18 nt upstream (bases 25-27) of the ORF1a initiation codon. c Based on the additional ORF1a start codon, the ORF1a-predicted polyprotein could be 6 aa longer; -not available. 85-86% nt (87-88% aa) to the other canine AstVs. Strain HUN/2012/8 displayed the highest identity to a mink AstV (68% nt and 70% aa), whilst identity to other canine AstVs was lower (56-58% nt and 50-52% aa) ( Table 3) .

The length of ORF2 is variable among the canine AstV strains. In all but one strains analysed in this study, the ORF1b and ORF2 overlapped by 8 nt. In strain HUN/2012/8 the overlapping was 11 nt in length. In addition, there was a second in-frame ATG start codon, located 180 nt upstream of the start codon homologous to other Mamastrovirus genomes. Only in strain HUN/2012/8, this additional in-frame start codon was located 141 nt upstream of the first start codon. During the RNA replication, ORF2 is expressed from a sgRNA (Walter and Mitchell, 2003; Mendez et al., 2014) . The sgRNA promoter sequence has a highly conserved nucleotide sequence motif and is present upstream of the ORF2 start codon (Mendez et al., 2014) . The highly conserved nucleotide stretch upstream of ORF2, ATATGGAGGGGAGGACCAAAAAATTGCGATGGC, believed to be part of a promoter region for synthesis of sgRNA, was completely conserved in the sequence of canine AstV strains except for the sequence of strain HUN/2012/8, that was CTTTGGAGGGGAGGACCAAAGCAGCGCTATGGC.

The ORF2 was 2292/2472 nt long for strain HUN/2012/115 and HUN/2012/135, 2295/2475 nt long for strain HUN/2012/2, 2325/2505 nt long for strain HUN/2012/6, 2298/2478 nt for strain HUN/2012/126 and 2328/2469 nt for HUN/2012/8 ( Table 2 ). The terminal nt stretch of ORF2 and the adjacent 3 UTR (s2m) is highly conserved among most AstVs and similarities have been observed in the sequence and folding of the 3 UTR of viruses from other viral families, suggesting that it is relevant for AstV genome replication (Monceyron et al., 1997) . The conserved s2 m sequence CCGCGGCCACGCCGAGTAGGAACGAGGGTACAG overlaps the 6 aa C terminus of the capsid (SRGHAE), that is highly conserved in several mammalian AstVs, including the canine AstVs (Fig. 2) . However, in strain HUN/2012/8 the highly conserved s2m stretch was found downstream of the ORF2 termination codon, in the 3 UTR. As a consequence, the 6 aa C terminus of strain HUN/2012/8 was TLSTKH.

Upon sequence comparison, the Hungarian canine AstVs were found to differ markedly. Strains HUN/2012/2 and HUN/2012/135 were highly related to each other (92% nt and 96% aa identity) and to Chinese CAstVs (91-96% nt and 95-99% aa identity) as well as to the UK strain GBR/2014/Lincoln (91-95% nt and 95-99% aa). Strain HUN/2012/6 displayed the highest identity (91-95% nt and 96-98% aa) to three Italian strains (ITA/2005 -3, ITA/2005 -6, ITA/2005 and to the UK strain GBR/2014/Gillingham. Strain HUN/2012/126 displayed the highest identity (97% nt and 98% aa) to the Italian strain ITA/2010/Zoid. Strain HUN/2012/115 displayed the highest identity (79% nt and 79% aa) to the Italian strain ITA/2010/Zoid, while sequence identity to other canine AstVs ranged from 72 to 75% at the nt level and 75-80% at the aa level. Interestingly, strain HUN/2012/8 displayed the highest identity (63% nt and 64% aa) to a mink AstV (Table 3) .

Phylogenetic trees were constructed using the nucleotide alignments of ORF1a, ORF1b and ORF2 (Fig. 3) . The ORF1a and ORF2 alignments were based on the full-length ORF sequences and also included a selection of sequences of mammalian AstV strains. The ORF1b alignment included 415 nt at the 3 end (138 aa at the C terminus of the protein).

In all phylogenetic trees, the majority of canine AstVs formed a distinct monophyletic group. In the ORF1a-based tree (Fig. 3A) , only five canine AstV strains generated in this study and two AstV strains from UK could be included, as information on the ORF1a is not available for other canine AstVs. Although monophyletic, the canine AstVs segregated in two distinct branches, with strain HUN/2012/126 in the basal position. When enlarging the number of analysed sequences, in the ORF1b (Fig. 3B) , this pattern of segregation was confirmed. Four strains (HUN/2012 /2, HUN/2012 /6, HUN/2012 /115, and HUN/2012 were grouped with the majority of canine AstVs identified in European and extra-European countries, whilst strain HUN/2012/126 clustered with the highly virulent strain ITA/2010/Zoid. Interestingly, strain HUN/2012/8 was distantly related to all other canine AstVs and it was grouped with AstVs identified in minks and in Californian sea lions. The unique evolutionary relationship of this canine strain was confirmed in the ORF2 (capsid)-based tree (Fig. 3C) . This gene is considered as the fundamental target for classification and characterization of AstVs. When observing in detail the large monophyletic group of canine AstVs which classified into species 5 (Schultz-Cherry, 2013), it was possible to identify clearly sub-clustering patterns, with at least 6 sub-clusters. All Chi-nese strains, the UK strain GBR/2014/Lincoln and the Hungarian strains HUN/2012/2 and HUN/2012/135 formed a unique group, with more than 91% nt identity in the full-length ORF2. A second group included three Italian strains (ITA/2005 -3, ITA/2005 -6, and ITA/2005 , the UK strain GBR/2014/Gillingham and strain HUN/2012/6, with more than 91% nt identity to each other. A third group encompassed the virulent strain ITA/2010/Zoid and strain HUN/2012/126 (97% nt identity to each other). Other canine strains (GBR/2014 /Braintree, GBR/2014 /Huntingdon, HUN/2012 were intermingled between these three main sequence groups and, as supported by sequence comparison (Table 3) , they clearly appeared as distinct genetic sub-lineages.

AstVs have been reported repeatedly in dogs across the world, although the association with the disease, prevalence rates and information on the genetic diversity are still largely unknown. In this study, we could neither confirm nor refute an association between AstV infection and diarrhea in dogs. Furthermore, we observed discrepancies between results obtained by the panastrovirus PCR assay and those derived from viral metagenomics. However, none of these methods were developed for routine diagnostic procedures and we do not have information about the actual sensitivity of these assays. At present it seems more appropriate to consider these methods, originally developed to detect viral diversity, as independent approaches that help understand the viral community and diversity in clinical/pathological specimens. Thus, our prevalence data for AstV must be interpreted with caution, even if the detection rates of AstVs fell in the ranges reported in the literature. For example, canine AstV RNA has been detected in 6-27% of dogs with enteritis and 0-19% of aysmptomatic dogs in studies in Italy ( (Takano et al., 2015) , France (Grellet et al., 2012) and UK (Caddy and Goodfellow, 2015) . Even if those studies differed in the number, provenience and age of the animals enrolled in the investigations, in most studies the detection rates were found to differ significantly between symptomatic and asymptomatic dogs, suggesting a possible role of AstVs as enteric pathogens of dogs. Also, the onset and evolution of the clinical signs have been found to correlate with the patterns of virus shedding and with seroconversion in two dogs naturally infected by canine AstVs (Martella et al., 2012) . Yet, experimental studies will be needed to demonstrate firmly the association of canine AstVs with gastroenteritis.

Sequencing of the ORF1a, ORF1b and ORF2 regions revealed significant sequence variation in the CAstVs detected in this study. Five strains were grouped with other canine AstVs identified worldwide, but further separated into multiple capsid (ORF2) sub-clusters.

By parallelism with what is observed in human AstVs (MAstV species 1), that are classified antigenically in 8 serotypes, it is possible to speculate that the genetic heterogeneity observed in canine AstVs might account for a significant antigenic diversity (Caddy and Goodfellow, 2015) . Weak antigenic cross-reactivity has been observed in immune electron microscopy between strain ITA/2008/Bari and ITA/2010/Zoid virus particles and the sera of convalescent dogs (Martella et al., 2012) . However, isolation in vitro of these viruses is fastidious and only one strain, ITA/208/Bari, has been adapted to grow in vitro thus far (Martella et al., 2011a,b) , thus hampering a precise evaluation of the antigenic relationships among different canine AstVs.

Interestingly, one Hungarian strain, HUN/2012/126, resembled a highly virulent canine AstV, ITA/2010/Zoid, associated with enteric disease in an adult and young dog in Italy (Martella et al., 2012) . The question whether some canine AstV strains may differ in their biological properties in terms of fitness or virulence remains open.

Even more interestingly, one of the canine AstVs identified in Hungary, HUN/2012/8, was found to be genetically distantly related from all other canine AstVs identified worldwide. Although we were successful to determine only the partial (3.2 kb) 3'end of the genome, the virus displayed unique genetic signatures, such as a longer ORF1b/ORF2 overlap (11 nt), and a longer 3 UTR. Also, this strain markedly varied from all the other canine AstVs in the highly conserved promoter region for synthesis of subgenomic RNA, located upstream of the ORF2 (Walter and Mitchell, 2003; Mendez et al., 2014) . Conversely, all other canine AstVs analysed in this study displayed a conserved genomic architecture, which was shared with all currently canine AstVs for whom the complete or partial (ORF1b and ORF2) genome sequence is available (Martella et al., 2011a (Martella et al., ,b, 2012 Takano et al., 2015) . In addition, upon sequence comparison and phylogenetic analysis, strain HUN/2012/8 differed markedly from other canine AstVs concerning the partial ORF1b and the full-length ORF2 (Table 3) . According to the 9th ICTV report (http://talk.ictvonline.org/files/ictv official taxonomy updates since the 8th report/m/vertebrate-official/ 4178), for MAstVs the mean aa genetic distances (p-dist) range from 0.378 to 0.750%, and from 0.006 to 0.312%, respectively, between and within groups (species). Using our set of ORF2 sequences, the p-dist of strain HUN/2012/8 was calculated to range between 0.350 and 0.772. Accordingly, this strain appears distantly related from any other known mammalian AstV and may represent a novel AstV species.

It remains to be established whether strain HUN/2012/8 is actually a canine virus, or it is the result of inter-species transmission from an unidentified animal source. Although AstVs are regarded as viruses with a robust host-species restriction, several pieces of evidences in mammals (including humans) indicate that the host species barrier may be permeable in some occasions, and that heterologous viruses may stably adapt to the new host (Finkbeiner et al., 2008 (Finkbeiner et al., , 2009 Nagai et al., 2015) . Moreover, occasional transmission of AstVs is thought to have occurred between avian and mammalian species in both directions (Sun et al., 2014; Pankovics et al., 2015) .

In summary, data about canine AstVs is currently scarce. Nonetheless, the genetic heterogeneity among circulating AstV strains is evident representing some challenge for laboratory diagnosis. This diversity may also be challenging for future prophylaxis strategies, complicating the design of future vaccines, as it is currently unknown whether antigenic cross-reaction exists among and cross-protection is elicited by different canine AstV strains. Further efforts are needed to better understand the biology of canine AstVs and large-scale structured surveillance programs should be initiated to elucidate the relative veterinary importance of various canine AstV types.

Molecular Evolution of the Primate a-/h-Defensin Multigene Family,"The primate a-/h-defensin multigene family encodes versatile endogenous cationic and amphipathic peptides that have broad-spectrum antibacterial, antifungal and antiviral activity. Although previous studies have reported that a-/h-defensin (DEFA/DEFT) genes are under birth-and-death evolution with frequent duplication and rapid evolution, the phylogenetic relationships of the primate DEFA/DEFT genes; the genetic bases for the existence of similar antimicrobial spectra among closely related species; and the evolutionary processes involved in the emergence of cyclic h-defensins in Old World monkeys and their subsequent loss of function in humans, chimpanzees and gorillas require further investigation. In this study, the DEFA/DEFT gene repertoires from primate and treeshrew were collected, followed by detailed phylogenetic, sequence and structure, selection pressure and comparative genomics analyses. All treeshrew, prosimian and simian DEFA/ DEFT genes are grouped into two major clades, which are tissue-specific for enteric and myeloid defensins in simians. The simian enteric and myeloid a-defensins are classified into six functional gene clusters with diverged sequences, variable structures, altered functional constraints and different selection pressures, which likely reflect the antimicrobial spectra among closely related species. Species-specific duplication or pseudogenization within each simian cluster implies that the antimicrobial spectrum is ever-shifting, most likely challenged by the ever-changing pathogen environment. The DEFT evolved from the myeloid DEFA8. The prosegment of h-defensin is detected with adaptive changes coevolving with the new protein fold of mature peptide, coincident with the importance of the prosegment for the correct folding of the mature peptide. Lastly, a less-is-hitchhiking hypothesis was proposed as a possible explanation for the expansion of pseudogene DEFTP and the loss of functional DEFT, where the gain or loss of the hitchhiker is determined by its adjacent driver gene during the birth-and-death evolutionary process.","Host immune systems evolve various defensive weapons against pathogens during the pathogen-host arms race. Defensins are small antimicrobial peptides that act as both effectors and mediators of host immunity. These endogenous cationic and amphipathic peptides have broad-spectrum antibacterial, antifungal and antiviral activity [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] . They also modulate the innate and adaptive immune systems by promoting or suppressing the proinflammatory responses during microbial infection [7] [8] [9] . In mammals, there are three structural subfamilies of defensins-a-, band h-defensins-that differ by their tridisulfide motifs. The bdefensins are the oldest members and are found in most classes of vertebrates [10] [11] [12] [13] . The a-defensins, which originate from the bdefensins, are younger members. The a-defensins are found in marsupials and most mammals but were lost in some Laurasiatheria species, such as cattle and dogs [14] [15] [16] [17] . The h-defensins are the only mammalian cyclic peptides currently known and originate from a-defensins through a nonsense mutation in the mature peptide. The h-defensins are found in Old World monkeys and certain apes but underwent a loss of function in humans, chimpanzees and gorillas due to a nonsense mutation in the signal peptide [18, 19] .

Primate a-/h-defensin (DEFA/DEFT) genes are located as multigene clusters on chromosome regions that are homologous with human chromosome 8p23 [16, 20] . Like other multigene families, DEFA/DEFT genes can be constitutively expressed at high levels to produce variant functional proteins. In humans, there are six functional and tissue-specific a-defensin peptides. Human HNP1-HNP4, encoded by the DEFA1, DEFA3 and DEFA4 genes, are primarily expressed in neutrophils [1] . The DEFA1 and DEFA3 genes are genetic variants that encode proteins with a single amino acid difference and are also referred to as DEFA1A3 genes. Unlike the single-copy DEFA4, the DEFA1A3 genes have copy number polymorphisms [21] [22] [23] . In contrast, human HD5 and HD6, encoded by DEFA5 and DEFA6, respectively, are expressed primarily in Paneth cells of the small intestine and play important roles in intestinal host defense and homeostasis [24] [25] [26] . Apart from the functional genes, there are many defensin pseudogenes-DEFAP and DEFTP-in humans [19, 27] . In macaques, the new member h-defensin encoded by DEFT is primarily expressed in the bone marrow and leukocytes [28] .

Defensins are synthesized as pre-pro-defensins containing a signal peptide, a prosegment and a mature peptide. The prosegment, which serves as an intramolecular chaperone, assists in the correct disulfide pairing and proper folding of the mature peptide [29] and keeps the mature peptide inactive until it is cleaved by various proteolytic enzymes [30] [31] [32] . The mature peptides are cationic and amphipathic, which are important properties for inducing the depolarization and permeabilization of the microbial membrane [2, 33] . The a-defensin monomer has a three-stranded antiparallel b-sheet structure with three intramolecular disulfide pairs linked as Cys1-Cys6, Cys2-Cys4 and Cys3-Cys5. Two monomers form an amphipathic dimer, which is stabilized by hydrophobic interactions and intermolecular hydrogen bonds between residues 18 and 20 (HNP4 numbering) in the second b-sheet [33, 34] . The dimerization of a-defensins, in addition to their cationic and amphipathic character, is also important for their antimicrobial ability [35] [36] [37] . In contrast to the structure of a-defensins, the h-defensins form a cyclic octadecapeptide through the posttranslational head-to-tail ligation of two nonapeptides and harbor three intermolecular disulfide pairs [18] . Recently, synthetic defensins have been studied and are being developed as potential antimicrobial peptide drugs [38] [39] [40] [41] .

Because of the frequent duplication and rapid evolution of primate a-/h-defensins, the nomenclature and phylogenetic relationships among this multigene family are still ambiguous. Moreover, there is no clear phylogenetic classification related to the expression pattern or the confounding antimicrobial function of these a-defensins, although many functional studies indicate that a-defensins are effective microbicidal peptides against a wide variety of microorganisms. Previous studies have demonstrated that the a-/h-defensin multigene family, like many other multigene families, is subject to birth-and-death evolutionary process with frequent gene duplication, pseudogenization and significant positive selection [42] [43] [44] . However, the molecular evolution of the undocumented antimicrobial spectra that are composed of functionally divergent a-/h-defensins in humans and closely related primates should be further explored. In this study, the phylogenetic classification, sequence divergence and structural diversification of the primate a-/h-defensins were investigated using molecular evolution and molecular dynamics analyses. Furthermore, the evolutionary processes involved in the emergence of cyclic h-defensins and their subsequent loss of function in humans, chimpanzees and gorillas require investigation. Loss of function is a major driving force for phenotypic change and can be advantageous, deleterious or tolerated, as explained by the hypotheses of less-is-more, less-is-less and less-is-nothing, respectively [45] . Because of the frequent gene duplication and functional redundancy within multigene families, losing certain members is usually ''tolerable''. However, the h-defensins have significant antiviral activity that is higher than that of a-defensins and b-defensins, including anti-HIV-1 activity [39, 46] . The loss of functional h-defensin seems to be ''deleterious''. Therefore, the expansion of pseudogene DEFTP and the loss of functional DEFT in humans, chimpanzees and gorillas cannot be well explained by the three hypotheses noted above. The evolutionary fate of hdefensin genes may be influenced by other factors, which should be further investigated. In this study, a less-is-hitchhiking hypothesis was proposed to explain this process, using comparative genomics analyses.

To identify sequences for the primate a-/h-defensin gene family, a literature search and exhaustive genome blast searches were carried out. First, primate DEFA/DEFT sequences were collected from the literature and defined as queries. Second, sequence-based searches of both BlastN and BLAT were performed using these queries, and these BlastN and BLAT searches were repeated using the newly identified genes as queries until no additional genes could be identified. Last, all identified genes were manually checked for functional genes or pseudogenes. Primate DEFA/DEFT DNA sequences or completely assembled genomes from the NCBI database or the UCSC Genome Browser were used, including human (Homo sapiens; assembly: GRCh37.p5; March 2011), chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes; assembly: Pan_troglodytes-2. The treeshrews (northern treeshrew Tupaia belangeri; assembly: AAPY01804345.1; June 2006; Chinese treeshrew Tupaia belangeri chinensis; assembly: ALAR1000000; February 2013), which are close relatives of primates, were also used. The exon-intron structures were determined by GeneWise. Sequences that encoded a-/h-defensins containing the six conserved cysteines (for DEFA) and the three conserved cysteines (for DEFT) were identified as functional genes. Sequences with frame-shift (insertion or deletion) mutations or premature stop codons were considered pseudogenes. A list of identified sequences is detailed in Table S1 .

To understand the evolutionary processes of the primate a-/hdefensin gene family, molecular evolutionary analyses and comparative genomics analyses were performed. Coding regions of the DEFA/DEFT functional genes were aligned codon-to-codon using the MUSCLE program as implemented in the MEGA6 software [47] , and then corresponding regions of the pseudogenes were manually matched to the multiple sequence alignment of the functional genes.

Phylogenetic trees were built using either the more conserved signal-prosegment region or the entire coding region. To obtain reliable phylogenetic relationships, three different tree-building methods were combined. Bayesian inference (BI) phylogenetic trees were constructed using the BEAST software [48] . Neighborjoining (NJ) and maximum likelihood (ML) phylogenetic trees were constructed using the MEGA6 software [47] . The BI trees were computed using the general time-reversible (GTR) nucleotide substitution model, and the site heterogeneity model was assumed with a discrete gamma distribution for among-site rate variation and a proportion of invariant sites (G + I (4 categories)). Two independent Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) runs were conducted for 10,000,000 steps, with a sampling frequency of every 1000 steps, a UPGMA starting tree and other default parameters. When the effective sample sizes (ESSs) of all quantities were larger than 200, the MCMC was considered converged, and the results were analyzed with 20% burn-in. The best nucleotide substitution patterns for ML trees were selected based on the analyses of best-fit models in MEGA6. The ML trees were computed using the Kimura 2-parameter substitution model (K2) with a bootstrap test (1000 replicates), and the rate variation model was allowed with a discrete gamma distribution (4 categories). The evolutionary distances for NJ trees were computed using the Kimura 2-parameter method with a bootstrap test (1000 replicates), and the rate variation among sites was modeled with a gamma distribution (gamma parameter = 2.6 for the signalprosegment region and 1.4 for the entire coding region).

The phylogenetic trees of BI, NJ and ML were combined using the TreeGraph2 software [49] . The BI trees were selected as background trees, and the clades or clusters of similar topologies in the BI, NJ and ML trees were labeled with posterior probabilities (BI) and bootstrap support values (NJ and ML).

The DEFA/DEFT genes from the human, chimpanzee, orangutan, macaque and marmoset genomes were used for synteny analysis by mapping their loci onto chromosomes in scale.

Functional divergences (type I and type II) between clusters were tested using the Gu99 and Gu2013 probabilistic models implemented in the DIVERGE 2.0 software [50, 51] . Pairwise coefficients (h ij 6SE) and likelihood ratio statistics (LRT) for simian enteric or myeloid defensin clusters were analyzed using the bootstrapped Gu99 probabilistic method. Functional distance analysis was performed based on the Wang and Gu 2001 method [52] . The type I functional distance (d F ) between clusters was defined as d F = 2ln(12h ij ). For two clusters A and B, d F (A,B) = b F (A)+b F (B); thus, the functional branch length, b F , for each cluster can be calculated using a standard least-squares method. A large b F value for a gene cluster indicates that the evolutionary conservation may be shifted at many sites. The effective number of sites (n e ) related to functional divergences was estimated following the Gu2013 protocol. Type I sites, typically generated by type I functional divergence, are conserved in one gene cluster but highly variable in the other following gene duplication, whereas type II sites, which are primarily caused by type II functional divergence, refer to radical changes of conserved amino acids at the same site in both gene clusters.

To investigate the selection pressure, maximum likelihood estimations of positive selection were performed using the sitespecific models from the CODEML program implemented in the PAML 4.5 package [53] . Parameters for the models M0 (one ratio), M1a (neutral), M2a (selection), M7 (beta), M8 (beta and v (equivalent to Ka/Ks)) and M8a (beta and v = 1) were calculated. The M0 model assumes a uniform selective pressure among sites. The M1a model assumes a variable selective pressure but no positive selection. The M2a model assumes a variable selective pressure with positive selection. The M7 model assumes a betadistributed variable selective pressure. The M8 model assumes a beta-distributed variable selective pressure plus positive selection. The M8a assumes a beta distributed variable selective pressure without positive selection. Three likelihood ratio tests (LRTs) were compared using the following paired models: M1a-M2a, M7-M8 and M8a-M8.

To investigate changes in the selection pressure along the DEFA and DEFT sequences, amino acid identities and average pairwise Ka/Ks ratios were computed using a sliding window method with a window size of 10 residues and a step size of 5 residues. Within each window, the numbers of nonsynonymous and synonymous substitutions per site (denoted as Ka and Ks, respectively) were calculated using the Nei and Gojobori (1986) method incorporated into the KaKs_Calculator software [54] . The values of Ka/Ks were reanalyzed using a bootstrap test of 1000 replicates to assess the effect of potential biases from a few genes in the gene set and to test the statistical significance of the difference between the average Ka/Ks ratio and 1. Suppose there were N original sequences, the average Ka/Ks from a random resampling of N sequences was calculated, and the resampling process was repeated 1000 times. The histogram for the bootstrap estimates of average Ka/Ks showed a normal distribution, and the parameters of the normal distribution were calculated. The null hypothesis (H0) was that there was no difference between Ka/Ks and 1, and the alternative hypothesis (H1) was that there was a difference between Ka/Ks and 1. If the average Ka/Ks for the original sequences was larger than 1, the H0 was defined as ''Ka/ Ks#1'' and the H1 was defined as ''Ka/Ks.1.'' If the average Ka/Ks for the original sequences was smaller than 1, the H0 was defined as ''Ka/Ks$1'' and the H1 was defined as ''Ka/Ks,1.'' The p-value was calculated based on the parameters of the normal distribution.

Sequence logos were generated from the web server WebLogo [55] .

Structures of the aand h-defensins were searched using BlastP against the Protein Data Bank (PDB) database. One representative structure for each simian a-defensin cluster was analyzed, including human HNP1 (PDB code: 3GNY) [56] representing the DEFA1 cluster, human HNP4 (PDB code: 1ZMM) for the DEFA4 cluster, human HD5 (PDB code: 1ZMP) for the DEFA5 cluster and human HD6 (PDB code: 1ZMQ) for the DEFA6 cluster [34] . No native structures were solved for the DEFA8 and DEFA9 clusters; thus, homology models of the rhesus macaque DEFA8 and marmoset DEFA9a were built using the MODELER automodel method [57] implemented in the Discovery Studio 3.1 software. The corresponding template structures selected for this modeling were HNP1 (41.9% sequence identity with DEFA8) and HD5 (39.4% sequence identity with DEFA9). Monomers were aligned into dimers by superimposing four intermolecular hydrogen bonds between the backbone residues 18 and 20 (HNP4 numbering) through a customized TCL script running in the VMD 1.9 software [58] .

Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed following the method described below. The simulation system was parameterized by applying the standard AMBER force field ff99SB for bio-organic systems using the leap module implemented in the AmberTools 12 package [59] . The preparative processes included adding hydrogen atoms and disulfide bonds, neutralizing with counter ions (Cl-) and solvating in a periodic box with TIP3P water to at least a 10-Å distance around the protein. Molecular dynamics simulations were then performed using the NAMD 2.7 software [60] . The entire simulation process was composed of the following steps: minimization, heating, equilibration and production. Three rounds of energy minimization were performed by releasing the restraints in a stepwise fashion. In the first round, all protein atoms were constrained for 50,000 steps with 2.0 kcal/ (molNÅ 2 ) restraints. In the second round, only atoms of the backbone were restrained for 50,000 steps with 2.0 kcal/(molNÅ 2 ) restraints. In the third round, all atoms were relaxed for 100,000 steps. Short-range electrostatic and Van der Waals interactions were truncated at 9 Å , whereas long-range electrostatic forces were computed using the particle-mesh Ewald (PME) summation method. Next, the system was gently annealed from 0 to 310 K using a Langevin thermostat with a coupling coefficient of 5.0 ps 21 and employing a force constant with 2.0 kcal/(molNÅ 2 ) restraints. All subsequent steps were carried out in the isobaricisothermal NPT ensemble with a target pressure of 1 atm. Five rounds of equilibration (100 ps, each at 310 K) were performed with decreasing restraint weights from 2.0, 1.5, 1.0, 0.5 to 0.0 kcal/(molNÅ 2 ). By releasing all the restraints, the system was again equilibrated for 500 ps. After the final equilibration step, the production phase of MD was run without any restraints for a total of 16 ns.

Tertiary structures and electronic properties were analyzed after performing MD simulations. The flexibility of the dimer was evaluated using two distances and a dihedral angle involving four highly flexible residues. The distance between the C a atoms of residue 22 in each dimer (HNP4 numbering) was defined as A22C a -B22C a . The distance between the C a atoms of residue 11 in each dimer was defined as A11C a -B11C a . The dihedral angle was defined as A11C a -A22C a -B22C a -B11C a . Distances and dihedral angles were extracted using a customized TCL script program.

The electrostatic potential was mapped by averaging the last five frames of each MD trajectory using the APBS plugin [61] implemented in the VMD software.

The primate a-/h-defensin gene repertoires, which were identified from the published literature [19, 42, 62] and exhaustive genomic BlastN and BLAT searches, were manually checked. A total of 144 DEFA/DEFT sequences from primates were identified, including 105 functional genes and 39 pseudogenes. Moreover, 10 DEFA sequences from two species of treeshrews were collected and served as closely related outgroups for the primate sequences (Table S1 ). Almost one-third of the primate a-/h-defensin genes have lost their functional protein-coding ability because of nonsense or frame-shift mutations that have occurred during the process of rapid birth-and-death evolution. The translated amino acid sequences of functional genes were aligned with MUSCLE ( Figure S1 ). Most of the protein sequences are computationally translated from genome sequences rather than being demonstrated to be produced in vivo. The multiple sequence alignment shows that the mature peptide of a-defensins has a motif with six conserved cysteine residues, represented as C-x-C-x(3,4)-C-x(9)-Cx(6,9)-C, whereas the mature peptide of h-defensins has a nonapeptide motif with three conserved cysteine residues, represented as x-C-x-C-x(4)-C, with the exception of the Eastern black-and-white colobus h-defensin (cgue_DEFT), which has the motif x-C-x-C-x(8)-C.

To explore the evolutionary relationships among these defensin genes, phylogenetic trees were constructed based on nucleotide sequences from either the more conserved signal-prosegment region or the entire coding region, and the phylogenetic trees inferred by the BI, NJ and ML methods were combined ( Figure 1 ). All sequences are classified into major clades, which are referred to as the treeshrew, prosimian and simian clades based on the species included. In all the trees from the signal-prosegment region ( Figures 1A, S2 and S3), the simian defensins are classified into two major clades of tissue-specific expression profiles and are thus named simian myeloid a-defensins and simian enteric a-defensins. In all the trees from the entire coding region ( Figures 1B, S4 and S5), all sequences are separated into two groups, with group I containing the simian enteric a-defensins and the treeshrew clade 2 and group II containing the simian myeloid a-defensins and the treeshrew clade 1, which indicates a possible early duplication and divergence before the split of treeshrews and primates. However, for the prosimian clades, phylogenetic incongruence was observed. The tree inferred from the signal-prosegment region has two major prosimian clades ( Figure 1A ), whereas the tree inferred from the entire coding region divides the prosimian clade 2 into four groups ( Figure 1B ). Because incongruence between phylogenetic trees may result from the independence of evolutionary changes at different sites and the homogeneity of the substitution process [63] , the phylogenetic incongruence was further assessed by reconstructing the phylogenetic tree after removing the homogeneity sites. Some amino acid sites in the mature peptide were identified as homogeneity sites of convergent or parallel evolution ( Figure  S6 ). When those sites were removed, the prosimian a-defensins grouped together, suggesting that these convergent or parallel evolution sites have resulted in long-branch attraction such that distant clades grouped together.

The simian myeloid and enteric a-defensins are classified into seven clusters, which are named following the nomenclature used for human DEFA/DEFT genes. The simian myeloid a-defensins contain the DEFA1/DEFA3, DEFA8/DEFA10/DEFT, DEFA4 and DEFA7 clusters, and the simian enteric a-defensins contain the DEFA9/DEFA11, DEFA6 and DEFA5 clusters. The DEFA7 cluster contains only pseudogenes and is found only in Old World monkeys and hominoids. The other six gene clusters, each containing at least one functional gene, are functional gene clusters. All six functional gene clusters include species from New World monkeys, Old World monkeys and hominoids, suggesting that the duplication and diversification of these clusters occurred before the species differentiation of simians. The six functional gene clusters, which diverged prior to the simian differentiation, provide the genetic bases for the similar antimicrobial spectra in closely related simian species.

The DEFA9/DEFA11 cluster shows different topologies among the phylogenetic trees ( Figures S2 and S4 ). In the NJ and ML trees from the signal-prosegment region, the pseudogene DEFA11P and the DEFA9 from Old World monkeys and hominoids group into one cluster, and the DEFA9 from New Old monkeys is the outgroup. However, in the BI tree from signal-prosegment region and the BI/NJ/ML trees from the entire coding region, DEFA11P and DEFA9 form separate clusters. To further clarify the relationship between DEFA9 and DEFA11P, the sequence alignment from the complete gene including the intron was examined, and different patterns of sequence similarity were observed before and after a clear boundary in the genes. Therefore, phylogenetic trees were inferred based on either the sequences before the boundary (part I) or the sequences after the boundary (part II), using DEFA6 as the outgroup ( Figure S7 ). The trees based on part I show that DEFA11P is duplicated from DEFA9 after the split of New World and Old World monkeys, whereas the trees based on part II show that DEFA11P is the outgroup of all DEFA9. The different topologies indicate that the two parts of DEFA11P might be derived from different ancestors. The DEFA8 from Old World monkeys and hominoids also shows different phylogenetic positions among the phylogenetic trees ( Figures S2 and S4 ). In the NJ tree from the signal-prosegment region, the DEFA8 from Old World monkeys and hominoids clusters together with DEFA10/DEFT. However, in all the other trees, the DEFA8 from Old World monkeys and hominoids is the outgroup in the DEFA8/DEFA10/DEFT cluster. Similarly, different patterns of sequence similarity were observed before and after a clear boundary in the genes of this cluster. Phylogenetic trees suggest that part I and part II of the DEFA8 from Old World monkeys and hominoids might be derived from different ancestors ( Figure S8 ). The complicated phylogenetic relationships within both the DEFA9/DEFA11 cluster and the DEFA8/DEFA10/DEFT cluster imply that gene conversion or interlocus recombination might have occurred during the evolutionary process.

Unlike the DEFA genes, which are present in all primates, DEFT genes are present in only Old World monkeys and certain hominoids. Both the tree inferred from the entire coding region and the tree inferred from the signal-prosegment region show that DEFT groups together with DEFA10. DEFA10, which is present only in hominoids, is the basal clade in the DEFA10/DEFT cluster ( Figure 1 ). The relationship between DEFA10 and DEFT and the origin of DEFT were further analyzed using their introns. The BI/ NJ/ML trees from the introns support that DEFT and DEFA10 are grouped into separate clusters, and both clusters are derived from the duplication of DEFA8 ( Figure S9 ).

After identifying different clusters of primate a-/h-defensins, the pattern of natural selection operating on each cluster was examined using the site-specific models of heterogeneous selection pressure among sites. Likelihood ratio tests (LRTs) were carried out between models M1a (neutral) and M2a (selection), M7 (beta) and M8 (beta and v (equivalent to Ka/Ks)), and M8a (beta and v = 1) and M8 [53] . The models M2a and M8, which are significantly favored over the other models, indicate positive selection, and the positively selected sites with posterior probabilities greater than 0.95 are listed (Table 1 and S2). Positive selection is not significantly detected for every cluster. For the two prosimian clades and the simian DEFT, DEFA1 (including DEFA3), DEFA5 and DEFA8 (including DEFA10) clusters, positively selected sites are detected and are located primarily in the mature peptide. However, the simian DEFA4, DEFA6 and DEFA9 clusters are under purifying selection, and no positively selected site is detected. The different selection patterns among these clusters reflect their variant functional constraints. Therefore, the sequence divergence and structural variations among the six clusters (excluding the DEFA7 pseudogene cluster) were further investigated to understand their functional diversity, which most likely constitutes their antimicrobial spectra.

During the evolutionary process following gene duplication, due to functional divergence, the evolutionary rate of duplicated genes will initially increase and may subsequently shift with altered functional constraints (type I functional divergence) or remain at the original rate with no altered functional constraints (type II functional divergence) [50, 51, 64] . Type I and type II functional divergence patterns among simian myeloid and enteric a-defensins were examined using the Gu99 and Gu2013 methods ( Figure 2 ). Statistical analysis suggests that clusters of both simian myeloid adefensins and simian enteric a-defensins have significantly diverged (Figure 2A) . The pairwise coefficients of type I functional divergence (h ij ) are all significantly greater than 0 (p,0.05), except for the comparison between DEFA9 and DEFA6 (p = 0.07). The type I functional distance for each pair of clusters was estimated to measure whether one cluster has more shifted evolutionary rates than the other cluster following gene duplication [52] . The type I functional distance (d F ) ranges from 0.78 to 1.40 for the simian myeloid a-defensins (with the functional branch length of DEFA1, DEFA4 and DEFA8 being 0.94, 0.32 and 0.46, respectively) and from 0.69 to 3.93 for the simian enteric a-defensins (with the functional branch length of DEFA5, DEFA6 and DEFA9 being 3.41, 0.53 and 0.17, respectively). Type I functional distances among enteric a-defensins are much higher than among myeloid ones, except for the distance between DEFA9 and DEFA6. The enteric a-defensins have a higher level of functional divergence, which reflects a more challenging microbial environment in the gut. Critical amino acid sites responsible for the type I and type II functional divergences (hereafter referred to as type I and type II sites, respectively) were detected ( Figure 2B and C). For simian myeloid a-defensin clusters, the type I sites of DEFA1 are located in the mature peptide, whereas the type I sites of DEFA8 and DEFA4 are located in the signal-prosegment ( Figure 2D ). The different locations of the type I sites among simian myeloid adefensin clusters suggest a specific altered functional constraint on the mature peptide of DEFA1. For simian enteric a-defensin clusters, the type I sites of DEFA5 are located in the signalprosegment, whereas the type I sites of DEFA9 and DEFA6 are primarily located in the mature peptide. This result indicates a specific altered functional constraint on the signal-prosegment region of DEFA5. Therefore, different clusters of a-defensins have undergone various functional constraints and have likely been specialized in their antimicrobial spectra. No site corresponding to the type I or type II functional divergence was detected between simian myeloid a-defensins and simian enteric a-defensins because of the high level of divergence within both clades.

The dimerization and the cationic and amphipathic properties of the a-defensin structures are important for their antimicrobial activities [2, 33, [35] [36] [37] ; hence, these characters of the representative structures from six clusters were analyzed. The a-defensin dimers were superimposed based on the backbone residues 18 and 20, which form four pairs of intermolecular hydrogen bonds ( Figure 3A and B) . These superimposed dimers include the myeloid a-defensins DEFA1 (human HNP1), DEFA4 (human HNP4) and DEFA8 (modeled rhesus macaque DEFA8) and the enteric a-defensins DEFA5 (human HD5), DEFA6 (human HD6) and DEFA9 (modeled marmoset DEFA9a). The b-sheets overlap well, whereas the two loops connecting b1-b2 strands and b2-b3 strands show structural variation. Residues 11 and 22 represent the most distal amino acids on the two flexible loops. Thus, the distances of A22C a -B22C a and A11C a -B11C a , as well as the dihedral angle of A11C a -A22C a -B22C a -B11C a , were monitored in molecular dynamics simulations (see Materials and Methods) to assess their structural variation ( Figure 3B ). The distance of Figure 1 . Phylogenetic trees of the a-/h-defensin (DEFA/DEFT) genes in primates and treeshrews. A: Phylogenetic tree of primate and treeshrew DEFA/DEFT genes based only on the signal-prosegment region. The BI tree is selected as the background tree. The major clades or clusters having similar topologies from all three tree-building methods (BI, NJ and ML) are combined and labeled with the BI posterior probabilities and the bootstrap support values from the NJ and ML analyses. Primate DEFA/DEFT genes are clustered into prosimian and simian clades. The simian clades are classified and named following the nomenclature used for the human DEFA/DEFT genes. The ''P'' in node labels denotes a pseudogene, and the ''U'' indicates a gene with an ambiguous locus from the species in the synteny map in Figure 7 . B: Phylogenetic tree of primate and treeshrew DEFA/ DEFT genes based the entire coding region. The BI tree is selected as the background tree. The treeshrew DEFA genes are the outgroups of the two separate clades. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0097425.g001 A22C a -B22C a is almost equal among the six dimers ( Figure 3C ), suggesting that the dimers are not separated into monomers and remain stable during the 16-nanosecond molecular dynamics simulation. The distance of A11C a -B11C a ranges from 30 Å to 37 Å , and the dihedral angle of A11C a -A22C a -B22C a -B11C a ranges from 75u to 120u ( Figure 3C and D) , showing significant variations in these dimer structures and providing a structural foundation for their different antimicrobial activities. In addition to dimerization, the surface electrostatic potentials of simian enteric and myeloid a-defensins create distinct cationic and amphipathic patterns ( Figure 3E) , which likely affect their membrane depolarization and permeabilization abilities through electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions with microbial membranes.

The h-defensins are cyclic octadecapeptides formed by the head-to-tail ligation of two nonapeptides that can be homodimeric or heterodimeric to increase their diversity [62, 65] Figure 4A) , which shows both a conserved cysteine pattern and a conserved hydrophilic/ hydrophobic pattern. The conserved cysteines at positions 2, 4 and 9 of the consensus motif form the tridisulfide ladder that has been proven to be important for structural stability but not for antimicrobial activity [66] . Positions 1, 5 and 6 are mostly cationic and hydrophilic arginine residues, whereas positions 3, 7 and 8 are mostly hydrophobic residues. The side chains of arginine residues and the tridisulfide ladder are on opposite sides of the cyclic backbone plane and thus form a polarized structure. The conserved hydrophilic/hydrophobic pattern generates the cationic and amphipathic properties, which might play a major role in the membrane depolarization and permeabilization of target cells or enveloped viruses. The cationic and amphipathic properties of hdefensins, like a-defensins, have been reported to be important for antimicrobial activities by disrupting microbial membrane structures [2, 33] .

Sites 3I and 5R in the nonapeptides (corresponding to 67I and 69R in the full sequence) were found to be under significant positive selection ( Table 1 ). The surface electronic potentials for two types of h-defensin homodimers, (RCICRRGVC) 2 that is under positive selection and (RCVCTRGVC) 2 that is not under positive selection ( Figure 4B ), were analyzed based on molecular dynamics simulations. The surface electronic potentials exhibit differences that may affect the polarization of h-defensin,

suggesting that the positively selected sites are related to the antimicrobial function of h-defensin. Adaptive changes in the prosegment coevolving with the new protein fold of the mature peptide

The h-defensins are the youngest members of the defensin family. A premature stop codon mutation in the mature peptide gives birth to the h-defensin, which contains a new protein fold that is different from that of a-defensins. The selection patterns along the length of DEFA and DEFT were examined to check whether there were any adaptive changes in the signal-prosegment region that are related to the new protein fold. For this purpose, a sliding window method for the amino acid identity and the Ka/Ks was used to analyze the selection pressures on different regions of all DEFA, DEFT and separate DEFA clusters ( Figure 5 , Table S3 ). Furthermore, bootstrap tests for the Ka/Ks were performed to assess the effect of potential biases from a few genes in the gene set and to test the significance of the difference between the average Ka/Ks ratio and 1.

The amino acid identities decrease from the signal peptide and prosegment to the mature peptide for both DEFA and DEFT ( Figure 5A and B) . The signal peptide is the most conserved region, whereas the mature peptide is highly divergent. This result also supported our rationale for inferring a phylogenetic tree using the more conserved signal-prosegment region ( Figure 1A [29] , it is most likely that the prosegment of h-defensins has undergone adaptive changes that are related to the new protein fold. The diagram in Figure 6 presents our proposed hypothesis for this evolutionary pattern and illustrates the adaptive evolution of the prosegment along with the new protein fold of the mature peptide.

To understand the evolutionary dynamics of the a-/h-defensin multigene family, the comparative synteny map from five simian species, including humans, chimpanzees, orangutans, macaques and marmosets, was analyzed and was combined with the phylogenetic results. The primate DEFA/DEFT genes originate from tandem duplication and are located in the regions homologous to the human chromosome 8p23 ( Figure 7A ). Conserved synteny relationships are observed among the five simian species. The DEFA5 orthologs are located at the 59 terminus, and the DEFA9, DEFA8, DEFA4 and DEFA6 orthologs are located at the 39 terminus in a 59 to 39 order. The simian myeloid and enteric DEFA genes, which are clustered into distinct clades in both phylogenetic trees (Figure 1 ), are not located as two clearly separated blocks in the synteny map. Loci of the genes from the two major clades (simian enteric and myeloid defensins) are intermingled, implying that duplication of a segment containing two or more genes has occurred. Orthologs from some species have mutated into pseudogenes, which include DEFA6P in the marmoset; DEFA9P in the macaque, orangutan, chimpanzee and human; and DEFA8P in the orangutan, chimpanzee and human. In the phylogenetic trees, genes from the same species group together in each simian cluster (Figure 1) , indicating speciesspecific duplication, which is a common phenomenon during the birth-and-death evolution of multigene families. In the synteny map ( Figure 7A ), species-specific duplication is not homogeneous across this region, with the middle section having more speciesspecific duplications. Based on the current versions of assembled genomes, the marmoset has multiple duplications of DEFA8 and DEFA9, and the macaque has multiple duplications of DEFT. In the orangutan, chimpanzee and human, there are several speciesspecific duplications of DEFA1 and DEFA10/DEFT.

A nonsense mutation at codon 17 of DEFT results in its loss of function in orangutans, chimpanzees and humans ( Figure 7B ), and these DEFTP pseudogenes contain the hspi_DEFT1P, hspi_-DEFT2P, ptro_DEFT1P, ptro_DEFT2P and pabe_DEFT4P (excluding the pabe_DEFT2P pseudogene which is generated by frameshift mutations). In humans, chimpanzees and gorillas, the DEFT has been lost, and only DEFTP pseudogenes have been maintained. Our results demonstrate that h-defensin had a conserved structural motif and was under positive selection. Therefore, the driving force for the expansion of the pseudogene DEFTP and for the loss of functionally important h-defensins in humans and chimpanzees were investigated. A less-is-hitchhiking hypothesis was proposed based on the synteny map and phylogenetic relationships. The synteny map suggests that the loci of the DEFA1 and the DEFT/DEFA10 are linked and have been duplicated together in orangutans, chimpanzees and humans ( Figure 7A ). The genes of the DEFA1 cluster are all functional and are under positive selection; thus, we infer that each box in the synteny map contains a driver from the DEFA1 cluster and a hitchhiker from the DEFT/DEFA10 cluster. The orangutan has multiple copies of functional DEFT as well as the pseudogene pabe_DEFT4P containing the nonsense mutation at site 17 ( Figure 7A and B) . This result suggests that, in the ancestor of the orangutan, chimpanzee and human, the selection pressure on the multiple-copied DEFT was relaxed and the pseudogene DEFTP (containing the nonsense mutation at site 17) emerged. Both DEFT and DEFTP are linked to DEFA1 and can expand, but only DEFTP (containing the nonsense mutation at site 17) is maintained, whereas DEFT is lost in the chimpanzees and humans ( Figure 7A ). The retention of DEFTP and loss of DEFT might be independent of their own fitness and depends on the fate of the driver. The pabe_DEFT4P is linked to the pabe_DEFA1g, which harbors a significantly positively selected site whose expansion might be advantageous: 74I, adjacent to the third cysteine. This 74I is not present in other pabe_DEFA1 (a, b, c, d and f) sequences (Table 1, Figure S1 ). Therefore, the DEFTP is linked to a DEFA1, whose expansion might be advantageous.

The less-is-hitchhiking hypothesis depicts the evolutionary process of the expansion of the pseudogene DEFTP and the loss of functional h-defensin in the humans and chimpanzees (Figure 8 ). With the expansion of the gene (driver) under positive selection, the adjacent linked gene (hitchhiker) is duplicated in the process of segmental duplication. The pseudogenization of the hitchhiker occurs in an ancestral species following the duplication process. During the birth-and-death evolution, the hitchhiker that gains more copies may be either the pseudogene or the functional gene, which is determined by the fate of its adjacent driver. The former scenario is the less-is-hitchhiking hypothesis. The less-is-more, lessis-less and less-is-nothing hypotheses depend on the phenotypic change of the loss-of-function variant, which can be advantageous, deleterious or tolerated, respectively. However, the less-is-hitchhiking hypothesis provides another explanation for the driving force of the loss-of-function variant expansion that does not involve phenotypic consequences. The fate of the loss-of-function hitchhiker is determined by the surrounding genomic environment of a driver gene (i.e., an adjacent gene under positive selection). The loss-of-function hitchhiker can be advantageous, deleterious or tolerated.

In this study, we collected the primate DEFA/DEFT gene repertoires and performed extensive analyses of the primate a-/hdefensin multigene family. Through systematic phylogenetic analyses, a detailed classification and nomenclature of the primate a-/h-defensins was provided. The classification of simian a-/hdefensins based on phylogenetic trees is related to their expression patterns in myeloid and enteric tissues. Further phylogenetic classification of simian a-defensins into six functional gene clusters corresponds to their functional divergence. In a previous study, this multigene family was classified into three classes based on neighbor-joining (NJ) and maximum parsimony (MP) trees using genes from simians that included human, chimpanzee, orangutan, macaque and marmoset sequences as well as one mouse adefensin sequence as the outgroup [42] . A recent study focused on the phylogenetic relationships of the a-, band h-defensins using DEFA/DEFT sequences from 10 primate species and two human DEFB sequences as the outgroup based on the NJ method [69] . In our study, we identified 144 primate DEFA/DEFT sequences from 16 species of simians and prosimians as well as 10 DEFA sequences from two treeshrews, which are closely related to primates. We used sequence alignments of both the more conserved signalprosegment region and the entire coding region to more precisely reconstruct a-/h-defensin orthologous relationships and to uncover their potential functional divergence.

The primate DEFA/DEFT sequences that are used for this study were collected from the public database, which may contain errors or uncertainty of the sequencing and assembly. One of such ambiguous sequences might be the pabe_DEFA10c sequence, which is highly similar to the pabe_DEFT sequences and is phylogenetically far from the DEFA10 cluster ( Figure 1A and S8 ). This sequence is named DEFA10 only because site 77 is not a premature stop codon. Thus, pabe_DEFA10c was excluded in the phylogenetic analysis based on the introns from DEFA8/DEFA10/ DEFT ( Figure S9 ). For the analysis of positive selection using PAML, sequencing and assembly errors may cause bias. Our results of PAML analysis for separate clusters show that most of the positively selected sites are located in the mature peptide, similar to the results of a previous study that analyzed all the DEFA sequences together [42] . For the sliding window analysis of Ka/ Ks, we used a bootstrap method to eliminate the effect of potential bias from the sequencing and assembly error in a few genes. For the synteny analysis, there are sequences (cjac_DEFA9cU and cjac_DEFA9dU) that are not mapped onto the chromosomes of the marmoset. In macaques, several sequences (mmul_7bUP, mmul_-DEFA5bU, mmul_DEFA5cU, mmul_DEFA5dU and mmul_DEFA5eU) are mapped onto a chromosome region that is quite far from the defensin gene locus presented in the synteny map. The human, chimpanzee, orangutan, macaque and marmoset genomes were selected for the synteny analysis because of their more complete assemblies in the genomic region harboring the DEFA1 and DEFA8/DEFA10/DEFT gene cluster, whereas the gorilla and gibbon genomes were not used due to the poor assembly in this region.

The functional shifting of simian a-defensins, which is implied by their sequence divergence, structural variation and selection pattern differences among the six functional gene clusters, most likely corresponds to differentiated antimicrobial activity. However, orthologs within the same gene cluster from different species are still under functional constraints, most likely due to their similar antimicrobial mechanisms and challenges from similar types of pathogens in closely related species. Based on these results, we speculate that these defensin clusters constitute a wide range of antimicrobial spectra and that each cluster occupies one part of the spectra. Within each cluster, there is species-specific cluster duplication or pseudogenization following the species diversifications of simians, which implies that the antimicrobial spectra are continuously changing. At the same time, deconstructing the undocumented antimicrobial spectra of a-/h-defensins is not feasible, even for the most closely related species, because of the countless types of pathogens and the frequent duplication and divergence of defensins. Many experimental studies have shown that members of this family have different antimicrobial activities and are effective against different groups of microbes. For example, the antibacterial activity and specificity of the six human a-defensins against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria are different [70] . For human myeloid defensins, HNP1-3 defensins are of greater potencies than HNP4 against Gram-positive bacteria such as S. aureus, whereas HNP4 is of greater potency against Gram-negative bacteria such as E. coli and E. aerogenes. For human enteric defensins, HD5 is effective against both Gramnegative and Gram-positive bacteria, whereas HD6 shows significantly lower antimicrobial activity against Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria than HD5. The myeloid a-/hdefensins and the enteric HD5 have also been reported to have inhibitory potential against enveloped and non-enveloped viruses, such as the herpes simplex virus [71] , the human immunodeficiency virus [72, 73] , papillomaviruses [74] , adenoviruses [75] , polyomaviruses [76] , the SARS coronavirus [77] , influenza viruses [78, 79] and others. In addition to its role in host defense, HD5 also has a homeostatic role in establishing and maintaining the intestinal microbiota [80] . Overall, these experimental studies indicate that the variable antimicrobial abilities of mammalian a-/ h-defensins compose an antimicrobial spectrum. Defensins with continuously shifting antimicrobial activity, together with other versatile antimicrobial factors, evolve to act as the first line of defense of the innate immune system and play important roles in the early host defense. Because of the therapeutic potential of antimicrobial peptides, synthetic defensins are being developed as peptide drugs, such as the fusion inhibitors. Exploring the natural defensin repertories, especially in species closely related to humans, will help us understand the stability and plasticity of a-/h-defensins and aid in designing potent peptide drugs.

The sliding window analysis of DEFT ( Figure 5B ) suggests that fragment 41-50 in the prosegment and fragment 66-75 in the mature peptide are under positive selection. These two fragments contain the positively selected sites detected by PAML (50D, 67I and 69R, corresponding to the sliding window sites 49, 66 and 68, respectively). Other amino acid changes that may contribute to the high Ka/Ks value are 41G/E, 45S/A and 48R/W in fragment 41-50 as well as 69R/L, 71V/I/F and 73R/Q in fragment 66-75 ( Figure S1 ). To be spliced into an 18-residue mature h-defensin, the three C-terminal residues must be removed during the maturation process [18] . The three C-terminal residues were not dashed lines, suggesting that these DEFTP pseudogenes are derived from a common ancestor. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0097425.g007 Figure 8 . The less-is-hitchhiking hypothesis during the birthand-death evolution of multigene families. With the expansion of the gene (driver) under positive selection, the adjacent linked gene (hitchhiker) is duplicated in the process of segmental duplication. Pseudogenization of the hitchhiker occurs in an ancestral species following the duplication process. During the process of birth-anddeath evolution, the hitchhiker that gains more copies can be either the pseudogene or the functional gene with the other one being lost, and the gain or loss of the hitchhiker is determined by the fitness of its adjacent driver. The expansion of the pseudogene and loss of the functional gene scenario is defined as the less-is-hitchhiking hypothesis. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0097425.g008

Evolution of a-/h-Defensin in Primates found to be under positive selection using the PAML software. However, the three C-terminal residues of h-defensin show a pattern of RLL or QLL that is quite different from the a-defensins ( Figure S1 ), which might be related to their involvement in the maturation process of h-defensins.

Multigene families play important roles in the immune system, the sensory system, development and other processes. These families can express gene products at high levels, such as highly conserved histones and nuclear ribosomal RNAs, and produce proteins with diverse functional spectra, such as a-defensins, major histocompatibility complex proteins, immunoglobulins, chemoreceptors and olfactory receptors. The evolutionary processes of multigene families have been explained by birth-and-death evolutionary models [43] . Frequent gene conversion, interlocus recombination, gene duplication and pseudogenization are involved in the evolutionary processes of multigene families. Strong purifying selection or positive selection can also act on multigene families to conserve gene function or give rise to new adaptive phenotypes. The expansion of genes under selection through segmental duplications may impact the fate of the adjacent genes linked with them, which can also affect the evolution of multigene families. Our less-is-hitchhiking hypothesis depicts this phenomenon that the retention of pseudogenes and the loss of functional gene are determined by the fate of the adjacent gene during the birth-and-death evolutionary process. We believe that the expansion of the DEFTP pseudogene and the loss of functional h-defensins in humans and chimpanzees is a representative case for the less-is-hitchhiking hypothesis based on the following criteria. First, the driver and the hitchhiker belong to phylogenetically separate clusters. Second, the driver and the hitchhiker are genetically linked and duplicate together on the chromosome. Third, positive selection acts on the functional drivers. Lastly, the pseudogene hitchhiker expands and the functional hitchhiker has been lost, as determined by the fitness of the driver.

Recently, it has been demonstrated that genetic hitchhiking is pervasive and the mutational cohort that includes both the driver and the hitchhikers drives adaptation [81] . Although these hitchhikers mostly refer to point mutations, there are few reports of an entire gene being a hitchhiker, with one exception reported for the yellow monkey flower (Mimulus guttatus), in which a copper tolerance locus under selection and its tightly linked hybrid incompatibility locus spread to fixation in a copper mine population by genetic hitchhiking [82, 83] . Future research on the evolution of genetic hitchhiking involving two or more closely linked genes from both case studies and whole-genome comparisons will help to uncover the adaptation of complex traits from linked genes and to understand the genetic and evolutionary basis of certain disease-related traits during the hitchhiking processes. Figure S1 Multiple sequence alignment of the primate a-/h-defensins. Most of the protein sequences are computationally translated from genome sequences rather than being demonstrated to be produced in vivo. The mature peptide of adefensins has a motif with six conserved cysteine residues, represented as C-x-C-x(3,4)-C-x(9)-C-x(6,9)-C. A nonsense mutation at position 77 (Q77*) generates a h-defensin precursor with three conserved cysteines. The mature peptide of h-defensins has a nonapeptide motif with three conserved cysteine residues, represented as x-C-x-C-x(4)-C, with the exception of the Eastern black-and-white colobus h-defensin (cgue_DEFT), which has the motif x-C-x-C-x(8)-C. The nonsense mutation at position 17 (Q17*) results in the loss of the downstream protein-coding ability of the h-defensins. The initial methionines (M) and conserved cysteines (C) in the alignment are highlighted in blue. The translational ends (*) of the h-defensin are highlighted in magenta. The blocks highlight the sliding windows of fragments 41-50 and 65-75 of DEFT, which are detected with Ka/Ks .1 (P,0.05) in Figure 5 . The question marks indicate ambiguous amino acids because of the single nucleotide polymorphisms from the genome sequences. The genus and species for each abbreviation can be found in Table S1 . (PDF) The BI tree is selected as the background tree. The major clades or clusters having similar topologies from all three tree-building methods (BI, NJ and ML) are combined and labeled with the BI posterior probabilities and the bootstrap support values from the NJ and ML analyses. (PDF) Figure S6 Phylogenetic incongruence is caused by the long-branch attraction of homogeneity sites. The homogeneity sites under convergent or parallel evolution in the mature peptide (62, 63, 64, 65, 68, 71, 77, 81, 88, 89, 92 and 93) are highlighted in different colors. These homogeneity sites can cause phylogenetic incongruence between the trees constructed using the entire coding region versus the signal-prosegment region. The phylogenetic tree on the left is inferred based on the amino acid sequences of the entire coding region using NJ method without removing the homogeneity sites, whereas the tree on the right is built using NJ method after removing the homogeneity sites. When the long-branch attraction effect is eliminated, the sequences of the prosimian DEFA clade 2 group together. (PDF) Figure S7 The different phylogenetic relationships of DEFA9/DEFA11 are determined by different parts of the gene. A: Different patterns of sequence similarity are observed before and after a clear boundary in the DEFA9/DEFA11 genes, namely part I and part II. Phylogenetic trees are separately inferred from part I (the tree on the left) and part II (the tree on the right), using the DEFA6 cluster as the outgroup. The combined tree based on part I shows that DEFA11 is duplicated from DEFA9 after the split of New World and Old World monkeys. Whereas, in the combined tree of part II, DEFA11 is the outgroup of all DEFA9 sequences. The BI tree is computed using the GTR + G + I (4 categories) model.

A: Different patterns of sequence similarity are also observed before and after a clear boundary in the DEFA8/ DEFA10/DEFT genes, which is different from that of DEFA9/ DEFA11 genes. Similarly, phylogenetic trees are separately inferred from part I (the tree on the left) and part II (the tree on the right), using the DEFA1 cluster as the outgroup. In the combined tree inferred from part I, the DEFA8 from Old World monkeys and hominoids clusters together with DEFA10/DEFT. Whereas in the tree inferred from part II, the DEFA8 from Old World monkeys and hominoids is the outgroup in the DEFA8/ DEFA10/DEFT cluster. The BI tree is computed using the GTR + G + I (4 categories) model. The NJ tree is computed using the K2 + G (shape parameter = 1.5 for part I and 2.0 for part II) model. The ML tree is computed using the K2 + G (4 categories) model. The sequence pabe_DEFA10c is clustered with DEFT, likely resulting from sequence assembly error. Thus, the sequence pabe_DEFA10c was excluded in following analysis in Figure S9 . B: The BI/NJ/ML trees with branch lengths proportional to the estimated distances inferred from part I.

The DEFA10 and DEFT are clustered into independent groups and are both derived from the duplication of DEFA8 before the divergence of Old World monkeys and hominoids. But the DEFA10 is lost in the ancestor of Old World monkeys. The BI tree is computed using the GTR + G + I (4 categories) model. The NJ tree is computed using the K2 + G (shape parameter = 1.8) model. The ML tree is computed using the K2 + G (4 categories) model.

Full-Genome Characterization and Genetic Evolution of West African Isolates of Bagaza Virus,"Bagaza virus is a mosquito-borne flavivirus, first isolated in 1966 in Central African Republic. It has currently been identified in mosquito pools collected in the field in West and Central Africa. Emergence in wild birds in Europe and serological evidence in encephalitis patients in India raise questions on its genetic evolution and the diversity of isolates circulating in Africa. To better understand genetic diversity and evolution of Bagaza virus, we describe the full-genome characterization of 11 West African isolates, sampled from 1988 to 2014. Parameters such as genetic distances, N-glycosylation patterns, recombination events, selective pressures, and its codon adaptation to human genes are assessed. Our study is noteworthy for the observation of N-glycosylation and recombination in Bagaza virus and provides insight into its Indian origin from the 13th century. Interestingly, evidence of Bagaza virus codon adaptation to human house-keeping genes is also observed to be higher than those of other flaviviruses well known in human infections. Genetic variations on genome of West African Bagaza virus could play an important role in generating diversity and may promote Bagaza virus adaptation to other vertebrates and become an important threat in human health.","Bagaza virus (BAGV) belongs to the Flaviridae family, Flavivirus genus and Ntaya serological group. BAGV is a mosquito-transmitted virus, which was first isolated in the Bagaza district of the Central African Republic (CAR), in 1966, from a pool of mixed-species female Culex spp. mosquitoes during entomological investigations [1] . As is characteristic of flaviviruses, BAGV possesses a linear single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome [2] . The BAGV genome is 10,941 nucleotides in length, encoding a single polyprotein (3426 amino acids) from which 11 viral proteins are derived, and flanked by 5 and 3 untranslated regions (UTRs) of 94 and 556 nt, respectively [3] .

BAGV has been isolated repeatedly with a high titer from different species of mosquitoes in Central and West African countries [4] [5] [6] , and in India, where serological investigations suggested subclinical infections in humans [7, 8] . Despite this widespread circulation of BAGV, outbreaks involving humans or animals have not yet been reported from these countries. Subsequently, in September 2010, BAGV was associated with a high mortality among game birds (Partridges and pheasants) in southern Spain, the first detection of BAGV in Europe and the first isolation from a vertebrate host [9, 10] . However, it is not surprising that BAGV infects birds since it has been shown to be synonymous with Israel turkey 

All 11 virus strains analyzed in this study were derived from the WHO Collaborating Center (http://apps.who.int/whocc/Detail.aspx?cc_ref=SEN-5&cc_code=sen) for arboviruses and viral hemorrhagic viruses in Senegal at Institut Pasteur de Dakar (Dakar, Senegal) ( Table 2 ). Viral stocks were prepared by inoculating viral strains into Aedes albopictus (C6/36) cell line in Leibovitz 15 (L-15) growth medium Viruses 2018, 10, 193 3 of 26 (GibcoBRL, Grand Island, NY, USA) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (GibcoBRL, Grand Island, NY, USA), 10% Tryptose Phosphate and antibiotics (Sigma, Gmbh, Germany). BAGV infection was confirmed after 4 days of propagation by immunofluorescence assay (IFA) using specific hyper-immune mouse ascitic fluid, as previously described [15] . Cultures supernatants were collected for virus RNA isolation. Extraction of viral RNA from supernatants was performed with the QIAamp viral RNA mini kit (Qiagen, Heiden, Germany) according to manufacturer's instructions. Extracted RNA was frozen at −80 • C prior to downstream applications. 

Real-time RT-PCR (Reverse Transcriptase-Polymerase Chain Reaction) was performed using the Quantitect ® Probe RT-PCR Kit (Qiagen, Heiden, Germany) in a final volume of 25 µL following previously established protocols and primers [16] . Reverse-transcription was performed using the AMV kit (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) following manufacturer's instructions and cDNA were stored at −20 • C. The polymerase chain reaction with each primer set was carried out in a final volume of 50 µL using the GoTaq ® DNA polymerase kit (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) according to manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 5 µL (around 10 µg) of cDNA was added to 45 µL of a RT-PCR mix containing 25 mM MgCl2, 10 mM of dNTP, 5X reaction buffer, 5 U Gotaq polymerase, 16.5 µL of nuclease-free water and 40 pmols of each primer (Sense and Antisense). PCR was carried using the following conditions: an initial incubation at 95 • C for 5 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95 • C for 1 min, 1 min at melting temperature of primers, and 72 • C according to the length of PCR product and 72 • C during 10 min. Subsequently, 5 µL of each PCR product was analyzed by gel electrophoresis on 1% agarose gels stained with ethidium bromide to check the size of amplified fragments by comparison to a DNA molecular weight marker (HyperLadder™ 1 kb, Bioline, Taunton, MA, USA). The DNA bands from the PCR amplification were purified (QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit, Qiagen, Heiden, Germany) and sequenced from both ends for each positive sample (Beckmann Coulter, High Wycombe, UK). Sequencing of the 5 and 3 termini of the viral genome was performed using a 5 RACE kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and a 3 RACE kit (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) following the manufacturer's protocols. Additional sequences representing strains from Central African Republic, India, strain related to Spanish wild bird's outbreak in 2010, the ITV and the Ntaya virus were obtained from GenBank, with the following accession numbers, respectively: AY632545, EU684972, HQ644143, KC734549 and NC_018705.

Full-length genome sequences BAGV isolates were obtained by assembling overlapping nucleotide sequences using the Unipro UGENE software (http://ugene.net/download.html) [17] . Multiple alignments of full-genome sequences were carried out by using Muscle algorithm (http://www.drive5.com/muscle/) [18] within Unipro UGENE software. Based on these alignments, we investigated the genetic properties of these different isolates circulating in West Africa, such as genome length and location of main conserved amino acid motifs previously described in mosquito-borne flaviviruses (MBFVs) with sometimes mutations which include no physicochemical properties changes [3] . Comparatively, conservation of these motifs was also assessed in Culex flavivirus (CxFV) and Aedes flavivirus (AeFV) (insect-specific flaviviruses; (ISFs)) and in Modoc virus (ModV) and Rio Bravo virus (RBV) (Vertebrate-specific flaviviruses, also known as no known vector flaviviruses (NKVFs)). We also searched for evidence of informative amino acid sites among BAGV sequences using the DIVEIN web server (https://indra.mullins.microbiol.washington.edu/DIVEIN/) [19] . The genetic divergence between previously available BAGV complete genomes and new characterized sequences was also assessed at the nucleotide and protein levels.

Prediction of N-glycosylated sites on the genome of BAGV were performed by submitting complete polyproteins on online version of NetNGlyc 1.0 Server (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/ NetNGlyc/). N-linked glycosylation is a post-translational event whereby carbohydrates are added to Asparagines, which occur in the consensus sequence Asn-Xaa-Ser/Thr, where Xaa is any amino acid except proline. ""Potential"" scores of predicted N-glycosylated sites across the protein chain from N-to C-terminal were illustrated using the default threshold of 0.5 and the ""jury agreement"" indicates how many of the nine networks support the prediction [20] .

The RNAz method [21] implemented in the Vienna RNA Websuite (http://rna.tbi.univie.ac.at/) [22] was used to detect thermodynamically stable and evolutionarily conserved structural RNA domains on complete non-coding regions of the 11 West African BAGV isolates characterized in this study and the isolates from Spain and CAR, because complete non-coding sequences are not currently available for the isolate from India. The RNAz method use an algorithm which testing a large set of well-known conserved structural RNA domains and reports a ""RNA classification probability"" or p-value as a measure of thermodynamic stability. Structural RNA domains with p > 0.5 are classified as stable [21] . Furthermore, the optimal secondary structures were predicted with a minimum free energy using the RNAalifold method [23] implemented also in the Vienna RNA Websuite that use a dynamic programming algorithm with RNA parameters as previously described [24] . Furthermore, previously described organization of conserved sequences (CS) [3] was analyzed on predicted secondary structures of the 3 UTR, considering possible repetitions of these CS. Thus, a conserved sequence was considered as imperfect when it presented three or more differences with corresponding consensus sequence previously described [3] , marked by a deletion, an insertion, or a substitution.

A Bayesian phylogenetic analysis for estimation of data quality and selection of the best-fit nucleotide substitution model were performed using Mega 6.0 (https://www.megasoftware.net/) with a discrete Gamma distribution (+G) with 5 rate categories. Thus, a total of 24 different nucleotide substitution models were tested and model with the lowest BIC score (Bayesian Information Criterion) was considered to describe the best substitution pattern. Further parameters as AICc value (Akaike Information Criterion, corrected) and Maximum Likelihood value (lnL) are also estimated [25] . A maximum likelihood tree was then constructed with complete polyprotein sequences from insect-specific flaviviruses, no known vector flaviviruses, tick-born flaviviruses, mosquito-borne flaviviruses, the 11 ORFs from new characterized West African BAGV isolates and BAGV sequences previously available from Spain (HQ644143-4, KR108244-6), India (EU684972) and CAR (AY632545). Tree was inferred using FastTree v2.1.7 (http://www.microbesonline.org/fasttree/) [26] , where nucleotide substitution was modeled using General Time-Reversible with a proportion of invariant sites (GTR+I). Nodes were labeled with local support values, which were computed with the Shimodaira-Hasegawa test (SH-like) for 5000 replications. Topology was visualized by FigTree v.1.4.2 (http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree/).

To prevent potential biases during phylogenetic inference due to recombination, all polyprotein sequences were analyzed using seven methods (RDP, GENECONV, MaxChi, BootScan, Chimaera, SiScan, and 3Seq) implemented in the Recombination Detection Program (RDP4beta 4.8) to uncover evidence for recombination events [27] . The disentangle recombination signals option was ""on"" and the linear sequence setting was used. The remaining settings were kept at their default values. Only events with p-values < 1 × 10 −6 that were detected by four or more methods were considered to represent strong evidence for recombination using 100 permutations and the Bonferroni correction [28] implemented in the RDP4 program to prevent false positive results. A chi-square test was used to determine if the sequence identity between a recombinant isolate and a given parent was significantly different both inside and outside the recombinant region. In addition, a BootScan analysis including the recombinant and the parental strains determined above was also performed to confirm these putative recombination events. The occurrence of recombination in BAGV genomes was also investigated with a method called Genetic Algorithms for Recombination Detection (GARD) implemented in Datamonkey web server (http://datamonkey.org) [29] , that estimates breakpoints based on a genetic algorithm. The statistical significance of putative breakpoints was evaluated through Kishino-Hasegawa (HK) tests; breakpoints were considered significant if their p value was <0.05. Separate Neighbor-Joining (NJ) trees were constructed for identified putative recombinant region and non-recombinant alignment partitions dictated by the breakpoint locations. Phylogenetic trees were inferred using the percentage of 1000 bootstrap replications under the appropriate model of nucleotide substitution.

Recombination can mislead inference of positive natural selection if it is not properly accounted for. If recombination was identified, these potential recombinant sequences were excluded from further analyses to avoid inferential biases [30] . The non-synonymous/synonymous rate ratio (dN/dS) is a widely used method to detect positive selection. The statistical test dN/dS permitted to distinguish diversifying or positive selection (dN/dS > 1) from negative or purifying selection (dN/dS < 1). Positive selection is inferred when the rate of non-synonymous (dN) substitutions is higher than that of synonymous (dS) substitutions (dN > dS). Episodes of positive selection in each gene of BAGV were analyzed using methods of estimation among individual sites and internal sites on branches of the phylogenetic tree. For this, a total of 9 alignment partitions were performed corresponding to C, prM, E, NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B and NS5 proteins. As site model, we used the single-likelihood ancestor counting (SLAC) that estimated the difference between non-synonymous (dN) and synonymous (dS) rates per codon site at 0.1 significance level. The fast unconstrained Bayesian approximation (FUBAR) method which evaluated episodic positive selection at each site in the alignment at posterior probability ≥0.9 was also used [31] . The mixed effects model of evolution (MEME) was also conducted at a 0.1 significance level for estimation selective pressure changes among codon sites. Finally, branch-site random effects likelihood (Branch-site REL) analysis was used to evaluate evidence of diversifying selection on specific branches in the phylogenetic tree at a proportion of sites, considering p-values less than 0.05 as significant. All four methods were conducted with HyPhy package implemented in Datamonkey web server [29] . An episode of positive diversifying selection in concern of a region was considered if it was detected by at least two different methods.

The evolutionary analysis was performed using a strict clock GMRF Bayesian Skyride coalescent tree prior [32, 33] . The GTR substitution model was used with 4 gamma rate categories. The Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms using BEAST v1.8.4 (http://beast.community/) [34] were employed to estimate the rate of BAGV evolution from first isolation to 2014. MCMC analyses were run for 100 million generations, sampling every 100 thousand to ensure convergence of estimates. Population size (ESS) above 200 was assessed using the analysis program Tracer v1.6 (http://beast.bio.ed.ac.uk/Tracer). The posterior distribution of trees obtained from the BEAST analysis was also used to obtain the Bayesian maximum clade credibility (MCC) tree for these sequences generated by TreeAnnotator v.2.3.2 (http://beast.community/treeannotator) (from 100 million) after removing 10% of the runs burn-in and visualized by FigTree v.1.4.2.

The Codon Adaptation Index (CAI) is a measure of the synonymous codon usage bias making comparisons of codon usage preferences in different organisms and assessing the adaptation of viral genes to their hosts [35, 36] . CAI was applied in many recent studies involving humans and RNA viruses [37] [38] [39] . To know if there is evidence of BAGV adaptation for codon usage in humans, the CAI was calculated for each isolate. To calculate normalized CAI, full-length polyprotein sequences of West African BAGV isolates and previously available BAGV sequences from Spain were compared to that of human using CAIcal v1.4 program (http://genomes.urv.es/CAIcal/) [40] . First, we obtained a ""raw"" CAI (rCAI) and then, the CAI was normalized by the ""expected neutral CAI"" (eCAI) value based on 1000 random viral sequences using similar length, codon composition, GC-content and human amino acid usage. Indeed, a table for human codon usage containing the entirety of human coding genes is publicly available [41] . Based on this table, we created a new table where only the 3804 identified human housekeeping genes were considered [42] . Normalized CAI threshold was obtained by calculating rCAI/eCAI values and a value above '1' is higher than neutral and considered as evidence of codon adaptation to the reference set of codon preferences [40] . CAI values obtained for BAGV were then compared to those of others MBFVs well known to infect humans such as Dengue virus (DENV), Usutu virus (USUV), WNV, Zika virus (ZIKV) and Yellow fever virus (YFV), NKV flaviviruses (ModV and RBV) and ISFs (CxFV and AeFV), using the non-parametric Wilcoxon test with R program. A p-value less than 0.05 was considered as significant. Sequences of tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) were compared to human codons and used as negative control to provide an example that results for codon adaptation to human house-keeping genes are robust and not false positives or anomalies. As there are no known cases of human infection, or evidence of human adaptation for TMV, we expected all sequences to have a lower CAI threshold than the calculated CAI.

In this study, a total of 11 full-genome sequences (10,954 bp) of West African BAGV isolates were obtained by sequencing overlapping PCR amplifications covering the genome and by using RACE (Rapid amplification of cDNA ends) techniques for the terminal ends and deposited in GenBank (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/) (Accession numbers: MF380424-34) ( Table 1 ). Analysis of new characterized BAGV complete open reading frames (ORFs) was performed at nucleotide and amino acid levels including previously available sequences from CAR (isolate DakArB209_CAR_1966, accession No. AY632545) and Spain (isolate Spain_H_2010, accession No. HQ644143) into multiple sequence alignments. The polyprotein length of the newly sequenced West African BAGV isolates was determined with respect to gene sizes (Table 3) . Although the 5 UTR was similar in length, the 3 UTR of these West African isolates was either 10 nt or 137 nt longer than those of sequences from CAR and Spain, respectively. In the 5 UTR, positions 52, 55 and 93 had nucleotide changes that were distinguishable for West African isolates. Nucleotide changes A to C at position 52 and T to C at position 55 were seen in West African sequences, and a T to C change at position 93 was observed only in sequences of the isolates ARD54139_Dakar-Bango_SEN_1989 and ARA23139_Dezidougou_CI_1988. Interestingly, the 3 UTR can be divided into three sections; a proximal highly variable section constituted by the 139 first nucleotides following the stop codon, a second highly conservative section located between nucleotide positions 140 and 434 and a moderately variable distal region comprising the last 142 nucleotides. In this distal section, 3 UTR sequences of West African isolates presented insertions of 74 nt and 1 nt, compared to the isolates from CAR and Spanish (KR108244-6), respectively.

Pairwise genetic distances of coding sequences were evaluated at nucleotide and amino acid levels between isolates characterized in this study and in comparison with previously available BAGV sequences ( Figure 1 ). Nucleotide sequences of BAGV isolated from Senegal showed a mean distance of 1.9% ± 0.8% (0.3-3.4%). This lowest genetic distance was also apparent at amino acid level with a mean distance of 1.9% ± 0.6% (0.4-3.7%). 

Here, we described location of main conserved amino acid motifs on BAGV proteins using in silico analysis of complete genome sequences of the 11 West African BAGV isolates characterized in this study and sequences from India, CAR and Spain. Most of highly conserved amino acid motifs localized across E, NS1, NS3 and NS5 proteins of MVFs were identified in the BAGV genomes, sometimes with presence of conservative amino acid mutations (positions highlighted in Black) or non-conservative amino acid mutations (positions highlighted in red) ( Table 4) In protein NS1, all analyzed motifs were conserved, but nc T713P and T713A were observed in sequences of isolates ARD171102_Barkedji_SEN_2004 and EU684972_96363_India_1996, respectively. The BAGV isolate ARD54139_Dakar-Bango_SEN_1989 also contains nc P1127T. In NS3, the conserved motif identified at positions 1722-1728 contains nc A1723P and P1724L for BAGV isolates ARD137998_Diawara_SEN_2000 and ARD138018_Diawara_ SEN_2000, whereas nc L1722S In comparison to sequence of the isolate ARA23139_Dezidougou_CI_1988 from Côte d'Ivoire, Senegalese BAGV isolates showed a higher mean distance of 3.4% ± 0.5% (2.7-4.1%) at nucleotide level. However, this highest genetic distance was less apparent at amino acid level with a mean distance of 1.7% ± 0.7% (2.7-4.1%). Furthermore, mean distances of 6.7% (6.2-7.3%), 1.3% (0.2-2.7%), 5.8% (5.2-6.3%) were recorded at nucleotide level between Senegalese BAGV isolates and the isolate from CAR, Spain, and EU684972__96363_India_1996, respectively while respective mean distances were 1.5% (0.8-2.5%), 1.7% (1.0-2.8%), 2.7% (2.0-3.8%) at amino acid level. A differentiation coefficient value of 0.17 was also observed between these West African BAGV isolates and previously available sequences.

The BAGV isolate ARD54139_Dakar-Bango_SEN_1989 also contains nc P1127T. In NS3, the conserved motif identified at positions 1722-1728 contains nc A1723P and P1724L for BAGV isolates ARD137998_ Diawara_SEN_2000 and ARD138018_Diawara_ SEN_2000, whereas nc L1722S is present in ARD138018_Diawara_SEN_2000, and ARD171075_Barkedji_SEN_2004. A non-conserved motif at positions 1759-1766 contained nc F1766L in all BAGV sequences analyzed and isolate ARD138018_Diawara_SEN_2000 contained additional nc T1765P and D1785Y. A non-conserved motif in NS5 at positions 2734-2741 contained nc T2738N in all BAGV sequences. BAGV isolate ARD54139_Dakar-Bango_SEN_1989 has two supplementary mutations S2734W and S2737P. In addition, these MBFVs amino acid motifs were also mostly conserved in BAGV, NKVFs and CxFV (ISFs) than in AeFV (ISFs). Non-conservative amino acid mutations on the BAGV polyprotein might be associated to phenotypic differences of BAGV isolates. In addition, the presence of phylogenetically informative sites was assessed on the DIVEIN web server. The identified site LAP is harbored by the conserved motif LAPTRVV previously identified in NS3 protein of flaviviruses [3] and presents nc mutations in the genome of three BAGV isolates. In addition, phylogenetically informative sites IEGA and GRIWNA identified in NS4B and NS5, showed combined variations in the genome of the CAR isolate (DKGQ and RTDMEC, respectively) and the Senegalese BAGV isolates ARD152146_Diawara_SEN_2001 (RRAA and GRIWNA, respectively) and ARD260266_Barkedji_SEN_2014 (RRSS and RTDMEC, respectively) ( Figure 2 ).

Prediction of N-glycosylation sites was performed using complete genome sequences of the 11 West African BAGV isolates characterized in this study and sequences from India, CAR and Spain on the DIVEIN web server. The ""potential"" score represents the averaged output of nine neural networks and the ""jury agreement"" indicates how many of the nine networks support the prediction. In total, eight N-glycosylated motifs were identified in the BAGV genome (potential > 0.5) including two highly probable sites (potential > 0.5 and jury agreement of 9/9). Despite high potential (0.7452) and jury agreement (9/9), the motif (Asn-X-Thr) NPTD identified at position 603 was not considered to be glycosylated because it contained a Proline known to preclude the N-glycosylation by rendering inaccessible the Asparagine in the majority of cases (Figure 3 ). This motif was in the domain III region

This motif was in the domain III region of the E protein of all BAGV isolates. However, a second (Asn-X-Ser) motif NFSL was highly predicted (score 0.6223 (9/9)) and suggested an N-linked glycosylation site at the residue Asn-2333 in the NS4B protein. Interestingly, we also found six others probable N-glycosylation at different positions on the BAGV polyprotein including one site (NYSI) harboring, the NYS motif at the 443th position (153th position of the E protein), previously described as a virulence factor for WNV and DENV. of the E protein of all BAGV isolates.

The N-Glyc Result column shows one of the following outputs for predictions. Nglycosylated sites highly predicted by the nine networks (potential > 0.5 and jury agreement of 9/9) are highlighted in red and the site previously reported as virulence factor on E protein of flaviviruses is colored in blue.

Assessment of thermodynamically stable and evolutionarily conserved structural RNA domains was performed using complete non-coding sequences of the 11 West African BAGV isolates characterized in this study and the isolate from Spain. The RNAz method implemented in the Vienna RNA Websuite was used to identify conserved structural RNA domains in the UTRs of BAGV characterized by a p > 0.5. Using the RNAz method, highly conserved structural RNA domains was not identified in the 5 UTR of BAGV genome while a total of four highly conserved structural RNA domains were determined in the 3 region with respective classification probabilities of 0.671490, 0.994641, 0.976295 and 0.846482 ( Figure S1 ).

However, the RNAalifold method implemented in the Vienna RNA Websuite server predicted that, as in the genome of other members of the genus flavivirus, BAGV has a shorter 5 UTR (≈100 nt), consisting of a pair of conserved stem-loops (SL-A and SL-B) (Figure 4) . SL-A serves as promoter of viral polymerase activity followed by a shorter loop which contains a cyclisation sequence upstream of the 5 AUG (SL-B) . The secondary structure of BAGV's 3 UTR could be divided in three parts; a highly variable domain 1 following the stop codon and consisting in an AU-rich stem-loop (SL-I), a second domain 2 with highly conserved sequence and two stem-loops (SL-II and SL-III) and dumbbell structures (DB1 and DB2), and the moderately conserved distal domain 3 which contains the complementary cyclisation elements. In the intermediate domain, the SL-II presented a pseudoknot PK1 preceding a short conserved loop (RCS3). This structural motif was repeated in a stem-loop SL-III with PK2 and CS3. These stem-loops were followed by dumbbell structures DB1 and DB2 that presented conserved loop RCS2 connected with a pseudoknot PK3 and its repetition CS2, respectively [43] . Thus, organization of conserved sequences on consensus secondary structure of BAGV's 3 UTR was structured RCS3-CS3-RCS2-CS2-ImCS1. Indeed, CS1 was imperfect (ImCS1) only on sequences of West African BAGV isolates with a total of nine substitutions compared to the corresponding consensus sequence previously described [3] .

Viruses 2018, 10, x 12 of 26 RNA Websuite was used to identify conserved structural RNA domains in the UTRs of BAGV characterized by a p > 0.5. Using the RNAz method, highly conserved structural RNA domains was not identified in the 5′ UTR of BAGV genome while a total of four highly conserved structural RNA domains were determined in the 3′ region with respective classification probabilities of 0.671490, 0.994641, 0.976295 and 0.846482 ( Figure S1 ).

The Bayesian phylogenetic analysis for estimation of data quality and selection of the best-fit nucleotide substitution model were performed using Mega 6.0 with a discrete Gamma distribution (+G) with 5 rate categories. The General Time-Reversible with a discrete Gamma distribution and a proportion of invariant sites (GTR+I) was the best nucleotide substitution model for our sequences data presenting score values of 69,924.128, 69,453.449 and −34,680.714 for BIC, AICc and lnL criteria, respectively. The maximum likelihood (ML) tree was inferred using FastTree v2.1.7 [26] on our total data set including the 11 complete polyprotein sequences of West African BAGV isolates circulating in Senegal and Côte d'Ivoire from 1988 to 2014, the 5 BAGV sequences from Spain, the BAGV sequences from India and CAR and complete polyproteins from different flaviviruses, with 10,281 bp alignment length ( Figure 5 ). A GTR+I model was used, as selected by Bayesian criteria. Nodes were labeled with local support values computed with 5000 bootstrap replications using the Shimodaira-Hasegawa (SH) test. The phylogeny of complete BAGV genome sequences presented evidence of a single BAGV phylogenetic group. Furthermore, we observed also that Israel meningo-encephalitis turkey virus (ITV) was closed to BAGV in genetic relatedness [11] .

Given the major implications of recombination events for evolution, pathogenicity, or diagnosis of non-segmented positive RNA viruses like flaviviruses [44] , it is clearly important to determine their occurrence in the BAGV genome. The RDP4beta 4.8 program used for assessment of recombination events on complete polyprotein sequences [27] revealed evidence of only one highly credible recombination event from the E protein to NS2B, with estimated breakpoints at positions 2202 and 4908 of BAGV genome. This recombination event involved the isolate ARD54139_Dakar-Bango_SEN_1989 originating from Saint-Louis, in the North of Senegal ( Figure 6 ). Considering the isolates ARD260266_ Barkedji_SEN_2014 and ARD171075_Barkedji_SEN_2004 as respective minor and major parents of the isolate ARD54139_Dakar-Bango_SEN_1989 (Similarity of 98.8% and 97%, respectively), this recombination event was found by RDP, GENECONV, Bootscan, Maxchi, Chimaera, SiSscan and 3Seq methods and supported by significant p-values of 3.09 × 10 -16 , 9.23 × 10 −12 , 7.36 × 10 −13 , 8.45 × 10 −7 , 1.59 × 10 −7 , 3.60 × 10 −8 and 1.17 × 10 −12 , respectively. The BootScan and GARD analyzes identified one significant recombination breakpoint at nucleotide position 2201 corresponding to the E protein, supported by a LHS p-value of 0.024 and a RHS p-value of 0.001.

This breakpoint divides the BAGV genome into two regions: one that encodes the structural proteins and another that encodes the non-structural proteins. Phylogenetic trees were constructed using 1000 bootstrap replications and midpoint rooted for clarity only (Figure 7 ). This recombination event led to a mismatch between NJ phylogenetic trees constructed using comparison of nucleotides sequences of recombinant (positions 2202-4908) and non-recombinant genomic regions (positions 1-2201 and 4909-10,281). The tree is midpoint-rooted, nodes are labeled with local support values computed using the Shimodaira-Hasegawa (SH) test for 5000 bootstrap replications, species names are color-coded as follows: new characterized BAGV isolatesdark blue with dots; previous sequences of BAGV-dark blue; mosquito-borne flaviviruses (MBFVs)-green; dual-host affiliated ISFs (dISFs)-red; no Known Vector (NKV) flavivirusesyellow; tick-born flaviviruses (TBFVs)-light blue; classical ISFs (cISFs)-Orange.

The structural and non-structural coding regions were analyzed separately for estimation of sites and branches under positive diversifying selection, applying four different methods to ensure consistency of these events along of BAGV sequences. Using this approach, we found several sites under strong negative selection and most of them were in the E, NS3 and NS5 proteins (Table 5) . However, the significant evidence (p < 0.1) of episodic positive selection was obtained for all the coding genes, except for the prM, NS2B and NS4A regions. All positively selected sites estimated by the FUBAR model (posterior probability ≥ 0.9) were also identified by the MEME method (p < 0.1). Thus, an important number of positively selected sites were detected; interestingly, the majority of such sites were in the E, NS1 and NS5 proteins. Branch-site analysis showed also a total of 11 branches evaluating under positive selection (p < 0.05) and the highest proportion was in the E and NS1 proteins.

MCMC convergence was obtained for three independent runs with 100 million generations, which were sufficient to obtain a proper sample for the posterior at MCMC stationarity assessed by effective sample sizes (ESS) above 200 for each gene. Furthermore, the evolutionary rates (µ) and the highest posterior densities (HPD with 95% of confidence interval) were 1.226 × 10 

Evidence of BAGV adaptation to human house-keeping genes was analyzed by calculating CAI indices using complete coding polyprotein sequences of West African BAGV isolates and BAGV sequences available from Spain, in comparison to other MBFVs such as DENV, USUV, WNV, ZIKV and YFV, NKV flaviviruses (ModV and RBV) and ISFs (CxFV and AeFV). CAI values > 1 were obtained for polyprotein sequences of all BAGV isolates. Thus, there is evidence that BAGV could have adaptation to the human genes ( Figure 9 ). ModV(mean CAI: 1.072 and median CAI: 1.072), RBV (mean CAI: 1.059 and median CAI: 1.059) and YFV (mean CAI: 1.075 and median CAI: 1.072) showed the highest CAI values for human housekeeping genes and were significantly different to Spanish and West African BAGV isolates (Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test, p-values ranging from 0.0001 to 1.028 × 10 −7 ). Compared to those of Spanish isolates, sequences of West African BAGV isolates presented significantly higher CAI values (mean CAI: 1.044 and median CAI: 1.044, Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test, p-value < 0.002). In addition, they were also higher than DENV serotype 2 (DENV-2) (Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test, p-value < 1.4 × 10 −6 ). However, CAI values of West African BAGV isolates were lower than those of DENV-1 (Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test, W = 231, p-value = 2.869 × 10 −6 ) and comparable to CAI values given by DENV-3 and DENV-4 (Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test, W = 3258, p-value = 0.06477 and W = 824, p-value = 0.3463, respectively). Interestingly, CAI values of West African isolates were also significantly higher than those obtained for other MBFVs well known to infect human such as USUV (Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test, p-value < 6.796 × 10 −9 ), WNV (Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test, p-value < 2.718 × 10 −10 ), ZIKV (Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test, p-value < 1.67 × 10 −8 ) and ISFs (means CAI: 1.0015 and 1.0006 and median CAI: 1.0015 and 1.0006 for CxFV and AeFV, respectively) which showed low evidence

Interestingly, CAI values of West African isolates were also significantly higher than those obtained for other MBFVs well known to infect human such as USUV (Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test, p-value < 6.796 × 10 −9 ), WNV (Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test, p-value < 2.718 × 10 −10 ), ZIKV (Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test, p-value < 1.67 × 10 −8 ) and ISFs (means CAI: 1.0015 and 1.0006 and median CAI: 1.0015 and 1.0006 for CxFV and AeFV, respectively) which showed low evidence for codon adaptation towards human housekeeping genes (Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test, p-value < 2.328 × 10 −16 ). Although CAI results for ISFs were significantly lower to human housekeeping genes, we did not find any significant difference between CxFV and AeFV codon adaptation. Compared to codon usage of human genes, sequences of tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) showed mean and median CAI values of 0.9587 and 0.9592, respectively. 

With an increasing number of emergent and re-emergent pathogens involved in human encephalitis, it is important to try to better understand which viruses have a potential to emerge causing human infection in the future. Since its first isolation, BAGV was only detected in mosquito pools collected in the field during entomological investigations in West and Central Africa and in India [12] . However, in 2010, BAGV was identified as the cause of an encephalitis outbreak in wild birds circulating in Southern Spain [9] . In a possible host-switching event [45] , BAGV could acquire future adaptation to other vertebrates such as humans [46] . In this study, genetic properties of BAGV isolates circulating in West Africa, the evolutionary phylogeny of BAGV and evidence of BAGV adaptation to human house-keeping genes were evaluated in comparison with different flavivirus groups.

Genomes of 11 West African BAGV strains isolated from mosquito pools collected in the field from 1988 to 2014 showed similarities in terms of gene lengths when compared with polyprotein sequences of previously available isolates from CAR and Spain.

Low amino acid distances observed between West African isolates (<2%) in comparison with previously non-West African sequences (<3%) combined with the weak coefficient of differentiation (<0.2) revealed evidence of a low genetic diversity of BAGV sequences analyzed in this study as previously described [9] . In addition, the West African BAGV isolates were more closely related to the CAR isolate. Genome sequences originating from BAGV isolates from other geographic locations would be helpful to understand if this low diversity is secluded to West-Africa.

Although the 5′ UTR was conserved between isolates, the 3′ UTR of West African isolates varied in terms of length and structure. As in other mosquito-borne flavivirus genomes, BAGV genome harbored structural RNA domains both in 5′ and 3′ UTRs which play a major role in flaviviral replication and interactions with host proteins and regulate cellular response to infection [47, 48] .

Genome sequences originating from BAGV isolates from other geographic locations would be helpful to understand if this low diversity is secluded to West-Africa.

Although the 5 UTR was conserved between isolates, the 3 UTR of West African isolates varied in terms of length and structure. As in other mosquito-borne flavivirus genomes, BAGV genome harbored structural RNA domains both in 5 and 3 UTRs which play a major role in flaviviral replication and interactions with host proteins and regulate cellular response to infection [47, 48] . However, differences in determination of structural RNA domains in 5 UTR between the RNAz and the RNAalifold methods used in this study could be attributed to variations in algorithm of analysis used by each method [21] [22] [23] [24] . The small subgenomic RNA (sfRNA) identified in the 3 UTR of BAGV is generated through incomplete degradation of the viral genome by cellular 5 -3 exonuclease XRN1 [49, 50] and plays an important role in viral pathogenicity [49] and modulation of host responses [51, 52] .

In addition, the stable 3' terminus region of the sfRNA following the dumbbell structures (DB1 and DB2) and complementary to the 5 terminus of the 5 UTR, was shown to be necessary in genomic RNA cyclisation for viral replication and translation [46] . The sfRNA can be in competition with the 3 UTR of genomic RNA in binding to proteins of viral replication complexes (RC) [53] and/or cellular machinery [54] . Thus, it slows down the replication or translation and assembly of particles [51] .

The 3 UTR region is important for translation and replication of the RNA genome through interactions with viral and host proteins, genome stabilization, and RNA packaging [55] . A better understanding of the potential impact of 3 UTR variations in replication of BAGV could be important in the study of mechanisms implicated in their pathogenicity [56, 57] .

Most motifs linked to virulence previously described in these proteins of other MBFVs were conserved among BAGV isolates. However, some non-conservative mutations were identified in E, NS1, NS3 and NS5. In general, non-conservative amino acid mutations (nc) are spontaneous, rare, and hazardous, and then represent the main causes of genetic diversity. Thus, non-conservative mutations observed on BAGV genome could modulate viral phenotypes of particular isolates in mechanisms such as virus cell entry, replication, production of viral particles, and assembly, and cause modifications in post-translational regulation as previously demonstrated for other flaviviruses such as DENV [58] [59] [60] . The E protein is involved in cell receptor recognition, attachment, cell fusion, tropism, and virulence [58] . NS1 is the most conserved non-structural protein of flaviviruses. Associated with the other non-structural proteins, the NS1 protein plays an important function in viral replication and assembly and viral escape to host innate immune response [61] . The NS3 protein is the main component of the replication machinery and ensures multiple functions in viral evasion to host antiviral response and in production and assembly of infectious viral particles [62] . The NS5 protein is the largest viral protein that serves as the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and performs multiple functions essential for viral replication, including processing the viral polyprotein, replicating the viral RNA. Sharing these motifs of virulence mostly with MBFVs, NKVFs and CxFV than with AeFV showed that BAGV could be more closely related to MBFVs transmitted by Culex mosquitoes and could explain frequent BAGV isolations mainly from mosquitoes of Culex genus and its capacity to infect vertebrates such as wild birds [1, 4, 5, 9, 10] . In addition, The West African BAGV isolates characterized in our study were mainly isolated from Culex poicilipes and Culex neavei mosquitoes which have been reported as potential vectors for flaviviruses such as WNV [63] . Culex neavei was also found as a competent vector able to transmit flaviviruses such as USUV and WNV [64, 65] . Despite no available data on Culex poicilipes competency to transmit flaviviruses, these two mosquito species belonging to Culex genus could play an important role in natural transmission of BAGV to vertebrates such as wild birds since another member of the Culex genus, Culex tritaeniorhynchus, has been found competent to transmit BAGV to mice [8] .

The phylogenetically informative sites identified on the BAGV genome located mainly in NS3, NS4B and NS5 proteins, respectively, could have a considerable impact in viral fitness on host for corresponding West African isolates. In addition, the prediction of the N-glycosylated sites at different positions on BAGV genome such as Asn2333 in NS4B and the NYSI motif at 153th position of the E protein showed that post-translational modifications may influence acquisition or loss of capacity in mechanisms such as pathogenicity, evasion of innate immune pathways. Indeed, flaviviruses NS4B plays an important role in replication of viral RNA facilitating the formation of replication complexes and modulating host innate immune response such as interferons, microRNAs and RNA interference, formation of stress granules and the unfolded protein responses [66] [67] [68] . A previous study had shown that N-glycosylation of NS4B of DENV does not affect the protein stability but causes a considerable reduction in efficiency of viral production [69] . Presence of a glycosylation site and an informative site in the viral NS4B protein could influence the efficiency of viral replication and the outer shape of the virion. The presence of the N-linked glycosylation motif NYS had been previously reported at 67/153th and 154th on the E protein of DENV and WNV (lineage 1 strains and some neuroinvasive lineage 2 strains), respectively, involving in receptor binding, viral morphogenesis, viral infectivity, and tropism [70] [71] [72] [73] [74] . Since glycosylation is a means of evasion to immune recognition within the host by masking particular antigenic sites from recognition by neutralizing antibodies, it could increase the diversity of the glycosylation on viral proteins [75, 76] . Nevertheless, it could be important in future studies to determine whether the predicted glycosylation sites are really used (asparagine-linked) using specific enzymatic digestion by Endo H and peptide N-glycosidase (PNGase F) [77] . Our data suggest the ability of BAGV to develop phenotypically important variations and potentially adaptation to new vertebrate hosts such as humans. However, to understand better the impact of variation on these predicted N-glycosylation sites and the identified phylogenetically important variations would require in vitro studies with reverse genetically engineered infectious clones on mosquito or mammalian cell lines and in vivo experiments in mosquitoes or in animal models like mouse [78, 79] . However, antibodies against BAGV proteins or infectious clone are currently not available for BAGV.

The identification of natural recombination events between virus isolates is important for our understanding of virus evolution. In our study, we identified a recombination event in the E protein BAGV. Recombination was documented in other members of the mosquito-borne flavivirus group [80, 81] , but had not yet been demonstrated to occur in BAGV. Identification of recombination breakpoints and the graphical detection of conflicting phylogenetic signals gave confirmation of this recombination event in E protein of the Senegalese isolate ARD54139_Dakar-Bango_SEN_1989 as previously described for ZIKV [74, 82] . Nevertheless, the precise molecular mechanisms of the template switches are unknown. The E protein is highly important because it encodes the most important antigen with regards to virus biology and humoral immunity. Therefore, large-scale genetic changes in this region, as might be brought about by recombination, could have significant impact on virus phenotype [44] .

The estimation of the selection pressures acting on each protein of BAGV demonstrated episodes of strong negative selection in functionally important proteins. These results suggested frequent purging of deleterious polymorphisms in the BAGV genome that could be associated with accumulation of synonymous mutations during BAGV transmission [83] . However, location of more significant episodes of positive selection in the E, NS1 and NS5 proteins indicated that they could represent preferential selection targets during BAGV evolution [84] . Indeed, the E protein of flaviviruses plays a crucial role in early steps of host cell binding and viral entry and represents a main target for immune responses influencing antigenic response and positive selection on the E protein is a hallmark of the emergence of flaviviruses [85, 86] . Positive selection episodes have been also previously reported for the DENV-3 capsid, however, the impact needs to be further investigated [87] . Likewise, non-structural proteins could also be targets of positive selection.

The NS1 protein is essential for viral RNA replication, is involved in immune system evasion, and represents the major positive selection target during speciation of arthropod-born flaviviruses such as DENV and ZIKV [88] . NS2A and NS4B proteins have been shown to antagonize the interferon response during DENV infection [89] and changes in these regions would be evolutionary advantageous selecting for BAGV strains with strong innate immunity suppression mechanisms. Mutations in the NS4B protein were also seen to modulate several phenotype mechanisms of flaviviruses, such as pathogenesis [90] , viral adaptation [91] , replication [68] , neurovirulence [66] and host preferences [92] . Thus, presence of positively selected sites in NS4B of BAGV isolates could have major impact in its natural evolution.

NS3 and NS5 proteins are crucial for viral replication, since non-conservative changes in these regions could modify process of protease and ATPase/helicase functions of NS3 protein [93] and RNA polymerase activity of NS5 protein [94] . These several polymorphic amino acid coding sites in the BAGV genome suggest that these proteins may be experiencing relatively adaptive changes in the natural evolution and they should be prioritized in future experimental studies.

Despite the evidence of a single phylogenetic group for BAGV sequences analyzed in our study, the evolutionary rates are expected in accordance to proteins functions; the NS5 representing the polymerase and the most conserved protein [86] . The inferred Bayesian MCC trees indicated a single introduction of BAGV into Europe and Africa from India, contrary to other African flaviviruses as WNV [95] and ZIKV [74] , suggesting an Indian origin of BAGV. Estimated times from the MRCA suggested a distant origin of West African BAGV sequences analyzed in this study from the 15th century. Thus, further phylodynamic analyzes based on more complete sequences could be interesting for determining geographical pathways and potential evolution patterns in correlation with BAGV spread from India to African and European continents.

The Codon Adaptation Index (CAI) represents a reliable bio-informatics approach to measure the synonymous codon usage bias and to assess the adaptation of viral genes to their hosts [96] . Flaviviruses can infect and replicate in hosts of different phyla. Therefore, their versatility in gene expression and protein synthesis and changes in the viral RNA genome could affect the fitness of the virus in a specific host relating to dinucleotide frequencies, codon preferences, and codon pair biases [97] [98] [99] . Nevertheless, ecology, different virus-host relationships, biogeographical migrations of flavivirus species and genetic differences may explain observed differences in flaviviral codon usage preference to human housekeeping genes [98, 100, 101] . In particular, NKV flaviviruses were only isolated from vertebrates and are maintained in nature by horizontal transmission between vertebrate hosts [102, 103] . Although ISFs were thought to sustain their populations in their respective insect vectors in the absence of mammal reservoirs, so lower translational efficiency in vertebrates could be expected [97, 104] .

In addition, the highest CAIs of YFV and DENV could be related to their long histories of infection in humans [105] . Indeed, YFV and DENV are maintained in endemic and sylvatic cycles, which conducted to repeated epidemics for more than one hundred years. However, YFV showed generally a higher virulence in human infections, particularly when it is compared to DENV infections reported in Africa [106] . This could explain the higher CAI values of YFV towards codon usage of the human housekeeping genes.

With evidence of adaptation to human house-keeping genes, BAGV could be potential cause of infection in vertebrates, such as humans. Considering the highest CAI values of West African BAGV isolates when compared to isolates responsible of the Spanish wild bird's outbreak in 2010 [9] , BAGV adaptation to vertebrate species such as birds could have led to an extension of adaptation to other species as shown in a previous virus study [46] . Interestingly, West African BAGV isolates showed a higher evidence of codon adaptation than MBFVs well known to infect humans, such as WNV which is a major cause of human encephalitis in USA and responsible of recent outbreaks in Europe [107] and ZIKV associated with microcephaly in fetuses and newborns during the outbreak in Brazil in 2015 [91] . Thus, further comparison of codon adaptation indexes of other BAGV genomic regions, such as the 3 UTR, among isolates that differ in biological, ecological, and genetic characteristics could help to characterize the evolutionary adaptation of BAGV genomes to vertebrate hosts [46, 108] .

Nevertheless, to ensure the potential of BAGV to be involved in human encephalitis cases, it would be important to evaluate its pathogenicity on human induced pluripotent stem cell lines (iPSC) capable of differentiating into brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs) and constituting a robust model of the human blood-brain barrier [109] . Otherwise, the iPSC cells can also generate primitive neural stem cells (NSCs), which can differentiate into neurons, astrocytes, or oligodendrocytes [110] . These BAGV sequences data obtained in our study could be used not only in future viral studies, but also in development of reverse genetic reagents or reliable diagnostic tools for investigation of this virus in human populations.

Animal Virus Ecology and Evolution Are Shaped by the Virus Host-Body Infiltration and Colonization Pattern,"The current classification of animal viruses is largely based on the virus molecular world. Less attention is given to why and how virus fitness results from the success of virus transmission. Virus transmission reflects the infection-shedding-transmission dynamics, and with it, the organ system involvement and other, macroscopic dimensions of the host environment. This study describes the transmission ecology of the world main livestock viruses, 36 in total, a mix of RNA, DNA and retroviruses. Following an iterative process, the viruses are virtually ranked in an outer-to inner-body fashion, by organ system, on ecological grounds. Also portrayed are the shifts in virus host tropism and virus genome. The synthesis of the findings reveals a predictive virus evolution framework, based on the outer-to inner-body changes in the interplay of host environment-transmission modes-organ system involvement-host cell infection cycle-virus genome. Outer-body viruses opportunistically respond to the variation in the external environment. For example, respiratory and enteric viruses tend to be associated with poultry and pig mass rearing. Ruminant and equine viruses tend to be more deep-rooted and host-specific, and also establish themselves in the vital inner-body systems. It is concluded that the framework may assist the study of new emerging viruses and pandemic risks.","Animal viruses may be split into transmissible and persistent viruses. It has been proposed that transmissible viruses correlate with replication and virulence and that virus persistence instead permits a lower transmission rate [1] . This insight builds on earlier work suggesting that virus persistence may pave the way for virus-host symbiosis [2] . Viruses are considered essential agents within the roots and stems of the tree of life [3] . For example, RNA viruses in vertebrates tend to broadly follow the evolutionary history of their hosts that began in the ocean and extended for hundreds of millions of years [4] . The symbiotic virus-host relationships can take many forms, from antagonistic to mutualistic, and viruses, like other symbionts, lie on a continuum that can shift with environmental changes [5] .

The present study seeks to take these insights to the next level. Starting point in the analysis is the link between virus propagation and transmission success. Virus transmission may be considered to present the backbone of virus ecology, determining the viruses selected for. Unfortunately, the current classification of animal viruses emphasizes the importance of virus genomic architecture and the host cell infection cycle [6] . Less attention is given to why and how virus fitness results from the virus transmission success. For example, an animal virus may become established in the upper respiratory tract and transmit via aerosols to the next host. An enteric virus features a fecal-oral cycle. A skin virus may transmit on the basis of touch. A virus colonizing the distal urogenital tract may transmit during sexual contact. Hence, an analysis of the virus transmission success requires a consideration of the overt clinical signs of infection, the gross pathology, the matching virus shedding profile, and of the ensuing modes of transmission.

The current analysis explores how the virus molecular world and the macroscopic dimensions of the host environment are intertwined, integral to one and the same virus transmission ecology. In vertebrate hosts the more vital organ systems are shielded off from external aggressors, small or large. It may be assumed that also the host immune defenses are structured to ensure that harmful viral pathogens remain confined to the outer-body environment, the epithelia. Epithelial viruses interface with the external environment and respond to the variation encountered here. Opposingly, infiltrative viruses establish in the inner-body environment and are expected to evolve towards a more intimate virus-host relationship. Given that the virus-host relationship changes with the position of the virus in the outer-to inner-body continuum the analysis focuses on the extent of virus host-body infiltration. The virus organ system tropism is assumed to evolve in harmony with the virus cell tropism. This may be inferred from the dichotomy in the release of viruses from epithelial cells. Apart from direct cell-to-cell transmission [7] , viruses may be released from the apical cell surface and so end-up in the outer-body environment. These viruses colonize mucosae and skin. In contrast, viruses released from the basolateral cell surface infiltrate underlying tissues. These viruses end-up in the lymph drainage, enter the blood circulation and so may infect any of the internal organs. Infiltration of and establishment in the inner-body environment may translate in additional, non-epithelial transmission modes. For example, virus establishment in the reproductive organs may translate in intrauterine or lactogenic transmission [8] . In birds, virus may be shed into yolk or albumen and so transmit vertically [9] . Virus circulation in the bloodstream may enable virus transmission via needles or arthropod vectors [10] .

Taking an invasion ecology perspective, the host-body is viewed as a mosaic of organ systems. Viruses and organ systems are virtually portrayed in an outer-to inner-body fashion, based on the outer-to inner-body shifts in the virus infection-shedding-transmission characteristics which, in turn, result from the shift in virus organ system tropism. It is assumed that the nature of the virus-host interaction changes with the position of the virus in the outer-to inner-body continuum. The study describes the transmission ecology of the world main livestock viruses. The rationale for selecting the world main livestock viruses relates to the host damaging effects of these pathogens, the overt clinical signs and gross pathology, translating in prominent virus shedding and obvious virus transmission modes. Moreover, because of the major economic impact of these diseases, the causative viruses and the corresponding infection-transmission dynamics have been well studied.

Placed in a wider perspective the analysis builds on the growing perception that viruses deserve to be viewed as evolving living entities [11] [12] [13] . As biological replicators viruses require a propagation strategy in order to become transmitted to the next host [14] . For this, a virus may turn host damaging or instead evolve a friendly, persisting virus-host relationship [15] .

The analysis entailed an iterative process. As a first step, the one-to-three scores allocated to the 36 livestock viruses for the four ecological variables were examined in more detail. The scores are shown in Figure S1b . The variables comprise the extent of virus host-body infiltration, the length of the infection period, the infection severity level, and the virus environmental survival rate. The one-to-three infiltration score reflects the organ systems involvement in infection-transmission and concerns, respectively, virus transmission based on the involvement of the epithelia, transmission involving epithelia and internal organs, and transmission involving just internal organs. The score for the length of the infection period reflects, respectively, acute, acute plus persistent, and persistent infections. Likewise, the score for the infection severity level concerns a case fatality of less than one, one to ten, and above ten percent. The score for the virus environmental survival rate refers to the number of days that the virus remains infective outside the host-body, ranging from up to three, three to ten, to over ten days. With one exception, the variables did not increase or decrease in value together. Just the association between the extent of virus host-body infiltration and the length of the infection period was found to be monotonic. Spearman correlation yielded an R = 0.58 and p < 0.0005. It was thus found that viruses infiltrating internal organs either cause persistent infections or a combination of acute and persistent infections. Conversely, persistent viruses either colonize internal organs or a combination of internal organs and epithelia. Hence, the length of the infection period appears to present a measure for the extent of virus host-body infiltration.

As a next step, the eleven virus families in the study were grouped and ranked A-D on the basis of the infiltration scores allocated to the individual family viruses, see Figure 1 . The transmission of the viruses belonging to the Orthomyxoviridae and the Paramyxoviridae was found to strictly result from the involvement of the epithelia. The transmission of the viruses belonging to the Coronaviridae, the Picornaviridae and the Poxviridae was in part modulated also by the internal organ systems. The transmission of the viruses belonging to the Arteriviridae, the Flaviviridae, the Herpesviridae, plus also the single infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV), resulted from epithelial modes as well as internal organ systems involvement. Finally, the transmission of the single bluetongue virus (BTV) plus the viruses belonging to the Retroviridae family either reflected the involvement of epithelia plus internal organ systems or of just internal organ systems. A Spearman correlation of the A-D virus family specific infiltration ranking and the length of the infection period scores yielded an R = 0.71 and p = 0. The result indicates that the interrelationships among virus families may be defined in ecological terms and that the virus families may be neatly lined up in an outer-to inner-body fashion, virtually. one to ten, and above ten percent. The score for the virus environmental survival rate refers to the number of days that the virus remains infective outside the host-body, ranging from up to three, three to ten, to over ten days. With one exception, the variables did not increase or decrease in value together. Just the association between the extent of virus host-body infiltration and the length of the infection period was found to be monotonic. Spearman correlation yielded an R = 0.58 and p < 0.0005. It was thus found that viruses infiltrating internal organs either cause persistent infections or a combination of acute and persistent infections. Conversely, persistent viruses either colonize internal organs or a combination of internal organs and epithelia. Hence, the length of the infection period appears to present a measure for the extent of virus host-body infiltration.

As a next step, the eleven virus families in the study were grouped and ranked A-D on the basis of the infiltration scores allocated to the individual family viruses, see Figure 1 . The transmission of the viruses belonging to the Orthomyxoviridae and the Paramyxoviridae was found to strictly result from the involvement of the epithelia. The transmission of the viruses belonging to the Coronaviridae, the Picornaviridae and the Poxviridae was in part modulated also by the internal organ systems. The transmission of the viruses belonging to the Arteriviridae, the Flaviviridae, the Herpesviridae, plus also the single infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV), resulted from epithelial modes as well as internal organ systems involvement. Finally, the transmission of the single bluetongue virus (BTV) plus the viruses belonging to the Retroviridae family either reflected the involvement of epithelia plus internal organ systems or of just internal organ systems. A Spearman correlation of the A-D virus family specific infiltration ranking and the length of the infection period scores yielded an R = 0.71 and p = 0. The result indicates that the interrelationships among virus families may be defined in ecological terms and that the virus families may be neatly lined up in an outer-to inner-body fashion, virtually. 

Next, the organ system tropisms of the viruses belonging to each family were collectively fitted and with the naked eye aligned with the Figure 1 line-up of families. For this, the within-group, alphabetical family order was adjusted to secure an optimal visual match. As indicated in Figure 2 , from outer-to inner-body the virus organ system appears to shift from the respiratory plus the alimentary tract to the skin, the distal urogenital tract or cloaca, the peripheral nerves and ganglia, the reproductive organs system, the lungs, to the immune plus the circulatory systems. Hence, there are indications that both viruses and organ systems may be lined up in an outer-to inner-body fashion, virtually.

Next, the A-D family ranking was converted into a one-to-four virus infiltration score applicable to individual viruses. Further, these scores are shown in Supplementary Figure S1b. To make the scoring compatible with the A-D family ranking, the one-to-four scores reflects, respectively, virus transmission strictly based on epithelial modes, primarily based on epithelial modes, involving epithelia and internal organ systems, and primarily involving internal organ systems. There are several differences with the A-D family ranking shown in Figure 1 . Among the viruses of family group B, TGEV, AEV, FMDV, and LSDV received a score of three for transmitting on the basis of the involvement of both epithelia and internal organs. PEV1 and SVDV of group B were considered primarily epithelial and so received a two score. Both these viruses are persistently shed in feces, including in the absence of clinical signs, indicating a systemic infection component. The herpesviruses of group C were split into two. BHV-1, DEV, EHV-3, and GaHV1 were considered primarily epithelial while EHV-1, GaHV-2, and SHV-1 were considered to involve epithelia and internal organs. Among the D group viruses ALV was considered to involve epithelia and internal organs, unlike CAEV, JSRV, and MVV, for which the involvement of the epithelia did not appear to contribute to the overall virus transmission success. The latter viruses were allocated a score of four.

When the new, one-to-four virus infiltration scores were matched to the scores for the length of the infection period Spearman R became 0.73, and p = 0. When the somewhat atypical, vector borne

When the new, one-to-four virus infiltration scores were matched to the scores for the length of the infection period Spearman R became 0.73, and p = 0. When the somewhat atypical, vector borne bluetongue virus was removed from the correlation, R remained 0.73 for the one-to-four scoring, became 0.74 for the A-D virus family specific ranking, and 0.62, with p = 8 × 10 −5 , for the one-to-three infiltration ranking.

Next, all of the above findings were considered in conjunction with the literature data on the transmission ecology collated for each of the 36 viruses in Figure S1a . Pieced together on this basis was an outer-to inner-body line-up of viruses by organ system or combination of organ systems, guided by the one-to-four virus infiltration score, the corresponding virus organ system tropism, the matching virus transmission modes, length of the infection and shedding periods, infection severity level, and virus environmental survival rate, see Figure 3 and, also, Figure S1d . bluetongue virus was removed from the correlation, R remained 0.73 for the one-to-four scoring, became 0.74 for the A-D virus family specific ranking, and 0.62, with p = 8 × 10 −5 , for the one-to-three infiltration ranking.

For the epithelial, outer-body viruses it turned out that the length of the infection and shedding periods, as well as the virus environmental survival rate generally increased from respiratory tract to alimentary tract to skin. The respiratory viruses transmitted on the basis of aerosols, direct contact or fomites. Alimentary tract viruses were found to transmit on the basis of a fecal-oral cycle, through direct contact, contamination of feed and water, or involving fomites, persons and vehicles. Viruses infecting both respiratory and alimentary tract featured a mix of these transmission modes. Mostly, these viruses caused rather severe infections. Among the skin viruses, the more infiltrative viruses affecting all layers of the skin caused slowly healing lesions. The transmission of these deep-rooted skin viruses was found to rely on abrasion or biting flies rather than on direct touch or on indirect contact, more typical for superficial skin lesions. Some of the epithelial viruses are shed in feces over a prolonged time period, also in the absence of clinical signs, and these infections were considered to feature a systemic component. Next, the epithelial herpesviruses establishing latently in peripheral nerves and ganglia were found to cause a recurrence or persistence of the mucosal and/or skin infection, including of the distal urogenital tract and external genitalia.

Virus infiltration of the inner-body environment frequently implicated the genital tract or reproductive system in general. This was found to be the case for the RNA, the DNA and for the retroviruses in the study. Virus establishment in the reproductive system translated in seminal transmission, haphazard abortion, late term abortion, stillbirth, birth of infected, yet apparently healthy offspring or, also, lactogenic transmission. The vertical transmission modes were common among the utmost deep-rooted viruses, the viruses infiltrating also the immune and circulatory systems. Some of the utmost infiltrative viruses featured an absence of epithelial transmission modes and were environmentally labile. Virus infiltration of the immune system associated with immune-suppression, severe infections, neoplasia, or instead with in-apparent, persistent infection. Virus infiltration of immune and circulatory systems associated with iatrogenic transmission modes. Virus circulation in the bloodstream facilitated arthropod borne transmission. As indicated in Figure 3 , the transmission of the bluetongue virus, the sole arbovirus in the study, was considered somewhat atypical because the virus usually causes a transient infection in the ruminant host while in midges remains infective for life. Hence, the involvement of the biological vector complicates a direct comparison with the transmission ecology of the remaining 35 viruses.

The finding that virus environmental survival in the outer-body environment increased from respiratory tract to alimentary tract to skin and decreased with the shift from the outer-to the inner-body environment prompted a re-examination of the relationship between the extent of virus host-body infiltration and virus environmental survival. Virus infiltration scores two-to-four, running from primarily epithelial transmission, to transmission involving also internal organ systems, to transmission primarily involving internal organ systems, were matched to the one-to-three virus environmental survival rate scores, yielding an R = −0.59 and p = <0.0005. The indication that at least in broad terms the extent of virus inner-body infiltration correlated with a loss of virus robustness was applied in the virus ranking, along with the other factors.

Furthermore, the outer-to inner-body shifts in virus host tropism and virus genome were examined. Underlined in Figure 3 are ruminant and equine viruses, contrasted to the remaining, poultry and pig viruses. Excluded from the host tropism correlations was the multiple-host FMDV. The remaining 35 viruses all formed part of either of the two virus host groupings. It was found that the RNA, DNA and retroviruses broadly line up in an outer-to inner-body fashion. Virus host tropism and the virus genome line-up were matched. Additional correlations concerned the virus host tropism and the four virus ecological variable scores, as well as the virus genome type and the four virus ecological variable scores.

The extent of the host-body infiltration was found to increase from RNA to DNA to retrovirus, with R = 0.48 and p < 0.005. From RNA to DNA to retrovirus the ruminant and equine viruses gained in prominence, with R = 0.40 and p < 0.05, and the infection severity level decreased, with R = −0.45 and p < 0.01. Moreover, the ruminant and equine viruses were found to cause less severe infections than the poultry and pig viruses, with Spearman R = −0.55 and p < 0.001. Hence, from outerto inner-body, the virus genome type and host tropism appear to shift in concert, along with the infection-transmission dynamics.

The synthesis of the findings is presented in Figure 4 . The host environment frames the virus transmission modes and, with it, explains the organ system involvement, the specifics of the host-cell infection cycle, and the virus genome. Vice versa, the virus life history explains the virus genomics, the host-cell infection cycle and, with it, the macroscopic level virus-host interactions and the host population ecology. The interplay of the host environment-transmission modes-organ system involvement-host cell infection cycle-virus genome changes from outer-to inner-body, resulting in two opposite virus evolution pathways, respectively for generalist and specialist type viruses.

Implied by Figure 4 is that the crowding conditions observed in poultry and in pig husbandry tend to attract horizontally transmitting respiratory and enteric viruses. The pathogenicity level of the viruses evolves to match the dynamics in host abundance and contact rate. At the molecular level, these RNA viruses become released from the apical surface of epithelial cells directly into the Implied by Figure 4 is that the crowding conditions observed in poultry and in pig husbandry tend to attract horizontally transmitting respiratory and enteric viruses. The pathogenicity level of the viruses evolves to match the dynamics in host abundance and contact rate. At the molecular level, these RNA viruses become released from the apical surface of epithelial cells directly into the outer-body environment. Thus, proliferative virus replication, generalized infection of respiratory plus enteric mucosae, profuse virus shedding, and swift onward transmission all go hand-in-hand.

A diametrically opposite scenario is given by relatively stable host environments observed in ruminant and equine husbandry, with parent stock and their young grazing together in the open, not unlike wild herbivore ecologies. The viruses attracted and selected for establish in the vital inner-body systems and transmit vertically, via needles or via bloodsucking arthropods. At the molecular level, virus establishment in the vital body systems is matched by low replication rates and minor or slowly evolving host damage. The utmost infiltrative viruses in the study are the retroviruses. In addition, some of other RNA viruses are deep-rooted.

The DNA viruses in the study take an intermediary position.

It has been established that epithelial viruses are highly evolvable, more so than inner-body viruses [16] . Epithelial viruses are responsive to the dynamics in the environment external to the host-body. This may be illustrated on the basis of the genetically related virus pairs in the study. For example, the influenza virus circulating in horses (EIV) generates a transient, dry cough supporting swift virus transmission via aerosols [17] . In pigs, the virus (SIV) causes coughing and sneezing, resulting from significant mucus production [18] . The virus transmits on the basis of close direct contact, in line with the social behavior and body size of pigs.

The rinderpest virus (RPV) in cattle and buffaloes primarily colonizes the alimentary tract and transmits on the basis of direct muzzle-to-muzzle contact [19] . In small ruminants, the identical peste des petits ruminants virus affects also the respiratory tract and transmits also via aerosols. Likewise, the lumpy skin disease virus (LSDV) in cattle causes persistent, deep, necrotic skin plugs and transmits via biting insects, mechanically. In sheep and goats, the virus (SGPV) causes transient lesions [20] .

The caprine arthritis-encephalitis virus (CAEV) and the Maedi-Visna virus (MVV) present an example of closely related lentiviruses establishing in the inner-body organ systems of sheep and goats. The viruses display overlap in host tropism and both transmit mainly vertically via colostrum and milk. The difference between the two viruses mainly concerns the differential inner-body virus organ system tropism.

Projected on a long evolutionary timescale, inner-body viruses tend to become locked in within the host body. This internalization may turn progressive when the epithelial transmission modes are being replaced by internal organ system-based modes. Virus establishment in the reproductive system translates in vertical transmission, in turn enhancing virus-host co-evolution [21] . Virus infiltration of also immune and circulatory systems may yield in-apparent, persistent infections, indicating low levels of pathogenicity and/or enhanced host tolerance. The division between virus and host may become blurred and given enough time the two may become one [22] .

The nature of species jumps differs between generalist and specialist type viruses. For example, an opportunistic, epithelial virus of wildlife origin is likely to be found circulating in livestock before becoming first detected in humans as host. This has been the case for influenza [23] , Henipah [24] and MERS corona viruses [25] . Further, the SARS corona virus infected civet cats raised as food animals before appearing in humans as host [26] . In contrast, more infiltrative viruses establish in the vital inner-body systems. Specialist viruses circulating in the bloodstream of non-human primates may directly jump to humans as host, as a result of complex ecological, socio-economic, demographic and other drivers. Examples comprise HIV-aids [27] , Chikungunya [28] , and Zika viruses [29] . Hence, knowing how species jumps differ for the different host ecologies may assist the study of pandemic risks.

A subtotal of 23 livestock viruses of global animal health significance was extracted from the OIE-Listed diseases, infections and infestations in force in 2019 [30] . Livestock infections and diseases resulting from virus spill-over from wildlife were excluded from the analysis. The common livestock hosts, described in the colloquial OIE terminology, comprise horses, donkeys, cattle, buffaloes, sheep, goats, swine, chicken, turkeys, ducks, and geese. The total of 36 livestock viruses belong to eleven different families and form a mix of RNA (N = 19), DNA (N = 11), and retroviruses (N = 6).

Shown in Figure S1a for each of the 36 viruses are the virus family, virus genomic architecture, virus name in full, abbreviated, and the common names given to the infection or disease. Also presented is a brief summary on the transmission ecology for each virus, with references to the primary livestock host, the virus organ system tropism, the length of the infection and shedding period, the infection severity level, the transmission modes, and the virus environmental survival rate.

Presented in Figure S1b are one-to-three scores allocated to the 36 viruses for four ecological variables. The variables comprise the extent of virus host-body infiltration, the length of the infection period, the infection severity level, and the virus environmental survival rate. The one-to-three infiltration score reflects the organ system involvement in infection-transmission and concerns, respectively, virus transmission based on the involvement of the epithelia, transmission involving epithelia and internal organs, and transmission involving just internal organs. Also shown is a one-to-four virus infiltration score, an outcome of the iterative analysis process and reflecting, respectively, virus transmission strictly based on epithelial modes, primarily based on epithelial modes, involvement of epithelia and internal organ systems, and of primarily internal organ systems. The score for the length of the infection period reflects, respectively, acute, acute plus persistent, and persistent infections. Likewise, the score for the infection severity level concerns a case fatality of less than one, one to ten, and above ten percent. The score for the virus environmental survival rate refers to the number of days that the virus remains infective outside the host body, ranging from up to three, three to ten, to over ten days. Also indicated in Figure S1b is the virus host range as observed in both livestock and wildlife. Figure S1c lists the literature sources on which Figure S1a ,b is based.

The analysis concerned an iterative process. As a first step, the one-to-three scores allocated to the 36 viruses for the four ecological variables were examined in more detail and the monotonic associations subjected to Spearman correlation. Just the scores for the virus host-body infiltration and for the length of the infection period were found to increase in value together.

Next, given the coarse match between virus infiltration and persistence, it was examined how this relationship played out at the virus family level. For this, the eleven virus families in the study were grouped and ranked A-D on the basis of the one-to-three infiltration scores allocated to the individual family viruses. Also, this A-D infiltration ranking was held against the length of the infection period scores.

Next, given the indication, from the above, that the virus families may be neatly lined up in an outerto inner-body fashion, it was examined how the organ system tropisms of the family viruses aligned with it. For this, the organ system tropisms of the viruses belonging to each family were collectively fitted and with naked eye aligned with the A-D family groups. For this, the alphabetical family order within the family groups was abandoned in order to obtain an optimal visual match. The result confirms that also the organ systems may be lined up in an outer-to inner-body fashion, virtually.

Next, the A-D family ranking was converted into a one-to-four virus infiltration score applicable to individual viruses, as described in Section 4.3, and also these scores were matched to the length of the infection period scores.

Next, since the infiltration-persistence match for the individual viruses was found to be about as strong as for the virus families, the 36 viruses were individually lined up in an outer-to inner-body fashion, irrespective the family origin, strictly on ecological grounds. For this, all of the above obtained results were considered in conjunction with the literature data on the transmission ecology collated for each of the 36 viruses in Figure S1a . Pieced together on this basis was an outer-to inner-body line-up of viruses by organ system or combination of organ systems, guided by the one-to-four virus infiltration score, the corresponding virus organ system tropism, the matching virus transmission modes, length of the infection and shedding periods, infection severity level, and virus environmental survival rate.

The finding that virus environmental survival in the outer-body environment increased from respiratory tract to alimentary tract to skin and decreased with the shift from the outer-to the inner-body environment prompted a re-examination of the relationship between the extent of virus host-body infiltration and virus environmental survival. Virus infiltration scores two-to-four, running from primarily epithelial transmission, to transmission involving also internal organ systems, to transmission primarily involving internal organ systems, were found to match with the one-to-three virus environmental survival rate scores. The indication that, at least in broad terms, the extent of virus inner-body infiltration correlated with a loss of virus robustness was applied in the virus ranking, along with the other factors.

Next, furthermore examined were the outer-to inner-body shifts in virus host tropism and virus genome. For this, the ruminant plus equine viruses were contrasted to the poultry plus pig viruses. Excluded from the host tropism correlations was the multiple host FMDV. The remaining 35 viruses all formed part of either of the two host groupings. It was found that RNA, DNA and retroviruses broadly line up in an outer-to inner-body fashion. Virus host tropism and the virus genome line-up were matched. Additional correlations concerned virus host tropism and the four virus ecological variable scores, as well as virus genome type, and the four virus ecological variable scores. It was found that from outer-to inner-body, the virus genome type and host tropism appear to shift in concert, along with the infection-transmission dynamics.

The collective results above served the compilation of the predictive framework for animal virus evolution shown in Figure 4 , Discussion section.

Evolution of feline immunodeficiency virus in Felidae: Implications for human health and wildlife ecology,"Genetic analyses of feline immunodeficiency viruses provide significant insights on the worldwide distribution and evolutionary history of this emerging pathogen. Large-scale screening of over 3000 samples from all species of Felidae indicates that at least some individuals from most species possess antibodies that cross react to FIV. Phylogenetic analyses of genetic variation in the pol-RT gene demonstrate that FIV lineages are species-specific and suggest that there has been a prolonged period of viral-host co-evolution. The clinical effects of FIV specific to species other than domestic cat are controversial. Comparative genomic analyses of all full-length FIV genomes confirmed that FIV is host specific. Recently sequenced lion subtype E is marginally more similar to Pallas cat FIV though env is more similar to that of domestic cat FIV, indicating a possible recombination between two divergent strains in the wild. Here we review global patterns of FIV seroprevalence and endemnicity, assess genetic differences within and between species-specific FIV strains, and interpret these with patterns of felid speciation to propose an ancestral origin of FIV in Africa followed by interspecies transmission and global dissemination to Eurasia and the Americas. Continued comparative genomic analyses of full-length FIV from all seropositive animals, along with whole genome sequence of host species, will greatly advance our understanding of the role of recombination, selection and adaptation in retroviral emergence.","The emergence of infectious disease within new host species or naïve populations can greatly influence species survival and adaptation. Recent outbreaks of SARS Li et al., 2005; Lu et al., 2004; Zhong et al., 2003) , avian flu (Butler, 2006; Ghedin et al., 2005) , and the devastating effects of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (http://www.unaids.org/en/HIV_data/epi2006/), provide examples of how viral pathogen emergence can pose grave threats to human health. Infectious disease outbreaks are not unique to humans, but opportunities to observe such effects in free-ranging species are rare.

Comparative studies in nonhuman species are invaluable, especially when they incorporate diverse disciplines such as wildlife biology with biomedical and veterinary medicine and thereby stimulate advances in genetic and evolutionary research of both pathogen and host.

Molecular genetic tools are informative in evaluating emerging pathogens and provide essential information such as pathogen identification, association of particular or novel strains with disease outbreaks, mutational changes leading to increased or decreased pathogenesis, and geographic and/or evolutionary origins of the pathogen. These tools also provide increasingly valuable information for design of vaccines and drug therapies. Similarly, comparative genomic analyses of mammalian species that serve as reservoir host species, or represent new opportunities for emergent pathogens, are critical in estimating patterns of outbreak, transmission, and inferring adaptive evolution and natural selection. Endangered species are particularly vulnerable to reduction in effective population size due to disease. A better understanding of viral emergence in natural populations is possible by phylogeographic methods.

Feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) offers an important comparative genomic model for the current pandemic of HIV-1, which leapt from chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) to humans; likely through direct contact with hunters in the bush meat trade in western Africa (Korber et al., 2000; Peeters et al., 2002; Sharp et al., 2000; Sharp et al., 1999) . In domestic cat (Felis catus), FIV infection results in disease progression and outcome similar to that of HIV in humans, and offers a natural model to AIDS (Bendinelli et al., 1995; Dunham, 2006; VandeWoude and Apetrei, 2006; Willett et al., 1997) . However, other free-ranging felids are infected with FIV, but seemingly do not develop AIDS-like disease (Carpenter and O'Brien, 1995; Lutz et al., 1992; Packer et al., 1999) . Immune suppression may still occur as indicated by recent analyses of both captive and wild FIV-infected lions (Panthera leo) and pumas (Puma concolor) that describe mild to severe CD4+ T-cell depletion (Bull et al., 2002; Bull et al., 2003; Roelke et al., 2006) . These findings raise the prospect that FIV is not completely benign in these species, but rather suppresses host immune response and may increase the incidence of opportunistic infections or spontaneous cancers as AIDS does in humans.

FIV is endemic in Felidae species (Biek et al., 2003; Biek et al., 2006b; Brown et al., 1994; Carpenter et al., 1996; Carpenter et al., 1998; Carpenter and O'Brien, 1995; Driciru et al., 2006; Hofmann-Lehmann et al., 1996; Munson et al., 2004; Olmsted et al., 1992; Troyer et al., 2004; Troyer et al., 2005) , many of which are considered endangered or threatened with extinction (http://www.iucnredlist.org/). Here we compare full-length proviral sequences from free-ranging lions (Pecon-Slattery et al., 2008) to FIV of domestic cat (Olmsted et al., 1989b) , Pallas cat (Otocolobus manul) (Barr et al., 1997) , and puma . Patterns of divergence describe substantial genetic differences among strains across the entire FIV genome and define monophyletic viral lineages unique to specific host species (Barr et al., 1997; Burkala and Poss, 2007; Carpenter and O'Brien, 1995; Langley et al., 1994; Olmsted et al., 1989a; Troyer et al., 2005) . We interpret these findings in the context of felid phylogeographic history (Buckley-Beason et al., 2006; Culver et al., 2000; Eizirik et al., 2001; Gilbert et al., 1991; Johnson et al., 1998; Johnson and O' Brien, 1997; Johnson et al., 1999; Luo et al., 2004; Menotti-Raymond and O'Brien, 1993; O'Brien, 1994; O'Brien and Johnson, 2005; Slattery et al., 1994; Uphyrkina et al., 2001) and patterns of evolution and speciation within Felidae King et al., 2007; Masuda et al., 1996; Pecon Slattery and O'Brien, 1998; Pecon-Slattery et al., 2004) to assess FIV emergence in endangered cat species. Lastly, we offer a perspective on scientific advancements in retroviral emergence within humans and other mammalian species that has been made possible by the advent of the genomics era.

Patterns of divergence within full-length genomes of emerging pathogens such as FIV define (1) changes linked with pathogenesis and virulence of each outbreak; (2) viral protein structure and function; and (3) estimates of mutation rates within viral genes. This approach, while promising, has been limited because only full-length FIV provirus from domestic cat FIV-Fca, pallas cat FIV-Oma, and puma FIV-Pco have been sequenced (Barr et al., 1997; Langley et al., 1994; Olmsted et al., 1989b) . As part of our ongoing efforts to obtain complete proviral genome from all FIV seropositive species, we isolated and sequenced FIV-Ple subtype E from wild lions in Okavango Delta in Botswana (Pecon- Slattery et al., 2008) for comparative genomic analysis. As postulated in our previous studies (Brown et al., 1994; Carpenter et al., 1998; Carpenter and O' Brien, 1995; Roelke et al., 2006) , FIV-Ple may have acquired or maintained genetic motifs indicative of reduced virulence.

FIV-Ple subtype E shares similar genome organization with other FIV isolates and consists of LTR, gag, pol, vif, orfA, env , and additional small ORFs that may represent accessory genes including rev (Table 1 ). The LTR contains common transcription and regulatory elements of IR, AP-4, Aml-1 (EPB20), AP-1, TATA box, Poly A, and the cap transcription initiation site yet differs in the placement of NF-AT and CREBP-1/c-Jun (Pecon- Slattery et al., 2008) . FIV-Ple gag (sites 703-2199) encodes three structural proteins (matrix, capsid and nucleocapsid) shared by all FIV. Pol (sites 2004-5450) is highly conserved and encodes the key viral enzymes of protease, reverse transcriptase, RNAase, dUTPase and integrase. Similar to HIV-1 vpr, FIV-Ple Vif (sites 5447-6211) is thought to be an accessory protein essential for viral replication. OrfA (sites 6198-6452) in lion FIV-Ple likely corresponds to tat of HIV for targeting transcription factors in the LTR. Env (sites 6532-9222) has a leader region and also encodes the surface (SU) and transmembrane (TM) regions of the envelope glycoprotein essential in viral binding and entry into the host cell. Like other FIVs, FIV-Ple rev is thought to be essential in viral replication and is encoded by splicing two exons: the first in the leader region of env, the second in a ORF proximal to 3′ region of env (Table 1) .

Although sharing conserved genome organization, large genetic differences exist among species-specific FIV strains. Consequently, the necessary step of aligning FIV sequences for detecting evolutionary and adaptive differences between species-specific strains is problematic. Therefore, amino acid residues are used as a ""scaffold"" for alignment of nucleotides using RevTrans (Wernersson and Pedersen, 2003) . Our results indicate pol is the most conserved gene across FIV, although it exhibits substantial average pair-wise genetic distances of 60% and 54% for nucleotide and amino acid data, respectively. Similarly, gag has an average pair-wise genetic distance of 72% for nucleotides, and 62% amino acids. In contrast, vif, orfA, env and rev all were more divergent, with average genetic distances of 100% for both nucleotide and amino acid data across all FIV, suggesting multiple hits and mutational saturation of variable sites across viral strains (Pecon- Slattery et al., 2008) .

Specific comparison of FIV-Ple subtype E with the other FIV proviral genomes confirms functional constraints for gag and pol (Burkala and Poss, 2007; Carpenter et al., 1996; Carpenter et al., 1998) , and the rapid evolution of vif, orfA, and env (Table 2 ). FIV-Ple viral genes gag and pol are marginally more similar to Pallas cat FIV-Oma, followed by FIV-Fca, and highly divergent from FIV-Pco (Table 2) . Lion vif and orfA show some homology to FIV-Oma, but virtually none with FIV from domestic cat and puma.

Phylogenetic analyses of concatenated sequences from coding regions excluding env (6435 bp) recapitulate that FIV strains are specific to their host species. Three subtypes of FIV-Fca in domestic cat exhibit the least, and puma subtypes A and B the most, within-species genetic divergence among FIV subtypes (Fig. 1A) . FIV-Ple and FIV-Oma are monophyletic and appear to have evolved from a common ancestral virus.

Inclusion of env sequences within the data (9393 bp) alters this association between FIV-Ple subtype E and FIV-Oma (Fig. 1B) . In env, the SU and TM regions of FIV-Ple are more closely affiliated with domestic cat FIV-Fca, albeit with a large average genetic distance (67% nucleotide and 69% amino acid; Table 2 ). Only the leader region of FIV-Ple env, which also encodes the first exon of rev (Table 1) , retains homology with FIV-Oma (Pecon- Slattery et al., 2008) . These env differences represent a novel feature that has evolved during the emergence of FIV-Ple subtype E in lions and appears to result from an ancestral episode of recombination. It is not clear if FIV-Ple recombined with FIV-Fca, since the divergence is quite large, or with env from another FIV that is not yet sequenced. Nonetheless, recombination in FIV-Ple env may be a genetic signature of viral pathogenicity in lions and is under further investigation (Pecon- Slattery et al., 2008) .

Conservation of gene structure and sequence in gag and pol make these genes useful markers of FIV diversification in Felidae. Phylogenetic analyses of the pol-RT region isolated from 72 diverse FIV strains derived from six felid species, plus spotted hyaena, Crocuta crocuta, affirm the high level of species-specificity worldwide ( Fig. 2) . However, three general phylogenetic patterns are present among lineages, suggesting FIV evolutionary differences that may be further resolved by our phylogeographic studies of cat species.

In natural populations of American puma (P. concolor), FIV-Pco consists of two highly divergent subtypes A and B ( Fig. 1A and B) that appear to be paraphyletic within the pol-RT phylogeny (Fig. 2) , perhaps a consequence of two separate introductions of FIV within puma populations (see Troyer, this issue). Long branch lengths uniting and defining strains within each puma subtype, and low geographic concordance between strains (Fig. 2) , support our previous hypothesis of a long residence time within pumas (Carpenter et al., 1996) . The puma species diverged approximately 4 million years ago (MYA) from a common ancestor shared with the jaguarundi Pecon-Slattery et al., 2004) . During the last ice age of the late Pleistocene, pumas were extirpated from North America, but re-emerged from Brazil 10-12,000 years ago (Culver et al., 2000) . Except for a relic, inbred population dwelling in Florida (Roelke et al., 1993) , North American pumas are panmictic and inhabit western continental regions (Biek et al., 2006a; Culver et al., 2000) . Although studies of FIV-Pco B infecting pumas in the Rocky Mountains indicate that small local areas of closely related strains occurs in the wild (Biek et al., 2006a; Biek et al., 2003; Culver et al., 2000) , the overall lack of broad geographic associations (Carpenter et al., 1996) is consistent with the virus freely circulating within one large population. Further, Central and South America FIV-Pco are more related to North American strains than to each other (Carpenter et al., 1996) (Fig. 2) . The pattern of deeply divergent strains (consistent with long residence time within pumas) that do not cluster by geographic location within the New World, suggests that divergent FIV-Pco strains were already present in those South American pumas which re-colonized North America and supports a more ancient origin of the virus. The evolution of the more rare FIV-Pco subtype A remains inconclusive, and awaits further clarification from our ongoing FIV studies of Central and South American populations of puma.

In African lions, FIV-Ple has diverged into 6 subtypes A-F, each with distinct geographic areas of endemnicity (Brown et al., 1994; O'Brien et al., 2006; Troyer et al., 2004) . Fossil records indicate the African lion (P. leo) arose approximately 2 MYA, and spread throughout Africa, Asia and the Americas . However, modern lions are confined to the African continent except for a small relic population in the Gir forest of India. Genetic studies indicate modern African lion populations trace back to a founders event around 325,000 years ago in East Africa (Antunes et al., submitted) . The pattern of FIV-Ple gene evolution shows division of Southern and Eastern clades, with somewhat greater diversity seen in East Africa, and evidence for spread of one Southern strain (FIV-Ple A) into the Eastern population of the Serengeti National Reserve ( Fig. 2 ; Antunes et al., submitted; Troyer et al., 2004) . The high level of phylogeographic integrity of FIV-Ple compared to FIV-Pco may reflect behavioral differences; lions are social with frequent opportunities for viral transmission within and between prides whereas puma are solitary, and interact infrequently. Given the relative genetic uniformity of African lions, the absence of FIV-Ple in populations east of the Kalahari is puzzling, but may be explained by the low density of lions in this area (Antunes et al., submitted) .

Evolution of FIV-Fca in domestic cat is characterized a relatively long monophyletic branch diverging into three FIV-Fca subtypes A, B and C. Intra-subtype genetic differences are minimal, denoted by short branch lengths for each FIV-Fca subtype strain (Fig. 2) . The domestic cat evolved as a unique felid lineage only around 10,000 year ago (Vigne et al., 2004) from subspecies of wildcat Felis silvestris inhabiting Near East Asia (Driscoll et al., 2007) . With the exception of some populations of European wild cat, F. silvestris (Fromont et al., 2000) . FIV appears to be absent from nearly all of the close relatives of domestic cat (Troyer et al., 2005) . Thus, the pattern of FIV-Fca divergence may represent recent emergence combined with rapid viral diversification within the domestic cat worldwide.

FIV genome sequences have been recovered from wild populations of leopard (Panthera pardus), cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus), Pallas cat (O. manul) and spotted hyaena (C. crocuta). In these species, FIV exhibits sequence diversity comparable to that observed for the domestic cat FIV-Fca suggesting rather recent (compared to lion or puma) acquisition of FIV (Fig. 2) . Two species that evolved in distinctly different felid lineages (Fig. 3) , leopard and cheetah, coexist in the Serengeti National Park in Tanzania, and are infected with closely related viruses (FIV-Ppa and FIV-Aju, respectively) suggesting recent inter-species transmission (Fig. 2) . The cheetah once had a global distribution and was extirpated from North America 10,000 years ago, but has since rapidly expanded throughout Africa (Menotti-Raymond and O'Brien, 1993) . Thus, FIV-Aju emergence may have occurred within the last 10,000 years, perhaps acquired from leopards. Alternatively, FIV-Aju may have been already present in prebottleneck cheetahs, and re-emerged and spread within extant populations, with a subsequent inter-species transmission into leopards. Lastly, FIV-Ccr occurs in spotted hyena, a species from the Hyaenidae family within Carnivores that co-exist in the same habitats as most African species of cat, affording opportunities for cross-species transmission. However, with few exceptions (see Troyer, this issue) the strong monophyletic origin of each species-specific strain suggests that FIV has rarely undergone effective transmission between species.

The pattern of prevalence of FIV, considered with the habitat range of each host species, depicts FIV as a global pathogen. Recently, 3055 specimens from 35 felid species and three hyaena species (family Hyaenidae) were screened with both western blot and PCR amplification of gag and pol (Troyer et al., 2005) . The findings demonstrated that 19 free-ranging species were sero-reactive to FIV (Fig. 3) . Studies of felid populations in the wild indicate FIV occurs in majority of New World species, including the ocelot (Leopardus pardalis), puma (P. concolor), jaguar (Panthera onca), margay (Leopardus weidii), and tigrina (Leopardus tigrina) as well as several large African cats of lion (P. leo), cheetah (A. jubatus) and leopard (P. pardus), and spotted hyena (C. crocuta) from the related carnivore family of Hyaenidae. Only one species of Asian cat, Pallas cat (O. manul), has been confirmed by PCR to harbor FIV. Thus, these findings suggest FIV distribution worldwide is not uniform, being endemic in most exotic cat species in Africa and the Americas but infrequent in Eurasia.

The precise origin of FIV emergence into Felidae is not easily discerned by viral phylogenetic analyses. FIV pol-RT phylogenetic trees have a ""star-burst"" phylogenetic pattern typically associated with recent, rapid evolution, in which hierarchical internal nodes are short, and fail to resolve the relative order of lineage divergence (Fig. 2) . Yet, the distinct differences in topology and branch lengths observed between FIV lineages (Fig. 2) plus extreme genetic divergence among FIV strains, suggest a more ancient introduction of FIV to the Felidae.

We also have examined patterns of speciation within Felidae in the context of FIV dissemination. Modern felids are highly adapted, widely distributed species that have a fairly well-represented fossil record that has been integrated with extensive molecular genetic data sets . These analyses show that extant felids arose from a common ancestor in Asia 10.8 MYA during the Miocene. The 38 felid species form eight distinct evolutionary lineages that have successfully inhabited all continents except Antarctica through a series of migrations likely facilitated by sea-level oscillations (Fig. 3) .

The widespread occurrence of FIV combined with large interspecies divergence in Africa would suggest that FIV arose in Africa rather than Asia. Lentiviruses are endemic in Africa, infecting over 36 species of primates Hirsch et al., 1995; Sharp et al., 2005) and at least four of five African species of cat surveyed in the wild (Fig. 3) . Considered together with the presence of CAEV, BIV, and visna in Africa ungulate species (Achour et al., 1994; Adams et al., 1984; Ayelet et al., 2001; Payne et al., 1986; Querat et al., 1987; Woldemeskel et al., 2002) , an African origin of all lentiviruses may be posited. Second, the substantial genetic difference observed among FIV lineages in Africa is consistent with a long residence time within these species, and does not support recent dissemination from Asia into Africa (Figs. 1A and B and 2) . Third, the position of hyena FIV-Ccr within felid FIV suggests increased opportunities for inter-species transmission due to a greater elapsed time since the virus entered and disseminated in African felids.

As an alternative to an African origin, FIV might have arisen in Asia along with the progenitor of modern felids 10.8 MYA. In this scenario, we might expect a more ubiquitous viral presence in all cat species worldwide, high endemnicity of FIV residing in Asian felids, and substantial genetic diversity in Asian FIV strains accumulating over a prolonged period of time. The near absence of FIV in Asian species (except for the Mongolian Pallas cats), supported by ongoing surveillance, does not preclude an ancient Asian origin. Nonetheless, the most parsimonious interpretation, considering the rarity of FIV in Asian felids along with the complete absence of SIV in Asian primates, and combined with the dynamic biogeographic changes in sea level limiting species migrations into and out of this region during felid evolution, is that the virus did not originate along with ancestral felids of Asia.

Global dissemination of FIV from Africa might have been possible during two periods of felid transcontinental migrations into Eurasia and the Americas. The earliest felid migration across the Bering Strait to North America was approximately 4.5 MYA, during a short geologic interval of relatively low sea levels . These early migrants into North America radiated into seven species of the ocelot lineage; cheetah, puma and jaguarundi of the puma lineage; and the four modern species within the lynx lineage (Fig. 3) . A second opportunity for FIV transmission from Eurasia into the New World would not occur again until Asian lions and jaguars moved into North America and subsequently into South America in the late Pliocene/early Pleistocene . This more recent migration appears to be the most parsimonious interpretation, but this issue should be clarified further once FIV from the remaining seropositive felid species are sequenced. Further, the potential role of extinct felids, such as the saber-tooth species, which co-existed with modern felids until around the end of the Pleistocene (Turner, 1997) , in FIV dissemination may never be known but is intriguing nonetheless. In conclusion, our consensus scenario describes FIVoriginating in Africa, successfully infecting all related species within the Panthera lineage no earlier than the late Pliocene, migrating with ancestral populations of species such as African lion and jaguar across Eurasia into North America during the Pleistocene with subsequent dissemination into New World cat species.

Whole genome sequences of mammals, starting with human, mouse Mus spp, rat Rattus spp, and chimpanzee P. troglodytes, but now extended to dog Canis familiaris, cat F. catus (see Pontius, this issue), elephant Loxodonata africana and other mammals that capture phylogenetic divergence across all the orders of placental mammals (see NHGRI website: www.genome.gov/), are now available to provide a powerful new basis for genetic and pathogen studies.

Whole genome studies indicate mammalian genomes evolve at different rates (Cooper et al., 2004 ) and categories of genes experience different regimes of selection to either diversify or maintain function among species. Human and chimpanzee, separated by only 5-7 MY of evolution (Enard and Paabo, 2004) , exhibit profound differences in chromosome recombination (Winckler et al., 2005) , gene expression (Hill and Walsh, 2005) and differential selection for biological function (Clark et al., 2003) . These are but a few of the growing number of studies using molecular genomic technologies in nonhuman animal species that will advance our ability to identify regulatory/virulence genes in pathogens as well as host genes that regulate transmission, incubation, latency, virulence, morbidity, mortality and the immune response.

Advances in human genomics and evolutionary history have led to a comprehensive depiction of retroviral strategies in global dissemination that can, in turn, aid in wildlife research. The emergence of HIV represents the extreme of an explosive pandemic, infecting within a single generation 40 million people worldwide, and causing devastating mortality. Biomedical research motivated by the search for vaccines and a cure, has led to exquisite detail on HIV genomics, epidemiology, virology and pathogenicity represented by over 200,000 publications listed within NCBI database alone (as of February 2007). Along with research on primate SIV, this information has been essential to research of FIV genomics, pathogenesis and prevalence in endangered species.

FIV evolution is analogous to human and simian T-cell leukemia virus (HTLV/STLV). HTLV-1, infects approximately 20 million people throughout the world and causes adult Tcell leukemia/lymphoma (Poiesz et al., 1980) and the neurologic disease tropical spastic paraparesis/HTLV-1-associated myelopathy (Gessain et al., 1985) . Phylogenetic studies of HTLV-1 and STLV from over 20 species of non-human primates indicate HTLV-1 arose in humans at least six times from STLV strains . The extent of molecular divergence within strains from central Africa, high levels of endemnicity within isolated ethnic groups, and the recent discovery of additional HTLV/STLV types in that region (Switzer et al., 2006; Wolfe et al., 2005) , suggest an ancient African origin of HTLV/STLV. Current patterns of distribution among ethnic peoples worldwide suggest the virus spread out of African via human migrations over the past 100,000 years (Cavalli-Sforza and Feldman, 2003; Slattery et al., 1999; Switzer et al., 2006) . Compared with HIV, HTLV/STLV exhibits relatively longterm co-evolution between host and pathogen (Overbaugh and Bangham, 2001) . Thus, HTLV/ STLV in primates and FIV from species such as puma, jaguar, cheetah and lion, illustrate how naturally occurring retroviral infections have achieved modern-day global distributions.

Infectious disease epidemics are not unique to humans, but opportunities to observe such effects in free-ranging species are rare. Comparative studies in nonhuman species are invaluable and incorporate diverse disciplines such as genomics and wildlife biology with biomedical and veterinary science. Cumulative research on the 38 species within the cat family Felidae integrates host and pathogen genomics to provide a novel perspective of retroviral emergence in a successful, highly adapted Carnivore family.

FIV seroprevalence and genetic studies suggest the virus is global in distribution, with local regions of endemnicity in the wild. Evolutionary studies suggest FIV arose in Africa and has existed within Felidae since the late Pliocene. There is strong evidence that FIV evolves in different ways within each species. Rates of mutation vary among FIV genes. Gag and pol, genes that encode critical structural proteins and enzymes, are more conserved relative to vif, orfA and env, suggesting the latter genes are under greater host selection pressure and can withstand greater variation in structure without crippling viral replication.

Cumulative research on felid natural history, evolution and phylogeography provides important context for FIV emergence. The phylogeny of FIV resembles a ""star-burst"" pattern typically associated with recent, rapid evolution and is not concordant with host species evolution. However, integration of Felidae evolution and species phylogeography with FIV patterns of distribution describes an evolutionary scenario for a more ancient origin of FIV in Africa followed by global dissemination into Eurasia and the Americas.

Similarities in the natural history and evolution of FIV and primate retroviruses indicate Africa as a common nexus. Molecular genetic analyses of viral strains from African primates and felids show high levels of divergence consistent with long residence times. In Asia, FIV is rare in felids and SIV is absent in primates, suggesting lentiviruses did not originate in this region. Although HTLV/STLV are present in Melanesia, the greatest diversity among all known strains so far described occurs in Africa. The role of ancestral migrations of host species in retroviral dissemination from Africa throughout the world is supported both by the concordance between HTLV/STLV and HIV/SIV evolution and human history. These patterns are similar with FIV and the natural history of each felid host species and points to the intriguing role of ancestral patterns of migration in the global distribution of FIV in Felidae observed today.

Whole genome sequence is essential for the next generation of studies of host and pathogen. Emerging pathogens utilize diverse strategies for genome adaptation and re-organization to successfully infect new host species that are only discernable through full genome scans. Our depiction of changes with env of FIV-Ple subtype E in wild lions validates this approach, and argues for continued surveillance of wild populations and application of biomedical advances for both humans and wildlife.

Virus-Host Coevolution with a Focus on Animal and Human DNA Viruses,"Viruses have been infecting their host cells since the dawn of life, and this extremely long-term coevolution gave rise to some surprising consequences for the entire tree of life. It is hypothesised that viruses might have contributed to the formation of the first cellular life form, or that even the eukaryotic cell nucleus originates from an infection by a coated virus. The continuous struggle between viruses and their hosts to maintain at least a constant fitness level led to the development of an unceasing arms race, where weapons are often shuttled between the participants. In this literature review we try to give a short insight into some general consequences or traits of virus-host coevolution, and after this we zoom in to the viral clades of adenoviruses, herpesviruses, nucleo-cytoplasmic large DNA viruses, polyomaviruses and, finally, circoviruses.","What can be the origin of an obligatory cellular parasite? Three concurring hypotheses describe the origin of viruses: (i) the primordial virus world or the virus first hypothesis claims that the ancestors of viruses existed already in the pre-cellular world; (ii) the escaped genes theory describes viruses as mobile genetic elements, which became independent of their host cells; (iii) whereas according to the cellular regression theory, viruses are regressed intracellular parasites (Holmes 2013 ).

According to the primordial virus world hypothesis, in the primordial soup multiple pre-cellular and pre-viral Urorganisms competed with each other. The last universal common ancestor-the first cellular life form-emerged from these primordial replicators, and at least a fraction of current viruses might originate from the remaining ones . Ancient viruses might have even contributed to the formation of the last universal common ancestor of all living organisms.

It is generally accepted that an RNA-based world preceded today's DNA-and protein-based one. RNA viruses and especially the capsidless viroids might resemble this ancient world (Elena et al. 1991) . However, the evolution of viruses-which has been especially rapid for RNA viruses-destroyed the possible signal of genetic relatedness a long time ago, making phylogenetic reconstruction already impossible. Luckily, some sort of evidence is still 1 3 within reach: the existence of viral protein fold superfamilies without cellular counterparts. Proteins without any primary sequence homology are still grouped based on their conserved tertiary structure, their folding: e.g. the major capsid proteins of the PRD1 bacteriophage, adenoviruses and some archaeal viruses all have a double jellyroll fold structure (Benson et al. 1999; Caetano-Anollés 2015, 2017) , or there are structural homologies in the RNA-and DNA-dependent polymerases too (Gorbalenya et al. 2002) . There are fold superfamilies containing both viral and cellular proteins (we will return to this phenomenon by the escaped genes theory), but there are also numerous examples without cellular homologues found in phylogenetically very diverse viruses: e.g. viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases are not homologous to their cellular counterparts (Iyer et al. 2003) . According to the most parsimonious assumption, these proteins have a common origin in the primordial virus world, and phylogenetic tree reconstructions of these fold superfamilies confirm this as well (Nasir and Caetano-Anollés 2015) .

Viruses became obligatory parasites either only after the emergence of the last universal common ancestor, or it is equally possible that they were already parasitizing on other ancient replicators. According to the viral eukaryogenesis hypothesis, even the eukaryotic cell nucleus originates from an infection by a coated virus: the virus became an endosymbiont usurping the role of the original archaean nucleus (Bell 2009 ). The endosymbiont pox-like virus had no possibility for a lytic viral cycle, and under this evolutionary pressure started to replicate by means of cell-to-cell fusion using its fusion proteins. When two such cells-infected by related viruses-fused to each other, the viral DNA was copied, and homologous viral chromosomes formed tetrads. Cell division resulted in four daughter cells with one copy of the endosymbiont virus in each. This might be the origin of meiotic cell division (Bell 2006) . After its development, sexual reproduction offered a significant fitness advantage in the fight against any parasite (Hamilton et al. 1990 ), including viruses.

This theory states that mobile genetic elements escaped the cell, acquired a protein capsid and started to replicate autonomously López-García 2005, 2009 ). Numerous homologies can be observed among viral and cellular genes. On the other hand, the root position, and thus the certain direction of evolution, might be challenging to determine. For example, cellular and viral DNA polymerases are related (Filée et al. 2002) , but the exact direction of the lateral gene transfer is unknown (Shackelton and Holmes 2004 ).

Perhaps the least favoured theory currently claims that viruses are the extremely reduced descendants of obligatory intracellular parasites, incapable of autonomous extracellular life (Bândea 1983) . According to this theory, the viral genome is the remnant of a heavily reduced cellular genome and the capsid is that of a cell membrane. The nucleo-cytoplasmic large DNA viruses (NCLDVs) are good candidates to represent the end result of this mechanism: they proliferate in the cytoplasm, and have particle and genome sizes comparable to those of the smallest prokaryotes (Arslan et al. 2011; Colson et al. 2012 Colson et al. , 2011 . The modern version of this theory was mentioned when discussing the primordial virus world: viruses might be the reduced descendants of pre-cellular Ur-organisms, converting into obligatory cellular parasites (Claverie 2006; Forterre 1991 ).

The theories of viral origin are a topic of heated debate, but most possibly none of them is mutually exclusive, and the suspected processes of two or more could have occurred parallel and/or sequentially as well. A small proportion of mobile genetic elements might have its root in the primordial virus world, but numerous regression or escape occasions must have occurred too. The latter were perhaps facilitated by the cellular genomic insertion of viral genetic elements. Polintons, also known as Mavericks, are mobile genetic elements with multiple homologues in both cellular and viral genomes. They have escaped several times and gave rise to different viruses and mobile genetic elements such as adenoviruses or mitochondrial linear plasmids Koonin 2015, 2017) . It must be stressed again that these genetic elements are homologous and related, but the direction of the genetic exchange is unknown in most cases. Such transfers are common from host to virus and vice versa too.

Endogenous viral elements (EVEs) are viral genes or sometimes complete genomes inserted into host genomes. As genome integration is a compulsory step in retroviral replication, most of these elements are of retroviral origin, but further virus families were detected as well: hepadnaviruses, adeno-associated viruses, herpesviruses and others (Aiewsakun and Katzourakis 2015; Bill and Summers 2004; Broecker and Moelling 2019; Morissette and Flamand 2010; Young and Samulski 2001) . If the insertion occurs in the germ cell line, the inserted sequence stretch might get inherited. And if it provides a selective advantage, e.g. protection from a viral infection, the genomic change will be fixed in the population. In case this advantage disappears, the inserted stretch might mutate over time and lose its protective nature (Broecker et al. 2016) .

EVEs are important sources for virus-host coevolutionary research, as they provide a map for viral host range. The history of coevolution can be traced by the detection of homologous endogenous viral sequences in different host species. This provides information about the historical host range of a virus clade, and even the time frame of coevolution can be inferred based on the known diversification times of the hosts, or on phylogenetic analyses of exo-and endogenous viral sequences. E.g. based on endogenous lentiviral sequences in lemurs, it was hypothesised that these viruses have been coevolving with primates for several millions of years (Katzourakis et al. 2007 ).

Viruses represent a major force in evolutionary pressure (Emerman and Malik 2010; Villarreal and Witzany 2010). Retroviruses, for example, are so effective in genome integration and have been coevolving with vertebrates so long, that over 50% of the human genome was estimated to consist of endogenous retroviral elements (de Koning et al. 2011) . Some of these regions provide important and fundamental attributes to their integrator hosts, like the syncytin genes, which have an important role in placental development not only in various mammals but in viviparous lizards as well (Cornelis et al. 2017; Imakawa and Nakagawa 2017) . Other transposable elements contribute to embryonic development, stem cell pluripotency or cell differentiation in eukaryotes (Chuong et al. 2017) . In prokaryotes, important functions were attributed to the integrated viruses as well. E.g. in E. coli, deleting all prophages has resulted in increased susceptibility to environmental factors and slower cell growth (Wang et al. 2010 ).

Essentially, the viral mutation rate and copy number determine the variability within the host and in fine the stock of viral evolution (Duffy et al. 2008; Peck and Lauring 2018; Sanjuán and Domingo-Calap 2016) . Generally, viral pathogens exist in diverse populations in vivo (McCrone and Lauring 2018). As a substantial evolutionary effect on the population dynamics of viruses, genetic bottleneck (reduction of effective population size due to environmental events, for instance new habitat colonisation) affects the virus-host coevolution: it decreases both the genetic variation and the fitness of the virus, and furthermore it is responsible for the founder effect (Novella et al. 1995) . Changes of genotype frequencies by stochastic population size reduction are referred to as genetic drift (Bergstrom et al. 1999; Dennehy et al. 2006; Elena et al. 2001; McCrone and Lauring 2018; Zwart and Elena 2015) . Furthermore, it is important to stress that the phenomenon of genetic bottleneck is interpretable from both virus and host perspective (Voskarides et al. 2018) .

In the case of the viruses, the newly colonised region might be a new host (host switch) or organ (Voskarides et al. 2018; Zwart and Elena 2015) . Bottleneck events occur during both intra-and inter-species steps of the viral life cycle (Gutiérrez et al. 2012 ). An interesting aspect of virus evolution and the bottleneck effect is the case of multipartite viruses (e.g. plant-infecting nanoviruses or animal-infecting bidnaviruses, alphatetraviruses, nodaviruses and picobirnaviruses). These package their genetic material as independently encapsidated separate segments (Lucía-Sanz and Manrubia 2017). Self-evidently, bottleneck events have a crucial role for these viruses, as all genomic segments are needed for a successful infection. Furthermore, the different genomic segments drift at different rates (Gallet et al. 2018 ).

Under the constant threat of an infection, cellular organisms have developed multiple layers of different defence mechanisms (not solely) against these genetic parasites to protect themselves and their genomic integrity.

Most strikingly, antiviral defence mechanisms often have viral origins too tenOever 2016; Villarreal 2009 ). The simplest mechanism is the superinfection exclusion, where an integrated and expressed endogenous viral protein provides protection from exogenous infection. This was first described in the tobacco plant, but it is applied by prokaryotes, animals or other plants as well (Moelling et al. 2017 ). The development of such a defence mechanism was observed in sheep and koalas for example. Retroviral elements were endogenised even as recently as 200 and 100 years ago in the genomes of sheep and koala, respectively, providing protection against certain exogenous retroviral infections (Armezzani et al. 2014; Tarlinton et al. 2006) .

But such basic integrations are not the only examples. The recently described bacterial antiphage system, CRISPR-Cas (Charpentier and Doudna 2013) , has its roots in at least five different classes of mobile genetic elements (Koonin and Makarova 2017) . The Argonaute proteins show structural and functional homologies to the retroviral replication machinery and provide protection against invading nucleic acids in prokaryotes (Moelling et al. 2006) . The RNA interference system of eukaryotes shares the same homologies, and it is available in each of the five eukaryotic superkingdoms, suggesting a very ancient evolutionary origin (Cerutti and Casas-Mollano 2006) . Though present, this system does not provide antiviral effects in chordates. But also here, endogenous retroviruses provide transcription factor binding sites for interferon-stimulated genes (Chuong et al. 2016; Ito et al. 2017) , whereas the Rag recombinases-needed for the diversification of antibodies-originate from transposons found in the genomes of starfish, oysters and sea urchins (Kapitonov and Koonin 2015) .

The most ancient defence mechanism might be the use of antisense RNAs, where the gene translation of the invading pathogen is interfered by small complementary RNAs (Gottesman and Storz 2011) . Against DNA phages, bacteria often use restriction endonucleases, cleaving the viral genome (Kobayashi 2001) . Piwi-interacting RNAs associate with nucleases and provide defence against transposable elements. The latter are available in all metazoans, and they may have a common origin with the prokaryotic Argonaute system (Iwasaki et al. 2015) . As already mentioned, the RNA interference does not provide an antiviral effect in chordates; instead, pattern recognition receptors were developed. Engagement of these by pathogen-associated molecular patterns (i) induces antiviral cytokines: the tumour necrosis factor, available in most eukaryotic lineages, but in chordates rather the interleukins and interferons (Levy et al. 2011) , and (ii) activates the natural killer cells too (Esteso et al. 2017) . The APOBEC3 protein is part of the innate immune system in humans, it targets specifically retroviruses and interferes with their reverse transcription (Sheehy et al. 2002) . However, HIV counteracts this effect by the viral infectivity factor, which triggers the degradation of APOBEC3 (Donahue et al. 2008) . Furthermore, it was also observed that human leucocyte antigen I and II loci are genetically more diversified in pathogen-(most predominantly virus-) rich environments (Prugnolle et al. 2005; Sanchez-Mazas et al. 2012) .

After this short general introduction on the highlights of the topic, we focus on the coevolutionary processes of selected DNA viruses: adeno-, herpes-, NCLD-, polyomaand circoviruses.

Adenoviruses are DNA viruses, the major capsid proteins of the non-enveloped, icosahedral capsid are the hexon, the penton base and the protruding fibre, responsible for receptor binding. Their non-segmented, double-stranded, linear genome varies between 26 and 45 kbp in size, and the DNA is covalently bound to the terminal protein (Harrach 2014) . Adenoviruses infect vertebrate hosts, and are clustered into five accepted and one proposed genera. Members of the genera Mastadenovirus and Aviadenovirus infect mammals and birds, respectively. Atadenoviruses were detected in reptiles, birds, ruminants and a marsupial possum; siadenoviruses in birds, a frog and a tortoise. The single member of the genus Ichtadenovirus is the white sturgeon adenovirus. The sixth genus was proposed recently: testadenoviruses were detected in testudinoid turtles only until now (Doszpoly et al. 2013) .

As these viruses were described from five major classes of the vertebrates, the hypothesis was formed that adenoviruses had started to coevolve with the vertebrates 450 million years ago, before the divergence of fish from other vertebrates (Kovács et al. 2003) . Mast-, avi-, at-, si-and ichtadenoviruses had been thought to coevolve with mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians and fish, respectively (Benkő and Harrach 2003) . This hypothesis was partially questioned later, as the white sturgeon and the frog adenovirus-the latter belonging to genus Siadenovirus-are the single fish or amphibian adenoviruses, respectively, discovered until now (Davison et al. 2000; Doszpoly et al. 2019) . Furthermore, several avian adenoviruses clustered into the genus Siadenovirus Kovács and Benko 2011; Kovács et al. 2010; Lee et al. 2014 ). Yet, it is equally possible that several further amphibian and fish adenoviruses are awaiting discovery.

Adenoviruses are generally thought to be host specific with usually one or very few host species for a specific viral serotype. Still, during the hundreds of millions of years, host changes did happen, e.g. there were ten predicted host switches in the evolution of human adenoviruses in 4.5 million years (Hoppe et al. 2015) . The most striking assumed host switch happened for some atadenoviruses. These are thought to be the lineage coevolving with squamatid reptiles originally (Wellehan et al. 2004 ), but presumably a virus strain had jumped to an ancient ruminant during the evolutionary history. Atadenoviruses were isolated from cattle, sheep and mule deer, suggesting some level of coevolution already. However, the high genomic A + T content-hence the name atadenovirus-contradicts long cospeciation of these viruses (Benkő and Harrach 1998) .

Non-reptile atadenovirus genomes are characterised by 57.0-66.3% A + T content, whereas reptile atadenoviruses are not affected by such bias (Farkas et al. 2002; Harrach 2008; Papp et al. 2009; Wellehan et al. 2004) . Examples from other virus families are known: the influenzaviral nucleotide composition changes following a host jump from bird to mammal (Greenbaum et al. 2008) , or similar differences were observed between flaviviruses or herpesviruses of different hosts (Jenkins et al. 2001; McGeoch et al. 2006 ).

Obviously, this composition has an effect on codon usage, thus the complete genome sequence might be under evolutionary pressure (Shackelton et al. 2006) . Still, the exact cause of this bias in atadenoviruses is unknown, but it is hypothesised that longer coevolutionary times-adaptation of the virus to the host-result in a balanced nucleotide composition (Farkas et al. 2002; Papp et al. 2009; Wellehan et al. 2004) .

Similar observations were made about pathology. Adenoviruses generally cause a mild disease, and there are apathogenic strains at least in healthy individuals. E.g. recent research shows that only specific and not all serotypes of the species Fowl aviadenovirus D and E cause inclusion body hepatitis in chicken (Schachner et al. 2018; Zadravec et al. 2011) . But recent host switches might result in an elevated pathogenicity (Benkő and Harrach 2003; Jánoska et al. 2011; Kohl et al. 2012; Vidovszky et al. 2015) . For instance, duck adenovirus 1 is apathogenic in ducks and geese, but causes the egg drop syndrome in chickens (Hess et al. 1997) . Another atadenovirus causes a haemorrhagic epizooty among mule deer (Lehmkuhl et al. 2001; Woods et al. 1996) . Or bovine adenovirus 10-though a mastadenovirus-is only distantly related to other bovine mastadenoviruses, and it causes a severe acute fibrinous enterocolitis (Horner et al. 1989 ). The A + T content of the known genome part is over 59%, and from serologically identical strains several fibre size variants were described (Ursu et al. 2004 ). These mutations might be the consequences of an ongoing evolution, and represent the adaptation to a relatively new host, cattle (Benkő and Harrach 2003) .

The most investigated adenoviruses are evidently human and other primate adenoviruses. Codivergence is not obvious here at the first look as host switches blur the picture (Hoppe et al. 2015; Purkayastha et al. 2005; Roy et al. 2009; Wevers et al. 2011 ), but it is still observable. The most ancient lineages are the prosimian and New World monkey adenoviruses (Podgorski et al. 2018 ). On the next branches we can find the Old World monkey adenoviruses including members of Human mastadenovirus (HAdV) A, F and G (Gilson et al. 2016; Pantó et al. 2015; Podgorski et al. 2016) (Fig. 1) . Evolutionarily speaking, strains of HAdV-B and -E are of gorilla or chimpanzee origin, respectively; and strains of HAdV-B jumped to the common ancestor of humans and chimpanzees two times most probably (Hoppe et al. 2015) . HAdV-C seemingly codiverged with gorillas, chimpanzees, bonobos and humans, whereas HAdV-D viruses infect only humans (Hoppe et al. 2015) . The long-term coevolution of HAdV-D and humans is supported by the high variety of types within the species (Ismail et al. 2018b; Kaján et al. 2018) , and their usually facultative pathogen nature.

Exactly in HAdV-D strains it is often observed that homologous recombination has a driving force in adenovirus evolution (Crawford-Miksza and Schnurr 1996; Gonzalez et al. 2015; Ismail et al. 2018a; Kaján et al. 2017; Robinson et al. 2013; Walsh et al. 2009 ). Predominantly, intraspecies recombination events are common, but intergenus recombinants have also been reported already: the head domain of the porcine adenovirus 5 (genus Mastadenovirus) fibre seems to be of atadenoviral origin (Nagy et al. 2002) , though a porcine atadenovirus has not been discovered yet. Recombination enables an accelerated, modular evolution of viruses, 'and has been associated with such features as the evasion of host immunity (Malim and Emerman 2001) , the development of antiviral resistance (Nora et al. 2007) , the ability to infect new hosts (Hon et al. 2008) , increases in virulence (Khatchikian et al. 1989 ) and even the creation of new viruses (Weaver 2006) ' (Holmes 2013) .

Herpesviruses (HVs) are large (150-200 nm) icosahedral, enveloped viruses having a so-called tegument layer between the capsid and the envelope. HVs possess a linear, nonsegmented, double-stranded DNA genome (135-295 kbp) (Pellett et al. 2011) . They are known to infect all classes of vertebrates, from fish to humans; moreover, HVs were discovered in some mollusc species as well (Davison et al. 2009 ). Chronologically, HVs of mammals and birds were known first causing different diseases in humans, livestock and poultry. Later, several decades ago, HVs of reptiles, fishes and amphibians were also reported (Fawcett 1956; Rebell et al. 1975; Wolf and Darlington 1971) . These novel viruses were tentatively classified into the family Herpesviridae because of their morphological features. The first nonvertebrate HV was discovered in a mollusc species in the 1970s (Farley et al. 1972) . As more sequence data became available, molecular analysis provided insight into the evolution of HVs, and these newly discovered viruses were also officially classified into the family Herpesviridae (Davison 1998; Davison et al. 2006 Davison et al. , 2005 Davison and Davison 1995; McGeoch and Gatherer 2005) . In 2009, the taxonomy of HVs changed radically, as the family Herpesviridae was split into three families. The novel family Herpesviridae contains only the HVs of higher vertebrates (Amniotes), while the family Alloherpesviridae contains the HVs of amphibians and fish (Anamnia), and the family Malacoherpesviridae contains the HVs of molluscs. The three families were clustered under the novel order Herpesvirales (Davison et al. 2009 ). These three groups of HVs are related only tenuously to each other. There are only a few genes showing homology in all known HVs, the most conserved gene is the putative ATPase subunit of terminase, its gene product being responsible for the packaging of the viral DNA into the capsid (Davison et al. 2009 ). Interestingly, a homologous gene was found in T4 bacteriophages (Myoviridae) implying tree shrew AdV-1 black lemur AdV-1 eastern lesser bamboo lemur AdV crowned lemur AdV black and white ruffed lemur AdV black lemur AdV-3 red-fronted lemur AdV-2 lemur AdV ring-tailed lemur AdV red-fronted lemur AdV-1 black lemur AdV-2 red-handed tamarin AdV-1 red-handed tamarin AdV-2 common marmoset AdV red-bellied tamarin AdV marmoset AdV golden-headed lion tamarin AdV cotton-top tamarin AdV red-faced spider monkey AdV common squirrel monkey AdV-1 tufted capuchin AdV-2 tufted capuchin AdV-3 tufted capuchin AdV-1 common squirell monkey AdV-2 common squirell monkey AdV-3 titi monkey AdV gray-bellied night monkey the common origin of HVs and tailed bacteriophages (Baker et al. 2005) . The phylogenetic relationship of HVs is well studied and their evolution was found to be largely synchronous with host lineages (McGeoch et al. 2000 (McGeoch et al. , 2006 . Exceptions have been noted among the mammalian (McGeoch et al. 2006) and fish HVs (Kelley et al. 2005) . The major sublineages within the subfamilies (Alpha-, Beta-, Gammaherpesvirinae) of Herpesviridae emerged probably before the mammalian radiation, 60 to 80 million years ago, while the diversification time point of the three subfamilies had been around 200 million years ago (McGeoch et al. 1995 (McGeoch et al. , 2000 . The most common ancestor of all known HVs (order Herpesvirales) existed around 400 million years ago based on similar phylogenetic branching patterns of HVs and host lineages (McGeoch et al. 2006) .

As for mammalian HVs, several studies were conducted on their evolutionary route spanning shorter time periods. For example, Bovine herpesvirus 4 (BoHV-4) has been isolated from cattle worldwide and this species was thought to be the original host of the virus. However, BoHV-4 has been reported from wild buffalo and other ruminants as well (Rossiter et al. 1989; Todd and Storz 1983) . Later, serological studies implied that the original host of the virus might be the African buffalo (Syncerus caffer) (Dewals et al. 2005) . This hypothesis was confirmed by phylogenetic calculations, suggesting that BoHV-4 has been coevolving with the African buffalo for the last 1.5 million years, and the virus was passed to cattle on at least three independent occasions much more recently, sometimes via an intermediate species (Dewals et al. 2006) . In another study, the phylogenetic trees of primate cytomegaloviruses and their hosts' were compared, and primate cytomegalovirus genomes were also analysed. The obtained results demonstrated the coevolution of these viruses with their hosts (Russell et al. 2016) . Furthermore, the avian and reptilian HVs were clustered into the subfamily Alphaherpesvirinae, relating to the development of birds from reptilian progenitors (McGeoch and Gatherer 2005) .

As for the members of the family Alloherpesviridae, phylogenetic inferences strongly support the monophyly of fish and amphibian HVs within the order Herpesvirales (Waltzek et al. 2009 ). The comparison of the phylogenetic trees of viruses and hosts implied that closely related HVs in the family may have coevolved with their hosts, whereas codiversification was not supported at deeper nodes of the tree (Waltzek et al. 2009 ). In other words, the separation of the main alloherpesvirus lineages does not fully resemble that of the host taxa. One explanation can be that the ancestors of the different viruses diverged before the separation of the various fish lineages, and thus the different virus lineages evolved independently. The strong similarity among viruses of distantly related fish species could be explained by host switches (Doszpoly et al. 2011).

Integrated herpesviral genomes in host chromosomes were also discovered in the last years, giving insight into the virus-host coevolution and providing interesting data about the genome organisation and content of ancient virus species (Aswad and Katzourakis 2017; Inoue et al. 2017; Savin et al. 2010) . The discovery of a new lineage of alloherpesviruses associated with at least fifteen different fish species was reported. One of them seems to represent a full-length viral genome in salmon (Salmo salar) (Aswad and Katzourakis 2017 ). An interesting discovery of a HV genome integrated into the genome of an invertebrate chordate provides links to the ancient ancestors of mollusc and vertebrate HVs: the genome of Branchiostoma floridae (Florida lancelet or amphioxus) contains several genes showing homology to herpesviral genes, implying the existence of a HV associated with this invertebrate chordate. The terminase and polymerase gene sequences from the putative amphioxus HV show higher similarity to those of the mollusc HVs than to any vertebrate HVs (Savin et al. 2010) . The discovery of this virus gave data about HVs dating back to the separation of vertebrates and invertebrates.

Nucleo-cytoplasmic large DNA viruses (NCLDV) are a group of DNA viruses including the families Ascoviridae, Asfarviridae, Iridoviridae, Marseilleviridae, Mimiviridae, Pithoviridae, Phycodnaviridae and Poxviridae (Koonin and Yutin 2010, 2019) . A new virus order, the Megavirales was proposed [but not yet accepted by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV)] to collect the abovementioned virus families (Colson et al. 2013) . Their host range spans from unicellular eukaryotes via arthropods to vertebrates (even mammals). NCLDVs replicate within the cytoplasm of the infected cells, yet in some families (e.g. iridoviruses) a nuclear stage is also present. Hence, NCLDVs encode many genes required for their own successful replication, but still use the translational apparatus of the host. Although the genome size (between 100 and 2500 kb) and host range of NCLDVs vary greatly, they appeared to form a monophyletic group with a common ancestor, based on a subset of about 30 conserved genes (Filée et al. 2008) . For instance, iridoviral homologues of ATPase, the A1L/VLTF2 transcription factor, the major capsid protein and the DNA polymerase proteins show considerable sequence similarity with asfar-, asco-, mimi-, pycodna-and poxvirus counterparts (Boyer et al. 2009 ).

In 2003, the discovery of mimivirus, the first giant amoeba virus (La Scola et al. 2003) with its large virion (700 nm) in the size range of bacteria and archaea, altered a century-long vision about the sizes and genome structures in the virosphere. Its genome was also huge (1200 kb) (Raoult et al. 2004) , comparable to the smallest free-living prokaryote genomes (Koonin 2009 ), and contained several genes of distant origins (eukaryotic, bacterial or viral) acquired by lateral/horizontal gene transfer (Filée 2009) . This led to the concept of 'giant viruses are giant chimeras' (Moreira and Brochier-Armanet 2008) . The mimivirus was found to contain nearly all NCLDV core genes and clustered phylogenetically with phycodnaviruses based on these (Claverie et al. 2009 . This suggested that it was an oversized NCLDV. Nonetheless, the translation system component genes seemed to illustrate a divergent evolutionary past. On the corresponding phylogenetic trees, mimiviruses clustered on a distinct branch, separated from the three established domains of cellular life (bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes). This striking novel observation has triggered the 'fourth domain hypothesis', according to which giant viruses evolved from cellular ancestors, most likely of an extinct fourth domain, via the reductive evolution route (Colson et al. 2012 (Colson et al. , 2011 . However, the most recent evolutionary reconstruction favoured a less peculiar alternative hypothesis, the multiple origin of viral gigantism . This latter analysis, based on well-conserved genes, defined three major branches on the NCLDV tree, suggesting at least three independent emergences from smaller viruses. For the translation-related genes, phylogenetic analysis showed kinship between viral and different eukaryotic lineages, suggesting lateral gene transfers at different time points of the virus evolution. Further evolutionary reconstructions revealed a connection between NCLDVs and smaller eukaryotic viruses, e.g. adenoviruses, and ultimately, derived all these viruses from tailless bacteriophages (Koonin and Yutin 2019) . The reconstructed phylogeny was as follows. Branch #1 included most of the real giants (>500 kb): the extended family Mimiviridae and pandoraviruses. Branch #2 gathered the families Asco-, Irido-, Marseille-and Pithoviridae. This branch contained the widest variation of genome sizes (100 kb to 1500 kb). Branch #3 included only non-giants in two distinct clades: Asfarviridae (African swine fever virus and its protist-infecting relatives) and Poxviridae. According to the present knowledge, a major host switch took place two times along this branch. Once during the early history of poxviruses, which infect both arthropods and vertebrates, two animal phyla that radiated from the common ancestor more than 500 million years ago (Oliveira et al. 2017) . Thereafter an apparent coevolution with the hosts also took place within the two subfamilies resulting in what we see today: several genera and poxvirus 'types' infecting a wide range of arthropod and vertebrate species. The second host switch happened at a later evolutionary stage in the sensu lato asfarviruses. Within this group a few apparently related viruses infect protists and pigs too (Alonso et al. 2018; Andreani et al. 2017; Bajrai et al. 2016) .

Shifting the perspective to branch #2 families: we can see that using a concatenated set of 9 genes common to these, a close relationship has been confirmed, suggesting that ascoviruses emerged recently and share a common ancestor with invertebrate iridoviruses (Piégu et al. 2015) . However, the replication strategies and morphologies are markedly different in these two virus groups replicating in invertebrate hosts (Federici et al. 2009 ). The evolutionary steps leading to these significant alterations still remain obscure.

This phylogenetic reconstruction of the NCLDVs demonstrated a 'turbulent evolution', which was dominated by gene gain, while on other branches substantial gene loss was apparent. The branches that include giant (protist) viruses are the most prominent gene gainers, whereas NCLDVs infecting animal hosts have undergone considerable gene losses, a sort of 'genome contraction' during their evolution from ancestral protist viruses. It was hypothesised that in animals, the selective pressure for virus genome size is stronger than in protists, yet its mechanism needs to be analysed .

Polyomaviruses (PyVs) are non-enveloped icosahedral DNA tumour viruses with a double-stranded, cca. 5000-bp-long circular DNA genome. Approximately 80 accepted PyV species form the family Polyomaviridae; the species are clustered into four genera (Alpha-, Beta-, Gamma-and Deltapolyomavirus) according to the ICTV. The taxonomical classification of PyVs is based on the genetic distance of the large tumour antigen. Still, some PyVs cannot be categorised into any accepted genus, so these require additional genera in the future (Moens et al. 2017a) .

The organisation of the circular PyV genome is highly conserved: the 5-7 genes are located on both strands, and distributed into early and late regions. There is a non-coding control region as well. The early coding region contains regulatory proteins: the small and the large tumour antigen. The late coding region contains the genes of the structural proteins, like the major (VP1) and two minor capsid proteins. The approximately 500-bp-long non-coding control region contains regulatory elements and transcription promoters, the origin of DNA replication (Moens et al. 2017b) .

PyVs are known to infect mammals and birds, but using viral metagenomics, PyVs were identified and characterised also in fish and arthropods (Buck et al. 2016; Peretti et al. 2015) . Analysing the available divergent sequence data of PyVs, results indicate that PyVs have been progressively coevolving with their hosts for about half billion years. Still, the current taxonomic classification system does not reflect this coevolution. This might be explained using phylogenetic analyses of PyV genes: some modern PyV species arose after ancient recombination events involving distantly related PyV lineages (Buck et al. 2016 ). The mammalian PyVs are known to be highly host specific and coevolving with their hosts. PyVs are generally apathogenic in humans, causing symptoms mainly in immunosuppressed individuals. However, e.g. Merkel cell polyomavirus (species Human polyomavirus 5) is oncogenic like several other mammalian PyVs.

Intra-host molecular evolution is also a feature of some PyV infections in humans. Mutations in the early region can lead to the expression of a truncated form of the large tumour antigen protein. Rearrangements in the non-coding control region and point mutations in VP1 have been described in two important human PyVs: JCPyV and BKPyV (Helle et al. 2017 ). In the case of JCPyV, mutations of these loci lead to the development of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy. Non-coding control region rearrangements in BKPyV are proposed to play a direct role in the development of PyVassociated nephropathy. Therefore, intra-host viral evolution appears to be an essential component of the disease process (McIlroy et al. 2019).

As discussed already, a recent host switch or a broader host range is usually associated with elevated pathogenicity. This is true for PyVs too: closely related PyVs can be detected in healthy bats of the genus Rhinolophus (Carr et al. 2017) , whereas the goose haemorrhagic polyomavirus infects geese, Muscovy ducks and mulards, and the budgerigar fledgling disease virus (species Aves polyomavirus 1) infects birds of diverse families (Johne and Müller 2007) .

Circoviruses (family Circoviridae) are vertebrate-infecting, single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) viruses with one of the smallest (~2 kb) virus genomes (Parrish 2011) . The circular genome contains two genes (rep and cap) encoding the replication-associated (Rep) and the capsid (Cap) proteins, respectively ). The first recognised circoviruses, namely porcine circovirus 1 infecting swine and wild boar (Tischer et al. 1982 (Tischer et al. , 1974 and the beak and feather disease virus of parrot species (Pass and Perry 1984) have been known for a long time. Still, the diversity of circoviruses and circular replication-associated protein encoding ssDNA (CRESS DNA) viruses was not revealed until recently. The continuous improvement of molecular methods has facilitated the discovery of numerous novel circo-and CRESS DNA viruses over the past few years (Delwart and Li 2012; Rosario et al. 2017; Shulman and Davidson 2017; Zhao et al. 2019) .

Unfortunately, as most of this knowledge originates from metagenomic surveys of environmental samples, the exact host-virus linkage is often hard to decipher. In such cases, different comparative in silico approaches, like cophylogeny analysis of host and virus or a nucleotide composition analysis might help find a solution (Harrach 2000; Kapoor et al. 2010; Kemenesi et al. 2017; Shackelton et al. 2006) . The results of some phylogenetic tree reconstructions suggested the potential long-term adaptation of some circovirus groups to birds, mammals, reptiles and fish (Altan et al. 2019; Delwart and Li 2012; Dennis et al. 2018; Fehér et al. 2013) .

In relation to circoviruses and their hosts, the research of EVEs and their potential role in host cells has deepened recently. It was revealed that the complete or partial circovirus genome might be integrated into the host genome as an EVE. To date, primarily rep-but also cap-homologues have been detected in different animal genomes using bioinformatics approaches (Aiewsakun and Katzourakis 2015; Aswad and Katzourakis 2012; Belyi et al. 2010; Dennis et al. 2019 Dennis et al. , 2018 Fehér et al. 2013; Gibbs et al. 2006; Gilbert et al. 2014; Holmes 2011; Horie and Tomonaga 2011; Katzourakis and Gifford 2010; Krupovic and Forterre 2015; Liu et al. 2011) . There are various possible functions-e.g. antiviral protection-proposed for different circoviral EVEs depending on the location and type of integration, but the exact impact of these is poorly known (Aswad and Katzourakis 2012; Dennis et al. 2018; Honda and Tomonaga 2016; Horie and Tomonaga 2011; Katzourakis and Gifford 2010; Liu et al. 2011) . In the authors' opinion, the quick evolution of these viruses via recombination (Lefeuvre et al. 2009; Martin et al. 2011; Rosario et al. 2012 ) and the RNA viruslike high mutation rates (Duffy et al. 2008; Firth et al. 2009; Rosario et al. 2012) can facilitate genomic integration, adaptation to the host cell or host switches. This hypothesis is supported by studies of related viruses (Gibbs and Weiller 1999) .

By comparative analyses of the Rep-encoding gene superfamily, some authors propose the plant-infecting geminiviruses as the ancestors of both nanoviruses and circoviruses (Londoño et al. 2010; Mankertz et al. 1997; Meehan et al. 1997; Rosario et al. 2012) . In the opinion of Gibbs and Weiller (1999) , a plant-infecting nanovirus had switched to a herbivorous vertebrate first, and then recombined with a picorna-like virus (supposedly a calicivirus) via a retrotransposable element or a retrovirus. If we dig even deeper, the homologues of the ssDNA virus Rep were described in plasmids of eubacteria and algae, suggesting an evolutionary relationship (Gibbs et al. 2006; Liu et al. 2011; Oshima et al. 2001) . In some authors' opinion, the close phylogenetic relatedness of several circoviruses replicating in various host species may be the sign of cross-species transmissions (Delwart and Li 2012; Gibbs et al. 2006; Liu et al. 2011) . The common presence of the highly conserved Rep and the mechanism of the rolling circle replication (Faurez et al. 2009 ) are the most obvious evidences for the common ancestry of the ssDNA virus taxa and ssDNA molecules (Martin et al. 2011) . Members of the family Circoviridae and related viruses have been existing for 40 to 50 million years. Some authors hypothesise even 100 million years of coevolution with the vertebrates based on EVEs (Belyi et al. 2010; Delwart and Li 2012; Katzourakis and Gifford 2010) . By that period-from the middle Cretaceous to the late Eocene epoch-the main vertebrate groups had evolved already (Ravi and Venkatesh 2008) . Others estimate the age of bird and mammalian circoviruses to be a mere 500 years, questioning long-term coevolution with the hosts (Firth et al. 2009 ). The evolutionary route of these viruses is not clear yet, and further research is needed both for circoviruses and their hosts.

As seen from the example of this latest mentioned dispute concerning the appearance of circoviruses, there are a number of unsettled questions in connection with the coevolutionary processes observed in DNA viruses and their hosts. In the paragraphs above, we have listed these major processes. (1) Apparent speciation and coevolution of adenovirus lineages (genera) with the different vertebrate families. Here, host switches to new taxa were marked both with shift in the genome content (codon usage, A + T content) and more severe pathology in the non-coevolved hosts. (2) In connection with herpesviruses (HVs) a longer coevolutionary past was supposed, largely synchronous with the more divergent (vertebrate and invertebrate) host lineages. Integrated HV genomes in host chromosomes were demonstrated to provide new data about the genome content of ancient HVs and a new HVs lineage. Moreover, the discovery of a HV core gene homologue in tailed bacteriophages established the phylogenetic relatedness between two seemingly unrelated virus orders (Herpesvirales, Caudovirales) and broadened the perspective for the coevolutionary studies. (3) Concerning NCLDVs, we have discussed that many earlier unrelated virus families with large/giant capsid and genome sizes and even more divergent host range (from protists to vertebrates) can be phylogenetically linked based on a subset of core genes. This phylogenetic reconstruction demonstrated a 'turbulent evolution', which was dominated by gene gain and gene loss via horizontal gene transfer both from other viruses and from host genomes. (4) In connection with polyomaviruses (PyV) the recombination among PyV lineages generating novel virus species was also mentioned, and the importance of the intra-host molecular evolution was discussed in more detail. It was demonstrated that point mutations and rearrangements in non-coding control regions both can critically alter the pathogenic potential, immunogenicity and target organs of related PyVs of a single host species. (5) In the case of circoviruses (or more broadly CRESS DNA viruses), higher mutation rates and rolling circle type replication of their ssDNA, alongside with recombination events and integration into host genomes as well as presumed cross-species transmissions of distant hosts were simultaneously forming the coevolutionary processes.

The above list is extensive, yet not exhaustive. The presented examples cover a large portion of the animal DNA viruses, but many known and yet unknown families with potentially diverse coevolutionary strategies were not covered. One of these could be the recently discovered 'adomaviruses', which are apparently products of rampant gene exchange between adeno-, papilloma-and polyomaviruses and their ancient and more recent (fish) hosts (Welch et al. 2018) . As mentioned in the introduction, protein structure based homology searches can reveal such similarities between poorly sequence-conserved proteins and unravel the otherwise hidden evolutionary connections of viruses and their hosts.

Viruses have always been around. Their parasitic lifestyle had an enormous driving effect on the evolution of all organisms, and thus life would not be the same without them. Future research will hopefully shed light on the exact origin and coevolutionary history of all viruses. Davison (2006)

"The population genetics of drug resistance evolution in natural populations of viral, bacterial and eukaryotic pathogens","Drug resistance is a costly consequence of pathogen evolution and a major concern in public health. In this review, we show how population genetics can be used to study the evolution of drug resistance and also how drug resistance evolution is informative as an evolutionary model system. We highlight five examples from diverse organisms with particular focus on: (i) identifying drug resistance loci in the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum using the genomic signatures of selective sweeps, (ii) determining the role of epistasis in drug resistance evolution in influenza, (iii) quantifying the role of standing genetic variation in the evolution of drug resistance in HIV, (iv) using drug resistance mutations to study clonal interference dynamics in tuberculosis and (v) analysing the population structure of the core and accessory genome of Staphylococcus aureus to understand the spread of methicillin resistance. Throughout this review, we discuss the uses of sequence data and population genetic theory in studying the evolution of drug resistance.","Pathogen evolution is a major public health concern with enormous societal consequences around the world. Pathogens evolve quickly, allowing them to jump from multiple host species to humans (e.g. SARS coronavirus or Ebola virus; Woolhouse et al. 2005) , to become more virulent and evade immune pressure within humans (e.g. influenza virus; Grenfell et al. 2004) and to become resistant to drugs used to combat them (WHO 2014d).

To prevent or at least manage drug resistance in pathogens, it is imperative to understand the evolutionary aspects of the problem. However, evolutionary biologists have traditionally left most of the study of drug resistance to the medicine and epidemiology communities (Read & Huijben 2009 ). This has changed in recent years with interesting population genetic work being done on natural populations of pathogens, some of which is featured in this review. This change is, at least in part, driven by the availability of genetic data for a variety of pathogens. A new cross-disciplinary field is emerging that uses large amounts of genetic data and new theoretical advances from the world of population genetics. Some of this work is directly aimed at finding ways to prevent drug resistance evolution or spread, whereas other work is more basic in nature and mostly uses the pathogen as a model system to learn about evolution in general. In the best cases, we learn lessons on how to prevent resistance and on general evolutionary principles simultaneously.

The aim of this review was to introduce researchers from different fields to new and exciting work on drug resistance evolution happening at the intersection of population genetics and medical fields such as virology and infectious disease. Perhaps more importantly this review is intended as an advertisement of the strengths of using natural pathogen populations to study evolutionary principles as well as the strengths of using evolutionary theory to better understand the dynamics of infectious diseases. To this end, we present five case studies at the intersection of evolutionary theory and pathogen drug resistance. While the five examples we have chosen are not meant to be exhaustive in any way, each example showcases an evolutionary question in the context of a different pathogen, each with a unique biology and differences in genome size, methods of genetic exchange, reproduction and recombination (see Box 1).

We will describe the following five examples:

Selective sweep mapping in the malaria parasite P. falciparum resistant to the antimalarial drug artemisinin. This is a great example of how population genetic methods originally developed for other sexually recombining eukaryotic organisms, such as humans, could be applied to P. falciparum, which experiences a very high rate of sexual recombination. The mapping of the drug resistance mutations in P. falciparum has allowed researchers to track the prevalence of artemisinin resistance worldwide.

The role of epistasis in oseltamivir (Tamiflu) resistance in influenza. The evolution and spread of oseltamivir resistance in influenza in [2007] [2008] was unexpected. Even though the causal mutation for oseltamivir resistance was known, it was thought to be too costly to viral fitness to spread widely. Phylogenetic methods allowed researchers to discover mutations that interacted with the resistance mutation to ameliorate its detrimental effects, allowing the resistance mutation to spread. Influenza has become a model that helps researchers understand the importance of genetic interactions between sites during the course of evolution and the potential for predicting future evolution.

The importance of standing genetic variation (SGV) (also referred to as minority variants) to treatment failure for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) . Drug resistance mutations are well known in HIV and the evolution of drug resistance happens independently in different patients. This makes it possible to determine the importance of SGV for drug resistance in HIV. Several studies found that both SGV and de novo mutations contribute to drug resistance in HIV.

Clonal interference dynamics in Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Drug resistance mutations are also well known in M. tuberculosis. Through tracking these mutations, recent studies have revealed that clonal interference plays a large role in the evolutionary dynamics within patients. An examination of these dynamics offers insights into how multiply-resistant strains emerge and also provides a rare look into a natural population evolving without recombination.

Population structure analysis of the core and accessory genome of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Staphylococcus aureus reproduces clonally, yet drug resistance is often acquired via the spread of mobile genetic elements (or horizontal gene transfer), such as the gene cassette SCCmec that confers methicillin resistance. While the genealogy of the core genome of MRSA reveals that relatively few lineages have spread across the globe, phylogenetic analysis of SCCmec reveals that methicillin resistance arises on a more local scale.

These five examples will be used to illustrate that the growing availability of sequence data facilitates the application of population genetic methods to important questions in the evolution of drug resistance.

Malaria results in over 500 000 deaths every year (WHO 2014c) and is mainly caused by P. falciparum. Over the past 60 years, several antimalarial drugs have been deployed, but resistance to these drugs has developed repeatedly. The current front-line treatment, artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs), was introduced in the 1990s at a time when all other drugs were failing. While ACTs were initially very effective, by 2003, the first signs of resistance to artemisinin emerged in South-East Asia, and now resistance is widespread (Noedl et al. 2008; Dondorp et al. 2009 Dondorp et al. , 2010 Kyaw et al. 2013; Ashley et al. 2014 ).

To better track the global spread of resistance to antimalarial drugs and understand the mechanism by which resistance develops, it is essential to know the locations in the P. falciparum genome conferring resistance. Here, we review the population genetic methods used to identify the kelch gene on chromosome 13 conferring resistance to artemisinin-a locus that until recently had gone relatively unnoticed and whose biological function is still unknown-and the experimental methods used to confirm the causal mutations. We highlight P. falciparum in this review because it is a pathogen that experiences strong selective pressures and, unlike most human pathogens, it is a eukaryotic organism that experiences high rates of recombination (see Box 2). As we show, these properties of P. falciparum make it relatively straightforward to apply standard population genetics methods to malaria in order to detect selected sites with great success, even though these methods were often designed for other eukaryotic model organisms.

Common methods to detect selective sweeps in recombining eukaryotes, including Plasmodium falciparum

In a selective sweep, an adaptive mutation rises in frequency in the population, dragging with it the linked genetic material on the same haplotype background to high frequency via hitchhiking (Maynard Smith & Haigh 1974; Kaplan et al. 1989; Kim & Stephan 2002) . This can result in a pattern of low genetic variation, high linkage disequilibrium (LD) and high haplotype homozygosity in the vicinity of the adaptive mutation. Plasmodium falciparum experiences a high rate of recombination [58 cM/Mb (Su et al. 1999; Jiang et al. 2011) There are several statistics that utilize LD and haplotype homozygosity information to identify selective sweeps, including extended haplotype homozygosity (EHH), cross population extended haplotype homozygosity (XP-EHH), as well as iHS, nSL and H12 (Sabeti et al. 2002 (Sabeti et al. , 2007 Voight et al. 2006; Ferrer-Admetlla et al. 2014; Garud et al. 2015) . EHH and XP-EHH have been particularly popular and successful in the detection of sites under selection in P. falciparum. EHH measures the decay in tracts of homozygosity radiating away from a SNP at a partial frequency in a single population (Sabeti et al. 2002) . However, EHH is not powerful in detecting a selective sweep that has gone to fixation (Sabeti et al. 2002) . In contrast, XP-EHH utilizes information from two populations, one where a sweep has presumably occurred, and another where a sweep has not (Sabeti et al. 2007) . XP-EHH is thus powerful in detecting partial and complete sweeps that have occurred in one of the two populations considered. In addition to LDbased statistics, there are several site frequency spectrum (SFS) statistics which treat individual polymorphic sites in a sample independently from one another. Statistics such as Tajima's D (Tajima 1989) , Fay and Wu's H (Fay & Wu 2000; Fay et al. 2002) , and Sweepfinder (Nielsen et al. 2005 ) are sensitive to dips in neutral diversity and excesses in low and high frequency polymorphisms in the SFS (Braverman et al. 1995; Vitti et al. 2013) . Another widely used SFS statistic is F ST (Lewontin & Krakauer 1973) , which compares genomic patterns between two populations. More specifically, F ST measures the difference in average pairwise diversity measured in randomly sampled individuals across two different populations vs. within a single population, and can thus be an indicator of positive selection if one population diverges extremely in diversity from another. As we explain in this review, F ST has been successfully used in conjunction with EHH and XP-EHH to detect selected sites in P. falciparum across multiple populations.

Association tests are a LD-based approach often used to identify drug resistance loci in multiple study systems. Association tests correlate a phenotype with the allelic states of polymorphisms in a sample from a single population (Anderson et al. 2011 ). In the case of P. falciparum, artemisinin resistance is characterized by slow parasite clearance rates, measured as the rate of decay in parasite density in the blood over time (Noedl et al. 2008; Dondorp et al. 2009 ). Therefore, this phenotype is used in studies to identify the underlying mutations conferring resistance to artemisinin. Association studies can result in many false positives because of a number of confounding factors such as population substructure and relatedness between individuals in a sample. Furthermore, association studies can be computationally slow in large sample sizes with large numbers of polymorphic sites. Efficient mixed models association (EMMA) is an association technique that aims to address these factors (Kang et al. 2008 ).

Using a variety of methods, several loci that confer resistance to older antimalarial drugs such as mefloquine, chloroquine, sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine and atovaquone (e.g. genes encoding the chloroquine resistance transporter, multidrug resistance protein, GTPcyclohydrolase I, dihydropteroate synthetase, dihydrofolate reductase and cytochrome B) have been identified (Wootton et al. 2002; Nair et al. 2003; Ferdig et al. 2004; Sidhu et al. 2005; Musset et al. 2007; Vinayak et al. 2010; Anderson et al. 2011; Mita et al. 2011) . Close examination of the genomic signatures immediately surrounding these loci reveals patterns of reduced diversity, elevated linkage disequilibrium (LD), and the presence of long haplotypes at high frequency (Wootton et al. 2002; Nair et al. 2003; Roper et al. 2004; Vinayak et al. 2010) , all of which are associated with signatures of selective sweeps (Maynard Smith & Haigh 1974; Kaplan et al. 1989; Kim & Stephan 2002) . The distinct genomic signatures resulting from drug resistance in P. falciparum suggest that novel loci conferring resistance to artemisinin can be discovered by searching for patterns of elevated LD and haplotype homozygosity. In Box 2, we discuss some of the popular population genomic methods used to identify selective sweeps and resistant loci in P. falciparum, including LD statistics such as XP-EHH (Sabeti et al. 2007) , SFS statistics used to corroborate findings made with LD statistics, such as F ST (Lewontin & Krakauer 1973) and genomewide association studies.

Three recent studies by Cheeseman et al. (2012) , Takala-Harrison et al. (2013) , and Miotto et al. (2013) examined patterns of LD and haplotype homozygosity in the P. falciparum genome and identified a region on chromosome 13 associated with artemisinin resistance. This locus was later characterized as the kelch13 locus (Ariey et al. 2014) . These three studies benefited greatly from deep samples of P. falciparum from multiple populations, some of which displayed the artemisinin drug resistance phenotype of slow parasite clearance rate while others did not (Noedl et al. 2008; Dondorp et al. 2009 ). This data allowed the authors to contrast genomic patterns in strains from geographical locations displaying the slow parasite clearance rate phenotype vs. those that did not.

In the first major study, Cheeseman et al. (2012) examined genomic data from samples from three populations: Laos, Thailand and Cambodia, where resistance is observed only in Thailand and Cambodia (Cheeseman et al. 2012) . This data set offered the opportunity to contrast the Thai and Cambodia samples with Laos to discover putative loci conferring resistance to artemisinin. Cheeseman et al. (2012) utilized a two-step approach to identify genomic regions underlying resistance to artemisinin. First, the authors used the XP-EHH (Sabeti et al. 2007 ) and F ST (Lewontin & Krakauer 1973) statistics and identified 33 regions as significant candidates under selection in at least one population. These statistics were particularly appropriate for their multipopulation data set because they are designed to contrast genomic signatures in two populations (Box 2). Cheeseman et al. (2012) found that (Kang et al. 2008) to test the association of each SNP in their data set and the parasite clearance phenotype, thereby identifying four SNPs significantly associated, including two on chromosome 13. In conjunction with the association test, Takala-Harrison et al. (2013) applied XP-EHH (Sabeti et al. 2007 ) and F ST (Lewontin & Krakauer 1973) to the Cambodia population, using the Thai and Bangladeshi populations as comparison populations. The authors found that only the polymorphisms on chromosome 13 previously identified with the EMMA test also had significant XP-EHH and F ST values. Takala-Harrison et al. (2013) used HAPLOVIEW (Barrett et al. 2005) to visualize the extended haplotype homozygosity in the region. Miotto et al. (2013) examined 10 locations in West Africa and South-East Asia and found that there was an exceptionally high amount of population substructure within Cambodia. Upon closer examination, the authors found that three of four clusters of P. falciparum found in western Cambodia showed slow parasite clearance rates, slow decay in LD, and loss of haplotype diversity, while the fourth cluster prevalent in northeastern Cambodia did not show any of these characteristics. This leads the authors to conclude that western Cambodia harbours at least three distinct populations of artemisinin-resistant P. falciparum. In particular, one of the subpopulations with resistant strains of P. falciparum showed a single haplotype extending across half of chromosome 13, corroborating the evidence from Cheeseman et al. (2012) and Takala-Harrison et al. (2013) that this locus is implicated in resistance to artemisinin.

While Cheeseman et al. (2012) , Takala-Harrison et al. (2013) and Miotto et al. (2013) were all able to localize a putative locus on chromosome 13 strongly associated with the slow parasite clearance phenotype, it was only recently that Ariey et al. (2014) were able to identify causative mutations with high confidence. Ariey et al. (2014) used an in vitro drug selection technique to subject a parasite line to high doses of artemisinin for 5 years. Comparing the sequenced data from the selected line with that of a clonal population not experiencing any selection, the authors identified eight mutations in seven genes that were present in the artemisinin treatment group but absent from the control group. Ariey et al.

(2014) narrowed their list of candidates and concluded that only the mutation appearing in the kelch gene on chromosome 13 appeared at the same time as when artemisinin resistance developed in their treatment group. To determine whether there was concordance between the presence of this mutation in the kelch gene and artemisinin-resistant parasites from Cambodia, Ariey et al. (2014) sequenced the locus at which these mutations were present in parasite samples from patients showing the drug-resistant phenotype and from patients who did not in different geographical locations in Cambodia. They found that mutations in the kelch gene were strongly associated with the slow clearance phenotype observed in the locations where malaria is prevalent. In this extended analysis, Ariey et al. (2014) identified 17 mutations in the kelch gene, and all were significantly associated with artemisinin resistance.

Several follow-up studies confirmed the findings of Ariey et al. (2014) . Ashley et al. (2014) examined the geographical extent of resistance by tracking the prevalence of mutations in the kelch gene (see Fig. 1 ). The authors found several single point mutations in kelch significantly associated with slow parasite clearance rates. Recent work (Cheeseman et al. 2015; Miotto et al. 2015; Takala-Harrison et al. 2015; Tun et al. 2015) has also precisely mapped the origins and extent of mutations associated with artemisinin resistance (see Fig.  1 ). Ghorbal et al. (2014) used the CRISPR-Cas9 system to introduce a mutation (C580Y) implicated in artemisinin resistance (Ariey et al. 2014) into kelch, which produced the slow parasite clearance phenotype and demonstrated the first direct link between a mutant kelch and the characteristic phenotype. This work was expanded upon by Straimer et al. (2015) to confirm the role of multiple mutations and additional genetic factors in conferring artemisinin resistance.

Of the five examples reviewed in this study, this example of using classic statistical methods to find the association between the kelch gene and artimisinin resistance in P. falciparum is perhaps the most familiar to population geneticists. As a eukaryotic pathogen with a high rate of recombination, sequence analysis of the P. falciparum genome was amenable to traditional genome scan approaches. Clever stratification of the samples gave additional power to the genomic scans, and in combination with novel experimental methods, researchers were able to find a locus under recent strong selection that was responsible for the evolution of resistance to artimisinin. The identification of the kelch gene by population genetics methods offers a clear example where standard methodologies to identify selective sweeps are powerful in identifying a causal locus. Given that P. falciparum can be manipulated experimentally to confirm computational predictions, this organism is an attractive choice for future studies of drug resistance, especially since malaria continues to be a costly disease and new drug-resistant loci may be unknown.

Annual influenza epidemics are estimated to result in 3-5 million cases of severe illness and 250 000-500 000 deaths worldwide (WHO 2014b). Subtypes of the influenza type A virus are named according to the two surface proteins that allow influenza virus to bind and release from host cells, hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). For example, H1N1 designates the particular subtype of influenza that was responsible for the 2009 swine flu epidemic. These two surface proteins, hemagglutinin and neuraminidase, are primary antigenic targets for the immune system and are also potential targets for pharmaceutical intervention. One common influenza drug is oseltamivir, which is marketed under the trade name Tamiflu. Oseltamivir works by inhibiting the influenza neuraminidase surface protein, the protein that cleaves sialic acid from the receptor of the host cell and allows replicated virus to spread to other uninfected cells (Moscona 2005) . Resistance to oseltamivir in N1containing influenza is conferred by a single histidine-to-tyrosine amino acid change at the 275th amino acid position in the neuraminidase protein. Note that this amino acid is often referred to as amino acid 274, which is its position in N2, a convention which we will follow here. The H274Y mutation was known from laboratory studies, but researchers predicted that fitness costs would prevent H274Y from spreading widely. However, oseltamivir resistance due to the H274Y mutation has been documented extensively following the 2007-2008 flu season when global surveillance indicated the increasing prevalence of H1N1 influenza viruses with acquired resistance (Moscona 2009) . A combination of phylogenetics and elegant laboratory studies led to the discovery of two permissive mutations that mitigated the cost of the H274Y mutation, thus showing the importance of epistasis for influenza evolution. The study of the evolution of oseltamivir resistance has relied heavily on phylogenetic methods and taught us about the importance of epistasis, which, in turn, is of crucial importance for making predictions on influenza evolution.

The interactions among sites in the genome can give rise to a phenomenon called epistasis where the effects of one mutation at a site are dependent on the presence or absence of mutations at other sites. Epistatic interactions, when they exist, ensure that the fitness effects of a drug resistance mutation are dependent on the genetic background on which it emerges. Epistasis in drug resistance evolution has been characterized by several in vitro studies, including the case of the five interacting mutations involved in cefotaxime resistance in Escherichia coli that produce predictable mutation orders (Weinreich et al. 2006 ) and the hundreds of interacting mutations that determine viral fitness in antiretroviral resistance in HIV (Hinkley et al. 2011 ).

In the case of oseltamivir resistance, the H274Y mutation was shown to have detrimental effects on viral fitness after it was first identified in the laboratory (Ives et al. 2002; Abed et al. 2004; Herlocher et al. 2004 ). This led researchers to believe that viruses carrying H274Y were 'unlikely to be of clinical consequence' (Ives et al. 2002) . Why then did the resistant H1N1 strains subsequently reach a global frequency of nearly 95% (WHO 2009) during the 2008-2009 flu season? Bloom and others showed that the H274Y mutation reduces the amount of folded neuramindase that reaches the host cell surface and thereby reduces the virus' fitness. They hypothesized that secondary mutations at other sites in the influenza genome may have acted to ameliorate deleterious effects of the H274Y mutation, permitting it to reach high global frequency (Bloom et al. 2010 ).

Bloom and colleagues took sequences from before and after 2007 and created a phylogenetic tree. They found five nonsynonymous mutations that separated the 2008 strains in which H274Y was common from the 1999 strains in which H274Y was found to have a strongly negative fitness effect. They then added the mutations one by one to the 1999 strain and found that two of the five mutations (R222Q, V234M) had a strong effect on the amount of neuraminidase at the cell surface. In viruses that had these two mutations, H274Y no longer reduced the fitness of the virus. In the absence of oseltamivir, the created triple-mutant virus (with H274Y, R222Q, V234M mutations) had a fitness comparable to wild type. In the presence of oseltamivir, the triple-mutant virus had much higher fitness than wild type (Bloom et al. 2010) . A phylogeny with the status of these three mutations (H274Y, R222Q and V234M) is shown in Fig. 2 .

Subsequent studies also identified potential epistatic interactions between mutations in hemagglutinin and neuraminidase that impacted viral fitness and may have influenced the spread of oseltamivir resistance (Hensley et al. 2011; Ginting et al. 2012; Behera et al. 2015) . Taken together these results suggest that epistasis had a profound impact on the evolution of resistance to oseltamivir and allowed the H274Y resistance mutation to spread through the global population. This work also provides cautionary evidence for the clinical assessment of drug resistance mutations. Secondary mutations that interact epistatically with drug resistance mutations are important factors that need to be incorporated when making predictions about the epidemiological consequences of drug resistance mutations. Knowing that even deleterious drug resistance mutations can spread when they emerge on permissive backgrounds tells us that we should pay close attention to identifying and monitoring potential epistatic interactions during virological surveillance.

To what extent is epistasis a general feature of adaptive evolution? Both theoretical and empirical work predict that adaptation itself may enrich for epistatic interactions (Draghi et al. 2011; Draghi & Plotkin 2013; Gong et al. 2013; Rajon & Masel 2013; Szendro et al. 2013; Gong & Bloom 2014) . This means that epistasis is likely to play a more general role in adaptive evolution and is not limited to specific case studies. It also means that researchers interested in adaptation need model systems in which to test theory regarding epistasis. Influenza resistance evolution has been a formative model for testing population genetic predictions regarding the role of epistasis in adaptive evolution.

Oseltamivir resistance evolution provided some of the first evaluations for methodologies that can potentially predict the sites within proteins that interact with one another based on sequence data and phylogenetic trees. Bloom and colleagues initially predicted the R194G mutation as a potential candidate for a positive epistatic interaction with H274Y using a phylogenetic method (Bloom & Glassman 2009 ) to infer stabilizing effects of mutations. They showed that R194G did indeed restore H274Y-mutant surface expression to wild type levels in the absence of oseltamivir (Bloom et al. 2010) . Meanwhile Kryazhimskiy et al.

(2011) examined hemagglutinin and neuraminidase sequences of multiple influenza strains and successfully predicted a known epistatic interaction (Collins et al. 2009 ) between H274Y and another mutation (D344N, see Fig. 3 ) in addition to the V234M and R222Q mutations identified by Bloom et al. (2010) . Their methodology was based on a statistical ranking of the co-occurrence of specific amino acid substitutions within a phylogeny.

Predicting the evolution of influenza is an intriguing prospect for evolutionary geneticists, which we will briefly discuss in the Discussion. These studies have shown that phylogenetic methods can not only affirm theoretical predictions regarding the patterns of epistasis but can also predict epistatic interactions that may be of clinical importance. They also establish a connection between protein phylogenies and fitness that may prove to be useful for future work in both population genetics and infectious disease.

HIV drug resistance has been a challenge since the introduction of HIV treatment because HIV adapts rapidly due to its high mutation rate, fast generation time and large population size (Coffin 1995) . Although drug resistance in HIV has become less prevalent as treatments have improved (Lee et al. 2014; Feder et al. 2015) , a fundamental question both for both clinicians and population geneticists remains: when exactly do drug-resistant mutations (DRMs) originate? Some patients may have pre-existing drug resistance mutations prior to receiving any drug therapy. Although these pre-existing mutations, also known as SGV, may offer no selective advantage (and could in fact be deleterious) before the onset of treatment when therapy begins, they quickly rise to high frequency in the HIV population and cause treatment failure (Pennings 2012) . However, HIV can also acquire drug resistance mutations de novo after the onset of therapy.

Clinically, the extent to which drug resistance mutations arise from SGV or de novo mutation should inform treatment approaches. If SGV is critically important in the establishment of drug resistance, efforts should be focused on identifying any potential drug resistance mutations in the pretreatment HIV population to determine an appropriate regimen. However, if resistance occurs de novo after the start of treatment, patient adherence, drug penetrance and dosage should be the clinical focus. To this end, it is important to understand whether drug resistance mutations present before treatment onset can be identified in patient samples, and to assess the ultimate contribution of SGV to treatment failure.

From a population genetics perspective, drug resistance evolution in HIV allows us to understand the role of SGV in adaptation more generally. First, every infected person is an independent evolutionary replicate, and transmitted drug resistance is relatively rare. Around 2.8-11.5% of untreated patients have transmitted drug resistance mutations depending on the region of the world , although these numbers are lower when considering drug resistance to any specific treatment. Therefore, most drug resistance emerges independently within a patient, and it is sufficient to follow a single patient over time to chart the evolution of an HIV population, in contrast to monitoring the acquisition of drug resistance mutations across multiple patients in a transmission chain. Second, the mutations conferring drug resistance are well catalogued (Bennett et al. 2009; Wensing et al. 2014 ), allowing us to quantify their frequency prior to treatment using allele-specific PCR (asPCR). Finally, adaptation can be rapid, allowing us to observe the evolution of drug resistance as it happens.

Before an HIV-infected person starts treatment, a blood sample is taken to sequence the virus (see Schutten 2006 for an overview of genotyping assays). Sanger sequencing of HIV before the start of treatment is standard in clinical practice, but next-generation sequencing is not (Simen et al. 2009; Codoñer et al. 2011) . A sequence of the protease, reverse transcriptase, and integrase genes are used to determine whether any drug resistance mutations are present at high frequencies, and if so, these results help the clinician and patient choose a combination of drugs with which to start treatment (Hirsch et al. 2008 ). If the majority of the viral population in a patient carries a resistance mutation, then this information will be used to choose a drug regimen that will work for the specific virus. However, drug resistance mutations at low population frequencies (at 20% or less) are not detected by standard sequencing protocols (Simen et al. 2009 ). An important question therefore is whether this low-frequency SGV is present in most patients, and if so, whether it allows the viral population to adapt and evolve drug resistance.

An important study by Paredes et al. (2010) used asPCR to determine whether drug resistance mutations were already present as minority variants in the viral population of 183 patients. These patients originally took part in a clinical trial, so blood samples from before the start of treatment and at treatment failure (if applicable) were stored for them. Treatment failure is defined as having virus detectable in the blood at levels higher than should be expected given that the patient is on treatment. The authors focused on two important resistance mutations in the reverse transcriptase gene, K103N and Y181C, because the patients were treated with a combination of reverse transcriptase inhibitors. In 73 of the 183 patients, they found that either K103N or Y181C was already present as a minority variant (mostly around 1% frequency), but they could not detect the mutation in the other 110 patients. Of the patients with the minority variant, treatment failed in 26 but was successful in 47. Out of the patients without the minority variants, treatment failed in only 16 but was successful in 94. Altogether, treatment failed in 23% of the 183 patients. When only considering the patients without detectable SGV, treatment failed in 15% of the patients. This means that in 8% of the patients, failure can be attributed to the presence of a minority variant (see Fig. 4 ).

The estimate from Paredes et al. (2010) that 8% of treatment failures come from SGV may be an underestimate because the authors only looked at the presence of two drug resistance mutations, and they may not have detected the variants in all cases. However, the two mutations are the most important for the treatment they looked at, and the result is fairly similar to a different estimate which we will describe below.

A less direct method to study the role of SGV for the evolution of HIV drug resistance was developed by one of us (Pennings 2012) . We re-analysed data from a previous study (Margot et al. 2006 ) and looked for excess adaptation early during treatment. We found that in the study of interest, resistance evolution happened at a constant rate in the second and third year of treatment. In both of those years, the virus acquired resistance in 3.5% of the patients who previously had a virus without drug resistance. Such a constant rate of evolution of drug resistance was also observed in several other trials (e.g. UK Collaborative Group on HIV Drug Resistance and UK CHIC Study Group and Others 2010). In years 2 and 3 of treatment, SGV that was present before treatment probably plays no role, so the 3.5% likely reflects evolution of resistance from de novo mutations. In the first year of treatment, it is expected that both new mutations and SGV contribute to the evolution of resistance, so if resistance evolved in more than 3.5% of the patients' viral populations, this suggests that SGV played a role.

In Margot et al. (2006) , there were 600 patients in total in the first year of treatment. The expected number of people with resistance after 1 year was 21 (this is 3.5%, the rate that is seen in year 2 and year 3). In reality, there were 57 people with resistance, so 36 more than expected. Thirty-six of 600 is 6% (see Fig. 4 ), so it was estimated that SGV leads to resistance in 6% of the patients.

One may note that the total number of failing patients is much higher in Paredes et al. (2010) . This may be because they have a stricter criterion for treatment success [<200 copies for Paredes et al. (2010) vs. <400 copies for Margot et al. (2006) ]. Also, the patients were on similar but not the same treatments (3TC/AZT/EFV or ABC/3TC/AZT/EFV in the Paredes study and 3TC/ TDF/EFV or 3TC/d4T/EFV in the Margot study).

In the light of different overall rates of evolution in the two studies, it is perhaps surprising to see that the estimated rate of evolution from SGV is similar (8% and 6%). When Pennings used a third data set to estimate the rate of evolution of resistance due to SGV-based on a trial of long treatment interruptions with 435 patients (Danel et al. 2009 )-her estimate was again 6%, which suggests that these estimates are fairly robust (Pennings 2012) .

Adaptation from SGV has been discussed extensively in the literature; however, there are relatively few studies that have attempted to quantify its relative importance as a mode of adaptation. Altogether, the results from studying HIV suggest that SGV plays an important and quantitatively predictable role in treatment failures for this particular disease. SGV may also play a large role in treatment outcomes for other diseases, both those caused by pathogens and others such as cancer (Bozic et al. 2013 ). Next-generation sequencing can be used to determine whether drug-resistant SGV exists in patients prior to treatment, thus informing clinical decisions for individual patients. Apart from its clinical relevance, the particular example of HIV drug resistance evolution is also well-suited for validating evolutionary theory regarding adaptation from SGV (Orr & Betancourt 2001; Hermisson & Pennings 2005; Barrett & Schluter 2008) .

Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative agent of tuberculosis (TB), is a nonrecombining bacterium that is believed to reproduce entirely clonally (although see Namouchi et al. 2012) . Mycobacterium tuberculosis latently infects approximately one-third of the world's population, and tuberculosis caused ~1.5 million deaths in 2014. The vast majority of these deaths occurred in low-or middle-wealth countries (WHO 2014a). Although tuberculosis is often effectively treated with combination therapies of antibiotics, drug resistance is common to nearly all known drugs. Multiply drug-resistant and extensively drug-resistant strains can be particularly difficult to treat, requiring longer courses of more expensive medications. Therefore, much work has been done in categorizing the genomic locations and probable mechanisms of these drug resistance mutations.

Many mutations have been identified that confer a large degree of drug resistance within patients. These drug resistance mutations have been found by collecting M. tuberculosis samples, assaying their growth in media containing different antibiotics and identifying associations between mutations and resistance profiles. A comprehensive list of drug resistance mutations can be found in the Tuberculosis Drug Resistance Database (Sandgren et al. 2009 ) where 1178 drug resistance mutations of various effect sizes to nine drugs are recorded within more than 30 different genes.

Despite the apparent adaptability of M. tuberculosis, diversity in intrapatient populations has historically been considered to be very low (Sreevatsan et al. 1997; Musser et al. 2000) . It is only recently that studies have found that considerable diversity exists within M. tuberculosis populations (Al-Hajoj et al. 2010; Navarro et al. 2011; Sun et al. 2012; Eldholm et al. 2014) . By combining new sequencing data with the knowledge of well-documented drug resistance mutations in M. tuberculosis, we can test our theoretical understanding of how clonal evolution proceeds and arrive at a more complete picture of how M. tuberculosis drug resistance emerges within a patient.

Recombination is thought to be evolutionarily adaptive because it allows different adaptive mutations that reside on different genetic backgrounds in a population to appear together (Fisher 1930; Muller 1932; Felsenstein 1974 ). In addition, it can unlink positively selected traits from deleterious passenger mutations and mitigate the effects of linked selection (Hill & Robertson 1966; Birky & Walsh 1988; Good & Desai 2014) . In populations with no recombination, each mutation remains on the genetic background on which it originally occurred. Therefore, if multiple positively selective traits enter the population simultaneously on different backgrounds, these traits cannot be recombined to augment each other. Instead, they must compete against each other as they both rise in frequency in the population (Muller 1932) . This process is known as clonal interference (Gerrish & Lenski 1998 ).

While clonal interference has been extensively modelled (Rouzine et al. 2003; Desai & Fisher 2007; Park & Krug 2007; Martens & Hallatschek 2011; Neher 2013) and investigated in laboratory experiments (Miralles et al. 1999; Pepin & Wichman 2008; Kvitek & Sherlock 2013; Lang et al. 2013) , few systems exist that allow us to test these predictions in natural populations. Globally, influenza seems to evolve clonally across years (Strelkowa & Lässig 2012) , but intrahost populations of nonrecombining bacteria allow for many semiindependent evolutionary trajectories to be compared over much shorter time scales. Although there is evidence that HIV experiences clonal interference within patients, recombination complicates its study (Pandit & de Boer 2014) . There is also a strong interest in clonal evolution in cancer, but sampling at different time points is often much harder for cancer than for M. tuberculosis or HIV, which makes cancer as a study system more difficult Walter et al. 2012 ).

Intrahost evolution of M. tuberculosis provides a fairly straightforward way to examine clonal interference in vivo and to understand the extent to which it can slow the evolutionary process. Because there is no recombination, allele frequencies from pooled resequencing can, in some cases, be reconstructed into haplotypes (see below). Its large genome size (~4.5 Mb), well-documented drug resistance mutations, and long time course of infection mean that patterns of diversity can be tracked over time. Although previous studies have shown the presence of competing clonal lineages in M. tuberculosis populations in a patient using neutral markers (Al-Hajoj et al. 2010; Navarro et al. 2011 ), we can further use our understanding of drug resistance mutations to better understand the evolutionary dynamics of within-host populations. Among patients who are infected with drug-sensitive strains of M. tuberculosis, drug resistance can evolve within a patient during treatment. By tracking the frequencies of drug resistance mutations over time in a single patient, we can observe clonal interference between lineages that each carry beneficial mutations in real time. Sun et al. (2012) conducted the first analysis of this kind by tracking drug resistance allele frequencies in three patients across at least two time points. The first patient was entirely free of drug resistance mutations at the onset of treatment, but by the second time point of sampling had four segregating drug resistance mutations. At the final time point, 94% of the sample had a single drug resistance mutation, and 6% was divided among other drugresistant strains, including those containing drug resistance mutations not present at the second time point. This suggests that while M. tuberculosis rapidly acquires resistance mutations, different drug-resistant strains compete against each other due to lack of recombination. The second patient entered the study with an M. tuberculosis population fixed for a certain drug resistance mutation (rpoB L533P) but remained sensitive to the antibiotic rifampicin. Eighteen months later, this patient had a population whose genetic composition was dominated by a different drug resistance mutation (rpoB H526Y) and was now resistant to rifampicin, suggesting that successive sweeps of alternative drug resistance mutations can lead to multidrug-resistant strains. Eldholm et al. (2014) performed a similar study, but with much greater sequencing depth, in a single patient who was followed over 42 months as extensive drug resistance was acquired by the pathogen. The patient, who was started on a standard antibiotic regimen (pyrazinamide, rifampicin and isoniazid), was given increasingly uncommon drugs as their tuberculosis population acquired more drug resistance mutations. The dynamics of clonal interference are shown in Fig. 5 , based on data from Eldholm et al. (2014) . Allele frequencies were measured at several time points, so alleles with similar frequency trajectories can be assumed to be on the same background or in the same clone. Therefore, the clonal frequency changes can be inferred across time. Eldholm et al. (2014) identified 12 drug resistance mutations reaching frequency >25%, of which only seven ultimately fixed (shown in green), suggesting that clonal interference may purge over 40% of strongly selected drug resistance mutations even after reaching high frequencies (shown in blue).

The knowledge of these positively selected drug resistance mutations can also allow us to understand the dynamics of co-occurring hitchhiking mutations that were already on the background on which the drug resistance mutation arose. Eldholm et al. (2014) found that 23 mutations not directly associated with drug resistance also fixed in the population over the 42 weeks of sampling. While these mutations may have been neutral, compensatory, or positively selected through adaptation unrelated to drugs, it is also possible that some or all of them are slightly deleterious but rose in frequency due to their linkage to beneficial mutations.

From Eldholm et al. (2014) it may be noted that, in most cases, the drug resistance mutations were added to haplotypes one by one, which suggests that each individual mutation leads to an increase in fitness. This is troubling, because part of the rationale behind using multiple drugs at the same time is that it should make it much harder for the pathogen to evolve resistance, as it needs to acquire multiple mutations at the same time. It has been suggested that imperfect drug penetration may explain the evolution of resistance in tuberculosis despite multidrug therapy (Lipsitch & Levin 1998; Moreno-Gamez et al. 2015) .

The study of clonal interference, thus far largely investigated within experimental and theoretical models, has a unique application in the study of clonal dynamics of natural populations of the human pathogen M. tuberculosis. Using the presence of drug resistance mutations as a positive control for strong directional selection, we are able to better understand the evolutionary dynamics of clonally evolving pathogen populations such as M. tuberculosis. Although we currently only have detailed data for a few well-studied patients that include deep coverage of the entire genome across multiple time points, it appears to be the case that clonal interference in M. tuberculosis populations occurs in a way that is similar to what is seen in laboratory experiments. With the knowledge of hundreds of drug resistance mutations and the availability of affordable whole-genome sequencing, we expect to see many more studies of within-host dynamics of tuberculosis in the near future. We especially look forward to studies where population's genetics can be used to understand genetic patterns associated with diverse treatment outcomes.

There is a growing need to address drug resistance within bacterial species that exhibit horizontal gene transfer (HGT, see Box 3), which is the sharing of genetic material between cells. Resistance to antibiotics has been increasingly reported for many bacterial species with HGT, including S. aureus, Helicobacter pylori, Salmonella enterica, E. coli and many others. Most bacterial species primarily reproduce clonally, passing their current genomes vertically to the next generation. In species with HGT, there are also genetic elements that can be passed between individuals within the current generation and recombined into their genomes. HGT can move genes, sets of genes or even chromosomes between cells of even distantly related species (Nelson et al. 1999; Keeling & Palmer 2008; Syvanen 2012; Meric et al. 2015) . This makes defining a bacterial species difficult, let alone tracking the spread of drug resistance.

Bacteria have a circular chromosome (typically 1-10 Mb in size and in 1-2 copies per cell) that generally contains the 'core' or 'essential' genome and typically codes for fundamental functions like DNA repair and replication, cell structures and shapes, and metabolic functions. Many species of bacteria have an additional 'accessory' or 'satellite' genome that is typically 0.1-10% of the size of the core genome and can be present on the main circular chromosome or on extrachromosomal elements, such as plasmids. The core genome is usually defined as the set of genetic regions that are present within all members of the species, and the accessory genome is that which can vary between individual strains or cells. The accessory genome, whether on the main chromosome or not, can include chromosomal cassettes, bacteriophages, pathogenicity islands, genomic islands and transposons (Lindsay & Holden 2004) . The accessory genome is sometimes called 'dispensable' because it is not required for survival in an optimal environment; however, not only can the accessory genome encode information essential to a bacterium's survival in some environments, but bacteria have evolved elaborate and fascinating methods of sharing accessory genes between cells (Amabile-Cuevas 1993; Stokes & Gillings 2011) .

The sharing of genetic information between cells is called horizontal gene transfer (HGT). While bacteria are asexual and typically defined as 'clonal', both HGT (distinct from sex because it alters the genome of the recipient) and new mutations can generate novel genetic variation within a population of bacteria. HGT can occur both within and across species, and there are even cases of transfer across kingdoms (Keeling & Palmer 2008) . The actual methods of transferring DNA through the cell membrane include transformation, transduction, and conjugation. Transformation is the uptake of naked DNA into the cell, generally mediated by membrane proteins with some DNA specificity. It is a method restricted to species that have evolved to uptake DNA. Transduction is transfer of DNA that is mediated by phages (or bacteriophages, viruses that infect and replicate within a bacterium), thus it is restricted by which hosts a phage is capable of infecting. There are two types: generalized transduction, where random bacterial DNA is incorporated into phage DNA, and specialized transduction, where the incorporation is limited to a specific set of bacterial genes. Perhaps the most common method of HGT is conjugation, which requires cell-to-cell contact. One famous method of conjugation is the E. coli F conjugative plasmids, which code for cellular structures that bring the cells into contact (called 'pili') as well as for machinery to inject the DNA into the recipient cell. The genetic material transferred via HGT can be recombined onto the main bacterial chromosome or onto extrachromosomal elements. Often 'cassettes' of genes evolve together and can spread through a bacterial population, including in many cases of drug resistance (Amabile-Cuevas 1993; Stokes & Gillings 2011).

One useful framework for understanding the spread of drug resistance in species with HGT is the concept of a selective sweep. In general, in a selective sweep, a new adaptive mutation arises and spreads through a population, causing a corresponding reduction in genetic diversity around the adaptive site (Maynard Smith & Haigh 1974) . In clonal populations (e.g. populations of M. tuberculosis), a selective sweep can lead to the removal of entire lineages and a strong genomewide reduction in diversity. By contrast, in recombining populations (e.g. populations of P. falciparum) the extent of the reduction in diversity is inversely proportional to the ratio of recombination and selection, r/s [such that the greatest reduction in diversity occurs when recombination (r) is weak and selection (s) is strong] (Kaplan et al. 1989) . Selective sweeps in organisms that exhibit HGT can be best understood by distinguishing between gene-specific and genomewide selective sweeps (Shapiro & Polz 2014) . Gene-specific selective sweeps occur when an adaptive mutation or gene can be transmitted across a population faster via HGT than by clonal expansion, which means that the adaptive mutation spreads independent of the rest of the genome. Perhaps more familiarly, a genomewide selective sweep occurs when an adaptive mutation spreads via clonal expansion of the genome that first acquired the adaptive mutation. Another way to frame gene-specific and genomewide selective sweeps can be to think again of the ratio of recombination (here mediated via HGT) to selection, r/s, and how it impacts genetic variation in the genome. When r/s ≫ 1 gene-specific selective sweeps are more likely to occur, and they will have little impact on genomewide diversity. When r/s ≪ 1 genomewide selective sweeps are more likely, and genomic diversity can be strongly reduced. Thus far, it appears that many adaptive events in microbial species with HGT may fall into the r/s ≫ 1 regime which leads to gene-specific sweeps (Shapiro & Polz 2014) , although more data are needed. For example, what looks to be a high r/s ratio may be partially be explained by the slowing of genomewide sweeps due to clonal interference and perhaps selection for lowfrequency genotypes (Shapiro & Polz 2014) . Nevertheless, it is useful to frame the evolution of bacterial species with HGT in the context of both genomewide and gene-specific sweeps.

A more traditional framework for studying the evolution of bacterial genomes with HGT has been to study evolution within the 'core' genome, defined as the gene regions that are shared by all isolates within a species, vs. the 'accessory' genome, which is the genetic material that is not shared by all isolates of a species (see Box 3). We will use the example of S aureus and the accessory element SCCmec to explore the evolution of drug resistance within a bacterial species capable of horizontal gene transfer (note that SCCmec recombines onto the circular chromosome as a gene cassette, see Boxes 1 and 3). We have chosen to consider MRSA not only because it is a major emerging health threat but also because it is an instructive example in how the phylogenetic relationships between global isolates reveal different evolutionary histories depending on whether the core genome or an accessory genetic element is considered.

Staphylococcus aureus is a human commensal that is known for causing dangerous skin, blood stream and other hospital-associated infections as well as having the ability to become resistant to the majority of antibiotics (Lowy 2003; Stryjewski & Corey 2014) . In addition to methicillin resistance, which first emerged in the 1960s, there is also a growing number of cases of resistance to other antibiotics, including vancomycin, quinolones, aminoglycosides, streptogramins, oxazolidinones and rifamycins (Lowy 2003; Stryjewski & Corey 2014) . MRSA can be particularly deadly. For example, mortality rates for patients with MRSA bloodstream infections has been reported to be ~30% (De Kraker et al. 2011 ). In the USA ~94 000 infections and ~19 000 deaths per year are caused by MRSA (Stockman 2009 ). Drug resistance can arise via new mutations within the genome of a single clone (Strahilevitz & Hooper 2005; Howden et al. 2008) , via horizontal gene transfer between clones (Coombs et al. 2011 ) and even via horizontal gene transfer from another bacterial species (Hanssen & Ericson Sollid 2006; Bloemendaal et al. 2010; Malachowa & Deleo 2010; Smyth et al. 2012) . Staphylococcus aureus strains acquire methicillin resistance via the mobile genetic element SCCmec [most likely via transduction (defined in Box 3) (Maslanova et al. 2013 )], which integrates as a cassette of genes into the bacterium's chromosome.

The genome of S. aureus is ~2.8 Mbp total, where ~2.3 Mbp compose the core genome and ~0.5 Mbp compose the accessory genome. The most common method for analysing the genomes of S. aureus isolates has been multilocus sequence typing (MLST), in which a standardized set of housekeeping genes from the core genome are sequenced and categorized into allelic types, allowing placement of each isolate into a defined 'clonal complex' (Enright & Day 2000; Enright et al. 2002; Maiden et al. 2014 ). MLST has historically been applied to the core genome, revealing that S. aureus is a highly clonal species with relatively few recombination events in the core genome (Robinson & Enright 2004 ). When MLST is applied to international collections of isolates, it appears that a small number of clonal lineages are responsible for most infections. For example, Oliveira et al. (2002) applied MLST to over 3000 MRSA isolates from hospitals across Europe, South America, and the USA, and found that just five clones caused 70% of the infections (Oliveira et al. 2002) . As findings such as these emerged, it was thought that methicillin resistance was likely to have spread across the population of S. aureus when relatively few clones acquired SCCmec and then clonally expanded (i.e. genomewide sweeps) (Kreiswirth et al. 1993; Crisóstomo et al. 2001; Feil & Enright 2004 ). However, closer analysis of the population structure of the S. aureus accessory genome reveals a different story.

In the first few decades of MRSA outbreaks, it was found that the strains causing hospitalassociated (HA-MRSA) vs. community-associated (CA-MRSA) infections displayed distinct clinical and genetic differences (these differences may be eroding, as will be addressed later). HA-MRSA tends to be resistant to a wider array of antibiotics and often causes blood stream and other hospital-related infections in individuals with additional medical conditions. CA-MRSA tends to be more virulent (caused by virulence genes also transmitted via HGT) and often causes skin infections in otherwise healthy individuals (David & Daum 2010; Chua et al. 2014) . These clinical differences are partly mediated by the mobile genetic element called SCCmec, a chromosomal gene cassette that confers resistance to methicillin and can also confer resistance to other antibiotics (Katayama et al. 2000; Hanssen & Ericson Sollid 2006) . Interestingly, genetic changes within this gene cassette track successive epidemic waves of MRSA (Katayama et al. 2000; Chambers & DeLeo 2009) , and extensive work has been done to investigate the source and spread of this mobile element, both as a phylogenetically informative sequence and as an adaptive factor in its own right. SCCmec is currently classified into 11 types (with more subtypes) using mutations and the orientation of segments within the cassette (Milheiriço et al. 2007; IWG-SCC 2015) .

There have been a number of studies showing that the population structure of S. aureus is different between HA-MRSA and CA-MRSA strains (David & Daum 2010; Mediavilla et al. 2012; Stryjewski & Corey 2014) . Both HA-MRSA and CA-MRSA strains are thought to arise when methicillin-sensitive clones newly acquire a SCCmec cassette from a source population, most likely the staphylococcus species S. epidermidis (Wu et al. 1996; Hanssen et al. 2004 Hanssen et al. , 2005 Meric et al. 2015) . It has been found that HA-MRSA strains tend to carry the longer SCCmec types I, II, and III elements in just a few clonal backgrounds, whereas CA-MRSA strains tends to carry the shorter SCCmec types IV and V elements in diverse clonal backgrounds (Enright et al. 2002; Robinson & Enright 2003; David & Daum 2010; Coombs et al. 2011) . For example, the early HA-MRSA pandemic could be relatively neatly classified into just five clonal complexes (Musser & Kapur 1992; Fitzgerald et al. 2001; Enright et al. 2002; Robinson & Enright 2003) . In contrast, as researchers began analysing the strains responsible for the emerging CA-MRSA health threat, they found these strains to display more diversity and a stronger association between clonal type and geographic location (Chua et al. 2010; David & Daum 2010; Coombs et al. 2011) . As of 2006 the SCCmec type IV element alone was found to have entered at least nine different clonal complexes of S. aureus (Lina et al. 2006 ).

The clinical and genetic differences between hospital-associated (HA-) and communityassociated (CA-) MRSA are eroding in the modern pandemic, mainly due to the emergence of CA-MRSA strains that seed an increasing number of hospital outbreaks (Chambers & DeLeo 2009; David & Daum 2010; Mediavilla et al. 2012; Hsu et al. 2015) . A study of MRSA infections in 2004 MRSA infections in -2005 in the city of San Francisco, California, found that ~90% of MRSA infections were acquired in the community (Liu et al. 2008 ). In the United States, there is currently a predominant CA-MRSA clone, called USA300 (typically containing SCCmec Type IV), that is responsible for the vast majority of community-associated infections in addition to causing hospital outbreaks (Seybold et al. 2006; Chambers & DeLeo 2009 ). Mathematical models predict that these CA-MRSA strains will eventually replace the strains traditionally categorized as HA-MRSA, rendering the communityassociated and hospital-associated categories far less useful (D'Agata et al. 2009 ). The success of these CA-MRSA strains is potentially mediated by the arrival of the SCCmec Type IV cassette, which may be particularly suited to recurrent horizontal transfer because it confers faster growth rates at little or no fitness cost (Okuma et al. 2002; Diep et al. 2008; Chambers & DeLeo 2009; Mediavilla et al. 2012 ).

As the clinical and genetic differences between CA-and HA-MRSA strains have eroded in the modern pandemic, so too has the emphasis on their differences within recent literature. Instead, attention is moving towards leveraging new sequencing technologies (Maiden et al. 2014 ) to achieve higher resolution into the global patterns of methicillin resistance acquisition. Overall, analyses of the core genome of MRSA strains suggest that relatively few methicillin-resistant clones have dispersed widely across the globe (Robinson & Enright 2003) , while analyses of the accessory genome of MRSA suggest that new strains emerge locally via frequent de novo transfers of the SCCmec element. In other words, it appears that there has been clonal expansion of relatively few core genomes, while the accessory genome frequently goes through gene-specific sweeps. To illustrate this, Lina et al. (2006) applied MLST to both the core genome and the SCCmec element and found no association between clonal complex background and SCCmec element sequence type. The authors therefore concluded that SCCmec appears to transfer both repeatedly across distinct clonal complexes (particularly in the case of SCCmec IV) and repeatedly within a clonal complex, which suggests that SCCmec spreads through gene-specific sweeps. Chua et al. showed in another study that MRSA from geographically and genetically distant isolates (i.e. distantly related core genomes) can nevertheless have relatively conserved accessory elements, including SCCmec type IV (Chua et al. 2011) , which again suggests that transfer happens often and sweeps are gene-specific. Another example is a study by Nübel et al. (2008) where the authors used an improved sequence typing method of the core and accessory genome to investigate the genetic relationships within a single clonal lineage (ST5, belonging to clonal complex CC5) using 135 isolates from across 22 countries and six continents. In contrast to lower resolution studies that came before, their analyses of the core genome sequences found geographically-associated phylogenetic clades within the ST5 clonal lineage. Additionally, their analyses of the SCCmec sequence revealed that at least 23 independent transfers of SCCmec occurred into this clonal group alone, with acquisitions appearing to occur locally (rather than a single acquisition then disseminating globally; Fig. 6 ). We could refer to this case of multiple origins of the adaptive SCCmec element as a soft, gene-specific sweep (Pennings & Hermisson 2006) . The authors estimate that previous calculations for the rate of SCCmec acquisitions were at least an order of magnitude too low.

Taken together, we now know that genetically diverse core genomes can nevertheless contain closely related resistance alleles and that frequent transfers can occur even within a clonal lineage. This makes understanding the evolutionary history of these alleles complicated, because alleles can be transmitted independently of the clonal expansion of core genome lineages. Nevertheless, these studies of drug resistance in S. aureus illustrate that researchers can achieve fine resolution into the demographic and adaptive history of S. aureus using improved sequencing technologies, in this case facilitated by the exploration of both the core and accessory genomes.

As researchers begin to use whole-genome sequencing in S. aureus, an even finer resolution into the evolutionary history of MRSA outbreaks is possible. For example, Holden et al. (2013) were able to pinpoint both the population size changes and geographic origin of a specific clone (EMRSA-15/ST22), and Harris et al. (2013) were able to construct the transmission pathway of a hospital outbreak between staff and patients. Thus, the growing availability of sequence data and whole-genome sequencing technologies has provided the ability to determine that resistance may generally be unconstrained by global transmission dynamics and instead can be tracked on local spatial scales. This presents researchers with the opportunity to use sequencing as a tool to monitor transmission networks within hospitals to limit the numbers of hospital-acquired drug-resistant infections. Overall, the transmission and repeated evolution of drug resistance in bacterial populations capable of HGT presents important and interesting problems for reconstructing population structure and spatial distributions of resistance.

The costs that drug-resistant pathogens impose on human health are enormously high, making any tool that can lead to increased understanding of the evolution and spread of drug resistance of great potential value. It is therefore important that tools from the field of evolutionary genetics, including population genetic and phylogenetic ones, are applied to pathogen populations where these tools could provide meaningful insights. In addition to the possibility of helping to prevent the evolution and spread of drug resistance, valuable lessons can be learned to deepen our understanding of evolutionary biology, making pathogens attractive study organisms. In this review we highlighted five evolutionary genetic studies in pathogens that we hope give a sampling of the range of biological lessons that can be learned from the study of drug resistance in pathogens. First, we showed how classic population genetic methods for finding selective sweeps were used to successfully identify the region involved with resistance to artemisinin in the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum. Next, we described how phylogenetic methods helped uncover the role of epistasis in the evolution of influenza surface proteins in general and in the evolution of oseltamivir resistance in particular. In our third example, we highlighted the importance of SGV in the evolution of resistance to antiretrovirals in patients with HIV. Fourth, we showed that drug resistance mutations can be used to explore the dynamics of clonal interference within a patient infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Finally, we discussed the complications involved in studying bacterial populations and how horizontal gene transfer of genetic elements contributes to the spread of antibiotic resistance in Staphylococcus aureus.

These five examples are not meant to be exhaustive, but rather to show the wealth of possible study organisms and evolutionary questions that can be addressed. We hope that these five examples convince the reader that the evolutionary genetics of drug resistance is an appealing field.

In each of the cases we highlighted, the study of drug resistance has been useful in expanding our understanding of basic evolutionary processes. The insights gained from these examples are not limited to the organisms mentioned in this review, but the discoveries that can be made do, in some ways, depend on the organism, its biology, and the availability of data. For example, the work on epistasis in influenza was only possible because of the extensive sequence collection that is continuously happening around the world. The work on mapping a resistance allele in the malaria parasite P. falciparum also depended on the availability of data but additionally was possible because P. falciparum has a high recombination rate that facilitates linkage-based analyses. The described studies on SGV in HIV were possible because the relevant mutations were known and because evolution of resistance can happen independently in every patient, giving researchers the ability to work with replicate evolutionary histories. The work in M. tuberculosis was possible, once again, because the resistance mutations are well known and because haplotypes could be reconstructed from allele frequencies due to a lack of recombination. Finally, the example of drug resistance evolution in MRSA shows how horizontal gene transfer can be studied when extensive multilocus genotyping data are available from isolates collected across the globe.

Similar analyses can and are being performed in other pathogens. For example, we highlighted work on selective sweeps in P. falciparum, but selective sweeps and hitchhiking are also being studied in HIV (Zanini & Neher 2013; Pennings et al. 2014; Feder et al. 2015) , in hepatitis C virus (Bull et al. 2011) , and in influenza (Koelle et al. 2006; Strelkowa & Lässig 2012) . We used MRSA as an example for the importance of horizontal gene transfer, but there are many other such examples. For example, a recent study on pneumococcus describes horizontal gene transfer and soft selective sweeps related to drug resistance and vaccine escape (Croucher et al. 2014) . Another example of a group of pathogens in which the evolution of drug resistance can be studied are the herpes viruses. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is the herpes virus for which drug resistance is best studied and for which many resistance mutations are known (Hakki & Chou 2011) , and population geneticists have recently started to analyse CMV sequences (Renzette et al. 2015) . Drug resistance also evolves in other herpes viruses, such as varicella-zoster virus and herpes simplex virus (Piret & Boivin 2014; Brunnemann et al. 2015) , but these viruses have not been extensively analysed using population genetic or evolutionary genetic methods.

In all these cases, the role of evolutionary genetics is to connect information contained in genomic sequences to the processes underlying pathogen evolution, and this will require careful attention to the diverse biological properties of pathogens as we have discussed in this review (see Box 1). Pathogen evolution represents an enormous opportunity for population geneticists to study major questions in evolutionary biology and also contributes to our understanding of some of the most important issues in public health. By combining innovative population genetics approaches with appropriate data collection, we hope that future studies will make beneficial contributions to the fields of evolutionary biology and public health.

The field of population genetics traditionally leans heavily on the use of fruit flies, yeast, Escherichia coli, and humans as model organisms. However, it is becoming clear that many pathogens can also be excellent model systems. Pathogen evolution as a model evolutionary system has many advantages. Pathogens receive a lot of attention from biomedical researchers, and as a consequence, they are well studied and extensively sampled. Some pathogens already function as model organisms in the lab [e.g., influenza (Foll et al. 2014) , HIV (van Opijnen & Berkhout 2005) , polio (Acevedo et al. 2014 ) and E. coli (Toprak et al. 2012 )], which allows researchers to assess characteristics of population genetic and epidemiological relevance from laboratory populations, for example the cell surface expression assays that were performed in the previously mentioned study of oseltamivir resistance in influenza. In some pathogen systems, researchers can also apply known selective pressures with precision in a laboratory environment, thus allowing high-resolution measurements of an organism's response to selection. Additionally, because some pathogens evolve drug resistance quickly and repeatedly within patients, there are cases where many replicate evolutionary histories can be studied (HIV, HCV, TB, etc.).

Pathogens are also among the organisms for which the most genetic sequence data are available for population genetics analysis: In 2014, over 270 000 S. aureus sequences, 50 000 influenza sequences, 40 000 HIV sequences, and 5000 malaria sequences were released in GenBank alone (Benson et al. 2013; accessed 26 May 2015) . Moreover, decreased costs of next-generation sequencing will make the amount of new data for pathogens increase exponentially. Throughout this review, we highlight uses of sequence data and population genetics theory in studying pathogens as evolutionary model systems. We believe that pathogen evolution will continue to be a fruitful area of research for evolutionary biologists where fundamental insights can lead to beneficial public health consequences.

As more sequencing data emerge in the foreseeable future, there are some specific questions that we would like to see addressed at the intersection of population genetics and drug resistance in pathogens. First, we are expecting more work that bridges within-vs. betweenhost dynamics (e.g. Lythgoe & Fraser 2012) . This is important because considerable genetic variation is created and selected for within the host; however, the within-host processes of short-lived infections have not yet received sufficient attention. We are expecting more within-host work, including time series and deep samples for pathogens that are traditionally studied at the between-host level. The M. tuberculosis work described in this review is a good example, but new within-patient work on influenza is also being done (Rogers et al. 2015) . Second, with deeper samples and more time series, it should become increasingly possible to estimate selection pressures on pathogens and to estimate epistatic interactions between mutations. For some of this work, methods that are currently used for identifying mutations and evaluating selection in viruses grown in cell culture (Lou et al. 2013; Foll et al. 2014 ) will hopefully find use in clinical samples taken from infected patients. Extending these methods to patient data can potentially give researchers the ability to study the evolutionary dynamics of pathogens within patients over the entire course of an infection.

Another important goal for these evolutionary studies of pathogens was to increase our predictive power of pathogen evolution. Until very recently predicting evolution seemed like science fiction, but recent work is changing our perceptions of what is possible. In addition to the predictive phylogenetic methodologies mentioned in our discussion of epistasis in influenza, a method that uses the shapes of protein phylogenies to predict evolutionary trajectories was evaluated using influenza data (Neher et al. 2014) . The work shows that predictability is low when evolution occurs by big steps, but much higher when evolution proceeds by small steps (Neher et al. 2014 ). Although we tend to fix our attention on large adaptive events, such as drug resistance or immune escape, evolution by small steps may be more common than previously expected (Bhatt et al. 2011; Strelkowa & Lässig 2012; Gong et al. 2013) . In an organism like influenza where new vaccines are manufactured every year, the application of these and other new predictive methodologies that use population genetics theory (Luksza & Lässig 2014) are potentially groundbreaking.

We hope that the works on drug resistance reviewed here offer a glimpse into a growing field at the intersection of studies in pathogen evolution and evolutionary genetics. We also hope to have illustrated how these fields of study can benefit greatly from each other and that this review contributes to the exciting future of this field. Phylogenetic tree of neuraminidase (NA) subtype N1 illustrating the role of permissive mutations. Tree made with PhyML (Guindon et al. 2010 ) based on data from Bloom et al. (2010) and plotted using ggtree (Yu & Lam 2015) . The phylogeny suggests an epistatic interaction between mutations R222Q, V234M and H274Y. Based on a maximum-likelihood reconstruction, branches with the H274Y resistance mutation are coloured red, whereas those without are coloured grey. Nonresistant branches with only the V234M mutation are coloured in light blue while nonresistant branches with both V234M and R222Q mutations are coloured in dark blue. The clade in which mutations, R222Q and V234M, are nearly fixed is shaded in blue. The phylogeny is consistent with the idea that the substitutions at site 222 and 234 act as 'permissive' mutations, ameliorating the fitness costs of H274Y on the previous background and allowing it to spread. The branch length scale is given in units of substitutions per site. WILSON et al. Page 38 Mol Ecol. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2017 January 01.

Phylogenetic tree of neuraminidase (NA) subtype N1 illustrating a putatively epistatic interaction. The same tree from Fig. 2 is used to illustrate the methodology presented in Kryazhimskiy et al. (2011) . Nonresistant branches with the D344N mutation are coloured in blue. Branches with the H274Y resistance mutation are coloured in red. The phylogeny suggests an epistatic interaction between sites 344 and 275 where the H274Y substitution at site 275 (site 274 in N2 numbering scheme) appears multiple times immediately following the D344N substitution at site 344 (shaded in blue). This co-occurrence is consistent with the idea that the substitution at site 344 acts as a 'permissive' mutation and that these mutations interact in a positively epistatic manner. Determining the amount of drug resistance from standing genetic variation (SGV) in HIV-1 using two studies. In two different studies, the percentage of patients acquiring drug resistance is partitioned into those whose HIV populations acquired drug resistance from SGV (light blue) and those whose populations acquired drug resistance via de novo mutation (dark blue). The total rate of failure is higher in the Paredes study than in the Margot study, but the percentage that is attributable to SGV is similar in the two studies. The calculation of the percentage of patients failing from SGV from the Paredes et al. (2010) study is shown in the inset. Patients are partitioned into those starting without drug-resistant SGV (left) and those with drug-resistant SGV (right). Eleven patients are expected to have failed due to de novo mutations based on the sample size (15% of 73 patients), and the remaining 15 failures are attributed to failure due to drug resistance from SGV. Clonal interference in Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Dynamics of clonal interference among drug resistance mutations (stars) and mutations not known to be drug resistance mutations (dots) arising within a patient with tuberculosis. Each expanding colour block represents an M. tuberculosis lineage starting from one or more mutations and spreading through the population. Lineages are coloured depending on whether the mutations they possess ultimately fix in the population (green) or are lost (blue). Lineages that begin with mutations not known to be drug resistance mutations (non-DRMs) are coloured in brown. The background on which each new lineage emerges is overlapped at the starting point of each colour block. Trajectories are inferred from allele frequencies at the point of sampling (black vertical lines). Mutations for which the inferred trajectories do not closely match clonal dynamics are marked in red. Data from Eldholm et al. (2014) . sizes of circles are proportional to the haplotype frequency, and the line length is proportional to the number of mutational steps between haplotypes. In panel (A) haplotypes are painted with colours in proportion to the country of origin that isolates with this haplotype were found. Fourteen lineages (labelled 'A' through 'N') tend to cluster with geographical origin emerge, suggesting that specific haplotypes of the core genome of the S. aureus ST5 clone are largely endemic to a geographical area. In panel (B) the same minimum-spanning tree is used, but now haplotypes are painted with colours in proportion to the SCCmec element type co-occurring in the isolate. Some SCCmec elements are nontypeable ('nt'), likely due to being novel variants. The most parsimonious distribution of acquisition events of SCCmec is indicated with roman numerals placed along the branches of the tree (where the roman numeral corresponds to the SCCmec type), although the actual number of SCCmec acquisitions may be higher. Note that while the different SCCmec types are present across the globe, the acquisition events tend to occur at the tips of the tree, suggesting that methicillin resistance tends to evolve within a local S. aureus strain as opposed to occurring once and then disseminating globally.

Human-Specific Evolution and Adaptation Led to Major Qualitative Differences in the Variable Receptors of Human and Chimpanzee Natural Killer Cells,"Natural killer (NK) cells serve essential functions in immunity and reproduction. Diversifying these functions within individuals and populations are rapidly-evolving interactions between highly polymorphic major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I ligands and variable NK cell receptors. Specific to simian primates is the family of Killer cell Immunoglobulin-like Receptors (KIR), which recognize MHC class I and associate with a range of human diseases. Because KIR have considerable species-specificity and are lacking from common animal models, we performed extensive comparison of the systems of KIR and MHC class I interaction in humans and chimpanzees. Although of similar complexity, they differ in genomic organization, gene content, and diversification mechanisms, mainly because of human-specific specialization in the KIR that recognizes the C1 and C2 epitopes of MHC-B and -C. Humans uniquely focused KIR recognition on MHC-C, while losing C1-bearing MHC-B. Reversing this trend, C1-bearing HLA-B46 was recently driven to unprecedented high frequency in Southeast Asia. Chimpanzees have a variety of ancient, avid, and predominantly inhibitory receptors, whereas human receptors are fewer, recently evolved, and combine avid inhibitory receptors with attenuated activating receptors. These differences accompany human-specific evolution of the A and B haplotypes that are under balancing selection and differentially function in defense and reproduction. Our study shows how the qualitative differences that distinguish the human and chimpanzee systems of KIR and MHC class I predominantly derive from adaptations on the human line in response to selective pressures placed on human NK cells by the competing needs of defense and reproduction.","Natural killer (NK) cells are lymphocytes that contribute to both the immune and reproductive systems. NK cells provide first-line, innate immune defense against infection [1] and cancer [2] , and through interaction with dendritic cells [3] help initiate the second-line, adaptive immune response [4] . During embryo implantation and placentation, NK cells control the trophoblastmediated widening of maternal blood vessels necessary to nourish the fetus throughout pregnancy [5] . Controlling both NK cell development and effector function is a variety of interactions between NK cell receptors and their ligands [6] , the class I molecules of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC): called the HLA complex in humans. Some interactions are conserved, such as that between human HLA-E and the CD94:NKG2A receptor [7] , whereas others are highly variable, notably those between HLA-A, B, C and killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIR) [8] . Pointing to the clinical importance of these interactions, various combinations of HLA and KIR factors associate with the outcome of viral infection, susceptibility to autoimmune disease, relapse of leukemia following therapeutic transplantation, and reproductive success [9] [10] [11] .

The human KIR locus combines gene content variability with allelic polymorphism [8, 12] . This diverse family of NK cell receptor genes is restricted to simian primates, having expanded from a single copy KIR3DL gene during the last ,40-58 million years [13] . In rodents, where KIR genes are expressed in the brain, but not by NK cells [14] , the Ly49 gene family independently evolved as a variable family of NK cell receptors for MHC class I [15] . Prosimians have a single, non-functional KIR3DL gene, but a diversified system of CD94 and NKG2 genes [13] . Also having a single KIR3DL gene, cattle expanded and diversified the distantly related KIR3DX gene [16] , which in humans is non-functional. This strong element of species-specific evolution likely reflects the variety and inconstancy of selection imposed on NK cells by immune defense and reproduction; the former being essential for individuals to survive, the latter being necessary for the survival of populations and species [17] . In this context of rapidly evolving NK cell receptors, the study of chimpanzees, our closest living relatives, becomes an imperative, not only for clinical studies in which the chimpanzee is the preferred animal model, for example hepatitis C virus infection [18] , but also for defining those aspects of NK cell function that are unique to the human species [19] .

HLA-A, B, C and G serve as ligands for human KIR [8] . HLA-G expression is restricted to trophoblast and thus dedicated to functions associated with pregnancy [20] . Of the highly polymorphic genes, only HLA-C is present on trophoblast and able to interact with the KIR of uterine NK cells [21] . HLA-A, B and C are expressed by almost all cells of the body and can thus contribute in general to NK cell responses against infection and cancer. Although the chimpanzee has well-defined orthologs of all the human HLA class I genes [22] , exploratory studies of chimpanzee KIR cDNA and one KIR haplotype [23, 24] , raised intriguing possibilities: first that only a small minority of KIR genes is shared by humans and chimpanzees; and second, that the organization of KIR genes into haplotypes is qualitatively different in the two species. To test these hypotheses we performed extensive analysis of chimpanzee KIR haplotype structure and variation, permitting definitive genetic and functional comparison with the human KIR system.

Chimpanzee KIR haplotypes do not divide into functional groups like human A and B haplotypes From sequence analysis of cDNA [23] and three KIR haplotypes ( Figure 1A ), we defined 13 chimpanzee KIR genes. Typing a panel of 39 individuals identified 16 genotypes ( Figure 1B) , for which the component KIR haplotypes were deduced ( Figure 1C ). Both in number and gene content difference, chimpanzee KIR genotypes are within the human range ( Figure 1D ). Common to the human and chimpanzee KIR loci are three conserved, framework regions separated by centromeric and telomeric intervals of variable gene content [25] . Whereas the human variable KIR genes are evenly distributed between the two intervals, their chimpanzee counterparts are restricted to the centromeric interval, leaving the telomeric interval both short and empty (Figure 2A) .

Although human and chimpanzee each have ten variable KIR genes, only 2DL5 and 2DS4 are held in common. These two genes distinguish the human group A and B KIR haplotypes, a difference correlating with a wide range of clinical effects [10] . KIR2DL5 is the only inhibitory KIR restricted to B haplotypes, 2DS4 the only activating KIR of A haplotypes (Figure 2A and 2B) . Whereas human 2DS4 is restricted to the telomeric region and present on ,50% of KIR haplotypes, chimpanzee 2DS4 is restricted to the centromeric region ( Figure 2B ) and present on only 8% of haplotypes ( Figure 1C ). Also varying between species are the location of 2DL5 and its linkage disequilibrium (LD). Restricted to the centromeric region, chimpanzee 2DL5 has absolute LD with inhibitory KIR2DL8, whereas human 2DL5 has absolute LD with activating KIR2DS3/S5 and is alternatively found in the centromeric region, the telomeric region, or both (Figure 2A and 2B). Thus human-specific evolution of the KIR locus involved 'colonization' of the telomeric region of the KIR locus, with assembly of A and B haplotype gene-content motifs around the 2DS4 and 2DL5 genes, respectively. Consequently, human KIR haplotypes all have 2DS4 and/or 2DL5, while almost half the chimpanzee haplotypes (44%; arithmetic sum of the individual frequencies of haplotypes 1, 6, 9 and 15) lack both of them.

Chimpanzee lineage III KIR are more numerous and functional MHC-C receptors than their human counterparts The ten variable chimpanzee KIR form five pairs within the centromeric region ( Figure 1C and Figure 2A ). As shown in Figure 1B , Pairs 2, 3 and 4 at high phenotype frequency are flanked on the centromeric side by Pair 1 of intermediate frequency and on the telomeric side by Pair 5 of low frequency. Because Pairs 1, 3, and 5 have absolute or very high LD ( Figure 1C ), gene-content diversity of chimpanzee KIR haplotypes derives from asymmetric recombination between seven units, these three high LD pairs and the individual genes of Pairs 2 and 4. In humans, a similar number of units is divided between the centromeric and telomeric regions and separated by a unique and repetitive sequence that facilitates symmetric recombination [26] (Figure 2A ). Thus recombination of centromeric and telomeric gene-content motifs, a major component of human KIR haplotype diversification, is not a significant feature of the chimpanzee system.

Eight variable chimpanzee lineage III KIR have no human equivalents and represent lineage III KIR encoding high-avidity receptors for the C1 and C2 epitopes of MHC-C. Two inhibitory and one activating KIR are C1-specific, four inhibitory and one activating KIR are C2-specific [27, 28] . Contrasting with this battery of potent MHC-C receptors is the set of six variable human lineage III KIR without chimpanzee equivalents. These comprise high-avidity inhibitory receptors for C1 (2DL2/3) and C2 (2DL1), a C2 receptor with lower avidity (2DS1) and three KIR with no detectable binding to HLA class I (2DS2, 2DS3, and 2DS5) [29] . The lineage III KIR expansion associated with hominid evolution and 'first' detected in the orangutan [30] was further elaborated in chimpanzee and human, but in distinctive ways. Whereas the chimpanzee retains a diversity of strong inhibitory and activating MHC-C receptors, the human system is characterized by a reduced number of inhibitory receptors and a variety of activating receptors with loss of function [29] .

The 3DL3 and 2DL8 genes are represented on each of the sequenced KIR haplotypes by alleles that encode the same

Natural killer (NK) cells are versatile lymphocytes that make essential contributions to immune defense and placental reproduction. Essential to NK cell development, diversification and function are variable families of surface receptors that recognize equally variable determinants of polymorphic major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules, better known as the tissue types matched in clinical organ transplantation. These ligand-receptor interactions evolve rapidly, exhibiting much species specificity and convergent evolution. Consequently, mice represent a poor model, because their receptors are so disparate from the independently evolved human counterparts that are restricted to simian primates. To identify unique and shared aspects of human NK cell biology, we have defined the genomics, population biology, and immunology of variable chimpanzee NK cell receptors and ligands to a level permitting accurate, informed comparison with the well-characterized human system. In both receptors and ligands there are dramatic, qualitative differences between humans and chimpanzees. We show these differences arose during human evolution from the last common human-chimpanzee ancestor, while the chimpanzee system remained relatively stable. That two so closely related species exhibit major differences in NK cell receptors and ligands testifies to the strong and varying selection imposed by the different demands and competing needs of defense and reproduction. extracellular domains but different cytoplasmic tails ( Figure 3A ). In reciprocal manner, the same cytoplasmic tail can be associated with different extracellular domains. Thus, the T3 tail is alternatively associated with the extracellular domains of 3DL3, 2DL9 and 2DL6, as is the T7 tail with the 2DL8, 3DL5 and 2DL7 extracellular domains ( Figure 3A and 3B). These chimeric forms are the products of intergenic recombination that brought together the extracellular domains of one KIR with the signaling domain of another. The effect of this mechanism is to generate receptors with altered inhibitory signaling function ( Figure 3C and 3D). For example, of the three tails associated with 3DL3, T1 has no immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM), T2 has Chimpanzee KIR having no human strict ortholog are colored green.

Human KIR polymorphism was obtained from the IPD-KIR database [32] . doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1001192.g003 one, and T3 has two. The extent this occurred among the three haplotypes sequenced, points to the prevalence of the phenomenon and its significant contribution to the functional diversity of inhibitory chimpanzee KIR. Consistent with this thesis, sequence variability in the chimpanzee lineage III inhibitory KIR concentrates in the signaling domain ( Figure 3E ). However, that is not the case for human lineage III KIR, for which tail-swapping has principally served to convert inhibitory to activating receptors [31] , and allotypic variability more evenly distributes between ligand-binding and signaling domains ( Figure 3F ). Consequently, chimpanzee 3DL3 and inhibitory lineage III KIR display more allelic variability than their human counterparts ( Figure 3E and 3F). Particularly striking is 3DL3, for which four chimpanzee allotypes have 11 variable positions, compared to 12 in 31 human allotypes [32] .

The genomic regions containing the lineage I, II, and V KIR genes are shared by human and chimpanzee KIR haplotypes ( Figure 2A , Figure S1 , and Figure S2 ). In contrast, the regions containing the lineage III KIR genes have diverged to form four sublineages ( Figure 4A ). Of these, two are chimpanzee-specific, one is human-specific and one is shared. The two chimpanzeespecific sublineages correspond precisely to C1-and C2-specific KIR. Functionally, these sublineages were lost during human evolution (a non-functional remnant is KIR3DP1), being replaced by the human-specific sublineage that includes both C1-and C2specific receptors. The shared sublineage includes additional chimpanzee inhibitory C2 receptors and 2DS4. The differences in the MHC-C system of receptors in human and chimpanzee are seen to be mainly the result of human-specific evolution. These differences alter basic functional characteristics such as the number and avidity of receptors ( Figure 4B ), suggesting that natural selection played distinctive roles in the evolution of human and chimpanzee lineage III KIR.

Ligand-binding, KIR-KIR interaction, and signaling function were all subject to natural selection Evidence of positive diversifying selection was obtained for 16 positions in the ligand-binding domains of hominoid lineage III KIR ( Figure 4C and Figure 5A ). These positions cluster at four sites on the molecular surface: the MHC-C binding site, a site near the hinge where D1 and D2 interact (D1-D2 site), a site on D1 away from the interactions with D2 and MHC-C (D1 distal site), and a similarly distal site on D2 (D2 distal site).

Crystallography defined the MHC-C binding site [33, 34] , and mutagenesis identified D1-D2 sites that modulate avidity for MHC-C ( Figure 4D ). In both sites there was species-specific selection. Residues 44, 68 and 71 were subject to selection in chimpanzee, compared to residues 16 and 70 in humans. At positions 44, 68, and 71, chimpanzee inhibitory receptors have residues absent from their human counterparts, while the human evolution of low-avidity activating KIR introduced unique humanspecific residues at positions 44, 70 and 131 ( Figure 5B ). Thus the independent evolution of human and chimpanzee lineage III KIR involved fixation, under natural selection, of species-specific residues at sites affecting binding of MHC class I ligands.

Five of the 16 selected positions in D1 and D2 are implicated in the intermolecular KIR-KIR interaction observed in the KIR2DL2-HLA-Cw3 structure [34] : positions 119 and 90 are direct contact sites and residues 50, 84 and 123 are only 1-3 residues away from a contact site ( Figure 4D ). This distribution points to such KIR-KIR interactions being physiologically relevant, possibly contributing to the aggregation of receptors and ligands observed in the synapse between an NK cell and its target cell [35] .

In the cytoplasmic tail, positive diversifying selection targeted three positions (282, 295, and 296) ( Figure 4E and Figure 5A ). Position 282 is in the first ITIM that initiates inhibitory KIR signals by recruiting the tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2 [36] . Favoring such recruitment is alanine 282 [37] , fixed in chimpanzee but present in a minority of human lineage III KIR. Residues 295 and 296 are part of the protein kinase C (PKC) site, comprising residues 291-303. Phosphorylation of serine 298 attenuates inhibitory function [38] and is favored by arginine or lysine residues within the PKC site [39, 40] . In chimpanzee, but not human KIR, positions 295, 296 and 299 (also selected in chimpanzee KIR: p.0.9, Figure 5A ) have residue combinations that variably involve arginine and lysine, indicating a modulation of affinity for PKC.

Lineage III KIR recognize the C1 and C2 epitopes of MHC class I. C2 depends upon valine 76 (V76) and lysine 80 (K80), a motif restricted to a subset of MHC-C allotypes. C1 depends upon V76 and asparagine 80 (N80), a motif present in subsets of MHC-C and -B allotypes; 22% of chimpanzee MHC-B allotypes have C1, compared to only 2.5% for HLA-B ( Figure 6A ). Ancestral sequence reconstruction indicates that the last common ancestor of MHC-B and -C had V76, which remained fixed during MHC-C evolution, but was replaced by glutamic acid (E76) during MHC-B evolution ( Figure 6B ). The V76 observed in modern MHC-B allotypes arose de novo, by reversion from E76, with at least fifteen such events having occurred in hominoids ( Figure S3 ).

Of 12 distinct V76-containing HLA-B ( Figure 6C ), 11 emerged in modern human populations, either by point substitution (N = 8) or recombination (N = 3). Exceptional is the highly divergent HLA-B73, which combines features of both MHC-C and chimpanzee and gorilla MHC-B [41] . Eight point mutations independently introduced V76 and the C1 epitope into a range of HLA-B allotypes having N80. In contrast, V76 is never present in HLA-B allotypes having either isoleucine or threonine 80 (33% of the total), a distribution unlikely to occur by chance (a = 0.05). Likewise all 11 chimpanzee MHC-B allotypes with V76 have N80 ( Figure 6A ). Thus selection has favored MHC-B variants having C1 (V76-N80) and eliminated variants having V76-I80 or V76-T80. A possible mechanism for the latter effect is that HLA-B allotypes having I80 and T80 carry the Bw4 epitope recognized by KIR3DL1 [42, 43] , and that V76 perturbs this interaction while failing to introduce either C1 or C2.

Recombination events with HLA-C introduced V76 into three N80 HLA-B allotypes ( Figure 6C ). Of these HLA-B*46 rose to high frequency in Southeast Asia ( Figure 6C ), where it originated ( Figure 6D ) [44] following the arrival of modern humans ,55-65,000 years ago [45] . During this selective sweep B*46 further diversified by point mutation to give 14 low-frequency subtypes ( Figure 6C ). The B*46 frequencies of 25.4% and 22.9% in the Yunnan Dai and Guizhou Miao, respectively, are the highest for any HLA-B allele in populations exceeding one million individuals, being of a magnitude typical for small, isolated or bottlenecked populations ( Figure S4 ).

HLA-B*46 is a good ligand for KIR2DL2/3 [44, 46, 47] and a good educator of KIR2DL3-expressing NK cells [48] . It also gives individuals the flexibility to express up to four HLA class I isoforms bearing C1-C2 combinations ( Figure 7A ). From HLA and KIR frequencies, we determined the average number per individual of distinct interactions (ANDI) between KIR2DL receptors and HLA ligands. In all population groups ANDI ranged from 1.7-2.4, with a median of 2.0 ( Figure 7B and Figure S5 ). Because of their low C2 and KIR2DL2 frequencies, Southeast Asians have the lowest ANDI worldwide, despite the significant contribution of B*46 (shown in red in Figure 7B and in Figure S5 ). When B*46 is excluded from the analysis, Southeast Asian ANDI values fall out of the normal range. Thus the rise of B*46 in these populations has compensated for their reduced frequency of functional ligandreceptor pairs ( Figure 7C , Figure S5 , and Figure S6 ).

The evolution of MHC-B and -C was marked by extensive type I functional divergence (site-specific rate shift; a = 9.9E-22) as well as more limited type II functional divergence (shift of clusterspecific amino acid property; a = 0.048) ( Figure S7A ). Of eighteen locus-specific sites detected, sixteen are in the a1 domain, nine of them (including three of the four with strongest support) within residues 66-76 of the a1 helix ( Figure 7D ) [49] , the segment recombined in forming B*46 [50] . Type I functional divergence was greater in MHC-C (nine positions, including the four with the strongest confidence) than MHC-B (five positions). The nine Cspecific positions are fixed in MHC-C but variable in MHC-B and Old World monkey MHC-B/C. Thus during evolution of MHC-C to become the major ligand for lineage III KIR, functionally favorable residues were fixed at positions throughout the a1 helix ( Figure 7D ). Conversely, eleven positions exhibiting low type I divergence distribute evenly between the a1 and a2 domains, all but one being highly variable peptide-binding residues.

Type II functional divergence was more limited and equally distributed between MHC-B and -C (two positions each). Notably, however, this divergence included the valine to glutamate change at position 76 in the a1 domain of MHC-B ( Figure 6B and Figure 7D ). Overall, functional divergence of MHC-B and -C focused on the a1 helix, while maintaining similarity in the peptide-binding site. Consequently, the localized recombination that introduced residues 66-76 from HLA-C, conferred several Clike functions and selective advantage to the recombinant B*46 allotype [44, 51] .

Since their ancestors separated 6.5-10 million years ago, human and chimpanzee acquired major differences in KIR haplotype structure and gene content. These differences arose from specializations evolved on the human line. For chimpanzee KIR haplotypes, variable gene content is confined to the centromeric region, where ten KIR genes are variably found, leaving the telomeric region empty. During human evolution the telomeric region was 'colonized' to create a second region of gene content variability. As a consequence of this reorganization, symmetrical recombination between the centromeric and telomeric regions has evolved to be a major mechanism for diversifying KIR haplotypes in humans [26] but not in chimpanzees.

A second major human-specific specialization has been to fix mutations reducing the avidity of activating KIR for HLA class I, while retaining high-avidity inhibitory KIR. This process is most striking for the lineage III KIR that comprise receptors for MHC-C, the form of MHC class I molecule that became the major source of KIR ligands (the C1 and C2 epitopes) in the course of hominid evolution. Chimpanzees have eight lineage III KIR with no human equivalents, all of which encode high-avidity activating or inhibitory receptors for C1 or C2 [27, 28] . In contrast the six human lineage III KIR with no chimpanzee counterparts encode high-avidity inhibitory receptors for C1 and C2 and four activating receptors, which acquired mutations that caused three to lose avidity for HLA-C completely and one to have it reduced [29] .

The major consequence of these two specializations is that humans evolved two distinctive KIR haplotype groups, A and B, that are under balancing selection, present in all populations, and differently associated with disease [17] . In contrast, chimpanzee KIR haplotypes are variations on a theme emphasizing multiple and variable high-avidity C1 and C2 receptors. The character of the A haplotypes is closer to that of the chimpanzee KIR haplotypes: they have genes encoding high-avidity inhibitory C1, C2 and Bw4 receptors and lack their attenuated activating counterparts. In contrast, B haplotypes carry genes for the attenuated activating receptors and distinctive variants of the inhibitory receptors. Disease associations suggest a basis for the balancing selection, in that A haplotypes favor successful antiviral defense, whereas maternal B haplotypes favor successful reproduction [10] . Consistent with the evolutionary plasticity of viruses and other pathogens, the A haplotype KIR genes are more polymorphic than their B haplotype counterparts [52] , as is also seen for chimpanzee KIR haplotypes. In this context, humanspecific evolution of group B KIR haplotypes can be seen as an adaptation to life-threatening complications of pregnancy, such as pre-eclampsia and eclampsia, which have not affected the chimpanzee. For example, these hypertensive conditions could have arisen from imbalance between the supply and increased demands on maternal blood caused by selection to increase the size of the neonatal human brain, to double that of the chimpanzee [53] .

A third human-specific specialization has been the decreasing use of MHC-B allotypes as ligands for lineage III KIR. C1 originated in a molecule resembling MHC-B, which with duplication and differentiation led to the modern MHC-B and -C [54] . Whereas 22% of chimpanzee MHC-B allotypes retain C1, Figure 5 ) are marked in red in the KIR2DL2-HLA-Cw3 three-dimensional structure (PDB file 1EFX [34] represented).

For the cytoplasmic tail analyses all the sequences with an early termination (short tail KIR) were excluded. In addition, because of the risk of recombination between exon 7 and exon 8 (see Figure 3C ) a reduced dataset was also created (CYT-R) where the nine amino acids encoded by exon 7 were discarded and the Pt-KIR2DL9 amino acids encoded by exon 8 were masked. Similarly, because the cytoplasmic tail of KIR2DL3*007 and the D2 domain of KIR2DL1*004 showed evidence of gene conversion, additional analyses were performed where these sequences were discarded: datasets CYT-R2 and D2-R, respectively. 2DL, two times the difference in likelihood between the models allowing for positive selection (M2a and M8) and the models that do not (null models: M1a, M7 and M8a). The only one rare HLA-B allotype, B*73, has retained C1 and the capacity to bind KIR2DL2/3 [46] . Thus the trend for much of human evolution has been for HLA-C to become the exclusive source of ligands for lineage III KIR, potentially reducing competition between NK-cell KIR and T-cell receptors, which have overlapping binding sites on HLA class I [33, 34] . In this significance level (a) is indicated when the null models were significantly rejected. NS, not significant. *: a,0.01. When significant evidence of positive diversifying selection was obtained, the residues detected with model M8 were listed (underlined residues: p.0.95; boldened residues: p.0.99; **: p,0.90). (B) Residues observed at the positively selected positions in the D1, D2 and CYT domains. Amino acids unique to one species are highlighted in yellow. In the summary section, amino acids only found on activating KIR are highlighted in red while those only found on inhibitory KIR are highlighted in green. doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1001192.g005 scenario, HLA-C became more specialized in controlling NK cell functions leaving HLA-A and -B to dominate T cell responses. A remarkable reversal of this trend occurred in Southeast Asia during the last ,55-65,000 years [45] , where HLA-B*46, a recombinant allele that carries C1 and functions well as a ligand for KIR2DL2/3 [46] , underwent a selective sweep to become the most frequent HLA-B allele. Resolution of human hepatitis C virus infection was associated with homozygosity for KIR2DL3 and its C1 ligand [55] . The potential benefit of HLA-B*46 is that it allows individuals to express three or four C1-bearing HLA-B and C allotypes. Thus the selective sweep of B*46 could have been driven by epidemic infection caused by a pathogen like the hepatitis C virus that is preferentially resisted by individuals having enhanced representation of C1 and its cognate inhibitory KIR. Interestingly, several reports describe B*46 as a risk factor for various current infectious diseases ( Figure S8 ), illustrating the dynamic nature of these polymorphic genetic factors and the variable pressures placed on them by functions in both immune defense and reproduction.

A panel of 39 individuals was studied; 35 western chimpanzees, two eastern chimpanzees, one central chimpanzee, and one individual of unknown geographical origin. This study was approved by the Stanford University administrative panels on human subjects in medical research and laboratory animal care.

Haplotypes H13 and H2 originate from the RPCI-43 BAC library (individual: Donald) while H8 belongs to the CHORI-251 Figure S7 ). The gray box indicates residues that are in the recombinant region of HLA-B*46. Arrows indicate Peptide [73] , TCR [74] and KIR [33, 34] BAC library (individual: Clint). The final sequence of the H13 haplotype (clone RP43-84K19) has 'finished sequencing' quality (see Text S1 for details). H8 is a previously undescribed haplotype (Genbank accession number: AC155174) sequenced by the Washington University Genome Sequencing Center as part of the chimpanzee genome project. H2 was reported previously [24] .

KIR genes and alleles were named by the KIR Nomenclature Committee [56] . A curated database is available at http://www. ebi.ac.uk/ipd/kir/ [32] .

KIR gene names reflect the structure of the molecules they encode: following 'KIR', the first two characters give the number of Ig-like domains in the molecule (KIR3D have three Ig-like domains for example), and the third character is either a 'L', 'S' or 'P' to indicate 'Long' (inhibitory) or 'Short' (activating) cytoplasmic tails, or a pseudogene, respectively. To simplify the text in this manuscript, the acronym KIR is sometimes omitted.

Based on phylogenetics, the Ig-like domains form three groups: D0 (most membrane distal of KIR3D), D1, and D2 (most membrane proximal). Based on domain structure and phylogenetic comparison, human KIR are seen to form four distinct lineages: KIR of the lineages III (3DL1-2) and V (3DL3) have three Ig-like domains, while KIR of the lineages I (2DL4-5) and III (2DL1-3, 2DS1-5) have two, with D0-D2 and D1-D2 configuration, respectively.

Assessment of the expression and domain structure of the KIR encoded by genes present on the three chimpanzee KIR haplotypes sequenced was performed using peripheral blood mononuclear cells from the two individuals whose genomic DNA was used to construct the BAC libraries RPCI-43 and CHORI-251 (results are summarized in Figure S9 ; see Text S1 for details). Data on the MHC specificity of chimpanzee lineage III KIR are from references [27] and [28] . Changes to the nomenclature of chimpanzee KIR sequences are described in Text S1 and in Figure S10 .

Complete gene sequences were aligned and divided into 14 segments, as previously described [30] . Each segment was analyzed with four methods: Bayesian, maximum-likelihood, neighbor-joining and parsimony. For the lineage III KIR genes, a full gene analysis was performed on all fourteen segments. Additional details are in Text S1.

For five of the 14 KIR (2DL4, 2DL5, 3DL1/2a and b, and 3DL5) , KIR content was determined as previously described [23] , and for the other nine KIR a new typing system was developed. KIR haplotype structures were predicted from genotype data using the HAPLO-IHP program [57] , which was originally designed to reconstruct such haplotypes. Additional details are in Text S1.

To compare genotype diversity in human and chimpanzee, data from human populations from Africa [58] , Europe [59] , and Japan [60] were used. Because the chimpanzee panel has 26 unrelated individuals, human population data were resampled to give population sizes of n = 26. The mean, standard deviation, and 95% confidence interval for the number of genotypes in human populations were obtained from 5,000 such resamplings. Mean and standard error for the pairwise difference between genotypes were estimated using a bootstrap approach, as implemented in MEGA4 [61] . Presence/absence of each of the 14 chimpanzee KIR of Figure 1B was considered a single-nucleotide polymorphism and the bootstrap procedure was used to shuffle the column content (10,000 bootstrap replicates) before pairwise comparisons were performed. Data from the chimpanzee panel were then compared to data obtained from human populations using the same approach [62] .

For chimpanzee KIR, linkage disequilibrium (LD) was investigated from the haplotype data of Figure 1C using DNASP [63] ; significance was assessed using a 2-tailed Fisher's exact test. For human and chimpanzee, we also investigated KIR haplotype structures using KIR2DL5 as a reference. In these analyses, gene linkage to 2DL5 +/2 was estimated for each KIR as a ratio: for example KIR3DS1 is seven times more common on 2DL5A + haplotypes than on 2DL5A 2 haplotypes. All ratios were normalized to account for the difference in frequency between 2DL5 + and 2DL5 2 haplotypes. In the human locus, KIR2DS3/5 can occupy two different genomic locations [64, 65] and linkage between 2DL5 (A or B) and 2DS3/5 was assumed to be absolute, as supported by currently available haplotype sequences. Gene linkage to 2DL5 in human was assessed from Caucasian individuals [66] .

dN/dS (v) ratios were estimated by maximum-likelihood using PAML4 [67] . Three sets of likelihood ratio tests were conducted to compare null models that do not allow v.1 with models that do. Significance was assessed by comparing twice the difference in likelihood between the models (2DL) to a x2 distribution with one or two degrees of freedom. Codons with v.1 were identified using the Bayes Empirical Bayes approach; see Text S1 for details.

A representative set of MHC-B and -C sequences was gathered and phylogenetic analyses conducted using the approach described for the KIR genomic analysis (see Text S1). Ancestral sequence were reconstructed with CODEML of the PAML4 software package [67] , using the marginal reconstruction approach (see Text S1 for details).

Data for the distribution of the MHC-B and -C residues affecting interaction with lineage III KIR in hominoids were compiled using IMGT-HLA and IPD-MHC sequences [32, 68] . In addition, a gorilla MHC-B allotype bearing C1 was identified from analysis of the gorilla shotgun sequences available at the NCBI Trace Archive website (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/ home/), and generated by the Sanger Center as part of the gorilla genome project.

Allele frequencies for C1-bearing HLA-B allotypes are from the Allele Frequency Net Database [69] ; when no population data were available, the country listed in the IMGT-HLA database [68] is given.

The B46 distribution map was generated using the GMT software package [70] and a previously developed script [71] ; for this distribution, only anthropology studies were used, and data from recent migrant populations were discarded when the geographical location of the pre-migration population could not be precisely ascertained.

Type I (site-specific shift of evolutionary rate) and type II (sitespecific shift of amino acid property) functional divergence analyses were performed with DIVERGE2 [72] . For the type I functional divergence analysis a likelihood ratio test was used to test the null hypothesis that the coefficient of functional divergence equals zero: twice the difference in likelihood was compared to a x2 distribution with one degree of freedom. For the type II functional divergence analysis significance was assessed by a twotailed Z-test. Functional divergence-related residues were identified through the use of cutoffs (see Figure S7 for additional details).

Using KIR and HLA phenotypic frequencies (PF) in 33 human populations (see Figure S11 for details) we determined the average number of distinct interactions between HLA-C1/C2 and KIR2DL1-3 (sum of KIR and HLA receptor-ligand pairings) with the following formula: (2DL1 PF *C2 PF )+(2DL2 PF *C2 PF )+ (2DL2 PF *C1 PF )+(2DL3 PF *C1 PF ). For East Asian populations we also added the interaction between HLA-B*46 and KIR2DL2-3: (2DL2 PF *B46 PF )+(2DL3 PF *B46 PF ). An alternative model where the interaction between KIR2DL2 and HLA-C2 was not taken into account was also considered but the results were similar (see Figure S12 ).

In addition to the statistical tests described in individual sections, a binomial distribution was used to assess the probability that the substitutions that recurrently created V76 in HLA-B allotypes always occurred on allotypes with N80 by chance, and the Pearson product-moment was used to study the correlation between KIR and HLA frequencies in human populations. Red squares indicate a segment with no equivalent in the other haplotype. Yellow squares: lack of resolution or trans-species polymorphism (chimpanzee alleles are mixed with orthologs from different species) (panels B-D) or phylogenetic group contains at least three sequences (two from one species and one from the other species) and the relationships between these sequences are not resolved (panels E-F).

Human-specific Evolution and Adaptation led to Major Qualitative Differences in the Variable Receptors of Human and Chimpanzee Natural Killer Cells,Chimpanzee KIR haplotypes.,"Gene sequences were aligned with MAFFT [3] and corrected manually. The alignment was then divided into fourteen segments, as previously described [4] . Each segment was analyzed with four methods:

Bayesian, maximum-likelihood (ML), neighbor-joining (NJ) and parsimony. NJ phylogenetic analysis was performed with MEGA4 [5] using the Maximum Composite Likelihood method with 500 replicates. PAUP*4.0b10 [6] and the tree bisection-reconnection branch swapping algorithm were used for parsimony analyses with 500 replicates and a heuristic search. ML analyses were performed with RAXML7 [7] under the GTR+CAT model with 500 replicates (rapid bootstrapping). For the Bayesian analysis we selected the model of DNA substitution using MODELTEST3.7 [8] and the Akaike information criterion. Bayesian phylogenetic analyses used MRBAYES3.1.2 [9] ; sampling was performed with one cold chain and three heated chains, which were run for 2,000,000 generations. Trees were sampled every 250 generations and the first 4,000 trees were discarded before a consensus tree was generated. In all analyses the average standard deviation of split frequencies for the three runs was <0.01.

Recombination breakpoints in chimpanzees were identified using RDP [10] and confirmed by phylogenetic analyses and alignment inspection.

For the lineage III KIR genes, a full gene analysis was performed on all fourteen segments; the Pt-KIR3DS6 genomic sequence used in this analysis was obtained from the assembly of the chimpanzee genome available from the UCSC genome browser (March 2006 build; http://genome.ucsc.edu). This sequence lacks only ~1.5kb at the end of the gene (approximately the region from intron 7 to the 3'UTR).

Pt-KIR3DL1/2 and Pt-KIR3DL3 were renamed Pt-KIR3DL1/2a and Pt-KIR3DL1/2b, respectively, an allelic relationship supported both by segregation analyses [1] and by sequencing ( Figure 1A ). This change also eliminates confusion between this telomeric framework gene of the chimpanzee KIR locus (now named Pt-KIR3DL1/2) and KIR3DL3 the centromeric framework gene of the human KIR locus.

Consistent with this rationalization, Pt-KIRC1, the centromeric framework gene of the chimpanzee KIR locus and orthologous to human KIR3DL3 in the five exons encoding leader sequence and Ig domains was renamed Pt-KIR3DL3. The sequence characterized as Pt-KIR3DL6 in an analysis of KIR cDNA sequences in chimpanzees [1] was renamed Pt-KIR3DS6 following re-analysis of the cytoplasmic tail sequence of this KIR, as described in the following section.

While investigating KIR expression in chimpanzee Clint (see paragraph 'KIR expression study'), a KIR was identified that had sequence identical to that of the Pt-KIR3DL6 cDNA [1] except for insertion of one base pair at the end of exon 7. This inserted adenosine, part of a run of eight adenosines, changed the reading frame, leading to an early stop codon and loss of the two ITIM in the cytoplasmic tail of Pt-KIR3DL6. Because this sequence encodes an activating receptor it was named Pt-KIR3DS6 ( Figure   S10A ). An independent observation of Pt-KIR3DS6 has been made (Genbank accession numbers with the latter likely being artifacts of PCR slippage [11] .

Because Pt-KIR3DS6 is the only KIR not represented in the three sequenced haplotypes of Figure Eve revealed a sequence related to Pt-KIR3DL4 and 3DS2 but these sequences could not be unambiguously assigned to one particular group without the sequence of exons encoding the transmembrane and cytoplasmic tail. For Lucas and Duff, for whom peripheral blood mononuclear cells were available, KIR cDNA sequences were amplified as described in the 'KIR expression study' section above. This analysis showed that both individuals have 3DS2, but the alleles were highly related to Pt-KIR3DL4 for the 5' exons (encoding extracellular domains) and to Pt-KIR2DS4 for the 3' exons (encoding transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains). However, these novel 3DS2 sequences shared unique substitutions with previously characterized 3DS2 sequences in exon 6, encoding the Stem.

Because these single-nucleotide polymorphisms appeared unique to Pt-KIR3DS2, this property was used to design a 'Nested' primer set. 

The sequence-specific primer (SSP) method was used. Pt-KIR2DL4, 2DL5, 3DL1/2a and b, and 3DL5

were typed using the primers previously described [1] , new primers were developed for the other nine

with the same primer set or with a different primer set; when positive reactions were observed with one primer set but not with a second, the products were cloned and sequenced to confirm the specificity.

When possible, primer sets were combined to produce a single set that amplifies all alleles of the targeted KIR. Unless otherwise mentioned, all the new PCR amplifications used the following cycling parameters: initial denaturation at 95°C for 3min, then 32 cycles with a denaturation at 95°C for 20sec, an annealing at 63°C for 45sec, and an extension at 72°C for 2min. 

Reconstruction of haplotype structures from genotype data was performed with HAPLO-IHP [12] . For this analysis, genotypic data were used: from the 39 individuals of Figure 1B , as well as the three reference haplotypes of Figure 1A . Pt-KIR3DL3, 2DL4 and 3DL1/2 were set as framework genes. The two KIR haplotypes of Donald (a member of the panel) were fully sequenced so his KIR genotype was entered with inclusion of the copy number for each KIR. Sequences of two Pt-KIR3DL4 alleles defined by cDNA clones obtained from chimpanzee Lucas were also included.

Since none of the three sequenced chimpanzee haplotypes have all 13 KIR genes, the relative position of some KIR genes is ambiguous: first, the position of Pt-KIR3DL5 is not known when it belongs to a haplotype with 3DL4 and/or with 2DS4-2DL7; second, the position of 3DS6-2DL6 is not known when they belong to haplotypes with 3DS2-2DL9. The gene order used in Figures 1 and 2 is thus arbitrary for these KIR.

For the MHC sequence analysis, we gathered all non-human hominoid MHC-B and -C and non-macaque

Old World monkey MHC-B sequences from the IPD-MHC database [13] . Human sequences were 9 obtained from the IMGT/HLA database [14] and included one to three sequences for each HLA-B and -C sublineage as well as all HLA-B alleles encoding allotypes with V76. Macaque sequences were obtained from studies in Macaca mulatta [15] and Macaca fascicularis [16] . MHC-E sequences were used as the outgroup. Sequences with recombinant or missing segments in the α1 or α2 were excluded, recombinant α3 domains were masked. Alignment of the α1, α2 and α3 domains and phylogenetic analyses were conducted as described for KIR genomic analyses. For the Bayesian analysis three independent long runs were performed (10,000,000 generations) and the final average standard deviation of split frequencies was <0.04.

Ancestral sequences were reconstructed with CODEML of the PAML4 software package [17] , using the marginal reconstruction approach. Two codon models were used for this analysis: M0, the simplest model (implements a single dN/dS rate), and M2a, a model allowing for positive selection (three dN/dS categories). Analysis was first performed with the simplest model (M0), and when nodes were not fully resolved by M0 (p>0.95), reconstruction was also performed with model M2a.

For selection analyses, dN/dS (ω) ratios were estimated by maximum likelihood using PAML4 [17] with the F3X4 model of codon frequencies. ML tree topologies (generated using the approach described in the 'KIR Genomic Analyses') were used for these analyses and three sets of likelihood ratio tests were conducted to compare null models that do not allow ω>1 (M1a, M7 and M8a) with models that do (M2a and M8). Significance was assessed by comparing twice the difference in likelihood between the models (2ΔL) to a χ2 distribution with one (M8a/M8) or two (M1a/M2 and M7/M8) degrees of freedom.

Codons with ω>1 were identified using the Bayes Empirical Bayes approach [18] . Positively selected positions in D1 and D2 were marked in the KIR2DL2-HLA-Cw3 three-dimensional structure (PDB file 1EFX [19] ) using the software PyMOL [20] .

"Astrovirus infections in humans and animals -Molecular biology, genetic diversity, and interspecies transmissions","Astroviruses are small, non-enveloped, positive sense, single-stranded RNA viruses first identified in 1975 in children suffering from diarrhea and then described in a wide variety of animals. To date, the list of animal species susceptible to astrovirus infection has expanded to 22 animal species or families, including domestic, synantropic and wild animals, avian, and mammalian species in the terrestrial and aquatic environments. Astrovirus infections are considered among the most common cause of gastroenteritis in children, second only to rotavirus infections, but in animals their association with enteric diseases is not well documented, with the exception of turkey and mink astrovirus infection. Genetic variability has been described in almost all astrovirus species sufficiently examined infecting mammals and birds; however, antigenic variability has been demonstrated for human astroviruses but is far less investigated in animal viruses. Interestingly, there is an increasing evidence of recombination events occurring in astroviruses, which contributes to increase the genetic variability of this group of viruses. A wide variety of species infected, the evident virus genetic diversity and the occurrence of recombination events indicate or imply either cross-species transmission and subsequent virus adaptation to new hosts or the co -infection of the same host with different astroviruses. This can also favor the emergence of novel astroviruses infecting animals or with a zoonotic potential. After more than 30 years from their first description in humans, there are many exciting streams of research to be explored and intriguing questions that remain to be answered about the relatively under-studied Astroviridae family. In the present work, we will review the existing knowledge concerning astrovirus infections in humans and animals, with particular focus on the molecular biology, interspecies transmission and zoonotic potential of this group of viruses.","Astroviruses are small, non-enveloped RNA viruses first identified in 1975 by electron microscopy (EM) in children suffering from diarrhea (Appleton and Higgins, 1975; Madeley and Cosgrove, 1975b; Matsui and Greenberg, 1996) . Since then, enteric infections in humans caused by astrovirus have been reported worldwide mainly in infants and young children. Several studies suggest that astroviruses are the second most common cause of gastroenteritis in children after rotavirus infection (Matsui and Greenberg, 1996) .

The name astrovirus derives from the Greek word ''astron'' (=star) and describes the characteristic five/six pointed star-like projections detectable by negative stained EM of the virions. Although it should be pointed out that the presence of these projections is pH dependent and may only be present in less than 10% of the population (Caul and Appleton, 1982; Koci and Schultz-Cherry, 2002) . In fact, in some instances the typical star-like appearance is not easily recognizable in EM preparations and astroviruses could be misidentified as enteroviruses or provisionally named astrovirus-like particles or small round viruses (SRVs) (Guy et al., 2004; Koci and Schultz-Cherry, 2002) . This was probably the case of astrovirus infections in ducks, turkeys, and guinea fowl, where picornavirus or enterovirus-like particles were initially described (Cattoli et al., 2005; Guy et al., 2004; Koci and Schultz-Cherry, 2002) . For this reason, the advent of more specific tools for virus detection and genome-based identification in the last ten years has allowed the discovery or the confirmation of the presence of astroviruses in a number of different hosts.

Soon after the first description in human beings, astrovirus-like particles were described and reported in domesticated animals. The first reports in animals were from lambs and calves suffering from diarrhea (Snodgrass and Gray, 1977; Woode and Bridger, 1978) . Based on clinical and virological observations during acute mortality cases in ducks in the 1980s, the presence of astrovirus was associated with fatal hepatitis (Gough et al., 1984) . This was perhaps the first evidence of extra-intestinal localization of astroviruses. Of interest, similar acute duck hepatitis was also reported in the 1960s, one decade before the discovery of astrovirus in humans and 20 years before identification of astroviruses as the cause of hepatitis in ducks (Asplin, 1965a,b) . At present, the list of animal species susceptible to astrovirus infection has expanded to include domestic, synantropic and wild animals, avian and mammalian species in the terrestrial and aquatic environments (Table 1 ). In the last decade, there has been a dramatic increase in the identification of astroviruses in new animal species due to the advent of better molecular assays and pathogen discovery tools. This list is likely to be far from complete and surely more astrovirussusceptible hosts are going to be added in the near future.

In the present work, we will review the existing knowledge concerning astrovirus infections in humans and animals, with particular focus on molecular biology, interspecies transmission and zoonotic potential of this group of viruses.

The family Astroviridae comprises non-enveloped, positive sense, single-stranded RNA viruses, typically 28-30 nm in diameter (Matsui and Greenberg, 1996) . They have been classified into two genera, namely Mamastroviruses (MAstVs) and Avastroviruses (AAstVs) known to infect mammalian and avian species, respectively (Mendez and Arias, 2007) . Few species are officially classified by the International Committee for Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV). These are: duck astrovirus 1 (DAstV-1), turkey astrovirus 1 and 2 (TAstV-1 and TAstV-2), and avian nephritis virus (ANV) as AAstVs, bovine astrovirus (BoAstV), feline astrovirus (FeAstV), human astroviruses (HAstVs 1-8), ovine astrovirus (OAstV), mink astrovirus (MiAstV), and porcine astrovirus (PoAstV) as MAstrVs.

The genome length is 6.8 to 7.9 kb and includes a 5 0 untranslated region (UTR), followed by three open reading frames (ORFs) namely ORF1a, ORF1b, and ORF2, a 3 0 UTR and a poly-A tail. There is a frame-shift structure between ORF1a and ORF1b. ORF1 encodes both a protease and an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. ORF2 is expressed from a subgenomic RNA and encodes for the viral capsid protein (Fig. 1) . The length of each of these structures varies between species and serotypes. From a genetic point of view, ORF1b appears to be the least divergent and ORF2 the most divergent among the different ORFs (Strain et al., 2008) . This is of course an expected event since the region encoding for the viral capsid protein is more subject to selective pressure if compared to regions encoding for non-structural proteins. Unfortunately, only a minimal number of complete genomic astrovirus sequences are available (Table 2) .

To date, Astroviridae taxonomy takes into account the species of origin. Serotypes have been defined on the basis of twenty-fold, or greater, two-way cross-neutralization titers. Serotypes assigned to the species are given consecutive numbers (Lee and Kurtz, 1982; Mendez and Arias, 2007) . Astroviruses do not easily grow in laboratory host systems and for this reason serological classification is difficult and is generally speculated based on percentage of nucleotide and amino acid similarity of the ORF2 encoding for the capsid protein (Chu et al., 2008; Koci et al., 2000; Reuter et al., 2011) . It has been reported that if two strains of HAstVs have less than 95% homology at the nucleotide level, they are serologically distinguishable (Walter et al., 2001) . Few documented antigenic classifications have been attempted for animal AstVs. Serological assays confirmed by molecular characterization, suggested the existence of a putative novel serotype of turkey astrovirus, TAstV-3 (Tang and Saif, 2004; Tang et al., 2005) ; similarly the application of cross-virus neutralization assays indicated the presence of more undefined serotypes of bovine AstV (Woode et al., 1985) .

Although official classification is currently based on the species of origin of AstV, the discovery of viruses in species never implicated before and of viruses genetically unrelated to those known to infect the same species has highlighted the need to review classification of those viruses following updated guidelines. Several AstVs have recently been detected in new species, namely guinea fowl, insectivorous bats, dogs, cheetahs, marine mammals, and brown rats (Atkins et al., 2009; Cattoli et al., 2005; Chu et al., 2008 Chu et al., , 2010 Rivera et al., 2010; Toffan et al., 2009; Zhu et al., 2009 ). In humans, eight so-called ''Classic'' serotypes of astrovirus-es genetically related are known (HAstV1-8), and new species have recently been found in stool samples from patients suffering from gastroenteritis, namely AstV-MLB1 and MLB-2 which are geneti- Table 1 Chronology of astroviruses discovered, year of first prototype detection and in vitro isolation information.

(1985) Primary bovine embryo kidney cells ( Though variable in length among the Astroviridae family, the genome architecture of Astroviruses is similar. For Human Astrovirus-1, the genome is 6.8 kilobases (kb) in length. It contains a 5 0 untranslated region (UTR) of 85 nt, a 3 0 UTR of 83 nt, and a poly(A) tail. After deposition of the viral genome into the cytoplasm ORF1a is immediately translated to produce the nonstructural proteins. Combination of a slippery (A) 6 C sequence and downstream structural hairpin contribute to a À1 ribosomal frame shift resulting in translation of the nonstructural polyprotein ORF1ab encoding the RNA dependent RNA polymerase. The subgenomic RNA is 2.4 kb in length and contains a 5 0 UTR, 3 0 UTR, a poly(A) tail and is transcribed from an internal promoter in the minus strand. ORF2 is translated from the subgenomic RNA to produce the structural proteins. cally close to rat astroviruses discovered in Hong Kong (Chu et al., 2010; Finkbeiner et al., 2008b Finkbeiner et al., , 2009a , and HAstVs genetically related to MiAstVs and OAstVs, thus called human, mink-, and ovinelike, HMOAstVs A, B, and C and AstV-VA1 (Finkbeiner et al., 2009b; Kapoor et al., 2009) . Based on new findings, two proposals for re-classifications of Astroviridae were submitted in 2010 by the Astroviridae Study Group (Bosch et al., 2010a,b) . They both take into consideration genetic criteria based on the full length sequencing of ORF2 (Fig. 2) . According to the proposals, three new species of Avastroviruses and nineteen new species of Mamastroviruses have ben recognized. These include Avastrovirus GI.A (current TAstV-1), GI.B (current ANV-1 and -2) and GII.A (current TAstV-2, and DAstV).

Generally speaking, MAstVs (except HAstV-8) have an overlap of approximately eight nucleotides (nts) between the stop codon of ORF1b and the start codon of ORF2, which is in the same frame of ORF1a. AAstVs differ from this genome structure. The start codon for ORF2 of ANV is 19 nts downstream of the stop codon of ORF1b and ORF2 is maintained at the same frame of ORF1a. For

TAstV-1 and TAstV-2, the space between the ORF1b and ORF2 is 18 nts and the ORF2 is in the same frame of ORF1b. In DAstV, ORF2 is placed at a different frame than ORF1a or ORF1b, with a start codon 23 nt downstream of the stop codon of ORF1b. Another difference among astroviruses is placed at the 3 0 end of ORF2 and the 3 0 UTR, where there is a conserved motif of 19 nts, likely encoding for a secondary structure, and which is present in most astroviruses except for TastV-2, PoAstVs belonging to group II Table 2 . The phylogenetic tree was obtained using the Neighbor-Joining method and MEGA4 software. according to Luo et al. (2011) , BatAstVs and RatAstVs (Chu et al., 2008 (Chu et al., , 2010 Jonassen et al., 2003) .

The difficulty of astrovirus to grow in common laboratory hosts systems prevented early characterization, but in 1981 Lee and Kurtz demonstrated productive virus growth and passaging with the addition of trypsin in human kidney epithelial (HEK) cells (Lee and Kurtz, 1981) . It was not until 1990 that this technique was applied to a more representative cell line; the human colon carcinoma cell line Caco2, which has become standard (Willcocks et al., 1990) . The complete genome sequence for Human Astrovirus 1 was determined in 1994 and the first infectious cDNA clone was developed in 1997 (Geigenmuller et al., 1997; Willcocks et al., 1994) . Basic research of astrovirus replication and viral protein functions are expanding, but much information is inferred from the large body of work on other positive-strand viruses, including alphaviruses and picornoviruses (Racaniello, 2001; Sondra Schlesinger, 2001; Strauss and Strauss, 1994) or derived from studies of the human astroviruses.

Very little is known about astrovirus attachment and entry. The receptor for virus entry is unknown. The same cell line can be permissive and refractory to different subtypes of HAstV and this suggests different receptor requirements for the various subtypes (Brinker et al., 2000) . Caco2 cells support infection by HAstV1-8 subtypes, while another human colon carcinoma cell line only minimally supports infection by HAstV1. When transfected with an infectious in vitro transcribed astrovirus genomic RNA, baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells support virus replication but are refractory to infection by the whole virus, suggesting they lack the appropriate cell surface receptor (Geigenmuller et al., 1997) . The variances between virus subtypes and cell lines susceptible to infection suggest there may be multiple receptor requirements.

Early studies with HAstV-1 in Graham 293 cells demonstrated the presence of astrovirus particles in coated pits and later in coated vesicles, suggesting adsorptive endocytosis as a possible mechanism by which astrovirus enters the cells. This was supported by inhibition of viral entry with endocytic inhibitors (Donelli et al., 1992) . Once internalized, the plus-strand genome is released into the cytoplasm by unknown mechanisms and ORF1a and 1b are immediately translated by the host machinery. ORF1a is $2.8 kb encoding a $110 kDa polypeptide (Matsui and Greenberg, 1996) (see Fig. 1 ). The polypeptide contains a variety of conserved motifs, including several putative transmembrane helices, coiled coil domains, an immunoreactive epitope, putative nuclear localization signal (NLS), and serine protease (Guix et al., 2004; Matsui et al., 1993) . The translated polypeptide is cleaved by both cellular protease(s) and the viral protease into at least five peptides (Geigenmuller et al., 2002; Guix et al., 2005; Kiang and Matsui, 2002) . The structure of the astrovirus protease has recently been solved and several unique features defined, which differentiate it from other human and viral serine proteases (Speroni et al., 2009) . The function of the remaining non-structural proteins (NSP) remains largely unknown. The transmembrane domains may localize nsp1a/2 to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane to facilitate replication (Guix et al., 2004) similar to other positivestrand RNA viruses (Ahlquist, 2006; Geigenmuller et al., 2002; Guix et al., 2004 Guix et al., , 2005 Kiang and Matsui, 2002; Speroni et al., 2009) . One peptide, nsp1a/41a, co-localizes with the viral RNA at the ER membrane (Guix et al., 2004) ; mutations in nsp1a/4 correlate with increased viral titers in vitro and in vivo (Guix et al., 2005) suggesting a role for this protein in viral replication. This peptide was recently shown to contain a hypervariable region that can be phosphorylated, form oligomers and interact with the viral poly-merase supporting its importance to productive viral replication (Fuentes et al., 2011) . There is relatively little information on the regulation of astrovirus replication by cellular factors. One study demonstrated that the astrovirus activates the cellular extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 pathway early in infection independently of replication. Inhibition of ERK1/2 activity resulted in decreased viral replication early in the course of infection (Moser and Schultz-Cherry, 2008).

The second reading frame, ORF1b, which encodes the viral RNAdependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) (Matsui and Greenberg, 1996) , overlaps ORF1a by 70 nucleotides and is translated by a frame-shift into the À1 frame and is a common mechanism, though not unique, among plus-stranded animal RNA viruses (Lewis and Matsui, 1996) . It requires a highly conserved heptameric sequence (A 6 C) and a downstream hairpin structure (Lewis and Matsui, 1995 Marczinke et al., 1994 ) (see Fig. 1 ). This event results in an ORF1a/1b fusion peptide, which is further cleaved near the 1a/1b border and occurs between 7% (in vitro) to 25% (in vivo) of the time (Lewis and Matsui, 1997) . Astrovirus polymerase is a supergroup 1 RdRp (Lewis et al., 1994) , a group which utilizes a viral-encoded primer attached to the genome (VPg) to initiate transcription (Jang et al., 2010) . VPg is believed to exist (Al-Mutairy et al., 2005) although this hypothesis has yet to be confirmed (Carter and Willcocks, 1996) . Further, there is no evidence of a viral helicase.

The expression of the RdRp results in production of a minusstrand viral template between 9 and 12 h post-infection (hpi) (Jang et al., 2010) , which generates multiple copies of the plus strand genome and a poly-adenylated subgenomic RNA (sgRNA) containing short 5 0 and 3 0 UTRs and ORF2 (Monroe et al., 1993) . ORF2, which encodes the structural or capsid protein, is in the zero frame and overlaps ORF1b slightly (see Fig. 1 ). Production of the capsid protein from a sgRNA restricts capsid production in the viral replication cycle and allows for an estimated 10-fold excess of capsid to the viral genome by 12 hpi. The sgRNA is about 2.4 kb and encodes the capsid precursor polypeptide of 87-90 kDa (Monroe et al., 1993) . The capsid contains at least three domains including a highly conserved 5 0 terminal domain, a highly divergent intermediate domain, and the 3 0 variable end domain all of which can be distinguished by their sequence identity. Intracellular proteolytic processing by cellular proteases including caspases (Banos-Lara Mdel and Mendez, 2010; Mendez et al., 2002 yields an $70-80 kDa protein, which is further extracellularly cleaved by trypsin increasing infectivity up to 10 5 fold, condensing the virion to approximately 28 nm, and transforming the $70-80 kDa capsid protein into at least three smaller peptides of approximately 34, 29, and 26 kDa (Bass and Qiu, 2000) . Positive sense genomes are packaged into these viral-like particles (VLPs), likely through interactions with the first 70 amino acids of the capsid protein, which is highly basic (Carter and Willcocks, 1996) .

The astrovirus capsid protein has several unique biological properties. It has been shown to be a unique inhibitor of the complement pathway by binding to complement C1 and mannosebinding lectin (MBL) inhibiting the activation of the classical and lectin complement pathways, respectively (Bonaparte et al., 2008; Gronemus et al., 2010; Hair et al., 2010; ) . This was the first description of a non-enveloped icosahedral virus inhibiting complement. However, the importance of this finding during astrovirus infection remains unknown. Another unique feature of the astrovirus capsid protein is its potential action as an enterotoxin. Studies by Moser et al. (2007) demonstrated that astroviruses increase epithelial barrier permeability by disrupting cellular tight junction complexes (Moser et al., 2007) . This increase in barrier permeability was independent from viral replication. Recombinant capsid alone was sufficient suggesting that the capsid may contribute to diarrhea in vivo.

Overall, a great deal of work is still needed to understand astrovirus replication. Particularly in relation to the cellular factors required for productive replication, the role of the individual NSPs in replication and controlling cellular functions, and a better understanding of the processing of the capsid protein. One major unanswered question is how the astrovirus is released from the cell without inducing cell death.

HAstVs predominately affect children under the age of 2, elderly people and immunocompromised individuals and are thought to be involved in up to 20% of the cases of sporadic non-bacterial diarrheas and 0.5-15% of diarrheal outbreaks (Kirkwood et al., 2005; Moser and Schultz-Cherry, 2005) . Upon infection, clinical symptoms normally last between 2 to 4 days and consist of watery diarrhea and less commonly vomiting, headache, fever, abdominal pain and anorexia (Glass et al., 1996 (Glass et al., , 2001 LeBaron et al., 1990; Mitchell et al., 1999) . However, there is evidence that HAstV infections can be asymptomatic in children and adults (Mendez-Toss et al., 2004 ). An interesting study by Quan et al. (2010) suggested that human astroviruses may be able to go systemic when authors detected for the first time HAstV as the causative agent for encephalitis in an immunocompromised child, which has led to important new questions about this HAstV-associated disease, mainly in the immunocompromised patient (Quan et al., 2010) .

The prevalence of HAstV depends on the region and test settings (urban hospital versus child care center, etc.). However, most studies report a prevalence rate up to 10% in most areas (range of 2-9%) with rates as high as 30% in some developing countries (De Grazia et al., 2011; Guix et al., 2002) . Several extensive epidemiological studies suggested that the maximum detection rate for HAstV was in children from 2 to 4 years of age with the highest rates of infection in the winter months in temperate climates (De Grazia et al., 2011; Guix et al., 2002) , although, HAstV can be detected in the spring and summer seasons as well (Herrmann et al., 1991; Noel and Cubitt, 1994) . It is not unusual to find HAstV in association with other enteric viruses. Several studies suggest that 33-65% of symptomatic HAstV infection may be associated to other enteric microbes like rotavirus and norovirus (Colomba et al., 2006; Roman et al., 2003) . A study in Spain showed a slightly less incidence of co-infections with only 17% of the HAstV positive cases associated with other pathogens (Guix et al., 2002) . Regardless, HAstV appears to be a significant cause of gastroenteritis, especially in young children.

Until 2008, human infections were thought to be limited to eight closely related HAstV genotypes now referred to as the ''Classic'' human astroviruses. In several cases these genotypes were detected and initially differentiated using a set of conserved primers to the ORF1b termed Mon269 (5 0 CAACTCAGGAAACAGGGTGT) and Mon270 (5 0 TCAGATGCATTGTCATTGGT) (Noel et al., 1995) . HAstV-1 appears to be the predominant circulating serotype worldwide followed by types 2-5 and occasionally 8 depending on the region. HAstV-6 and 7 are rarely detected (De Grazia et al., 2011; Gabbay et al., 2007; Guix et al., 2002; Liu et al., 2008; Mendez-Toss et al., 2004; Mustafa et al., 2000; Palombo and Bishop, 1996) . There is a great deal of diversity within each of the different genotypes. Two studies of the beginning of year 2000 suggested that a variant could be considered a new subtype if identity was less than 95% nucleotide homology to a reference strain and >0.05 distance by phylogenetic analysis at the 3 0 end of ORF2 (Jakab et al., 2003; Walter et al., 2001) . Others proposed that strains showing a sequence diversity of at least 7% could be considered as new lineages (Guix et al., 2002; Medina et al., 2000) . Based on these suggestions, HAstV-1 has been divided into a least six lineages, HAstV-1a-1f (Gabbay et al., 2007) ; HAstV-2 into at least three lineages, HAstV-2a-2c (De Grazia et al., 2011; Gabbay et al., 2007) ; HAstV-3 into two lineages (Belliot et al., 1997a,b; Liu et al., 2008) ; and HAstV-4 into two lineages, 4a and 4b. To date there is no information on the association between disease symptoms and HAstV genotype, except for one study which suggests that HAstV-3 may be associated to more severe gastroenteritis and higher fecal viral titers if/when compared to the other genotypes (Caballero et al., 2003) . This very interesting work also demonstrated that astroviruses can result in persistent infections, some lasting up to 3 months, and described a quantitative RT-PCR assay to detect the HAstV genomes per gram of feces (Caballero et al., 2003) .

The advent of pyrosequencing and pathogen discovery demonstrates that the human stool contains a variety of previously unrecognized astroviruses. A seminal paper by Finkbeiner et al. (2008a) used metagenomic analysis to identify a new genotype of HAstV in the feces of a young boy from Melbourne, Australia with acute diarrhea (Finkbeiner et al., 2008a) . They termed the virus MLB1 (AstV-MLB1) and went onto characterize the genome, demonstrating that AstV-MLB1 was highly divergent from any of the known astroviruses (Finkbeiner et al., 2008b) . AstV-MLB1 lacks much of the conservation typically seen between HAstV 1-8 in the nontranslated regions of the genome, for example in the 5 0 and 3 0 non-translated regions and the ORF1b/2 junction, suggesting that this is a new genogroup within the Mamastrovirus I family. Further studies have demonstrated that AstV-MLB1 is widely distributed and that, just as in the classic HAstV, there is heterogeneity within the group (Finkbeiner et al., 2009a, c) . Of great interest is the molecular dating analysis on the ORF1b region, which suggests that the newly discovered rat astrovirus may share a common ancestor with AstV-MLB1 with an estimated date of AD 1054 (Chu et al., 2010) . Unfortunately, due to the lack of available sequence data, the evolutionary history of astroviruses remains unknown.

By using similar pathogen discovery techniques, the same group discovered and characterized AstV-VA1 during a sporadic diarrheal disease outbreak in Virginia (Finkbeiner et al., 2009b) and demonstrated diversity within the AstV-VA1 genogroup (Finkbeiner et al., 2009c) . During this time, a separate group also identified three novel human astrovirus species from adult travellers using pan-astrovirus specific primers to ORF1b that were phylogenetically related to each other with the closest genetic relatives being mink and ovine (Kapoor et al., 2009) . Thus, they were named human, mink, and ovine-like HMOAstV types A, B, and C. Intriguingly, AstV-VA1 is closely related to HMOAstV-C. There AstV-VA and HMOAstV viruses are quite distinct from the classic HAstV and AstV-MLB viruses and cluster within the Mamastrovirus II family. Important for surveillance purposes, Finkbeiner et al. (2009c) developed conserved primers to the ORF1b that should detect all human astrovirus genogroups (Finkbeiner et al., 2009c) .

It is evident that there are at least three clades of astroviruses co-circulating in humans: Classic, MLB1-like and VA1-like. Coinfection by two different genotypes in one person provides an opportunity for recombination to occur. Indeed, there has been evidence of recombination within the classic HAstV stains (Walter et al., 2001; Wolfaardt et al., 2011) .

Astrovirus infection in lambs probably represents the first report confirming the occurrence of astrovirus infections in animals and was described in 1977 shortly after the description of astroviruses in humans (Snodgrass and Gray, 1977) . Studies on pathogenesis of OAstV in lambs demonstrates that it replicates in the absorptive epithelial cells of the small intestine and induces mild diarrhea in gnotobiotic lambs (Gray et al., 1980; Snodgrass et al., 1979) . OastV does not seem to play a crucial role in the ovine viral enteritis since no further case reports or studies have followed after the first identification. As a consequence, the epidemiology of OAstV is unknown; the same for the serological or genetic diversity and only the complete genome sequence of the original isolate is available in the public genetic database (GenBank, http:// www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov; Table 2 ). Nevertheless, this OAstV genome has been extensively analyzed as a prototype Mamastrovirus (Jonassen et al., 2003) , and found to harbor, as most of known Ast-Vs, a RNA motif in the 3 0 end of the genome common to distinct and genetically different virus families (i.e. Coronaviruses and Picornaviruses) and supposed to be representative of a recombination event between these viruses (Jonassen et al., 1998) . Recent findings concerning novel astroviruses detected in human stools and genetically closely related to OAstV and MiAstV, have suggested the possibility for these viruses to have a common ancestor, as assumed for the previously described HAstVs, FeAstVs, and PoAstVs (Finkbeiner et al., 2009b; Jonassen et al., 1998; Kapoor et al., 2009; Quan et al., 2010) .

The first isolate of bovine astrovirus was reported in England in 1978 (Woode and Bridger, 1978) . Astrovirus was considered to be avirulent, as experimentally infected gnotobiotic calves remained clinically normal, although pathological studies on infected calves were not performed. Subsequently, a bovine enteric virus antigenically related to the UK strain of BoAstV was isolated in Florida from a calf with diarrhea (Woode et al., 1984) . Although calves experimentally infected with this astrovirus did not develop clinical disease, the virus caused cytopathology of the M cells of the dome epithelium covering the Peyer's patches (Woode et al., 1984) . Similarly to OAstV, the limited clinical significance initially attributed to BoAstV infection in cattle is probably the reason why there has been a lack of reports for more than 25 years, until 2011 (Tse et al., 2011) . It was originally concluded that in natural conditions, BoAstV does not seem to be directly associated with a severe diarrheic disease in calves (Bridger et al., 1984; Tse et al., 2011; Woode and Bridger, 1978; Woode et al., 1984) and few controversial data are available on the prevalence of this infection. In 2010, a study conducted in Europe by Smits et al. (2010) described astrovirus infection in European roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) suffering from gastroenteritis (Smits et al., 2010) . The virus responsible for the infection was further shown to be genetically related to BoAstV, suggesting that this virus could cross the species barrier to infect both cattle and roe deer (Tse et al., 2011) . Although a previous study suggested that BoAstV could be excreted by 60-100% of calves on farms (Bridger et al., 1984) , only 5 out of 209 rectal swabs (2.4%) collected from asymptomatic adult cattle were found positive for BoAstV infection (Tse et al., 2011) . In bovine, two serotypes have been recognized by serological investigation, namely BoAstV-1 and BoAstV-2 (Woode et al., 1985) , and recent phylogenetic analyses support classification of BoAstVs and the newly discovered AstVs in roe deer (CcAstV) under the proposed ''genocluster GI'' of the Mamastrovirus (Bosch et al., 2010b; Smits et al., 2010; Tse et al., 2011) . The antigenic diversity detected in the earlier studies is also reflected in the more recently described genetic diversity for BoAstV. In a recent report, Tse et al. (2011) detected sequences from two different BoAstVs in 2 out of 5 positive specimens (Tse et al., 2011) . This finding is in compliance with other reports on the occurrence of co-infections caused by genetically distinct astroviruses infecting the same host, as was described for pigs (Luo et al., 2011) and is a pre-requisite for recombination between different strains. In the same study, at least one recombination event was identified at the ORF2 between BoAstVs and CcAstVs (Tse et al., 2011) . However, it should be noted that only two partial BoAstV sequences are available in GenBank (Table 2) .

Feline astrovirus was first described in cats in 1981 (Hoshino et al., 1981) . To date, picornavirus-like particles as well as astroviruses from feces of domestic cats have been described in Australia, England, Germany, New Zealand and the USA (Harbour et al., 1987; Herbst and Krauss, 1989; Hoshino et al., 1981; Marshall et al., 1987; Rice et al., 1993) . The impact of AstV infection in cats seems to be low as infection of specific-pathogen free kittens caused two episodes of pyrexia and mild diarrhea (Harbour et al., 1987) . Similarly, in a 16-month study conducted in Australia, the occurrence of astrovirus infection was not related to the age of cats and to the presence of diarrhea (Marshall et al., 1987) . Interestingly, in this study a human serum was found to react against a cat astrovirus by immune electron microscopy, implying similarity in antigenic regions between human and FeAstV (Marshall et al., 1987) . To date, only partial sequences of the ORF1b and of the ORF2 have been deposited in public databases (Table 2) , and feline astrovirus diversity has not been yet explored. Interestingly, a study on both AstV genome sequences and host species evolution has led to the hypothesis of a cross-species transmission likely occurred from pigs to cats and further from cats to humans, possibly involving intermediate species (Lukashov and Goudsmit, 2002) . Recently, a Mamastrovirus was identified in cheetahs (Acinonyx jubatus) raised in captivity showing clinical signs of gastroenteric disease, such as lethargy, anorexia, watery diarrhea and regurgitation (Atkins et al., 2009 ). The newly discovered virus was shown to be closely related to the FeAstV in ORF2 (88.6%, 97.1% nucleotide and amino acid identity, respectively); although comparison with ORF1b sequences was not possible due to the unavailability of FeAstVs sequences. Cheetah's AstV clustered relatively more closely to HAstVs at the ORF2 level than at the ORF1b. This was an unexpected finding taking into account that for AstVs, the rate of change is generally higher in the capsid region (van Hemert et al., 2007b) and may indicate that a recombination event occurred between AstVs from different host species (Atkins et al., 2009 ). Currently it is unclear whether the cheetah AstV had crossed the species barrier from domestic cats or if it had established in cheetahs independently.

Astrovirus-like particles were first detected in pigs in the 1980s by EM (Bridger, 1980; Shirai et al., 1985) . These reports were followed by the detection PoAstVs in several countries throughout the world; namely South Africa (Geyer et al., 1994) , the Czech Republic (Indik et al., 2006) , Hungary (Reuter et al., 2011) , Quebec (Luo et al., 2011) and Colombia (Ulloa and Gutierrez, 2010), suggesting a wide geographical distribution. Although PoAstV is described as a common finding from fecal samples of apparently healthy pigs (Luo et al., 2011; Reuter et al., 2011) , the clinical significance of this infection has not been completely clarified. As a matter of fact, clinical symptoms have been reported mainly in piglets, often in association with rotavirus-, coronavirus-and calicivirus-like infections (Bridger, 1980; Indik et al., 2006; Luo et al., 2011; Shimizu et al., 1990; Shirai et al., 1985) . PoAstV prevalence is considered variable from 0% to 83% and 100% based on serological and virological surveillance, respectively (Luo et al., 2011; Shimizu et al., 1990) . Though ICTV officially recognizes only one species of PoAstV (PoAstV-1) several reports have demonstrated the existence of multiple serotypes and subtypes. PoAstV-1 was partially characterized in 2006 (Indik et al., 2006) , sharing only 86% nucleotide similarity with the previously characterized strain and clearly indicating that multiple serotypes could infect pigs (Indik et al., 2006). A putative PoAstV-2 was detected in Hungary (Reuter et al., 2011) , with a low value of similarity (46% and 43% nucleotide and amino acid similarity, respectively) with PoAstV-1 at the ORF2 (Reuter et al., 2011) . At the time of analysis, ORF1b sequences of PoAstV-1 were not available and authors found that partial ORF1b sequence of the putative PoAstV-2 shared 67% nucleotide similarity with HAstV-3 (Reuter et al., 2011) . A more recent study in Quebec confirmed that pigs could harbor several distinct AstVs most likely derived from different ancestors (Luo et al., 2011) . These PoAstVs did not cluster in a monophyletic group and three distinct PoAstV groups were identified, with the group II PoAstVs being the most prevalent (Luo et al., 2011) . Group II PoAstVs harbored specific genetic patterns: for instance, they were not genetically related to other animal strains identified to date, they contained a unique insertion of three nucleotides upstream the ORF2 and they did not possess the highly conserved stemloop-II-like (s2m) motif in the ORF2/3 0 UTR common to the majority of AstVs and other positive sense RNA viruses (Jonassen et al., 1998; Luo et al., 2011) . These findings were similar for the putative PoAstV-2 strain (Reuter et al., 2011) .

Recently, there has been evidence of multiple recombination events between distinct PoAstV strains and between PoAstV and HAstV in the variable region of ORF2 (Ulloa and Gutierrez, 2010). Interestingly, authors noticed that all PoAstV-HAstV recombinant viruses emerged from the same geographical area where pigs are raised in promiscuity with human beings. Considering the evident diversity of human strains compared to PoAstVs, the authors suggested that viral transmission likely occurred from humans to pigs and not vice versa, as it had been previously hypothesized (Lukashov and Goudsmit, 2002; Ulloa and Gutierrez, 2010).

In mink, AstV infection has been considered a significant risk factor for the pre-weaning diarrhea syndrome (Englund et al., 2002) and more recently a novel AstV has been discovered in brain tissue of mink developing the so-called shaking mink syndrome (SMS) (Blomstrom et al., 2010) . A pre-weaning syndrome has been well described in mink farms since 1954 in Denmark (Svennekjaer, 1954) . Mink farmers refer to this syndrome as ''sticky'', ''greasy'', or ''wet'' kits, due to the hyper secretion from apocrine glands in the dorsal neck region thus resulting in soiling of the neck and back (Schneider and Hunter, 1993) , together with diarrhea and dehydration at various degrees (Henriksen, 1987) . In 2003 the virus associated with this syndrome was entirely sequenced and characterized as a novel astrovirus with less than 67% similarity at the nucleotide level with the closest related OAstV, thus called MiAstV (Mittelholzer et al., 2003a,b) . Interestingly, sequence analysis of MiAstVs from geographically distinct Swedish and Danish farms indicated that they are rather conserved from a genetic point of view; although this observation was mainly based on a short fragment of ORF 1b and geographical clusters were revealed (Mittelholzer et al., 2003a,b) . This appears to be in contrast with the data collected for astroviruses infecting other species, such as swine, bats or turkeys, indicating a high degree of genetic variability (Cattoli et al., 2007; Luo et al., 2011; Pantin-Jackwood et al., 2011; Zhu et al., 2009) . Recently, Blomstrom et al. (2010) have identified a unique astrovirus associated with SMS (Table 2) , a neurological disorder of unknown etiology (Blomstrom et al., 2010; Gavier-Widen et al., 2004) . The AstV associated with SMS and found in the brain tissue of mink, was very similar to MiAstV in ORF1a and ORF1b (88% and 98% homology, respectively) and had a lower identity for ORF2 (67% and 59% homology for nucleotide and amino acid sequences, respectively) (Blomstrom et al., 2010) . Intriguingly, there was also low level similarity to a unique AstV associated with a neurological disorder in a child affected by X-linked a gammaglobulinemia (HAstV-PS) (Quan et al., 2010) . HastV-PS is also genetically related to AstV-VA1 (Finkbeiner et al., 2009b) and to a lesser extent to MiAstVs and OAstVs, thus falling within the proposed genocluster GII of Mamastroviruses (Bosch et al., 2010b; Quan et al., 2010) .

Since the 1980s astrovirus-like particles have been reported in dogs with and without diarrhea (Williams 1980; Marshall et al., 1984; Vieler and Herbst 1995) . However, infection in dogs was only recently confirmed by genetic characterization (Toffan et al., 2009; Zhu et al., 2011) and a canine astrovirus has also been recently isolated in cell culture (Table 2) . To date, canine astroviruses (CaAstV) or astrovirus-like particles in dogs have been reported in the USA, Germany, Austria, Italy, China and France (Grellet et al., submitted; Marshall et al., 1984; Toffan et al., 2009; Vieler and Herbst, 1995; Williams, 1980; Zhu et al., 2011) . The clinical significance of CaAstV infections in dogs requires further investigation; however, CaAstV was detected from symptomatic puppies occasionally suffering from diarrhea in association with other enteric viruses, such as rotaviruses (Toffan et al., 2009 ) and corona-and/or parvo-like viruses (Williams, 1980; Martella et al., 2011) . A recent study on the prevalence of CaAstV in Shanghai, China suggested that 12.02% (22/183) of the puppies showing clinical signs of diarrhea were positive for astrovirus by RT-PCR as compared to zero of the 138 healthy controls . In a recent study conducted in Italy, 24.5% of 110 stool samples collected from symptomatic dogs and 9.3% of 75 from asymptomatic animals under survey tested positive for the presence of CaAstV RNA . In the same study, serologic assay indicates that 59% of 54 dogs surveyed in Italy presented specific CaAstV-antibodies, with specific antibodies detected almost exclusively in dogs aged >3 months . A similar prevalence was found in France where 20.9% (66/316) of the puppies in 42% (14/33) of the breeding kennels surveyed were CaAstV positive by RT-PCR (Grellet et al., submitted) . In the same report, the authors noted that puppies less than 7 weekold were especially susceptible to CaAstV infection (Grellet et al., submitted) .

Genetic analysis of ORF2 and partial ORF1b identified the virus as a member of the genus Mamastrovirus, falling in the proposed genocluster GI comprising ''classic'' human, porcine and feline Ast-Vs but genetically well distinguishable from the other Mamastroviruses (Bosch et al., 2010b; Toffan et al., 2009 ). Among available sequences, the closest similarity was found with HAstV-7 and HAstV-1 (22% and 59.4% nucleotide similarity for ORF2 and partial ORF1b sequences, respectively). Thus, genospecies GI.E has been further proposed as being a new species (Bosch et al., 2010b) .

Novel astroviruses in insectivorous bats were recently discovered in Hong Kong, mainland China and Germany (Chu et al., 2008; Drexler et al., 2011; Zhu et al., 2009) . AstV in bats seems to occur as a low pathogenic asymptomatic infection, as it has been observed in relation to the reproductive success of a Myotis myotis colony under study, where AstV was detected together with Coronaviruses and Adenoviruses (Drexler et al., 2011) . In this study AstV displayed different patterns of amplification during the observed three-year period (Drexler et al., 2011) . In summary, for the first two years of the survey a unique peak occurred only after the formation of a colony with sufficient size and density, and only in the third year a second peak was noticed associated with parturition, similar to what observed for the entire survey period for coronavirus infection in the same colony (Drexler et al., 2011) . Interestingly, the second peak was associated with the predominance of a different lineage of AstV in the bat colony, indicating the emergence of a pathogen with enhanced replication efficiency (Drexler et al., 2011) . A remarkably high prevalence and genetic diversity were observed for AstVs occurrence in bats (Chu et al., 2008; Drexler et al., 2011; Zhu et al., 2009) . The Hong Kong study demonstrated that 7 out of 9 sampled bat species were positive for astrovirus, with a total of 77 BatAstVs found in fecal swabs (Chu et al., 2008) . Partial sequence analysis of ORF1a and analysis of the complete ORF1b indicated that bat AstVs clustered alone and fell into two subgroups according to the species of origin (Chu et al., 2008) . In particular, this study identified group A and group B BatAstVs, primarily detected in Miniopterus and Myotis spp, without any bat species restriction, and a third group made of five viruses clustering separately (Chu et al., 2008) . Full length sequencing of one BatAstV revealed the absence of the s2m motif, similarly to TAstV-2, RatAstV and group II PoAstVs (Chu et al., 2008 (Chu et al., , 2010 Jonassen et al., 1998 Jonassen et al., , 2003 Luo et al., 2011) . Viral diversity of BatAstVs was also observed by Zhu (Chu et al., 2008) . Seven monophyletic groups (1 to 7) were identified from the ORF1b sequences of known Mamastroviruses. With the exception of group 1 specific for humans, feline and porcine AstVs, BatAstVs fell in all remaining groups, and 5 groups were completely occupied by BatAstVs (Zhu et al., 2009) . Five groups revealed a varying degree of host restriction within the bat populations. These findings were confirmed by sequence analysis of the ORF2. Three viral lineages from mammalian hosts were clearly identified, namely ''human/feline/porcine'', ''bats only'', and a ''mixed'' group (Zhu et al., 2009) . Interestingly, a high degree of viral diversity was confirmed by Zhu et al. (2009) . More specifically, viruses belonging to different ORF1b genetic lineages (namely 2, 3 and 6) were identified from a single species in a single cave and sampled in a single day, indicating high level of circulation of different AstVs in the same host (Zhu et al., 2009 ). On the contrary, viruses detected from a unique species in different sites fell in the same genetic group, confirming a certain degree of host restriction (Zhu et al., 2009) . In a recent three-year monitoring of a Myotis Myotis colony in Western Germany, 6 distinct Bat AstVs, as well as a coronavirus and a novel adenovirus, were detected from the fecal samples collected from the sampling site (Drexler et al., 2011) . All six BatAstVs found in the German colony fell within the putative genocluster GII and clustered with other previously discovered AstVs from Myotis chinensis and Myotis ricketti in mainland China (aminaocid similarity ranging from 65-86%) (Bosch et al., 2010b; Zhu et al., 2009) .

In 1981, an astrovirus was associated with an outbreak of gastroenteritis in red deer (Cervus elaphus) raised in captivity. Although genetic characterization was not performed for this virus, antigenic characterization indicated that the new virus was unrelated to OAstV or BoAstV grown in cell cultures (Tzipori et al., 1981) . Unfortunately, no further findings have been reported in red deer.

An astrovirus-like infection was associated with an outbreak of gastroenteritis in inbred mice by EM (Kjeldsberg and Hem, 1985) . In this report, astrovirus-like particles were detected in the intestinal content of 16/17 nude mice displaying diarrhea and 34/55 symptomless and in 4/10 normal apparently healthy mice (Kjeldsberg and Hem, 1985) . The high prevalence in asymptomatic animals might suggest that mice could carry AstV and develop disease when immunocompromised (Kjeldsberg and Hem, 1985) . The pathogenicity and genetic patterns of these viruses were not further investigated and to date no further reports in laboratory mice have been documented.

Recently, novel astroviruses were identified in the feces of urban brown rats sampled in Hong Kong (Chu et al., 2010) . Sequence analyses revealed a high degree of variability among RatAstVs and the absence of the 2sm motif, similarly to TAstV-2, BatAstVs, and group II PoAstV as described by Luo et al. (2011) (Chu et al., 2010; Jonassen et al., 2003; Luo et al., 2011) . These viruses clus-tered into2 genetically related but distinct clades closely related to the human MLB1 and MLB2 AstVs; leading to the hypothesis of a putative common ancestor (Chu et al., 2010; Finkbeiner et al., 2009a; Jonassen et al., 2003; Luo et al., 2011) .

Five genetically distinct AstVs have recently been found in the fecal samples of three marine mammal species: a California sea lion (CslAstV-1, CslAstV-2, CslAstV-3), a Steller's sea lion (SslAstV) and a bottlenose dolphin (BdAstV) (Rivera et al., 2010) . Genetic analyses of ORF1b and ORF2 indicate that these viruses do not cluster in a monophyletic group but across the Mamastrovirus tree, as confirmed by the proposal of re-classification submitted to ICTV. Recombination analyses suggested that a recombination event may have occurred between a human strain (HAstV-4) and a CslAstV-2, possibly resulting in CslAstV-3 (Rivera et al., 2010) .

The first clinical description of a disease syndrome (duck hepatitis) presumably associated with astrovirus infection in poultry dates back to 1965 (Asplin, 1965a,b) . The astrovirus-associated disease in ducklings was first described in 1984 and was based on morphology of the virions by EM (Gough et al., 1984) . This virus was later definitively identified as astrovirus and we are now aware that astrovirus is the causative agent of duck hepatitis, a severe acute disease detectable in 1-2 week-old ducklings which can result up to 50% mortality (Fu et al., 2009) . Livers in the affected animals displays typical multiple and widespread hemorrhagic lesions, indicating necrosis of the hepatocyte cytoplasm with the formation of much cavitations or ballooning degeneration at the histopatological investigation (Fu et al., 2009; Gough et al., 1985) . Until 1984, the etiologic agent of duck fatal hepatitis was thought to be a Picornavirus. Former classification recognized three picornaviruses as duck hepatitis virus (DHV) I, II and III, based on vaccine protection. Although DHV II was classified as a DAstV, in Todd et al. (2009 genetically characterized DHV II and III ORF1b and definitely defined them as astroviruses (Todd et al., 2009a) . DHV II and DHVIII share a low level of nucleotide and aminoacid identities (64 and 69%) and DHV III appears more closely related to TAstV-2 than DHV II, which is in fact more related to CAstV. However, since these findings were based on sequence analysis of only a small portion of ORF1b ($390 nt) further characterization is required before phylogenetic and taxonomic relationships can be established. Recently Fu et al. (2009) sequenced the complete genome of a duck astrovirus associated with fatal hepatitis in Chinese ducklings (Fu et al., 2009) . Sequence analysis demonstrated that the genome exhibited a classical AstV organization with two unique features; the largest poly-adenylated genome of 7722 nt, and the presence of ORF2 in a different frame than ORF1a or ORF1b, with a start codon 23 nt downstream of the stop codon of ORF1b. From a phylogenetic point of view this virus is more closely related to TAstV-2, which suggests that the duck virus may have originally transmitted from turkeys (Fu et al., 2009) .

To date, two genetically distinct TAstVs have been recognized: TAstV-1 and TAstV-2. TAstV-1 was firstly detected in diseased turkey flocks in the '80s (Reynolds and Saif, 1986; Reynolds et al., 1987; Saif et al., 1985 Saif et al., , 1990 . TAstV-2 was characterized in association with poult enteritis mortality syndrome (PEMS) (Koci et al., 2000) and PEMS-associated TAstV-2 has been shown to cause enteritis, thymic and bursal atrophy, and increased mortality in experimentally infected poults (Behling-Kelly et al., 2002) . Field observations indicate that TAstV-2 is currently more prevalent in turkeys than TAstV-1 (Cattoli et al., 2007; Pantin-Jackwood et al., 2006b ) and its occurrence is often associated with other enteric viruses (Jindal et al., 2010a,b; Reynolds et al., 1987) . Nevertheless, it is one of the most commonly detected viruses from turkey poults suffering diarrhea. The exact role of TAstV-2 as the etiological agent of poult enteritis complex and PEMS is difficult to estimate since it can be easily detected in apparently healthy adult turkeys (Jindal et al., 2010b (Jindal et al., , 2011 . Recently, Spackman et al. (2010) have evaluated the effect of TAstV-2, turkey rotavirus and turkey reovirusco-infections in decreased weight gain in broad-breasted white turkey poults. They showed that poults exposed to all three viruses administered in combination had the lowest body weight, although the weights were not significantly different from control birds (Spackman et al., 2010) . The prevalence of TAstV varies from 40 to 80% in symptomatic poults (Cattoli et al., 2007; Domanska-Blicharz et al., 2011; Jindal et al., 2010a; Reynolds et al., 1987) to less than 30% to 50% in healthy flocks (Jindal et al., 2010b; Reynolds et al., 1987) . Generally speaking TAstVs are widely spread and considered as the most prevalent virus infection in 1-5 week-old poults suffering from diarrhea (Jindal et al., 2010a,b; Reynolds and Saif, 1986; Reynolds et al., 1987; Saif et al., 1985) . Although TAstVs can be detected in adult healthy turkeys (Jindal et al., 2010b) , clinical signs of disease usually develop between 1 and 3 weeks of age and generally last up to 2 weeks (Reynolds and Schultz-Cherry, 2003) . Severity is usually mild to moderate and is characterized by diarrhea, listlessness, litter eating and nervousness. Although mortality rate is low, morbidity occurring as decreased growth is of great concern (Reynolds and Schultz-Cherry, 2003) . Data from full genome sequencing of TAstV-1 and TAstV-2 indicate that they are genetically unrelated and likely to have originated from separate introductions and should therefore be regarded as two subtypes instead of serotypes (Jonassen et al., 2003; Pantin-Jackwood et al., 2011; Strain et al., 2008) . Beyond this classification, data from genetic and antigenic analyses of field viruses detected in turkeys indicate the circulation of multiple lineages of TAstV-2. Genetic and antigenic characterization of two turkey isolates related to TAstV-2 (TAstV1987-TAstVT2001 also identified as TAstV-3) suggests that they could be virtually classified as two different serotypes (Pantin-Jackwood et al., 2011; Tang and Saif, 2004; Tang et al., 2005) , similarly to strain MN/01 (Strain et al., 2008) . Characterization of 23 distinct TAstVs-2 throughout the USA identified different lineages based on ORF1b and ORF2 sequence analysis with no clear geographic neither temporal derives (Pantin-Jackwood et al., 2006a) . Molecular characterization of TAstVs revealed an unexpected variability among ORF2, on the basis of what has been reported for human viruses (Pantin-Jackwood et al., 2011; Walter et al., 2001) . Such variability was related not only to nucleotide substitutions but also to insertions and deletions at several different positions (Pantin-Jackwood et al., 2011) . There were different topologies for ORF1b and ORF2 trees confirmed by SimPlot analysis and episodes of recombination in different isolates collected in different houses of the same farm on the same day (Pantin-Jackwood et al., 2006a ,b, 2011 . Similarly to previous findings, Cattoli et al. (2007) identified different lineages of TAstV-2 circulating in Italian flocks, based on ORF1b or ORF2 sequences, respectively. Importantly, for 29 out of 41 TAstV-2 sequences, the amplification of ORF2 was not achieved, confirming a high rate of variability between the circulating TAstVs-2 (Cattoli et al., 2007) . The existence of different sublineages of TAstV-2 in turkey farms has been confirmed by field studies (Domanska-Blicharz et al., 2011; Jindal et al., 2010a Jindal et al., ,b, 2011 Pantin-Jackwood et al., 2006a) . Field findings are consistent with further genetic studies (Strain et al., 2008) . This analysis suggested that TAstV-1 and TAstV-2 should be reconsidered as subtypes instead of serotypes and that multiple serotypes of TAstV-2 exist (Pantin-Jackwood et al., 2011; Strain et al., 2008) . A total of 46 recombination events were identified, with at least one of them for each of ten analyzed TAstVs-2 (Strain et al., 2008) . Results from this analysis also pointed out the need for a deep genetic analysis. In fact, a phylogenetic analysis can suggest distinct results if different parts of the genome are analyzed. It is clear that the ORF2 is the most important region to analyze when trying to determine genus and species classification, and the junction across ORF1b and ORF2, as a potential hot spot of recombination (Strain et al., 2008) . Whether the currently circulating TAstV-2 sublineages have evolved as immunological escape mutants or circulate as multiple discrete sub-lineages, similar to what happens in HIV infections, is still under debate. In turkeys, antibody response against TAstV-2 is not sufficiently elicited (Koci et al., 2004) and does not seem to play a crucial role in the evolution of TAstVs-2 sublineages, which in fact do not cluster neither geographically nor historically following immunological pressure (Pantin-Jackwood et al., 2006b) .

Interestingly, an astrovirus has been found to infect and cause diarrhea in guinea fowl (Cattoli et al., 2005 (Cattoli et al., , 2007 . The origin of this virus remains unknown, although sequence analysis suggests that interspecies transmission might have occurred between turkey and guinea fowl (Cattoli et al., 2007) .

Avian nephritis virus (ANV) was first isolated from rectal content of apparently healthy broiler chicks and experimental infections revealed that it mainly results in a sub-clinical disease, although mild growth depression and mortality have been reported for infections with ANV-1 (the strain G-4260) Maeda et al., 1979; Yamaguchi et al., 1979) . Like many other avian AstVs, ANV was initially classified as a picornavirus based on EM analysis (Maeda et al., 1979; Yamaguchi et al., 1979) and only after complete genome sequencing was it reclassified as a member of the Astroviridae family (Imada et al., 2000) . At least two serotypes have been reported to date (Frazier et al., 1990; Imada et al., 1980; Pantin-Jackwood et al., 2011; Shirai et al., 1991) . ANV typically causes histological changes in the kidneys although the viral antigen can be detected in other organs, namely liver, spleen, pancreas, jejunum and rectum (Imada et al., , 1983 Shimizu et al., 1990; Shirai et al., 1989 Shirai et al., , 1992 . Young chicks are the most susceptible and become resistant to disease after the first month of life (Imada et al., 1981) . Clinical disease in chicks varies from subclinical to outbreaks of runting stunting syndrome (RSS) and chick nephropathy (Frazier et al., 1990; Imada et al., 1980; Shimizu et al., 1990; Shirai et al., 1992; Takase et al., 1989 Takase et al., , 1994 Yamaguchi et al., 1979) . However, the impact of ANV infection on RSS is unknown. Although ANV affected body gain in specific-pathogen free chicks (Shirai et al., 1991) an experimental study on the effect of ANV and several unclassified enterovirus-like viruses (ELVs) in commercial chicks demonstrated that only one ELV analyzed among the broad panel produced clinical signs in inoculated chicks (McNulty et al., 1990) . Similarly, infection of 1-day-old chicks with three different ELVs and an ANV showed that ELVs are able to induce more severe lesions in the intestine, the kidneys and the pancreas than ANV (Smyth et al., 2007) .

Passive and active surveys indicate that ANV is widely distributed worldwide and that serological evidence can be found in turkeys as well (Connor et al., 1987; Decaesstecker et al., 1989; Hewson et al., 2010; Imada et al., 1980; McNulty et al., 1989; Nicholas et al., 1988; Takase et al., 1989; Zhao et al., 2011) . Although to date the infection has never been associated with the disease in turkeys, an ANV genetically related to ANV-1 was detected in the feces of turkeys. However, the significance of this finding requires further investigation (Pantin-Jackwood et al., 2006a .

Astrovirus-like virions were first observed in feces of chickens by EM in the 1990s (McNeilly et al., 1994; McNulty et al., 1990 ), but until recently little was known about their genetic and antigenic characteristics. A preliminary study on a panel of three newly isolated and characterized CAstVs revealed that 1-day-old chicks infected with one CAstV developed mild diarrhea and distension of the small intestine (Baxendale and Mebatsion, 2004) . They also showed that those viruses were antigenically and genetically distinct from ANV, the only astrovirus known to infect chickens (Baxendale and Mebatsion, 2004) . A small portion of ORF1 was sequenced and showed limited similarity to the non-structural proteins of TAstV-2 (62%), TAstV-1 (58%), and ANV (55%). Serological evidence of CAstV has been demonstrated in broiler flocks in the UK, the Netherlands, Spain, Australia, and the USA (Baxendale and Mebatsion, 2004) and more recently in broiler parent flocks in the UK that spread to European breeder flocks (Todd et al., 2009b) , which suggests a worldwide distribution. Recently molecular and antigenic characterization of enterovirus-like viruses (ELVs), previously classified as belonging to the Picornaviridae family, demonstrated that they were distantly related to CAstVs (Todd et al., 2009a) . Further studies on CAstV genetic and antigenic characteristics indicate that multiple serotypes exist (Pantin-Jackwood et al., 2006a Todd et al., 2009a,b) . In particular, sequencing of ORF2 of 32 avian astroviruses showed the circulation of at least two CAvtVs, namely CAstV-2 to 3 (Pantin-Jackwood et al., 2011). To date, full sequencing of CAstVs has not been done and therefore many questions remain to be answered on viral genome organization and on the origin of this putative new species of AAstV.

Given the nature of their RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, which is error-prone and switches from copying one RNA molecule to the next without releasing the original strand, RNA viruses have a tendency towards significant genetic variability due to the introduction of mutations and genetic recombination. Astroviruses are not an exception in this term. In fact, genetic variability has been described in almost all mama-and avastrovirus species sufficiently examined (Belliot et al., 1997a,b; Chu et al., 2010; De Grazia et al., 2011; Finkbeiner et al., 2009a-c; Gabbay et al., 2007; Kapoor et al., 2009; Liu et al., 2008) , PoAstVs (Luo et al., 2011) , BoAstVs (Tse et al., 2011) , BatAstVs (Chu et al., 2008; Drexler et al., 2011; Zhu et al., 2009) , RatAstVs (Chu et al., 2010) , TAstVs (Cattoli et al., 2007; Pantin-Jackwood et al., 2006b; Strain et al., 2008) and CAstV (Pantin-Jackwood et al., 2011; Todd et al., 2009b) . Genetic variability can be induced by synonymous or non-synonymous nucleotide substitutions, the latter being subjected to stronger positive or negative selection pressure. Data gathered on astroviruses suggest pressures and evolutionary constrains for different selection in different genomic regions. For example, regions of the astrovirus capside protein exposed to the immune pressure and environmental changes, such as predicted epitopes or sites interacting with host cells, are subject to positive selection and codon changes (Lukashov and Goudsmit, 2002; Strain et al., 2008; van Hemert et al., 2007a) . Furthermore, there is an increasing evidence of recombination events occurring in astroviruses, which contributes to increased genetic variability. Recombination within the classic HAstV stains was among the first examples described. Walter et al. (2001) characterized a novel recombinant HAstV strain associated with diarrhea in children (Walter et al., 2001) . They identified a virus containing an ORF2 region from HAstV-5 and an ORF1b region belonging to HAstV-3 that was widely circulating and stable being isolated from separate geographical regions at least one year apart. This suggested that the recombination even took place at the ORF1b-ORF2 transition region. More recently, a recombinant virus was isolated from a Kenyan child with diarrhea that contained an ORF1a clustered with HAstV-6/7, an ORF1b clustered with HAstV-3, and an ORF2 from HAstV-2 (Wolfaardt et al., 2011) . Similar to the study from Walter et al. (2001) , the ORF1b-ORF2 junction was identified as a recombination point with a second possible recombination point within the ORF1a region (Walter et al., 2001; Wolfaardt et al., 2011) .

Also, recombination events have occurred in astroviruses infecting animals. At least one has occurred during the evolution of BoAstV and CcAstV (Tse et al., 2011) and evidence of recombinations was revealed in distinct studies on TAstV-2 viruses circulating in the USA (Pantin-Jackwood et al., 2006b; Strain et al., 2008) .

A major question is whether an animal astrovirus can recombine with a HAstV leading to human disease or facilitate zoonotic transmission and the emergence and spread of novel viruses into the human or the animal population. A recent report suggests that a recombination even may have occurred between a human and a California sea lion astrovirus (Rivera et al., 2010) leading to the hypothesis of a common ancestor or to a zoonotic transmission event. Similarly, a possible recombination event between PoAstV and HAstV3 was described in another recent publication (Ulloa and Gutierrez, 2010) .

The wide variety of species infected the evident virus genetic diversity and the occurrence of recombination events indicate or imply the cross-species transmission and subsequent virus adaptation to new hosts and/or the co-infection of the same host with different astroviruses. An interesting study on astroviruses evolution suggests that several cross-species transmissions probably occurred during the evolutionary history of astroviruses (van Hemert et al., 2007a) . After the cross-species transmission, the viruses adapted to the new hosts diversifying themselves genetically. Putative common ancestors and ancient interspecies transmissions have been suggested between avian and mammalian species and among mammalians, in more recent time, between sheep and mink, or cheetahs and cats (Atkins et al., 2009; van Hemert et al., 2007a) . Cross-species transmission has also been suggested among avian species. For example, the close genetic relatedness between a novel astrovirus causing acute hepatitis in ducks and TAstV-2, and between TAstV-2 and astroviruses infecting guinea fowl suggested transmission of astroviruses between turkey and duck, or guinea fowl, respectively (Cattoli et al., 2007; Fu et al., 2009) . Also, ANV-1-like astroviruses were detected in the intestinal contents of healthy turkeys in the USA (Pantin-Jackwood et al., 2006a) . Although no documented zoonotic transmission of animal astroviruses to humans is documented, some scientific reports suggested the possibility of cross-species transmission of astroviruses between animals and humans and therefore the zoonotic potential of astrovirus infections. Lukashov and Goudsmit (2002) , based on phylogenetic analysis, suggested the transmission of an astrovirus from pigs to cats and then to humans with unidentified intermediate hosts potentially involved (Lukashov and Goudsmit, 2002) . Different conclusions were described in a more recent study, suggesting interspecies transmissions of astroviruses from humans to pigs in Canada (Luo et al., 2011) . In other recent studies, the suggestion of putative common ancestors of RAstV, MiAstV and OAstV and novel astroviruses found in human stools, namely MLB-like and HMO AstVs, raised questions about the zoonotic transmission of astroviruses (Chu et al., 2010; Kapoor et al., 2009 ). However, these possibilities remain under investigation.

Historically, astroviruses have been considered as species-specific viruses and this was reflected in the past taxonomical criteria for their classification based on the species of origin (Faquet et al., 2005) . Considering the almost regular discoveries of novel astroviruses in humans and in animals and the parallel development of genetic and evolutionary studies, not only the capacity of astroviruses to infect a wide variety of hosts in different environments it is now evident but also their potential capability to cross species barriers and become adapted to new hosts. Therefore, the acquired host adaptation presumably does not prevent astroviruses to infect new species. The astonishing genetic diversity of Astroviridae greatly contributes to their successful colonization of/in different environments. It is likely that with increased surveillance and improved diagnostic assays the diversity will only continue to increase. This aspect also imposes alternative nomenclature and taxonomical classification for this virus family, as recently proposed by an ad hoc study group (Bosch et al., 2010a,b) .

After more than 30 years from their first description in clinical samples, there are many exciting avenues of investigation and intriguing questions that remain to be answered as regards the relatively under-studied Astroviridae family, for example those aspects related to biology and epidemiology which still remain unclear. Taking into consideration the molecular biology of astroviruses, a great deal of work is still needed to understand virus replication particularly in relation to cellular factors for productive replication, the role of the individual NSPs in replication and controlling cellular functions and a better understanding of the processing of the capsid protein. Studies on the evolutionary mechanisms of astroviruses and their phylogenetic relationships are at the start and the driving forces governing evolution and adaptation of astroviruses in different host species certainly deserve further research.

In humans, astroviruses are considered among the major viral enteric pathogen; in animals they have been associated with enteric or extra-enteric diseases in some species, such as mink, turkey and duck. However, in many hosts the association between astrovirus infection and disease or clinical syndromes is still debated and under-investigation and the same is for the molecular or phenotypic viral traits potentially associated to pathogenicity and virulence. For example, the pathogenesis and the molecular mechanisms governing virus tissue tropism and the extra-intestinal infections remain largely unknown, particularly for mammalian species. Furthermore, the virus genetic diversity, the occurrence of multiple infections and recombination events, the ability to cross species barriers and the circulation of astroviruses in animals in close contacts with humans make astroviruses as potential candidates for emerging zoonotic infections.

Microbial genomes from non-human primate gut metagenomes expand the primate-associated bacterial tree of life with over 1000 novel species,"Background: Humans have coevolved with microbial communities to establish a mutually advantageous relationship that is still poorly characterized and can provide a better understanding of the human microbiome. Comparative metagenomic analysis of human and non-human primate (NHP) microbiomes offers a promising approach to study this symbiosis. Very few microbial species have been characterized in NHP microbiomes due to their poor representation in the available cataloged microbial diversity, thus limiting the potential of such comparative approaches.","The human microbiome is a complex ecosystem, consisting of diverse microbial communities that have important functions in host physiology and metabolism [1] . The gut microbiome is influenced by several factors including diet [2] , physical activity [3] , use of antibiotics [4] , and other lifestyle-related conditions. Studies comparing the microbiome of rural and industrialized communities have also shown that dietary and lifestyle changes linked to Westernization have played a pivotal role in the loss of many microbial taxa and in the rise of others [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] . Although it is difficult to establish causality and mechanisms for these links [15, 16] , recent studies have extended the identifiable members of the human microbiome to now cover > 90% of its overall diversity [11] , which is a prerequisite for advancing the understanding of the role of microbes in human physiology and metabolism.

A comprehensive understanding of the current structure of the human microbiome needs to consider the study of how the microbiome has coevolved with humans. Ancient intestinal microbiome samples (i.e., coprolites) can give some insights on the gut microbial composition of pre-industrialized and prehistoric humans and date back to a few thousand years [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] , but the time-dependent degradation issues of microbial DNA limits the possibility of profiling stool samples predating the neolithic period [22] . Some patterns of codiversification between humans and their microbiomes can be in principle investigated by comparative and phylogenetic analysis of genomes and metagenomes in non-human primates (NHPs), the closest evolutionary relatives of humans [23] . However, a very substantial fraction of the microbiome in NHPs is currently uncharacterized, and a comprehensive comparative sequencelevel analysis against human microbiomes is thus unfeasible.

Recent studies of NHPs uncovered part of their hidden microbial diversity but only very partially contributed to the extension of the genetic blueprint of the microbiome in these hosts. Several 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing studies investigated the microbiome composition of NHPs [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] , and some, including a meta-analysis [33] , investigated the overlap and specificity of microbial communities associated with humans and NHPs [34] [35] [36] . Yet, because this approach has a limited phylogenetic resolution and lacks functional characterization, many co-diversification aspects cannot be studied. Some studies have also applied shotgun metagenomics on NHP microbiomes [30, [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] , but all of them employed a reference-based computational profiling approach, which solely allows the identification of the very few known microbial species present in NHPs, disregarding those that have not been characterized yet.

However, because of the advances in metagenomic assembly [42, 43] and its application on large cohorts [11] , there is now the possibility to compile a more complete catalog of species and genomes in NHP microbiomes and thus enable accurate co-diversification and comparative analyses.

In this study, we meta-analyzed 203 available shotgunsequenced NHPs metagenomes and performed a largescale assembly-based analysis uncovering over 1000 yetto-be-described species associated with NHP hosts, improving NHP gut metagenomes mappability by over 600%. We compared the newly established catalog of NHP-associated species in the context of a large-scale human microbiome assembly project [11] to expose the overlap and divergence between the NHP and human gut microbiome. We showed that captive NHPs harbor microbial species and strains more similar to the human ones compared to wild NHPs and that the extent of microbiome overlap is strongly lifestyle-dependent. Through comparative microbiome analysis, we thus describe the loss of biodiversity from wild to captive NHP that mimics that from non-Westernized to Westernized human populations.

To investigate the extent to which the composition of the gut microbiome overlaps across different primates for both known and currently uncharacterized microbes, we meta-analyzed a large set of gut microbiomes from humans and non-human primates (NHPs) that are publically available. Six datasets were considered for NHPs [30, [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] spanning 22 host species from 14 different countries in 5 continents (Additional file 1: Table S1 and Additional file 2: Figure S1 ), totaling 203 metagenomic samples that we retrieved and curated for this work. Microbiome samples from adult human healthy individuals were retrieved from 47 datasets considered in a recent meta-analysis [11] on 9428 human gut metagenomes and used as a comparative resource. Human samples include both Westernized and non-Westernized populations from different countries, whereas NHP datasets cover 4 primate clades, including Old and New World monkeys, apes, and lemurs (Additional file 1: Table S1 , Fig. 1a ). Two datasets (LiX_2018 and SrivathsanA_2015) surveyed NHPs in captivity, which were fed a specific human-like diet [39] or a diet similar to the one of wild NHPs [38] , respectively.

The newly metagenome-assembled genomes greatly increase the mappable diversity of NHP microbiomes Reference-based taxonomic profiling of all the 203 samples (see the ""Methods"" section and Additional file 3: Table S2 ) confirmed that a very large fraction of NHP metagenomes remains unmapped and uncharacterized (average estimated mapped reads 2.1% ± 3.64% st.dev., Fig. 1 The expanded set of microbial genomes and species from the gut microbiomes of NHPs. a Phylogenetic tree of the primate species considered in this study (adapted from [44] ), reporting the dataset and number of samples per species. b Microbial phylogeny of the 4930 species-level genome bins (SGBs, using single representative genomes, see the ""Methods"" section) and the 1009 SGBs that are specific to NHPs and newly retrieved in this study. c Overlap between the sets of SGBs reconstructed from NHP metagenomes and at least 1 reference microbial genome (kSGBs), between SGBs reconstructed both from NHP and human metagenomes but lacking a reference genome (uSGBs), and identification of newly assembled SGBs from NHPs metagenomes only (pSGBs). d Fraction of MAGs assigned to clades at different taxonomic levels; samples unassigned at the species level (kSGB or uSGB) could be assigned to known genus-level genome bins (GGBs) or family-level genome bins (FGBs), or remained unassigned at the family level (not assigned at FGB level). e Statistics of NHP metagenomic read mappability before and after the addition of MAGs from human and NHP metagenomes. We observed an average increase of 612% with respect to the reference genomes alone and 206% with respect to the catalog of human MAGs Additional file 4: Table S3 ). This points at the paucity of microbial genomes representative for members of the gut microbiome of NHPs, which greatly overcome the unexplored diversity still hidden in human microbiomes [45] . We thus employed an assembly-based approach we previously proposed and validated elsewhere [11] (see the ""Methods"" section) and that was also recently crosschecked with other similar efforts [46] to reconstruct microbial genomes de novo in the whole set of available NHP metagenomic samples. After single-sample assembly and contig binning of the 203 NHP metagenomes considered, we retrieved a total of 2985 metagenomeassembled genomes (MAGs) (Additional file 5: Table S4 ) that exceeded the threshold for being considered of medium quality (completeness > 50% and contamination < 5%) according to recent guidelines [47] . A large fraction of these genomes (34.6%) could additionally be considered of high quality (completeness > 90% and contamination < 5%) and provide the basis for assessing the diversity of NHP microbiomes Functional annotation of all MAGs (see the ""Methods"" section [48] ) showed low levels of functional characterization in NHPs, with only 1049 ± 482 Uni-Ref50 (61.9% ± 17.3% st.dev. of predicted proteins) assigned per MAG, in contrast with the 1426 ± 591 (77.3% ± 14.6% st.dev. of predicted proteins) assigned to MAGs from non-Westernized human samples and 1840 ± 847 (83.7% ± 12.6% st.dev. of predicted proteins) assigned to those obtained from Westernized human populations. Comparative functional analysis between human and NHP strains was hindered by the low level of overlap between species-level genome bins (SGBs; i.e., clusters of MAGs spanning 5% genetic diversity, see the ""Methods"" section) retrieved from human and NHP metagenomes, with only 8 SGBs being present in at least 10 human and 10 NHP microbiomes. Statistical analysis on the functional annotations of these shared SGBs showed 150 KEGG Orthologies (KOs) significantly associated with NHP strains and 166 KOs associated with human strains (Fisher's test FDR-corrected p values < 0.05, Additional file 6: Table S5 ). Among the functions associated with NHP strains, we found different genes involved in the degradation of sugars like cellobiose (K00702, K02761) and maltose (K16211, K01232), and among those associated with human ones, genes encoding for the degradation of different antibiotic compounds, including penicillin and vancomycin (K01710, K02563, K07260, K07259), which is consistent with the exposure of humans but not NHPs to antibiotics.

We first mapped the 2985 obtained MAGs against the previously described SGBs that recapitulate the > 150, 000 MAGs from the human microbiome and the > 80, 000 reference microbial genomes from public repositories. In total, 310 MAGs (10.39%) fell into 99 SGBs containing at least 1 known reference genome (called kSGBs), whereas 489 (16.38%) belonged to 200 unknown species (called uSGBs) lacking reference genomes but previously identified in the human microbiome ( Fig. 1c and Table 1 ). The large majority of the MAGs remained however unassigned, with 2186 MAGs (73.23%) showing > 5% genetic distance to any SGB and 1903 MAGs (63.75%) showing > 10% genetic distance. These completely unknown MAGs firstly reconstructed in this work from NHPs' gut metagenomes were de novo clustered into 1009 NHP-specific SGBs (here defined as primate SGBs or pSGBs) with the same procedure that defines SGBs at 5% genetic diversity we previously employed and validated [11] (Fig. 1c and Table 1 ). Overall, NHP microbiomes comprised 1308 SGBs covering 22 phyla (Fig. 1b) that expanded the known NHP microbiome diversity with new candidate species mostly expanding the Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Euryarchaeota, and Elusimicrobia phyla. On the contrary, Actinobacteria were generally underrepresented among NHP SGBs (Fig. 1b) . Although some species were shared between NHPs and humans, our analysis highlighted extensive microbial diversity specifically associated with primates other than humans.

This expanded set of genomes improved the fraction of metagenomic reads in each metagenome that could be mapped by over 6-folds (612%) with respect to the sole reference genomes available in public repositories (> 80,000, see the ""Methods"" section) and by 2-folds (206.5%) with respect to the catalog of genomes expanded with the MAGs from over 9500 human metagenomes [11] (Fig. 1e) . Overall, the average metagenome mappability reached 38.2%, with however uneven increase across datasets (Fig. 1e) . The LiX_2018 dataset of NHPs in captivity reached a mappability of 77.6%, whereas the AmatoKR_2018 dataset of wild NHPs merely reached a 17.4% mappability rate (Fig. 1e ). The fact that LiX_2018 was already highly mappable even when using the available reference genomes alone (22.2% w.r.t. 1% of AmatoKR_2018) and that the human Only few and mostly unexplored gut microbes are in common between humans and NHPs

We first investigated how many of the microbial species identified in NHPs were also detected at least once in the human gut microbiome, finding only about 20% overlap (291 of the 1308 SGBs) between NHP and human gut microbial species. Considering the whole set of SGBs found at least once in human or NHP gut metagenomes, this overlap is further reduced to 5.95%. Many of the species found both in NHPs and humans (200 MAGs, 68%) are currently unexplored species without reference genomes (uSGBs). In addition, very few of the newly recovered MAGs belonged to species previously isolated from NHPs but never found in human microbiome samples. This set of 8 known species includes Helicobacter macacae, which can cause chronic colitis in macaques [49, 50] , and Bifidobacterium moukalabense, whose type strain was originally isolated from Gorilla gorilla gorilla samples [51] , and we reconstructed from two samples of the same host (Additional file 7: Table  S6 ). The other 6 known species (Fibrobacter sp. UWS1, Caryophanon tenue, Staphylococcus nepalensis, Staphylococcus cohnii, Enterococcus thailandicus, Serratia sp. FGI94) comprise 1 MAG only from our dataset and confirm the paucity of isolated and characterized taxa specifically associated to NHPs. When looking at the species with previously assigned taxonomic labels, we found a total of 91 species with sequenced representatives (kSGBs) in NHPs that can also be found in the human microbiome. However, many of them (64.65%) are still rather uncharacterized species as they represent sequenced genomes assigned to genuslevel clades without an official species name (e.g., with species names labeled as ""sp."" or ""bacterium,"" Additional file 8: Table S7 ). Most of such relatively unknown kSGBs were from the Clostridium genus (15 kSGBs), and several others belonged to the Prevotella (9) and Ruminococcus (6) genera. However, both the 2 most represented human kSGBs assigned to the Prevotella genus (13 and 11 MAGs recovered, respectively, Fig. 2a and Additional file 9: Table S8 ) were retrieved from Macaca fascicularis in captivity from the LiX_2018 dataset, consistently with previous the literature [36, 52, 53] . Among those kSGBs with an unambiguously assigned taxonomy, 2 highly prevalent Treponema species, T. berlinense and T. succinifaciens, were reconstructed from 14 and 11 samples, respectively, from different studies and host species ( Fig. 2a and Additional file 8: Table S7 ). These two species were previously found to be enriched in non-Westernized populations [11] , with 45 genomes reconstructed from different countries. T. berlinense and T. succinifaciens may thus represent known taxa that are common to primate hosts but that are under negative selective pressure in modern Westernized lifestyles.

The majority (68.7%) of the 291 species shared between humans and NHPs are SGBs without available reference genomes and taxonomic definition (i.e., uSGBs, Fig. 1c , d). Many of these uSGBs remain unassigned also at higher taxonomic levels, with only 25 of them assigned to known genera and 102 to known families. Overall, more than one third (36.5%) of the uSGBs shared with humans were highly uncharacterized and were left unassigned even at the family level (Additional file 9: Table S8 ). Among these, 5 out of the 10 most prevalent shared uSGBs (accounting for 61 MAGs in total) were assigned to the Bacteroidetes phylum ( Fig. 2a) but remained unassigned at lower taxonomic levels (Additional file 9: Table S8 ). Even among uSGBs, the Treponema genus was highly represented, with 9 genomes reconstructed from different samples of Papio cynocephalus from the TungJ_2015 dataset (Additional file 9: Table S8 ). Common human-NHP taxa thus represent only a small fraction of the primate microbiome, and these taxa generally belong to very poorly characterized taxonomic clades.

Microbiomes of NHPs in captivity showed reduced numbers of previously unseen microbial diversity (pSGBs) and a larger set of strains from species also found in humans (kSGBs and uSGBs) when compared to wild NHPs. Indeed, eight of the ten most prevalent human-associated SGBs found in at least five NHP samples (Additional file 9: Table S8 ) were recovered from the LiX_2018 and SrivathsanA_2015 datasets, the only two studies which surveyed the microbiome of NHPs in captivity. Accordingly, a high fraction of genomes reconstructed from the LiX_2018 captive dataset matches previously described species (64.2%), in contrast with an average of 7.0% ± 6.0% for the MAGs in wild datasets (Additional file 9: Table S8 ). Overall, these numbers suggest that the microbiome of captive animals is a rather poor representation of the real diversity of their microbiome in the wild and that exposure of NHPs to the human-associated environment and somehow humanlike diet and sanitary procedures can inflate the similarity between human and NHP microbiomes. Nevertheless, a few SGBs were consistently found in both wild and captive NHPs and shared with humans. These ten kSGBs and eight uSGBs mainly belonged to unclassified Firmicutes (n = 5) and uncharacterized Ruminococcus species (n = 4). Among the most prevalent in NHPs, the kSGBs of Treponema berlinense, Succinatimonas sp., Escherichia coli, and Prevotella sp. were consistently found in different host species spanning NHPs and humans and thus appear as key players in the primate gut microbiome.

The overlap in microbiome composition between wild NHPs and humans is mostly due to the sharing of SGBs characteristic of microbiomes of non-Westernized rather than Westernized human hosts. This is clear when observing that only 3 SGBs present in NHPs are enriched in prevalence in stool samples from Westernized populations (Fisher's test, Bonferroni-corrected p values < 0.05), in comparison with 41 SGBs enriched in non-Westernized datasets ( Fig. 3 and Additional file 10: Table S9 ). Even for those three SGBs associated with Westernized populations, the average prevalence in Westernized datasets was only 0.42%. The SGB found in NHPs that is most strongly associated with non-Westernized populations is Succinatimonas sp. (kSGB 3677, prevalence 41.6% in non-Westernized datasets, 1.3% in Westernized datasets; Fisher's test, Bonferronicorrected p value 2.74E−223, Fig. 3) , from a genus able to degrade plant sugars such as D-xylose, a monosaccharide present in hemicellulose and enriched in diets rich in plant products. The broader Succinatimonas genus-level cluster also had a prevalence of 48.05% in non-Westernized datasets and of 1.4% in Westernized ones (Fig. 2b) , in agreement both with the folivore diet of most NHPs considered here and with previous observations of enriched D-xylose degradation pathways in non-Westernized populations [54] . Overall, the 3 most prevalent genus-level genome bins in NHPs (2 from the Treponema genus and 1 from the Firmicutes, all > 10% Table S8 and Additional file 11: Table S10 prevalence in NHPs) had an average prevalence of 4.5% in non-Westernized and of 0.6% in Westernized populations (Fig. 2b ).

At the family-level, many Prevotella SGBs are both very prevalent in NHPs and in non-Westernized human populations. The overall Prevotellaceae family is the most prevalent in NHPs (36.55%), and its prevalence is even higher in non-Westernized human microbiomes (60.55%), while not reaching 20% in Westernized ones (Fig. 2c) . Consistently, 4 out of the 20 SGBs most associated with non-Westernized human populations belonged to the Prevotella genus (SGBs 1680, 1657, 1613, 1614,  Fig. 3 ) and were however retrieved only from the LiX_ 2018 dataset of captive Macaca fascicularis. Similarly, the only shared SGB assigned at the species level was Treponema succinifaciens (kSGB 3546), which was present in 8.22% of non-Westernized samples and in only 0.02% Westernized microbiomes ( Fig. 3 and Additional file 10: Table S9 ), but all of the samples were from the 2 datasets of NHPs in captivity (LiX_2018 and SrivathsanA_2015), supporting once again the observation that when well-characterized species are found in NHPs, these are usually from captive hosts. The family Spirochaetaceae, to which the genus Treponema belongs, was however prevalent also in wild NHPs (24.37%) and non-Westernized samples (13.67%), while being almost absent in Westernized ones (0.13%, Fig. 2c ). These data thus suggest that the level of similarity between human and NHP microbiomes depends not only on the host species but also on lifestyle variables that could be at least partially assessed both in NHPs (wild vs captive animals) and humans (Westernized vs non-Westernized populations).

More than two thirds (2186) of the MAGs recovered from NHPs (2985) belonged to the 1009 newly defined and previously unexplored SGBs (pSGBs) never found in human microbiomes so far. Some of these pSGBs seem to be key components of the NHP microbiome, with 6 of them (recapitulating 128 MAGs) within the 10 most prevalent SGBs in NHP microbiomes ( Fig. 2a and Additional file 9: Table S8 ). The distribution of pSGBs was however not homogeneous among datasets, with the LiX_2018 dataset being the one with the highest fraction of MAGs assigned to known species (23.5% of the MAGs assigned to kSGBs) and AmatoKR_2018 having 97.23% of the MAGs unassigned at the species level (56.57% unassigned at the family level, Fig. 1d ). This again reflects the different composition of the two datasets, with the captive Macaca fascicularis of the LiX_ Table S9) 2018 dataset fed with specific human-like diets [39] and the AmatoKR_2018 dataset spanning 18 NHP species living in the wild, which explains its high diversity (Fig. 1a) .

Many of the 1009 pSGBs were taxonomically unplaced even at higher taxonomic levels, with only 109 pSGBs assigned to a known microbial genus (10.8%, 241 MAGs, see the ""Methods"" section) and 386 pSGBs to a known microbial family (38.3%, 963 MAGs, Fig. 1d ). The 514 pSGBs (50.9%, 982 MAGs) that remained unassigned may represent new microbial clades above the level of the bacterial families (Fig. 1d) . The majority of these pSGBs unassigned even at the genus level or above were placed, based on genome similarity, into the 2 highly abundant human gut microbiome phyla of the Firmicutes (44.2% of the unassigned pSGBs, 514 total MAGs) and Bacteroidetes (30.9% of the unassigned pSGBs, 458 MAGs) with smaller fractions assigned to Proteobacteria (9.7%, 125 MAGs), Actinobacteria (5.5%, 108 MAGs), and Spirochaetes (2.8%, 37 MAGs). Because the dominance of the Bacteroides and Firmicutes phyla is quite consistent among the gut microbiomes of primates, it is thus at the species and genus level that most of the inter-host diversity is occurring, possibly as a consequence of host co-speciation or codiversification evolutionary dynamics.

To better taxonomically characterize these unassigned pSGBs, we grouped them into clusters spanning a genetic distance consistent with that of known genera and families [11] generating genus-level genome bins (GGBs) and family-level genome bins (FGBs). This resulted in the definition of 760 novel GGBs (73.6% of the total number of GGBs in NHP) and 265 novel FGBs (65.6% of all FGBs in NHP), with an increase of about 6% of the total GGBs and FGBs previously defined on reference genomes and > 154,000 human MAGs. Eight of the 10 most prevalent GGBs in NHP samples were part of this novel set of GGBs and were assigned to Coriobacteriales (36 MAGs), Bacteroidaceae (36 MAGs), and Prevotellaceae (33 MAGs) families. Among the most prevalent, only the 2 Treponema GGBs (42 MAGs from NHPs) were known and shared with humans (52 MAGs), mainly from non-Westernized populations (38 MAGs, Fig. 2b and Additional file 11: Table S10 ). On the contrary, all of the 10 most prevalent families were previously known and shared with humans (Additional file 11: Table S10 ). In the study of the overall diversity of the primate gut microbiome, it is thus key to consider the new sets of NHP gut microbes defined here that are largely belonging to novel microbial clades.

Despite the low overall degree of microbial sharing between human and non-human hosts at the species level, some bacterial families were common among primate hosts (Fig. 2c) and motivated a deeper phylogenetic analysis of their internal genetic structure. By using a phylogenetic modeling based on 400 single-copy universal markers [55] , we reconstructed the phylogeny and the corresponding genetic ordination analysis of the 5 most relevant shared FGBs (Fig. 2c) , which included 3 known families (Prevotellaceae, Bacteroidaceae, Spirochaetaceae), and 2 unexplored FGBs assigned to the Actinobacteria phylum and the Clostridiales order. We observed the presence of both intra-family host-specific clusters (Fig. 4a) and clusters comprising genomes spanning human and non-human hosts. The phylogeny of the Bacteroidetes reconstructed to include all of the MAGs and reference genomes for the 10 most prevalent characterized (kSGBs), uncharacterized (uSGBs), and newly reconstructed NHP-specific (pSGBs) species assigned to this phylum ( Fig. 4b and Additional file 2: Figure S2 ) further confirms the presence of closely related sister clades one of which is specific to wild NHPs and the other spanning multiple hosts, including NHPs in captivity. This likely reflects a complex evolutionary pattern in which vertical co-diversification [56, 57] , independent niche selection, and between-host species transmission are likely all simultaneously shaping the members of the gut microbiome of primates.

To further investigate the hypothesis of at least occasional paired primate-microbe co-diversification, we selected the taxonomically unassigned FGB 4487, which is the only FGB retrieved in this work that spans 3 out of the 4 main host clades (Lemuriformes, Platyrrhini, Cercopithecoidea, but no Hominoidea), including 15 MAGs reconstructed from 7 wild hosts from 6 countries. The phylogeny of FGB 4487 recapitulated the one of the hosts (Additional file 2: Figure S3 ), with different sameclade host species from different countries sharing the same SGB (e.g., different Alouatta species from 3 different countries sharing pSGB 20386) while being distinct from those found in other clades, thus supporting the hypothesis that host-microbiome co-diversification could have occurred at least for some bacterial clades.

We also analyzed the under-investigated phylum of the Elusimicrobia as species in this clade were already shown to span a wide range of host environments ranging from aquatic sites to termite guts [58] and were recently found relatively prevalent in non-Westernized human populations (15.4% prevalence) while almost absent in Westernized populations (0.31% prevalence) [11] . The phylum was clearly divided into two main clades (Additional file 2: Figure S4 ), with one including strains mostly from environmental sources or non-mammalian hosts and the other (already reported in Fig. 4c ) comprising all the MAGs from humans, NHPs, rumen, and the type strain of Elusimicrobium minutum [59] . The genomes from wild NHPs belonged to an unknown SGB detected also in humans (uSGB 19690) and to 2 pSGBs (pSGBs 20223 and 20224) not found in human hosts. These 2 NHP-specific Elusimicrobia are sister clades of a relatively prevalent human-associated SGB (SGB 19694 comprising 64 MAGs from humans, Fig. 4c ). Such closely related but host-specific sister clades might again reflect the evolutionary divergence of the hosts, while the presence of Elusimicrobia strains from macaques in captivity inside human-associated SGBs (Fig. 4c ) also confirms that these microbes can colonize different primate hosts.

The Treponema genus contains mostly non-pathogenic species commonly associated with the mammalian intestine and oral cavity [60] . Treponema species seem to be under particular negative selection forces in Westernized populations as multiple studies found them at much higher abundance and prevalence in non-Westernized populations [7, 11, 54, 61, 62] , and they were also identified in ancient coprolites [19] , and dental calculus of the Iceman mummy [63] . To better study its diversity and host association, we investigated the phylogeny of this genus considering all the genomes from NHPs and humans currently available (Fig. 1b) . The 221 total genomes included 27 available reference genomes and 220 MAGs (96 oral and 124 intestinal) spanning 54 Treponema SGBs. These genomes are grouped into 34 distinct SGBs previously reconstructed from human metagenomes and 20 pSGBs newly reconstructed and uniquely associated with NHPs.

Phylogenetic analysis (Fig. 5a) highlighted a clear and host-independent separation of oral and stool treponemas that is reflected at the functional level (Fig. 5b) , with Fig. 4 Strain-level phylogenetic analysis of relevant microbial clades found both in NHPs and human microbiomes. a Ordination analysis using multidimensional scaling (MDS) on intra-FGB phylogenetic distances for the five most prevalent FGBs shared by NHPs and humans (Fig. 2c) , showing both host-specific and shared clusters. b Phylogenetic tree of the ten most prevalent kSGBs, uSGBs, and pSGBs assigned to the Bacteroidetes phylum reported in Fig. 2a , with MAGs from wild NHPs in separate pSGB subtrees and captive NHPs clustering into SGBs shared with humans (uncollapsed tree in Additional file 2: Figure S2 ). c Phylogenetic tree of the Elusimicrobia phylum, with SGBs specifically associated with wild NHPs and others with humans and captive NHPs (uncollapsed tree in Additional file 2: Figure S4) oral species lacking several pathways encoded by SGBs recovered from stool samples. These included starch and sucrose metabolism, glycerolipid and glycerophospholipid metabolism, methane and sulfur metabolism, folate biosynthesis, and phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan biosynthesis (Additional file 2: Figure S5 ), consistently with the nutrients and carbon sources available in the 2 different body sites. Focusing on the intestinal species, the SGBs in this family were quite host-specific, with genomes recovered from different hosts clustering in specific subtrees (Fig. 5a) . This is for instance the case of uSGB 3548 and pSGB 21240 that, despite being phylogenetically related, were found only in humans and NHPs, respectively (Additional file 12: Table S11 ). Treponema succinifaciens (kSGB 3546) was instead an exception, as it was possible to reconstruct genomes for this species both from NHP microbiomes (11 MAGs) and (mostly) non-Westernized human stool microbiomes (45 MAGs, Fig. 5a , Additional file 12: Table  S11 ). However, the closely related uSGB 3545 was recovered only from NHPs (Papio cynocephalus) and could represent a species specifically adapted to the gut of these NHPs or the consequence of the host speciation. It is quite striking that only 11 Treponema MAGs were available from Westernized stool samples despite the large number of gut metagenomes analyzed for this category (7443 stool samples), whereas the same microbial genus was very prevalent in non-Westernized datasets (13.72% of non-Westernized samples, all but one non-Westernized datasets, Fig. 5a and Additional file 6: Table S5 ). This raises the hypothesis that Treponema species might have been living within the gut of their primate hosts for a long time and have remained with humans in the absence of lifestyle changes associated with urbanization [22] .

The host specificity of related Treponema species is evident also at the functional level (Fig. 5c) with several microbial pathways characterizing each species. When comparing the functional potential across hosts, we found for example that human strains were enriched for genes necessary for galactose metabolism (ko00052) and NHPs strains were instead encoding the pathway for the degradation of glucuronate-containing polymers (ko00040), highly present in hemicellulose (Fig. 5d) , consistently with the different nutritional regimes of humans and NHPs. Treponema species enriched in NHPs were however including a substantially lower number of annotated functions (1312 ± 375 in NHPs w.r.t. 1426 ± 423 UniRef50 in Westernized samples), pointing to the need of future efforts to experimentally characterize the genes in under-investigated NHP species. The Treponema genus overall appears to be a key member of the primate-wide gut microbiome, and for this reason, its striking disappearance in human Westernized populations suggests that changes in recent lifestyle variables might be responsible for the disruption of intestinal microbes possibly coevolving with our body since the evolutionary era of primate host diversification.

In this study, we expanded the fraction of characterized microbial diversity in the highly unexplored non-human primate metagenome, to enable species-and strain-level comparative genomics analysis of the human and nonhuman primate microbiome and generate hypotheses on relevant coevolutionary trajectories that shaped the current worldwide structure of the human microbiome. Through the application of strain-level single-sample de novo genome assembly on 203 NHP metagenomic samples, we uncovered over 1000 new SGBs expanding the catalog of microbial species recovered from non-human primates by 77% and improving the mappability of NHP metagenomes by over 600%. These newly assembled genomes contributed to the identification of 760 new genus-level and 265 family-level genome bins that represent completely uncharacterized microbial clades never observed in humans. Compared to the over 150,000 MAGs available from human metagenomes [11] and because of multiple primate hosts that need to be studied, the NHP microbiome still remains undersampled.

Despite the genomes assembled from metagenomes are not free from assembly problems [64, 65] and should be considered for complementing rather than substituting those obtained from isolate sequencing, large-scale metagenomic assembly efforts to mine available metagenomic data showed to be crucial to uncover the whole diversity of environment-specific microbiomes [11, 66, 67] , especially in these under-investigated hosts. Indeed, given the efficiency of metagenomic assembly pipelines [67, 68] and the availability of complementary tools to explore the microbial diversity in a microbiome [69, 70] , the limiting factor appears to be the technical difficulties in sampling primates in the wild.

The newly established collection of NHP microbial species showed that at the fine-grained taxonomic resolution, there is little overlap between the gut microbiomes of humans and NHPs, with 6% of the overall species found in wild NHP that were identified at least once in human microbiomes. Captive NHPs exposed to more human-like environments and diets showed instead higher species sharing with humans (49%) and a higher degree of metagenome mappability. On the other hand, microbiomes from wild NHPs overlapped comparatively much more (163%) with human populations adopting non-Westernized rather than Westernized lifestyles. Because lifestyle patterns appear to have an impact on the structure of the gut microbiome comparable in effect size to that of the primate host species, NHP and potentially ancient microbiome samples [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] are thus more suitable for host-microbe coevolutionary analyses as they are likely less confounded by recent lifestyle changes.

Our strain-level investigations of specific taxonomic clades (Figs. 4 and 5) showed the presence of both species with strains spanning multiple hosts and of sister species associated with different primates. While the former is suggestive of recent inter-host transmission or common acquisition from common sources, the second can be the basis to study microbial evolution or diversification as a consequence of host speciation, especially if phylogenies can be dated using ancient microbiome samples [71] or other time constraints [72] . Our framework can thus be exploited to study inter-host species and zoonotic microbial transmission that is currently mostly limited to specific pathogens of interest [73] [74] [75] [76] [77] [78] . The catalog of primate-associated microbial genomes can thus serve as a basis for a better comprehension of the human microbiome in light of recent and ancient cross-primate transmission and environmental acquisition of microbial diversity.

In our meta-analysis, we considered and curated 6 publicly available gut metagenomic datasets ( Fig. 1a and Additional file 1: Table S1 ) spanning 22 non-human primate (NHP) species from 14 different countries in 5 continents (Additional file 2: Figure S1 ) and metagenomic samples from healthy individuals from 47 datasets included in the curatedMetagenomicData package [79] . In total, our study considers 203 metagenomic samples from the gut of NHPs and 9428 human metagenomes from different body sites.

The non-human primate datasets were retrieved from 4 studies considering wild animals and 2 studies surveying animals in captivity. All but 1 study produced gut metagenomes of 1 single host species. One work [41] instead analyzed the gut microbiome of 18 species of wild NHPs from 9 countries (Fig. 1a and Additional file 1: Table S1 ) to test the influence of folivory on its composition and function and highlighted that host phylogeny has a stronger influence than diet. With a similar approach, [30] shotgun sequenced 19 wild western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) in the Republic of the Congo as part of a 16S rRNA study including sympatric chimpanzees and modern human microbiomes that demonstrated the compositional divergence between the primate clades' microbiome and the seasonal shift in response to changing dietary habits throughout the year. Orkin et al. [40] exposed similar seasonal patterns linked with water and food availability by surveying the microbiome of 20 wild white-faced capuchin monkeys (Cebus capucinus imitator) in Costa Rica. Tung et al. [37] instead found that social group membership and networks are good predictors of the taxonomic and functional structure of the gut microbiome by surveying 48 wild baboons (Papio cynocephalus) in Kenya. Studies in captivity instead include [38] , who sequenced the gut microbiome of 2 red-shanked doucs langurs (Pygathrix nemaeus) in captivity that were fed a specific mix of plants to test for the ability of metabarcoding vs metagenomics to identify the plants eaten by the primates from the feces, and [39] , who surveyed the change in microbiome composition and function in 20 cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fascicularis) fed either a high-fat and low-fiber or a low-fat and high-fiber diet and showed that the first provoked a change toward a more humanlike microbiome. Despite the relevance of these 6 works, none of them attempted at reconstructing novel microbial genomes from NHPs.

To define known species-level genome bins (kSGBs), we considered the 80,853 annotated genomes (here referred to as reference genomes) available as of March 2018 in the NCBI GenBank database [80] . These comprise both complete (12%) and draft (88%) genomes. Draft genomes include also metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) and co-abundance gene groups (CAGs).

As a preliminary explorative test, taxonomic profiling was performed with MetaPhlAn2 [81] with default parameters. Additional profiling was performed by using the parameter ""-t rel_ab_w_read_stats"" in order to estimate the read mappability for each profiled species.

In order to reconstruct microbial genomes for both characterized and yet-to-be-characterized species, we applied a single-sample metagenomic assembly and contig binning approach we described and validated elsewhere [11] . Briefly, assemblies were produced with MEGAHIT [42] , and contigs longer than 1000 nt were binned with MetaBAT2 [82] to produce 7420 MAGs. Quality control with CheckM 1.0.7 [83] yielded 1033 high-quality MAGs (completeness > 90%, contamination < 5% as described in [11] ) and 1952 medium-quality MAGs (completeness > 50% and contamination < 5%). Extensive validation of the MAG reconstruction procedure employed here has been previously validated in [11] by comparing MAGs with isolate genomes obtained from the very same biological sample, including different bacterial species and sample types. This analysis showed that genomes recovered through metagenomic assembly are, at least for the tested cases, almost identical to those obtained with isolate sequencing. Moreover, the specific choices for the use of assemblers, binners, and quality control procedures and of their parameters was proven sound with respect to similar efforts using only partially overlapping methodologies by independent investigations [46] .

After metagenomic assembly and binning, MAGs were clustered at 5% genetic distance based on whole-genome nucleotide similarity estimation using Mash (version 2.0; option ""-s 10000"" for sketching) [84] . Overall, we obtained 99 kSGBs containing at least 1 reference genome retrieved from NCBI GenBank [80] , 200 uSGBs lacking a reference genome but clustering together with genomes reconstructed in [11] , and 1009 pSGBs consisting of 2186 genomes (73.23% of MAGs recovered from NHPs) newly reconstructed in this study (Fig. 1c) . However, even when using a 10% genetic distance to define new SGBs, the ratio of MAGs assigned to pSGBs remained very high with respect to the total MAGs recovered from NHPs (63.75%). SGBs were further clustered into genuslevel genome bins (GGBs) and family-level genome bins (FGBs) spanning 15% and 30% genetic distance, respectively.

Phylogenies were reconstructed using the newly developed version of PhyloPhlAn [55] . The phylogenetic trees in Figs. 1b and 4c are based on the 400 universal markers as defined in PhyloPhlAn [55] and have been built using the following set of parameters: ""--diversity high --fast --remove_fragmentary_entries --fragmentary_ threshold 0.67 --min_num_markers 50 --trim greedy"" and ""--diversity low --accurate --trim greedy --force_nucleotides,"" respectively.

From the reconstructed phylogeny in Fig. 1b , we extracted the SGBs falling into the Treponema subtree, including also pSGBs. We then applied PhyloPhlAn 2 on all reference genomes and human and non-human primates microbial genomes belonging to the extracted SGBs to produce the phylogenetic tree reported in Fig. 5a [with params --diversity low --trim greedy --min_num_ marker 50].

External tools with their specific options as used in the PhyloPhlAn framework are as follows:

diamond (version v0.9.9.110 [85] ) with parameters: ""blastx --quiet --threads 1 --outfmt 6 --moresensitive --id 50 --max-hsps 35 -k 0"" and with parameters: ""blastp --quiet --threads 1 --outfmt 6 --more-sensitive --id 50 --max-hsps 35 -k 0"" mafft (version v7.310 [86] ) with the ""--anysymbol"" option trimal (version 1.2rev59 [87] ) with the ""-gappyout"" option FastTree (version 2.1.9 [88] ) with ""-mlacc 2 -slownni -spr 4 -fastest -mlnni 4 -no2nd -gtr -nt"" options RAxML (version 8.1.15 [89] ) with parameters: ""-m PROTCATLG -p 1989"" Trees in Figs. 1b and 5a were visualized with GraPh-lAn [90] . The phylogenetic tree of the primates was obtained from [44] , manually pruned with iTOL [91] to report only species considered in this study, and visualized with FigTree v.1.4.3 [92] .

We estimated the percentage of raw reads in each sample that could align to known bacterial genomes, SGBs, and pSGBs using a previously described method (Pasolli et al. [11] ). Briefly, each raw metagenome was subsampled at 1% to reduce the computational cost of mapping. Subsampled reads were filtered to remove alignments to the human genome (hg19). Short (i.e., lower than 70 bp) and low-quality (mean sequencing quality < 20) reads were discarded.

Each sample was mapped against the three groups of indexes: (i) a set of 80,990 reference genomes used to define the set of known SGBs in [11] , (ii) the 154,753 known and unknown SGBs from [11] , and (iii) the 1009 SGBs from NHPs reconstructed in this study. The mapping was performed with BowTie2 [93] v. 2.3.5 in endto-end mode. The mapping was performed incrementally (i.e., reads that are reported to map against pSGBs do not map against any reference genome or human SGB). Additionally, BowTie2 alignments scoring less than − 20 (tag AS:i) were excluded, to avoid overestimating the number of mapping reads. The mappability fraction was calculated by dividing the number of aligning reads by the number of high-quality reads within each sample.

Metagenome-assembled genomes reconstructed in this study were annotated with Prokka 1.12 [94] using default parameters. Proteins inferred with Prokka were then functionally annotated with UniRef90 and UniRef50 using diamond v0.9.9.110 [85] .

KEGG Orthology (KO) for the UniRef50 annotations was retrieved from the UniProt website using the Retrieve/ID mapping tool. KOs related to the metabolism were filtered and used to produce a presence/absence matrix for generating Fig. 5d and Additional file 2: Figure S5 . Non-metric multidimensional scaling plots were generated using the Jaccard distance with the metaMDS function in the vegan R package [95] .

Statistical significance was verified through Fisher's test with multiple hypothesis testing corrections with either Bonferroni or FDR as reported in the text.

v irus Research Evolutionary implications of genetic variations in the Sl gene of infectious bronchitis virus,"The large number of phenotypically distinct strains of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) provide a broad genetic background for examining naturally occurring coronavirus variation. Comparisons of the published nucleotide sequence of Sl genes of strains isolated in Europe, Japan and the USA and four additional American strains described in this report identified 4 genetically distinct groups. The Dutch group was the most divergent sharing only about 60% identity with the American, Mass and European groups which were about 80% homologous with each other. Whereas the strains within the Mass, European and Dutch strains were at least 95% homologous, the strains within the American group were most variable, sharing about 80% identity. The h~e~ariable region (HVR) which tended to correlate with serotype extended from amino acid residue 53 to 148. In addition to the previously described putative recombination events in the Sl gene of PP14 and SE17, we have now described similar shifts in homology in the corresponding gene of the Gray, Holte, 6/82 (European strain), and Iowa strains. Although minor cross-over sites were identified in the more conserved 3' end at approximately nt 1000 and 1400, a frequently used hot-spot for re~mbination extended from nt 25 to a region immediately upstream of, but not including, the hypervariable region (HVR). In addition to point mutations, deletions, and insertions, recombination often involving Mass-like and Ark-like sequences, is a commonly used mechanism responsible for the evolution of IBV.","In spite of the routine use of vaccines, infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) outbreaks continue to occur in vaccinated fowl (Gelb, 1989; personal observations) . These outbreaks often are the result of infections with strains that differ serologitally from the vaccine strain. The major neutralization epitopes which determine the serologic distinction of IBV are thought to map to the Sl (Cavanagh et al., 1986; Parr and Collisson, 19931 . Genetic diversity among serotypes and even within a serologic group was first indicated by RNA fingerprint analyses (Clewley et al., 1981; Butcher et al., 1990) . However, specific regions of variability, as well as phylogenetic relationships of IBV strains, have been identified by nucleotide sequence analyses (Cavanagh et al., 1988; Kusters et al., 1989) .

The large number of phenotypically distinct strains of IBV provide a broad genetic background to examine naturally occurring variation associated with outbreaks of coronavirus induced disease. Variations resulting in evolutionary changes are both a consequence of modifications in the genome and the result of environmental pressures placed on the virus. Factors determining genetic variability of coronaviruses include point mutations and recombination events. The lack of proof-reading in RNA polymerases is thought to be responsible for the high frequencies of point mutations among the RNA viruses, and provides a mechanism for antigenic and pathogenic evolution (Holland et al., 1982) . More rapid modifications in the genetic composition of many viruses, including coronaviruses, may occur as a result of recombination events (Lai, 1992) . Under experimental conditions, both in vitro and in vivo, RNA recombination between mouse coronavirus genomes in the presence and absence of selective biological pressure has been well documented (Lai et al., 1985; Makino et al., 1986; Banner and Lai, 1991; Liao and Lai, 1992) . Such exchanges of genetic information could be a critical mechanism for the survival of coronaviruses in nature. A consequence of rapid variation could be the frequent occurrence of IBV-related disease in vaccinated animals (personal observations). In fact, recombination events in the Sl involving serologically distinct Ark-like and Mass-like strains have been shown to occur in naturally evolving IBV strains that have been implicated with severe disease in chickens immunized with a Mass-like vaccine (Wang et al., 1993) . The role of recombination in the evolution of IBV in the field and the mechanisms responsible for such exchanges of genetic information have not been determined.

The entire Sl gene of the nephropathogenic Gray (GenBank accession number L18989) and Holte (GenBank accession numbers L18988), and the respiratory isolates Conn (GenBank accession numbers L18990) and Iowa609 were cloned and sequenced compared with all corresponding published sequences in order to determine the phylogenetic relationship of these viruses and to elucidate possible mechanisms for variation @need et al., 1989) . The cDNA was synthesized using PCR with genomic RNA (Wang et al., 1993; Williams et al., 1992; Chomczynski and Sacchi, 1987) . The primers used for the PCR, GAACCATCAGGTTTTATA-CAAAAC and AAACTGAACAAAAGACAGACTTAG (Biosynthesis Inc. Denton, TX), corresponded to a conserved region upstream and downstream of Sl gene, respectively. The PCR products were cloned into the PCR II TA Cloning Vector and sequenced (Sambrook et al., 1989 ; Strategene, La Jolla, CA; Sequenase Version 2.0 Sequencing Kit, USB, Cleveland, OH). Standard forward and reverse primers were used to initiate the sequence from both ends. Additional primers were made according to acquired sequences in order to 'walk through the Sl genes. Several clones were sequenced for each strain to ensure fidelity.

The viruses represented had been isolated from the USA, the United Kingdom, Holland and Japan during a period of at least 55 years. The Pileup program in the GCG package (University of Wisconsin Computer Group), version 7.3 was used to align both the nucleotide and amino sequences and to generate a similarity plot. Phylogenetic analyses were performed using Paup 3.1 (Smithsonian Institution, Washington, DC) to construct four heuristic trees, which displayed minor differences only at the terminal branches (data not shown), and a bootstrap tree (Fig. 1) . The resulting computer consensus of the heuristic trees (tree length = 2036, consistency index = 0.637) was nearly identical with the bootstrap tree. The overall relationship of Sl suggested these strains could be placed in four genetically defined groups. The Dutch strains included D1466 (Davelaar et al., 1984; Kuster et al., 1989) and V1397 (Kuster et al., 19891 , the American strains, Ark99 (Field, 1973; Wang et al., 19931, PP14 (Wang et al., 19931, Holte (Winterfield et al., 1962) , Gray (Winterfield et al., 1962) , SE17 (Hopkins, 1969; Wang et al., 1993) and Iowa609 (Hofstad, 1958) ; European strains, D3896 (Davelaar et al., 1984; Koch and Kant, 1990) , D207 (Cook, 1983; Kuster et al., 1989) , 6-82 (Cook, 1983; Matthew et al., 1986) , UK-82, UK-86, UK-84 , and Massachusetts, H120 (Cavanagh et al., 1988; Kusters et al., 19891, Kb8523 (Sutou et al., 19881, Beau (Beaudette et al., 1937; Binn et al., 1985) , M41 (Van Roekel et al., 1951; Matthew et al., 1986) and Conn (Jungherr et al., 1956) . With the exception of the Mass group, from which many strains have been attenuated and used routinely as vaccines around the world, the classifications corresponded with the geographic origin of the strains within a group.

The Sl genes, which varied from 1 to 40% among the strains examined, indicated that point mutations, deletions, insertions and recombination events all contribute to the evolution of IBV. The Mass, European and Dutch phylogenetic classifications corresponded with the overall percent identity. The Mass group, which was genetically homologous but geographically the most diverse group, included the commonly used vaccine strains originating from the M41 and Holland. Within the Mass group, the serologically close M41, Beaudette and Holland strains were found to also be genetically closely related with l-4% differences among them. However, the Conn and KB8523 strains known to be serologically distinct from M41 were also 95 and 97% homologous, respectively. The strikingly high 99.3% homology between H120 and KB8523 implied an even closer genetic relationship. The two isolates in the Dutch group, D1466 and V1397, shared 96% sequence homology and 5 unique deletions or insertions with each other, but shared only about 60% homology with the remaining IBV strains.

The nucleotide sequences of the European strains varied only l-3% among each other and 80% homology with viruses in the Mass or American groups. The European strains have been shown to be serologically distinguishable by viral neutralization assays (Koch and Cavanagh, 1991 tributed throughout the genome, antigenic differences in this group probably originated from a common source as a result of accumulated point mutations. Therefore, assuming that Sl defines serotype, single base mutations can apparently play a critical role in the generation of the serologically distinct but genetically closely related strains.

The American viruses seemed to best illustrate the potential for variation in field situations. While the sequences of Dutch, European and Mass strains are relatively conserved within the individual groups, the overall percent identities of the American group is much more diversified. The sequence homologies of the American strains were about 80% within the group, as well as 80% with the Mass and European strains. The common origin of the American strains was suggested by the presence of similar deletions, insertions and clusters of nucleotide sequences, such as those found at nt 423-440, 180-183 and 72-134, respectively. The heterologous insertion located at nt 423 was also present in the Dutch but absent in the European and Mass strains.

The American group viruses, representing the most recently isolated IBV in the USA, not only have a common geographic origin within North America, but the genetic relationship of the American strains correlated with the temporal appearance of the strains in nature. The Iowa was isolated earliest and was genetically the most distant of these viruses with the Gray, Holte and JMK, which has been shown to be nearly identical to Gray, forming a second subgroup, and the Ark-related strains representing the latest isolations (Wang et al., 1993; personal observations) .

The inclusion of the American strains better defined the previously described hypervariable sequences (Niesters et al., 1986; Kusters et al., 1989) . The greatest divergence in the amino acid sequence was concentrated between residues 53 and 148 (Fig. 2) . This HVR was actually biphasic with a short, relatively conserved peptide lying between residues 100 and 119. Differences in the HVR region could be found between strains that were genetically close but antigenically distinct (Cavanagh et al., 1988) . The HVR region of Sl extending from amino acid residues 50-148 was somewhat shorter than that described by Kusters et al., (1989) . Niesters et al. (1986) identified two HVR regions within the closely related Mass strains at positions 56-69 and 117-133 from the beginning of the Sl. In spite of the variations in the HVR, all five cysteines were conserved and four putative glycosylation sites; two flanking and two within this region. The conservation of glycosylation sites and a number of residues within the HVR region may reflect critical structural or functional features of the Sl protein.

Serotype differences among the genetically distinct IBV generally correlated with variations in the HVR (Cavanagh et al., 1988) . The only concentration of variations between the serologically distinct Conn and the Mass strains were found in this region. Likewise, sequence variations among strains of the serologically different European and Mass groups were concentrated in this region. It is apparent from the sequence alignment that the 5% variation among Mass serotype strains were spread throughout the Sl gene, but the 2-3% alterations among the serologically distinct UK-82, 84 and 86 were focused in the HVR region. Sequence differences concentrated in the HVR of the Conn and Mass may explain the serotype distinction of these otherwise genetically very closely related viruses. Because only two amino acid differences could be found between the Kb8523 and Beaudette, it was suggested that the serotype difference between these strains might be explained by a variable region found in the S2 of Kb8.523 (Sutou et al., 1988) . The phylogenetic tree and overall sequence comparisons of the entire Sl genes do not reflect localized sequence variations or dramatic shifts in homology. Potential recombination as indicated by shifts in the sequence of a high percentage of homolo~ with one virus to a high percentage of homology with a second virus could be identified in the diverse American group and within the more homologous European and Mass groups (Table 1) .

Overall, the Sl of the nephropathogenic Gray was closest to the less recent SE17 isolate with 87% identity, and was 83% identical with the M41 strain. However, the first 20 bases and at least 91 bases upstream of the Gray Sl in the adjacent polymerase gene were 93% homologous to the M41. Whereas divergence between the M41 and Gray sequences occurred between nucleotides 20 and 72 with 65% identity, the sequence between nucleotides 73 and 131 were again 92% identical. A region between 1030 and 1373 was also closer to M41 with 97% homology. Holte, another nephropathogenic strain, classified in the same serologic cluster as Gray (Hopkins, 1974) , but a distant variant according to the nucleotide sequences, is also a possible recombinant virus. Although the Sl of Holte and Ark99 shared 92% homology in the 71 bases at the 5' end of the Sl gene, only 73% identity was found in the next 500 bases. No region of relative similarity could be found between the Holte and other known IBV strains. The 5' 67 bases of the Iowa609 strain was close to Ark whereas the region from 68 to 131 was 95% homologous with M41. The region downstream of nucleotide 131 differed from either strain.

Evidence for homology shifts were also found in the Sl gene of the European isolates which are geneticalfy homologous throughout the gene. From the available sequences of these isolates, the region which included 81 bases upstream of the Sl start codon and 71 bases downstream of the start codon of the S gene were 92% identical with Ark99 and 79% with M41. However, for the next 60 bases, the European isolates were 97-100% identical with M41, and were only 80% identical with the Ark99. Both Ark and Mass related strains were very likely involved in the evoiution of the 6/82 related European isolates.

Although the Sl of the Corm strain was 95% identical with M41, a region from 153 to 219 was only 60% homologous with Mass, but differed even more from Ark99 (40% identity). The sequence variations were clustered throughout this region with intermittent sequences maintaining strong homology with M41. Therefore, this region may have evolved as a result of point mutations, rather than recombination. Because the variable sequences within the HVR were integrated among sequences that were nearly identical between Mass and Conn, it may be less likely that the variation can be explained by recombination than by accumulation of point mutations.

A map of shifts in sequence homology is shown in Fig. 3 . Although the European strains appeared to be highly conserved among each other, they shared regions that were similar to both the Ark and M41 strains and may have shared common ancestors, evolving through recombination events involving both of these U.S. strains. Ark-like and Mass-like sequences have been identified in the Sl genes of 6 American viruses, as well as the European strains. A number of recombinants from earlier isolates were identified with genome fragments that were similar to Ark. Since Ark actually was isolated somewhat later than the SE17, Iowa and Holte, the shared Ark-like segments probably originated from a strain that evolved before Ark. This common ancestor apparently continues to play a dominant role in the evolution of IBV because the most recent U.S. strains such as PP14, and the unpublished 4121 and 4628, isolated from 1992 to 1993 were found to be genetically closest to Ark (Wang et al., 1993; persona1 observations) . Mass-like sequences were also commonly found in potential recombinant strains. The presence of Mass-like segments in the American strains, as well as the European strains, suggested that recombination provides a prominent mechanism for the Mass derived vaccines to directly influence the evolution of IBV.

More than one recombination event appeared to have participated in the generation of at least five of the six strains shown. Putative recombination sites were most often identified tying about 131 bases from the start codon of the Sl

Origin and Evolution of Viruses,"Quasispecies theory is providing a solid, evolving conceptual framework for insights into virus population dynamics, adaptive potential, and response to lethal mutagenesis.","The complexity of mutant spectra can infl uence disease progression and viral pathogenesis, as demonstrated using virus variants selected for increased replicative fi delity. Complementation and interference exerted among components of a viral quasispecies can either reinforce or limit the replicative capacity and disease potential of the ensemble. In particular, a progressive enrichment of a replicating mutant spectrum with interfering mutant genomes prompted by enhanced mutagenesis may be a key event in the sharp transition of virus populations into error catastrophe that leads to virus extinction. Fitness variations are infl uenced by the passage regimes to which viral populations are subjected, notably average fi tness decreases upon repeated bottleneck events and fi tness gains upon competitive optimization of large viral populations. Evolving viral quasispecies respond to selective constraints by replication of subpopulations of variant genomes that display higher fi tness than the parental population in the presence of the selective constraint. This has been profusely documented with fi tness effects of mutations associated with resistance of pathogenic viruses to antiviral agents. In particular, selection of HIV-1 mutants resistant to one or multiple antiretroviral inhibitors, and the compensatory effect of mutations in the same genome, offers a compendium of the molecular intricacies that a virus can exploit for its survival. This chapter reviews the basic principles of quasispecies dynamics as they can serve to explain the behavior of viruses.

* Dedicated to Manfred Eigen on the occasion of his 80th birthday, for the insights that his pioneer studies have represented for virology.

The quasispecies theory of molecular evolution was fi rst proposed to describe the error-prone replication, self-organization, and adaptability of primitive replicons such as those thought to have populated the earth some 4000 million years before the present ( Eigen, 1971 ( Eigen, , 1992 Eigen and Schuster, 1979 ; see Chapter 1). Quasispecies was formulated initially as a deterministic theory involving mutant distributions of infinite population size in equilibrium. Extensions and generalizations to ensembles of genomes of fi nite population size replicating in changing environments have been developed ( Eigen, 2000 ; Wilke et al. , 2001a Wilke et al. , , 2001b Saakian and Hu, 2006 ) . Virologists use the term "" viral quasispecies "" to mean complex distributions of non-identical but closely related viral genomes subjected to genetic variation, competition and selection, and which act as a unit of selection (reviewed in different chapters of Domingo, 2006 ) . More simple and general, a quasispecies has been defi ned as a population of similar genomes ( Nowak, 2006 ) . Quasispecies dynamics is most clearly manifested in systems such as RNA viruses that display short duplication times, generally high fecundity, and errorprone replication, traits that have been maintained despite a probable ancient origin of most extant RNA viruses in coevolution with a cellular world. Increasing numbers of careful analyses of viral populations have supported quasispecies dynamics for animal and plant RNA viruses (for recent examples see Ge et al. , 2007 ; Zhang et al. , 2007 and references included in these articles; see also other chapters of this book).

As discussed by Villarreal in Chapter 21, there are two main hypotheses regarding the origin of RNA viruses and other RNA genetic elements: that they are remnants of an ancient RNA world, or that they are modern derivatives of cells, originated in cellular RNAs that acquired autonomous replication. Viroids and other subviral RNA replicons may be direct descendants of early RNA (or RNA-like) replicons that preceded an organized cellular world ( Robertson et al. , 1992 ) (Chapter 2). Cells and viruses share a considerable number of essential functional domains or modules: polymerases, proteases, enzymes involved in nucleotide and nucleic acid metabolism, etc. However, on the basis of key proteins involved in viral replication, that are absent in cells, and also based on the evidence of extensive genetic exchange between diverse viruses, the concept of an ancient virus world has been proposed ( Koonin et al. , 2006 ) . A primordial pool of genetic elements could have been the ancestor of viral and cellular genes. Cells and viruses share a ubiquitous ability to modify, lose, or acquire new genes or gene segments through genomic rearrangements, insertions, deletions, and other recombination events. Shuffl ing of functional modules among cells, viruses, and other replicons (plasmids, episomes, transposons, retrotransposons) is probably a frequent occurrence through fusion, transfection, conjugation, and other types of horizontal gene transfers ( Botstein, 1980 ; Hickey and Rose, 1988 ; Zimmern, 1988 ; Davis, 1997 ; Holland and Domingo, 1998 ; Bushman, 2002 ) . Sequence comparisons strongly suggest that all extant viruses have deep, ancient evolutionary roots ( Gorbalenya, 1995 ; Villarreal, 2005 ) (Chapter 21).

One of the critical features that distinguishes cells from viruses is the difference in the complexity of their genetic material, even after accounting for repeated DNA in animal and plant cells. Complexity in this case means the amount of genetic information encoded in their genetic material. A typical mammalian cell includes a number of chromosomes amounting to a total of about 3 ϫ 10 9 base pairs (bp) of DNA. The chromosomal DNA of Escherichia coli has a complexity of about 4 ϫ 10 6 bp. In contrast, RNA viruses have genomes in the range of 3.0 ϫ 10 3 to 3.2 ϫ 10 4 nucleotides. Point mutation rates for eukaryotic cells have been estimated to be in the range of 10 Ϫ 10 Ϫ 10 Ϫ 11 substitutions per nucleotide (s/nt), while for bacterial cells, values may reach up to 10 Ϫ 9 s/nt ( Friedberg et al. , 2006 ) . Mutation rates for a number of genomic sites of RNA viruses, determined using both genetic and biochemical procedures, are in the range of 10 Ϫ 3 Ϫ 10 Ϫ 5 s/nt ( Drake, 1993 ; Drake et al. , 1998 ; Drake and Holland, 1999 ; Domingo, 2007 ) (Chapter 7). Despite mutation rates varying with a number of environmental parameters, the above values mean that, in the process of RNA replication or retrotranscription, each progeny genomic molecule of about 10 kb will contain on average 0.1 to several mutations. These determinations of mutation rates and frequencies suggest that even the viral progeny of a single infected cell will be genetically heterogeneous ( Domingo et al. , 1978 ; Holland et al. , 1982 ; Temin, 1989 Temin, , 1993 Domingo, 2006 Domingo, , 2007 ; see also other chapters of this book).

Penetration into the composition of mutant spectra, either by determining the nucleotide sequence of many clones from the same population, or by other "" diving "" strategies, has quantitated large genotypic and phenotypic diversity within mutant spectra ( Duarte et al. , 1994a ( Duarte et al. , , 1994b Nájera et al. , 1995 ; Marcus et al. , 1998 ; Pawlotsky et al. , 1998 ; Quiñones-Mateu et al. , 1998 ; Wyatt et al. , 1998 ; Fernandez et al. , 2007 ; Garcia-Arriaza et al. , 2007 ; Ge et al. , 2007 ; Zhang et al. , 2007 ) . Diversity can extend to multiple mutant and recombinant genomes within an infected organ, and even within a single infected cell. Diversity of genetic forms is a prerequisite for evolution, including the major transitions undergone by our biosphere ( Eigen, 1992 ; Maynard Smith and Szathmary, 1995 ) . RNA viruses have an exhuberant diversity to offer as a substrate for evolution. A virus population, by virtue of consisting of dynamic mutant spectra rather than a defi ned genomic sequence, has the potential to adapt readily to a range of environments.

One of the predictions of quasispecies dynamics of RNA viruses is the existence of an error threshold, defi ned as an average copying fi delity value at which a transition between an organized mutant spectrum and sequences lacking information contents occurs (reviewed in Eigen and Schuster, 1979 ; Eigen and Biebricher, 1988 ; Biebricher and Eigen, 2005 ; Nowak, 2006 ; Chapters 1 and 9) . This transition has been coined "" entry into error catastrophe, "" a term fi rst used by L. Orgel to describe errors during protein synthesis that could contribute to a collapse of cellular regulatory networks in the process of aging ( Orgel, 1963 ) . Both, the concept expressed by Orgel and the one applied to genetic information of viruses address deterioration of meaningful information with a biological consequence, due to errors in an informational macromolecule. The error threshold relationship establishes a limitation for the maximum complexity of genetic information that can be stably maintained by a replicon displaying a given copying accuracy (Chapter 1). Theoretical calculations of the range of mutation rates that should be compatible with maintenance of the information carried by the simple RNA bacteriophages were compatible with the mutation rates and frequencies found experimentally (compare Batschelet et al. , 1976 ; Domingo et al. , 1976 , 1978 , with Eigen and Schuster, 1979 Eigen and Biebricher, 1988 ) . In addition to intrinsic copying fi delity levels of viral polymerases, other biochemical features of virus replication may have evolved to preserve a minimal replication accuracy. It has been hypothesized that the "" rule of six "" (genome of polyhexameric length) in Mononegavirales that edit their phosphoprotein mRNA, may have evolved to prevent the negative effects of illegitimate editing that could result in error catastrophe ( Kolakofsky et al. , 2005 ) . Some biological systems exploit enhanced mutagenesis as a defense mechanism against invading molecular parasites. A mechanism known as "" repeatinduced point mutations (RIP) "" operates in some fi lamentous fungi such as Neurospora crassa resulting in the production of mutations in repeat DNA copies that penetrate into the cells ( Bushman, 2002 ; Galagan and Selker, 2004 ) . Also, the APOBEC3 family of cytidine deaminases are innate immunity factors that induce hypermutation in retroviral DNA. Such activities can be regarded as a form of natural "" error catastrophe "" against retroviral genomes (see Chapter 8). Thus, a mutagenesis-based antiviral approach to drive virus to extinction has a parallel in natural mechanims which have contributed to the survival of organisms in the face of perturbing molecular parasites.

Increased genetic complexity as is embodied in cells required a correspondingly higher copying accuracy of the genetic material. This appears to have been accomplished with a number of pathways for post-replicative repair mechanisms as well as with the acquisition of a 3 Ј -5 Ј proofreading-repair exonuclease activity by most cellular DNA polymerases ( Goodman and Fygenson, 1998 ) . No evidence of a 3 Ј -5 Ј exonuclease activity in viral RNA polymerases and reverse transcriptases has been obtained from either biochemical or structural studies with viral enzymes ( Steinhauer et al. , 1992 ; Ferrer-Orta et al. , 2006 ) . A possible exception was presented in an early report by ( Ishihama et al. , 1986 ) showing that the infl uenza virus RNA polymerase was able to remove excess GMP residues added to a capped oligonucleotide primer. A 3 Ј -end repair mechanism has been described in a satellite RNA of the plant virus turnip crinkle carmovirus, involving synthesis of short oligoribonucleotides by the viral replicase using the 3 Ј -end of the viral genome as template, and, probably, template-independent priming at the 3 Ј -end of the damaged RNA to generate wild-type, negative strand, satellite RNA ( Nagy et al. , 1997 ) . Also, some coronaviruses encode a polymerase which includes a 3 Ј -5 Ј exonucleolytic activity (i.e. nsp14 of SARS) ( Minskaia et al. , 2006 ) . In the coronavirus murine hepatitis virus, mutations in the MSP14 exoribonuclease decreased replication fi delity (Eckerle et al ., 2007) .

The limitations imposed on average mutation rates to maintain the genetic information transmitted by simple RNA replicons ( Swetina and Schuster, 1982 ; Eigen and Biebricher, 1988 ; Nowak and Schuster, 1989 ) (Chapter 1) encouraged the fi rst experiments to investigate whether chemical mutagenesis was detrimental to RNA virus replication. The fi rst studies indicated that chemical mutagenesis could increase the mutation frequency by at most three-fold at defi ned genomic sites of poliovirus (PV) and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) , and 13-fold in the case of a retroviral vector ( Pathak and Temin, 1992 ) . Also, increased mutagenesis had an adverse effect on fi tness recovery of VSV clones ( Lee et al. , 1997 ) . These early results suggested that RNA viruses replicate near the error catastrophe threshold, with a copying fi delity that allows a generous production of error copies. Additional studies in cell culture and in vivo have established that enhanced mutagenesis can result in virus extinction (reviewed in Anderson et al. , 2004 ; Domingo, 2005 ) . Loeb and colleagues coined the term "" lethal mutagenesis "" to refer to the loss of virus infectivity associated with the action of mutagenic agents ( Loeb et al. , 1999 ) . Mutagenic nucleoside analogues, some used in antimicrobial and anticancer therapy, are currently actively studied as promoters of lethal mutagenesis of viruses, including an ongoing clinical trial with AIDS patients ( Harris et al. , 2005 ) .

Lethal mutagenesis is attracting increasing interest, and several theoretical models have addressed the mechanisms underlying lethal mutagenesis and the relationship between the observations on viral extinction and the original concept of error catastrophe (several models are reviewed in Chapter 1, and one model is described in Chapter 9). Key to the validation of these models as applied to RNA viruses is the experimental fi nding that a low viral load and low replicative fi tness (relative replication capacity) favor extinction ( Sierra et al. , 2000 ; Pariente et al. , 2001 ) , and that a mutagenic activity (not merely an inhibitory activity) is necessary to achieve extinction . This was shown by absence of extinction when the virus was subjected to equivalent inhibitory activities with cocktails of non-mutagenic inhibitors . However, since low viral loads favor extinction, the inhibitory activity that is associated with the action of some mutagenic agents may contribute to lethal mutagenesis. In this respect, a combination of a mutagenic nucleoside analogue and the antiretroviral inhibitor AZT was required to extinguish high fi tness HIV-1 during infections in cell culture ( Tapia et al. , 2005 ) . Even strong reductions in population size of highly debilitated foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) and lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) populations did not result in virus extinction unless a mutagenic activity intervened ( Sierra et al. , 2000 ; Pariente et al. , 2001 ; Pariente et al. , 2003 ) . A second fi nding to be considered in the development of theoretical models is the negative interference exerted by mutants that either coinfect the cells along with standard virus, or are generated inside the cell by mutagenesis. The interfering activity of such "" defector "" genomes as contributing to viral extinction has been documented both experimentally with FMDV and LCMV, and by in silico simulations ( González-López et al. , 2004 ; Grande-Pérez et al. , 2005b ; Perales et al. , 2007 ) . Production of a fraction of non-infectious hepatitis C virus (HCV) in infected patients as a result of ribavirin (1--Dribofuranosyl-1,2,3-triazole-3-carboxamide) therapy is a key parameter in the models of HCV clearance following treatment with ribavirin and interferon alpha (IFN-) ( Dixit et al. , 2004 ; Dahari et al. , 2007 ) (see Chapter 15 ).

An argument that has been used to deny a connection between lethal mutagenesis and the transition into error catastrophe has been the absence of hypermutated molecules in mutagenized populations of RNA viruses. However, any hypermutated genome transiently generated during mutagenesis is unlikely to be replication-competent and to be included in any sampling of viral genomes. This has been recognized by us ( Grande-Pérez et al. , 2005a ) and others ( Perelson and Layden, 2007 ) . Despite this, a genome with a mutation frequency lying in the lower range of typically hypermutated genomes was identifi ed in a population of 5-fl uorouracil (5-FU)-treated LCMV ( Grande-Pérez et al. , 2005a ) . The absence or very low frequency of hypermutated genomes in standard genome samplings of pre-extinction viral populations cannot constitute an argument against a mutagenesis-driven transition into error catastrophe.

Concerning the relationship between the concept of error catastrophe and extinction of viruses by lethal mutagenesis, M. Eigen pointed out the following: (i) dependence of copying fi delity on sequence context and the type of mutagen; (ii) fi tness landscape of the quasispecies distribution, including the perturbing effects of specifi c types of mutants that may arise during mutagenesis (as discussed above); (iii) participation of multiple viral functions (not only RNA replication) in determining the replicative collapse of the system. As pointed out by Eigen, "" Theory cannot remove complexity, but it shows what kind of ' regular ' behavior can be expected and what experiments have to be done to get a grasp on the irregularities "" ( Eigen, 2002 ) .

In line with the application of the error threshold relationship to real viruses ( Eigen, 2002 ) , it is obvious that virus extinction will not occur through "" evaporation "" into the entire sequence space theoretically available to a viral genome. This is physically impossible. As mutagenesis progresses during viral replication myriads of end-point genomes harboring lethal or highly deleterious mutations will impede further expansions into sequence space by such genomes. This is a consequence of the multiple viral functions (not only RNA replication) that affect replicative competence ( Eigen, 2002 ) . These differences between the mechanisms that mediate extinction of real viruses and the original concept of error catastrophe can be expressed by distinguishing "" phenotypic "" and "" extinction "" thresholds from an "" error theshold, "" as has been done in some theoretical treatments (for example, Huynen et al. , 1996 ; Manrubia et al. , 2005 ) . Apart from these rather obvious adaptations of error catastrophe to a real biological system, the experimental studies carried out in the laboratory of one of us (E.D.) do not provide any basis to dissociate lethal mutagenesis from error catastrophe, as initially developed by Eigen, Schuster, and colleagues, and even less to consider that the approach to error catastrophe will impede viral extinction. In the section on "" Intra-mutant spectrum suppression can contribute to lethal mutagenesis "" in this chapter, we summarize our current view on the mechanisms that underlie virus extinction through lethal mutagenesis based on experimental results, and the main challenges facing, in our view, this new antiviral strategy.

A viral quasispecies can have a biological behavior that is not predictable from the behavior of its components considered individually. Several observations with viruses as they replicate in cell culture or in vivo suggest that intra-population interactions can modulate the replicative capacity of the ensemble of mutants or of individual mutants introduced in a spectrum of mutants. Fitness of biological clones of bacteriophase Q ( Domingo et al. , 1978 ) and of VSV ( Duarte et al. , 1994a ) was lower than the fi tness of the average populations from which the clones were derived. These quantifi cations of clonal fi tness suggest that an ensemble of related mutants may collectively acquire a selective replicative advantage, perhaps because competent gene products may complement suboptimal or defective products expressed by subsets of components of the mutant spectrum. Specifi c mutants, including deleterious and lethal mutants, can be maintained in viral populations in vivo, and can be transmitted to susceptible hosts ( Moreno et al. , 1997 ; Yamada et al. , 1998 ; Aaskov et al. , 2006 ; Vignuzzi et al. , 2006 ) . A seemingly opposite manifestation of the internal interactions within viral quasispecies is the suppression of the replication of specifi c mutants by the surrounding mutant spectrum. This possibility was suggested by theoretical models according to which a simple replicon of inferior fi tness to another could nevertheless dominate the population by virtue of being surrounded by a more favorable mutant spectrum ( Swetina and Schuster, 1982 ) (reviewed in Eigen and Biebricher, 1988 ; Nowak, 2006 ) (Chapter 1). The fi rst experimental documentation of this prediction with real viruses was by de la Torre and Holland who showed that a standard VSV population interfered with the replication of a VSV clone of superior fi tness, unless the latter was present above a certain frequency in the population ( de la Torre and . Suppressive effects of this type have been subsequently documented in several virus-host systems (reviewed in Domingo, 2006 ) . Remarkable examples include suppression by attenuated PV of neuropathology in monkeys associated with virulent PV present in the vaccine preparation ( Chumakov et al. , 1991 ) , suppression of pathogenic LCMV by non-pathogenic variants ( Teng et al. , 1996 ) , the lowered replication rates of drug-resistant viruses ( Crowder and Kirkegaard, 2005 ) , and complementing-interfering effects of specifi c FMDV mutants ( Perales et al. , 2007 ) .

The complexity of the mutant spectrum of a virus (that is, the average number of mutations that distinguish the individual components of the mutant distribution) can affect the course of viral disease and the response to treatment. Most notably, prolonged persistence of HCV infection correlated with high mutant spectrum complexity ( Farci et al. , 2000 ) ; other aspects of quasispecies behavior of HCV were reviewed in Domingo and Gomez, 2007 ) (see also Chapter 15). Studies with a PV mutant with an amino acid substitution in the viral polymerase which increases about fi ve-fold its template-copying fi delity have been particularly revealing. The mutant PV produces a narrower mutant spectrum (with a lower average number of mutations per genome) than wild-type PV. In infections of susceptible mice (transgenic for the human PV receptor) the mutant replicated in the animals but failed to reach the brain and to produce the neuropathology that was associated with the infection with wild-type PV ( Pfeiffer and Kirkegaard, 2005 ; Vignuzzi et al. , 2006 ) . Remarkably, restoration of the standard mutant spectrum complexity by subjecting the mutant PV to 5-FU-induced mutagenesis led to a neuropathogenic mutant spectrum ( Vignuzzi et al. , 2006 ) . Moreover, Sabin ' s attenuated PV vaccine shows relatively low mutant frequency compared with wild-type strains, and this observation could be due to differences in polymerase fi delity (Vignuzzi, personal communication; see also Chapter 6). These observations are highly relevant ( Biebricher and Domingo, 2007 ) . Foremost, the results show the biological relevance of high mutation rates, in that they may affect pathology by allowing the virus to reach specifi c target organs, thereby increasing viral loads and chances of transmission. The observed phenotypic transitions of PV demand consideration of the virus as a quasispecies, since PV behavior could not be explained by taking into account consensus genomic nucleotide sequences alone. We come to the conclusion that virus evolution can affect viral pathogenesis in at least two ways ( Domingo, 2007 ) : (i) The information for increased pathology or for adaptation to multiple environments can be contained in the genetic material of the virus (in most of its individual clones) irrespective of the mutant spectrum to which they belong ( Kimata et al. , 1999 ; Greene et al. , 2005 , among 

The information for increased pathology can be contained in a distribution of mutants as such, as documented above for HCV and PV. Again, these observations reinforce the biological advantage of high mutation rates for the long-term survival of RNA viruses, and the consideration of entire quasispecies as the units of selection (see also Domingo, 2006 Domingo, , 2007 , and other chapters of this volume).

The PV polymerase mutant displaying higher fi delity than the wild type was obtained by passaging the virus in the presence of increasing concentrations of the nucleoside analogue ribavirin ( Pfeiffer and Kirkegaard, 2003 ; Vignuzzi et al. , 2006 ) . The amino acid replacement in the polymerase (G64S) is located away from the catalytic domain of the enzyme, and an action at a distance was invoked to explain the general effect of this substitution on the copying fi delity ( Arnold et al. , 2005 ) (see Chapter 6). A mutant of FMDV, selected also by passaging the virus in the presence of increasing concentrations of ribavirin, displayed higher fi tness than the wild-type virus when virus replication took place in the presence of ribavirin but not in its absence ( Sierra et al. , 2007 ) . This phenotypic change was mapped to amino acid substitution M296I in the viral polymerase, and the mutant enzyme displayed decreased capacity to use ribavirin triphosphate as substrate (instead of GTP or ATP), but did not show an apparent alteration of general templatecopying fi delity ( Sierra et al. , 2007 ) . Substitution M296I is located at a loop whose fl exibility seems to be required to adapt its conformation and interactions to the size and shape of template residues and incoming nucleotide substrates. Ile at this position may restrict the loop fl exibility and affect nucleotide recognition ( Ferrer-Orta et al. , 2007 ) . M296 is quite distant from the site (G62) where the equivalent, ribavirin-selected substitution in PV lays. These results suggest that in the picornaviral polymerase multiple sites (perhaps domains) might be involved either in specifi c interactions with nucleotide analogues or in recognition of nucleotide substrates.

Comparison of the structure of the FMDV polymerase complexed with RNA ( Ferrer-Orta et al. , 2004 ) , and with RNA and a number of nucleotides and nucleotide analogues ( Ferrer-Orta et al. , 2007 ) has documented the involvement of multiple amino acids of the FMDV polymerase in the recognition of nucleotides. Several interactions are key to catalysis, as shown by modifi cation of the polymerase activity of the corresponding mutants produced by site-directed mutagenesis. Interestingly, some interactions are common to standard nucleotides and nucleotide analogues, while other interactions are specifi c for a given nucleotide analogue ( Ferrer-Orta et al. , 2007 ) . These results suggest that multiple sites in the polymerase can modulate substrate recognition, thereby affecting the fi delity properties of picornaviral (and probably other) polymerases ( Arnold et al. , 2005 ; Ferrer-Orta et al. , 2007 ) . These and other recent studies on the mechanism of substrate discrimination by viral RNA polymerases and reverse transcriptases are providing important information that may help in the design of drugs able to lower the copying fi delity of viral polymerases to facilitate lethal mutagenesis (see also Chapter 6).

Populations of RNA viruses subjected to increased mutagenesis by nucleoside analogues display decreases in specifi c infectivity due to accumulation of viral genomes harboring deleterious or lethal mutations ( Crotty et al. , 2001 ; Grande-Pérez et al. , 2002 , 2005b Airaksinen et al. , 2003 ; González-López et al. , 2004 Arias et al. , 2005 ) . Mutagenized, pre-extinction FMDV RNA interfered with the replication of standard FMDV RNA, resulting in a delay and in a decrease in the production of progeny virus ( González-López et al. , 2004 ) .

Since the interfering FMDV displayed at least a 0.1-fold fi tness relative to the standard FMDV ( González-López et al. , 2005 ) , the suppression observed could not be due to mechanisms invoking competition between genomes of comparable replication capacity (such as positive clonal interference). It was suggested that the expression (normal or aberrant) of altered viral proteins could contribute to the suppression of replication of standard FMDV, and also to the extinction of FMDV RNA. To test this hypothesis, a number of capsid and polymerase mutants of FMDV were examined regarding their capacity to interfere with standard FMDV, in experiments involving coelectroporation of cells with the relevant RNAs ( Perales et al. , 2007 ) . The results showed that an excess of several replication-competent mutants caused a strong and specifi c interference on FMDV replication. Furthermore, mixtures of some capsid and polymerase mutants evoked a very strong, synergistic interference ( Perales et al. , 2007 ) . Notably, some of the mutants tested had been isolated from mutagenized FMDV populations in their way towards extinction. These results with FMDV are in agreement with observations on enhanced mutagenesis of LCMV which resulted in populations in which the loss of infectious progeny production preceded the loss of replicating viral RNA ( Grande-Pérez et al. , 2005b ) . A deleterious effect on infectivity exerted by defective LCMV genomes was also supported by numerical simulations using realistic parameters of LCMV replication ( Grande-Pérez et al. , 2005b ) . The picture emerging from the studies with FMDV and LCMV is that the transition towards viral extinction associated with lethal mutagenesis can have at least two phases: an initial one, with a limited input of mutations in the viral genomes, in which a subset of defective genomes that have been termed "" defectors "" interfere with replication of standard genomes, and can contribute to viral extinction. This is termed the "" lethal defection model "" of virus extinction, proposed on the basis of experiments with LCMV ( Grande-Pérez et al. , 2005b ) , and supported by the strong interference on FMDV replication exerted by combinations of specifi c capsid and polymerase mutants of FMDV ( Perales et al. , 2007 ) . In a second phase, as the number of mutations per genome increases due to continuing mutagenesis, the proportion of lethal mutations increases, resulting in further decreases in specifi c infectivity ( González-López et al. , 2005 ; Grande-Pérez et al. , 2005b ) . In Chapter 6, Cameron and colleagues describe elegant experiments that show that low-fi delity mutants of poliovirus manifest an acceleration of the onset of lethal mutagenesis. Genomes with either deleterious or lethal mutations have been isolated from mutagenized FMDV and LCMV populations on their way towards extinction ( Sierra et al. , 2000 ; Pariente et al. , 2001 ; Arias et al. , 2005 ) . Some detrimental mutations may be maintained in the viral populations by complementation and whenever the genomes harboring them increase in frequency they may exert an interfering activity provided that the type of genetic lesion belongs to the interfering class ( Perales et al. , 2007 ) . Interestingly, some genomes harboring multiple mutations (for example a triple mutant in the polymerase of FMDV) that render the genome replicationincompetent may differ in a single nucleotide position from a replication-competent, strongly interfering mutant ( Arias et al. , 2005 ; Perales et al. , 2007 ) . Viral genomes with interfering or lethal mutations may occupy proximal or distant positions in sequence space, relative to the standard, non-mutated genome. Thus, there might be a gradual but overlapping transition between a phase of dominance of interfering mutants and a phase of increasing presence of lethal mutants, until a replicative collapse and virus extinction occur, in agreement with the theory of error catastrophe (see Chapter 1 for a discussion of the contribution of lethal mutants to error catastrophe). Recent biochemical data have documented that viral proteins are frequently multifunctional and that they often form oligomeric complexes. Thus, mutated forms of a given protein may affect multiple viral functions and result in inactive protein complexes (several examples can be found in Mesters et al. , 2006 ; Sobrino and Mettenleiter, 2008 ) . Abnormal behavior of altered viral proteins may be one of the molecular mechanisms underlying virus transition into error catastrophe, very much in line with the cascade of events initially proposed as a model for aging ( Orgel, 1963 ) .

The transition of FMDV and LCMV towards extinction by lethal mutagenesis occurred with a 10 2 -to 10 3 -fold decrease in specifi c infectivity (PFU/total viral RNA), and without a modification of the consensus sequence of the population ( González-López et al. , 2004 ; Grande-Pérez et al. , 2005a ) in agreement with results with poliovirus ( Crotty et al. , 2001 ) . Loss of infectivity was very sharp, and extinction occurred generally after 1-20 passages, depending on viral fi tness and the mutagen-inhibitor combination treatment (compare the extinction kinetics in Sierra et al. , 2000 ; Pariente et al. , 2001 Pariente et al. , , 2003 Grande-Pérez et al. , 2005a ) . Extinction can be preceded by minimal increase in the average mutation frequency of the mutant spectra ( Crotty et al. , 2001 ; Grande-Pérez et al. , 2005b ; Tapia et al. , 2005 ) . These experiments have not provided evidence that as the mutational load in the viral genome increases, the virus acquires resistance to extinction. It remains to be seen whether the presence of M296I in the FMDV RdRp, which was selected by ribavirin, confers any signifi cant resistance to lethal mutagenesis. The vulnerability of FMDV to extinction by lethal mutagenesis offers a signifi cant contrast with the resistance of FMDV to extinction despite accumulation of mutations as a result of plaque-to-plaque transfers (Escarmis et al. , 2002 (Escarmis et al. , , 2008 Lazaro et al. , 2003 ) .

The key difference between the two scenarios is that resistance to extinction (despite accumulation of mutations accompanying serial bottleneck events) results from the selection for a next transfer of a virus able to replicate thanks to the presence of compensatory mutations. This is in contrast to mutagenesis of a complex population whose suppressive effects do not allow the rescuing of replication-competent individuals .

The course of events preceding viral extinction that we have outlined here has a number of experimentally testable predictions, currently under study. Clarifi cation of the mechanisms underlying virus extinction may help in the design of improved protocols of administration of mutagenic agents and antiviral inhibitors for lethal mutagenesis. In our view, the main challenges facing progress in lethal mutagenesis are: (i) fi nding and design of new mutagenic base or nucleoside analogues that target viral (but not cellular) polymerases, that can be used in combination with antiviral inhibitors; (ii) evaluation of how widespread is the occurrence of mutagen-resistant virus mutants, and whether lethal mutagenesis may fail either because of the presence of mutagen-resistant mutations ( Pfeiffer and Kirkegaard, 2003 ; Sierra et al. , 2007 ) or other mechanisms ( Sanjuan et al. , 2007 ) ; (iii) understanding of the molecular basis of templatecopying fi delity of nucleic acid polymerases, and the design of drugs that can lower specifi cally the copying fi delity of viral polymerases; (iv) the application of lethal mutagenesis to model systems in vivo ( Ruiz-Jarabo et al. , 2003a ; Harris et al. , 2005 ) . Concerning possible applications of lethal mutagenesis in vivo, measurements of the "" critical drug effi cacy "" -as developed for treatments of infections by HIV-1 and HCV ( Callaway and Perelson, 2002 ; Y. Huang et al. , 2003 ; Dahari et al. , 2007 ) -for mutagen-inhibitor combinations, should guide in establishing protocols adequate for viral clearance, to avoid stabilization of viral levels at a therapyinduced set point.

One of the consequences of the quasispecies dynamics of RNA viruses is fi tness variations in a constant environment triggered by changes in viral population size. Fitness is a complex parameter that measures the degree of adaptation of a living organism or simple replicons to a specifi c environment (as general reviews see Williams, 1992 , and Reznick and Travis, 1996 ) . For viruses, fi tness values have been measured as the relative ability of two competing viruses to produce infectious progeny reviewed in Domingo and Holland, 1997 ; Quiñones-Mateu and Arts, 2006 ) . In the standard protocol, competitions are started by infecting cells or organisms with a mixture of a reference wild-type virus (given arbitrarily a fi tness value of 1) and the virus to be tested, in known proportions. The progeny viruses are used to initiate a second round of infection, and the process is repeated a number of times (serial infections). Then, the logarithm of the proportion of the two competing viruses at each passage defi nes a fi tness vector, the slope of which is the logarithm of the fi tness of the test virus relative to the reference virus ( Figure 4 .1 ). The two competing viruses must be distinguishable by some phenotypic trait (e.g. a clear difference in the ability to replicate in the presence of an antibody or a drug) or by some genetic change, such as nucleotide substitutions that allow the proportion of the two viruses to be determined by densitometry of a sequencing gel or by their specifi c amplifi cation by real time reverse transcriptionpolymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using discriminatory oligonucleotide primers. Fitness determinations of viruses subjected to different passage regimes have established an important effect of population size of the virus involved in the infections, on fi tness evolution.

Animal viruses are likely to undergo genetic bottlenecks during transmission; most of the evidence suggesting bottleneck effects comes from sequence analysis of infected hosts (for instance, Frost et al. , 2001 ) , but Pfeiffer and Kirkegaard demonstrated bottlenecks during PV transmission from inoculated sites to the brain in transgenic mice expressing the human PV receptor ( Pfeiffer and Kirkegaard, 2006 ) . In addition, there is direct evidence demonstrating that plant viruses experience signifi cant bottlenecks during movement from the site of infection ( Ali et al. , 2006 ; Jridi et al. , 2006 ) (see Chapter 12). RNA virus populations subjected to severe serial bottleneck events in cell culture-such as those occurring upon serial plaque-to-plaque transfers-undergo, on average, a decrease in fi tness ( Chao, 1990 ; Duarte et al. , 1992 ; Escarmís et al. , 1996 ; Yuste et al. , 1999 ; de la Iglesia and Elena, 2007 ) . This is due to the stochastic accumulation of deleterious mutations ( Figure 4 .2 ), predicted by Müller (1964) to occur for small populations of asexual organisms lacking in mechanisms, such as sex or recombination, that could eliminate or compensate for such debilitating mutations ( Maynard-Smith, 1976 viral population reduced to a single genome at the onset of plaque formation (extreme genetic drift), and high mutation rates.

A study by Novella et al. (1995c) using VSV established that the extent of fi tness loss for any given bottleneck size depends on the initial fi tness of the viral clone under study. The higher the initial fi tness, the less severe must the bottleneck be to avoid fi tness losses. Debilitated viral clones often gain fi tness even when subjected to considerable bottlenecking ( Novella et al. , 1995a ( Novella et al. , , 1995c . Rather constant, stable fi tness values could be attained by choosing the appropriate bottleneck size, although occasional fi tness jumps were observed ( Novella et al. , 1996 ) . Escarmís et al. (1996 Escarmís et al. ( , 2008 examined the genetic lesions associated with Müller ' s ratchet by determining genomic nucleotide sequences of FMDV clones prior to and after undergoing repeated (up to 409) plaque-to-plaque transfers. The result was that fi tness loss was associated with unusual mutations that had never been seen in natural FMDV isolates or laboratory populations subjected to passages involving large viral populations. Particularly striking were an internal polyadenylate extension preceding the second functional AUG initiation codon of the FMDV genome, and amino acid substitutions at internal capsid residues. Additions or deletions of nucleotides have been frequently observed at homopolymeric tracts, particularly on pyrimidine runs in templates copied by proofreading-repair-defi cient polymerases ( Kunkel, 1990 ; Bebenek and Kunkel, 1993 ) . The experimental results suggest that only when the repeated bottlenecks limit the action of negative selection (elimination or decrease in proportion of low fi tness genomes) can such internal polyadenylate extensions (and other deleterious mutations) be maintained in the FMDV genome ( Escarmís et al. , 1996 . In contrast, sequence analysis of VSV genomes subjected to plaque-to-plaque passages did not show unusual mutations, with the possible exception of mutations in the RNA termini, which are uncommon in viruses evolving in regimes of acute replication ( Novella and Ebendick-Corpus, 2004 ) .

Fitness decrease upon subjecting FMDV to plaque-to-plaque transfers was biphasic: an initial decrease was followed by a highly fl uctuating pattern with a constant average fi tness value. The fl uctuating pattern followed a Weibull statistical distribution ( Weibull, 1951 ; Lazaro et al. , 2003 ) . A Weibull distribution describes disparate physical and biological processes. In the case of plaque-to-plaque transfers of a virus this type of distribution probably results from the multiple host-virus interactions that occur as the virus life cycle is completed, and alterations of such interactions as mutations accumulate in multifunctional viral proteins ( Lazaro et al. , 2003 ) . The studies of evolution of FMDV when subjected to many repeated serial bottleneck transfers revealed a remarkable resistance of the virus to extinction despite a linear accumulation of mutations in its genome , as well as the existence of multiple evolutionary pathways for fi tness recovery ( Escarmís et al. , 1999 ) (see also "" Intra-mutant spectrum suppression can contribute to lethal mutagenesis, "" above).

Fitness has often been considered a component of parasite virulence, defi ned as the capacity of parasites to infl ict damage upon their hosts. Indeed, very frequently an increase in viral fi tness parallels an increase of virulence. However, a comparative quantitative analysis of fi tness and virulence (cellkilling capacity) of an FMDV clone subjected to plaque-to-plaque transfers, and of its parental clone, revealed that fi tness and virulence can be two unrelated traits ( Herrera et al. , 2007 ) . The molecular basis for the different trajectories followed by fi tness and virulence resided in the fact that fi tness was affected by mutations anywhere in the viral genome while determinants of cell-killing capacity were multigenic but restricted to some specifi c genomic regions of the viral genome. As a consequence, the random accumulation of mutations associated with bottleneck transfers had a more negative impact on fi tness than on virulence of this FMDV clone ( Herrera et al. , 2007 ) . That viral fi tness and virulence can follow different trajectories is supported by several observations with animal and plant viruses. VSV populations that were subjected to a regime of persistent infection in sandfl y cells showed overall decrease in both fi tness and virulence in mammalian cells, but the decrease in virulence continued throughout the experiment, while the decrease in fi tness peaked at intermediate passages and was followed by some degree of recovery ( Zárate and Novella, 2004 ) . Simian immunodefi ciency virus SIVmac239 attains similar high viral loads in the sooty mangabey and the rhesus macaque, yet it is only virulent for the rhesus macaque ( Kaur et al. , 1998 ) . At an epidemiological level, greater fi tness of historical versus current HIV-1 isolates was taken as evidence of HIV-1 attenuation over time, assuming a direct correlation between fi tness and virulence ( Arien et al. , 2005 ) . However, no trend towards HIV-1 attenuation since the time of introduction of the virus into Switzerland was observed ( Muller et al. , 2006 ) . These and other studies with viral and non-viral parasites (reviewed in Herrera et al. , 2007 ) suggest that evolution in nature can drive parasites to attain virulence levels that are not necessarily coupled to fi tness. This distinction between fi tness and virulence should be taken into consideration in the formulation of models for parasite virulence.

In contrast to bottleneck passages, large population infections generally result in fi tness gains of RNA viruses ( Martinez et al. , 1991 ; Clarke et al. , 1993 ; Novella et al. , 1995b ; Escarmís et al. , 1999 ) . Fitness increase in this case is expected from a gradual optimization of mutant spectra when their different components, arising by mutation and in some cases also by recombination, are allowed unrestricted competition in a constant environment ( Figure 4 .2 ). High replicative fi tness may help a virus to overcome selective constraints-including antiviral agents or immune responses (Quiñones-Mateu et al. , 2006; Grimm et al. , 2007 ) -and to delay extinction by lethal mutagenesis ( Sierra et al. , 2000 ; Pariente et al. , 2001 ) . When the relative fi tness of the evolving quasispecies reaches a high value, even quite large population sizes can constitute an effective bottleneck and prevent continuing fi tness increase ( Novella et al. , 1999a ( Novella et al. , , 1999b . This limiting high fi tness level was manifested by stochastic fl uctuations in fi tness values expected from random generation of mutations in a continuously evolving mutant swarm. These perturbations illustrate how diffi cult it is to attain a true population equilibrium even when viruses replicate in a constant environment. A rare combination of mutations-one that may occur only once over many rounds of viral replication-may transfer one genome and its descendants to a distant region of sequence space, and trigger the dominance of one viral subpopulation over another, thereby disrupting a period of population equilibrium. In competitions between two VSV clones of similar fi tness coexisting at or near equilibrium, a rapid and unpredictable displacement of one VSV population by the other provided support for a classical concept of population biology: the competitive exclusion principle ( Gause, 1971 ) . Furthermore, in the competition passages preceding mutual exclusion, both the winners and the losers gained fi tness at comparable rates, in support of yet another concept of population genetics: the Red Queen hypothesis ( Van Valen, 1973 ; Clarke et al. , 1994 ; reviewed in Domingo, 2006 ) (see Figure 4 .1 ).

Parallel fi tness gains were also observed for minority memory genomes and their majority counterparts in evolving FMDV quasispecies . Memory genomes are subpopulations of genomes that remain in a replicating viral quasispecies at a frequency about 10 2 -to 10 3 -fold higher than the frequency that can be attributed to mutational pressure alone, and refl ect those genomes that were dominant at a previous stage of the evolution of the same viral lineage ( Ruiz-Jarabo et al. , 2000 ; review in Domingo, 2000 ) . Memory has been documented with a number of genetic markers of FMDV ( Ruiz-Jarabo et al. , 2000 , 2003b and HIV-1 ( Briones et al. , 2003 ( Briones et al. , , 2006 , and similar results have been described for VSV ( Novella et al. , 2007 ) . Memory is a consequence of fi tness variations inherent to quasispecies dynamics, likely to exert its main infl uence on the composition of mutant spectra that have been subjected to various alternating selective pressures ( Domingo, 2000 ) .

Relative viral fi tness may depend on the multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) used during selection or competition. High m.o.i. promotes coinfection, and the higher the level of coinfection the more likely that complementation will take place. Complementation effectively hides benefi cial (and deleterious) variation from the effects of selection ( Sevilla et al. , 1998 ; Wilke and Novella, 2003 ; Wilke et al. , 2004 ) . In addition, high m.o.i. effects may relate to the use of alternative receptors or to interfering interactions occurring within the mutant spectra of viral quasispecies ( Sevilla et al. , 1998 ; Perales et al. , 2007 ) (see section on "" Intra-population complementation and interference in viral quasispecies: mutant distributions as the units of selection "" ).

Defective viruses can be maintained in the course of high m.o.i. passages by complementation. An extensively documented case is the generation and maintenance of helperdependent defective-interfering (DI) RNA and particles, which follow the process of mutation, competition and selection typical of quasispecies dynamics ( Holland et al. , 1982 ; Roux et al. , 1991 ) . Other types of defective genomes can also be maintained in viral populations by complementation Moreno et al. , 1997 ; Yamada et al. , 1998 ) . Some defective genomes can be transmitted from infected into susceptible hosts, rendering the maintenance of defective genomes by complementation an event of potential epidemiological signifi cance ( Aaskov et al. , 2006 ) .

A striking, extreme case of complementation between defective genomes was provided by evolution of standard FMDV towards two defective forms that were infectious and killed cells by complementation in the absence of standard FMDV ( García-Arriaza et al. , 2004, 2005, 2006 ) . These studies have provided evidence of a continuous dynamics of generation of defective FMDV genomes harboring in-frame internal deletions within genomic regions encoding trans -acting proteins, giving rise to swarms of genomes with non-identical, related deletions ( García-Arriaza et al. , 2006 ) . Each virion encapsidates only one type of defective genome and, therefore, the same cell must be infected by at least two different particles to permit complementation and formation of progeny defective genomes . The high m.o.i.-dependent evolution of FMDV towards two defective forms that can complement each other has been regarded as experimental support of a fi rst step in a process towards viral genome segmentation. Interestingly, multipartite segmented genomes are rare among the animal and bacterial viruses but are frequent among plant viruses, and the latter are characterized by high m.o.i. as they spread in their host plants ( Lazarowitz, 2007 ) .

The main conclusion we derive from the results summarized in the preceding paragraphs is that even in a relatively constant biological and physical environment, as is usually provided by in vitro cell culture systems, the degree of adaptation of viral quasispecies may undergo remarkable quantitative variations, prompted by the stochastic generation of mutant genomes, and different opportunities for competitive optimization of mutant spectra.

The experiments of fi tness variation of viruses in cell culture summarized in the previous section have been instrumental in defi ning some basic infl uences that guide fi tness evolution of viral quasispecies. However, in their replication in a natural setting, viruses encounter multiple and changing environments, and they often have to cope with confl icting selective constraints. Because of polymorphisms in key host proteins involved in cellular and humoral immune responses, and in many other cell surface antigens, viruses do not face the same selective constraints in different individuals of the same host species. Biological environments are heterogeneous and vary with time within each infected individual. Furthermore, a considerable number of viruses are capable of infecting different host species, extending even further the range of environments they face.

Arboviruses that replicate in mammalian and insect hosts constitute a classical example of obligate environmental alternacy in vivo ( Scott et al. , 1994 ; Weaver, 1998 ) (Chapter 16) . Early work documented that extensive replication of viruses in insect cells led to attenuation of infectivity for mammalian cells ( Peleg, 1971 ; Mudd et al. , 1973 ) . Prolonged persistence of VSV in sandfl y cells cultured at low temperatures resulted in several orders of magnitude greater fi tness in insect cells than in mammalian cells ( Novella et al. , 1995a ; Zárate and Novella, 2004 ) . In contrast, acute VSV replication in sandfl y cells led to fi tness increase in mammalian cells ( Novella et al. , 1999a ) , and replication of West Nile virus in mosquito cells resulted in populations that, while not improved, showed no fi tness losses in vertebrate cells ( Ciota et al. , 2007 ) . Thus, we cannot assume selective differences between insect and mammalian cells types, and when we observe tradeoffs, these may be due to different strategies of replication (persistent versus acute), not to difference in cell type per se .

A single passage of sandfl y cell-adapted VSV in mammalian cells led to an increase in fi tness in mammalian cells to near original values. It would be interesting to test whether this capacity for fi tness shift would be similar for non-arboviral RNA viruses able to grow in insect cells in culture. VSV adapted to sandfl y cells was highly attenuated for mice. Again, a single passage in mammalian cells restored the virulence phenotype in vivo ( Novella et al. , 1995a ) .

Several groups have studied the evolutionary consequences of alternating environments during arbovirus replication (reviewed in Wilke et al. , 2006 ; Ciota et al. , 2007 ) . The overall results showed that extensive alternating replication between mammalian and insect cells led to fi tness improvement in both environments; the only exception was VSV adapted to alternation between persistent insect replication and acute mammalian replication: adaptation during alternation is dominated by the persistent environment and there is fi tness loss in the mammalian environment ( Zárate and Novella, 2004 ) (for details, see Chapter 16).

Studies of fi tness variations in vivo have been approached in at least three ways. Some studies have involved growth-competition experiments between two viruses replicating in host organisms. In other studies, the outcome of competitions between viruses that were isolated in vivo has been analyzed in primary or established cell cultures. In yet another line of research, the effect of fi tness variations in cell culture on the replicative potential of viruses in vivo has been examined. Carrillo et al. (1998) isolated two variant FMDVs present at low frequency in the course of replication of a clonal virus preparation in swine. One of the variants was a MAbresistant mutant (MARM), while the other was isolated from blood during the early viremic phase of the acute infection. The ability of the two variants to compete in vivo with the parental clonal population was examined by coinfection of swine with mixtures of the parental clone and each of the two variants individually. None of the two variants became completely dominant in a single coinfection in vivo , but fi tness differences were clearly documented. The parental FMDV clone manifested a selective advantage over the MARM in that the parental clone was dominant in most lesions (vesicles) in the diseased swine. In contrast, the parental clone and the variant from the early viremic phase were about equally represented in the lesions of the animals infected with equal amounts of the two viruses ( Carrillo et al. , 1998 ) .

The lentivirus equine infectious anemia virus (EIAV) experiences continuous quasispecies fl uctuations during persistent infections in horses ( Clements et al. , 1988 ) . EIAV quasispecies were characterized in a pony experimentally infected with a biological clone of the virus. New quasispecies were associated with recurrent episodes of disease. A large deletion in the principal neutralizing domain of the virus was identifi ed during the third febrile episode and became dominant during the fourth febrile episode. This drastic genetic change did not appear to diminish signifi cantly the fi tness of EIAV in vivo and in cell culture ( Leroux et al. , 1997 ) . The complexity of sequential EIAV populations in vivo , was characterized with a nonhierarchical clustering method to analyze quasispecies, termed PAQ (partition analysis of quasispecies) ( Baccam et al. , 2001 ) . This procedure to dissect the composition of mutant spectra should allow the recognition of subpopulations within viral quasispecies as they evolve towards fi tness gain or loss.

The multiple environments in which viruses have to replicate in vivo may promote the selective expansion of subpopulations from viral quasispecies thereby leading to variant viruses that display altered relative fi tness in different host organs, as compared with their parental populations. Such variations in the potential replicative capacity constitute one of the ingredients that may affect the emergence and reemergence of viral disease (reviews in Smolinski et al. , 2003 ; Peters, 2007 ) . The genetic lottery of blind variation through mutation, recombination, and genome segment reassortment is played in the face of a background of multiple ecological, sociological, and demographic factors. In recent decades viral disease emergences that have affected humans have occurred at a rate of about one per year. Salient examples are acquired immune defi ciency syndrome (AIDS), severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), encephalitis associated with West Nile virus, the expansion of dengue fever, or periodic infl uenza pandemics ( Smolinski et al. , 2003 ; Peters, 2007 ) .

Multiple genetic changes may favor the adaptation of a virus to a new host. Once adaptation has taken place, the adapted virus may lose or maintain the pathogenic potential for the former (donor) host (as an example of maintenance of virulence for a donor and recipient host in FMDV see Nuñez et al. , 2007 ) . A core (or basal) genetic composition of a viral pathogen may be in itself a predictor of pathogenic potential, as profusely documented with natural or laboratory-generated, attenuated variants of many viral pathogens. To take infl uenza A virus and the threat of a human infl uenza pandemics as examples, out of the 16 hemagglutinin (H) and 9 neuraminidase (N) subtypes circulating among animal reservoirs, some potentially threatening forms being more carefully kept under surveillance include H 5 N 1 , H 7 N 7 , H 9 N 2 , and H 2 N 2 viruses. The expansion of the H 5 N 1 subtype among wild and domestic avian species and human contacts since 2005 has resulted in over 300 human cases in nearly 50 countries, with more than 50% deaths, as well as the killing of millions of poultry ( Wright et al. , 2007 ) . Key parameters for an avian infl uenza virus to give rise to a human infl uenza pandemic include acquisition of receptorrecognition specifi city for human cells, and the capacity for effi cient human-to-human transmission ( Parrish and Kawaoka, 2005 ; Suzuki, 2005 ) . This capacity can be expressed as the basic reproductive ratio (Ro) which is the average number of infected contacts from each infected host (review in Nowak and May, 2000 ) . "" Epidemiologic fi tness "" has been used to describe (through samplings of defi nitory genomic sequences, diagnostic surveys, etc.) the capacity of a virus to become dominant (relative to related viruses or variants) during epidemic outbreaks ( Domingo, 2007 ) . In the case of human infl uenza virus, the acquisition of high epidemiological fi tness depends on multiple gene products. Critical substitutions in H may modify the receptorbinding specifi city of infl uenza viruses, and such substitutions have been found in minority subpopulations of infl uenza virus in several surveys. In one study, two substitutions in H identifi ed in a human infl uenza virus from a fatal human case, were shown to modify the receptor-binding preference of H of a H 5 N 1 virus from sialic acid-2,3 galactose (associated with replication in avian hosts) to both sialic acid-2,3 galactose and sialic acid-2,6 galactose, both associated with binding to human-type receptors, each expressed preferentially in different sites of the human respiratory tract ( Auewarakul et al. , 2007 ) . Thus, in infl uenza virus, and probably many other pathogenic viruses, both epidemiologic fi tness and replicative fi tness are multigenic traits ( Grimm et al. , 2007 ) .

Several studies have compared the amino acid sequence of multiple infl uenza virus proteins to search for markers (amino acid substitutions) of human isolates and human pandemic strains (from 1918, 1957, 1968 and recent human H 5 N 1 isolates). In one such proteomics survey, several amino acid changes located in PB2, PA, NP, M1, and NS1 distinguished avian infl uenza viruses from their human counterparts ( Finkelstein et al. , 2007 ) . Some markers were conserved in the infl uenza viruses that caused the 1918, 1957, and 1968 pandemics. Other studies have identifi ed HA and PB2 as critical for adaptation of avian virus to humans, that may occur by a step-wise process refl ected in acquisition of diagnostic amino acid markers. Evidence of human-to-human transmission of avian infl uenza virus H 5 N 1 has been obtained in some family case clusters but not in others ( Yang et al. , 2007 ) . Infl uenza constitutes the paradigm of a viral disease which, favored by a continuum of genetic variation, reemerges periodically to cause pandemics, and for which extensive epidemiological surveillance is currently in operation.

An increasing number of measurements of viral fi tness involve human immunodefi ciency virus 1 (HIV-1) variants isolated from quasispecies replicating in vivo . Particularly relevant are fi tness comparisons among multiple mutants harboring amino acid substitutions related to resistance to reverse transcriptase and protease inhibitors (see also Chapter 14).

Since the discovery of AZT (3 Ј -azido-3 Јdeoxythymidine, zidovudine) as an effective inhibitor of HIV replication ( Mitsuya et al. , 1985 ) , drug therapy has been widely used in the treatment of AIDS. The loss of therapeutic effect due to the acquisition of resistance was recognized for AZT in 1989, when Larder and colleagues showed that HIV isolates from patients with advanced HIV disease became less sensitive to the drug during the course of treatment ( Larder et al. , 1989 ) . High-level resistance to AZT is achieved through the accumulation of several mutations including M41L, D67N, K70R, L210W, T215Y/F, and K219Q/E (for a review, see Larder, 1994 ) . The fi rst substitution arising during AZT treatment is usually K70R, followed by T215Y. The K70R mutation appears frequently, since it requires only one nucleotide change, and does not have a major impact on viral fi tness ( Harrigan et al. , 1998 ) . The simultaneous presence of Leu41 and Tyr215 in the viral RT-coding region confers high-level resistance to AZT, without having a major effect on viral fi tness. In contrast, other combinations of AZT resistance mutations (e.g. M41L/K70R) confer reduced replication capacity ( Jeeninga et al. , 2001 ) . Interestingly, transmitted HIV-1 carrying D67N or K219Q evolve rapidly to AZT resistance in vitro (selecting for K70R) and show a high replicative fi tness in the presence of zidovudine ( García-Lerma et al. , 2004 ) . On the other hand, L210W improved infectivity and relative fi tness of an M41L/T215Y mutant in the presence of AZT, but decreased infectivity and relative fi tness when introduced into a D67N/K70R/K219Q background . Drug-resistant mutations occur in the mutant spectra of HIV-1 quasispecies from untreated patients ( Nájera et al. , 1995 ) . The replacement of Tyr215 by Cys, Asp, or Ser has been observed in vivo in the absence of zidovudine treatment ( Goudsmit et al. , 1997 ; Yerly et al. , 1998 ) . In the absence of inhibitor, T215S and T215D confer a small but signifi cant advantage over the wild-type virus, as determined in vitro in growth competition experiments. However, the replicative advantage conferred by T215S was lost in the presence of zidovudine-resistance mutations such as M41L and L210W ( García-Lerma et al. , 2001 ) .

Other nucleoside inhibitors of HIV-1 RT are listed in Table 4 .1 . High-level resistance to the nucleoside analogue 3TC (2 Ј , 3 Ј -dideoxy-3 Јthiacytidine, lamivudine) is rapidly achieved by the substitution M184 V, located at the YMDD motif, which is part of the catalytic core of the enzyme. During 3TC treatment, the substitution M184I appears fi rst, but then

Amino acid substitutions associated with drug resistance a Clotet et al., 2007; Johnson et al., 2007) . b Primary resistance mutations are shown in bold. Most PR inhibitors (saquinavir, indinavir, amprenavir, lopinavir, atazanavir, tipranavir, and darunavir) are usually prescribed in combination with a low dose of ritonavir, that has a boosting effect on the PR inhibitor concentration in plasma.

it is lost due to the outgrowth of the M184Vcontaining viruses ( Keulen et al. , 1997 ) .

Growth competition experiments showed a selective advantage of viruses with Val184 over those with Ile184. The low effi ciency of 3TC-resistant HIV-1, carrying RT mutations M184V or M184I, has been attributed to the low processivity of the mutant RT ( Back et al. , 1996 ) , which was accentuated in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) ( Keulen et al. , 1997 ) .

Other nucleoside analogue resistance mutations (e.g. K65R, K70E, or L74V) also have a signifi cant impact on viral fi tness, which correlates with a defect in RT processivity ( Sharma and Crumpacker, 1997 ; Miller et al. , 1998 ; Sharma and Crumpacker, 1999 ; White et al. , 2002 ) . The presence of K65R together with L74V or M184V has a strong deleterious effect on viral replication, due to the poor ability of K65R/L74V to use natural nucleotides relative to the wild type ( Deval et al. , 2004 ) , or to the negative impact of the simultaneous presence of K65R and M184V on the RT ' s processivity, as well as in the initiation of reverse transcription ( White et al. , 2002 ; Frankel et al. , 2007 ) . These observations are consistent with the low prevalence of the K65R mutation among isolates from antiretroviraldrug experienced patients, and give rational support to the benefi t in combining mutations that impair virus replication.

Drug combinations are very effective in blocking HIV replication, leading to a more than 10 000-fold reduction of viral load. Early studies showed that multiple drug resistance to AZT and other inhibitors can be achieved through the accumulation of mutations appearing in monotherapy ( Schmit et al. , 1996 ; Shafer et al. , 1998 ) . However, the response of a viral quasispecies to multiple constraints (e.g. different antiviral drugs) is often diffi cult to predict. Simultaneous treatment with AZT and ddI led to viruses with reduced sensitivity to AZT, ddC, ddI, ddG, and d4T ( Shirasaka et al. , 1995 ; Iversen et al. , 1996 ) . The resistant viruses contained substitutions A62V, V75I, F77L, F116Y, and Q151 M. Substitution Q151 M, which results from two nucleotide changes, is the fi rst to appear and confers partial resistance to AZT, ddI, ddC, and d4T. Fitness assays involving the determination of replication kinetics or growth competition experiments showed that mutations at codons 62, 75, 77, and 116 improved the replication capacity of the resistant virus ( Maeda et al. , 1998 ; Kosalaraksa et al. , 1999 ) .

With the increasing complexity of the antiretroviral regimens, novel mutational patterns conferring resistance to multiple antiretroviral drugs have been identifi ed. Thus, HIV-1 variants with insertions or deletions in the "" fi ngers "" subdomain of the RT have been found in patients failing therapy with multiple RT inhibitors  for a recent review, see Menéndez-Arias et al. , 2006 ) . The presence of the amino acid changes T69S and T215Y in the RT, together with a dipeptide insertion between positions 69 and 70 (usually Ser-Ser), and the subsequent accumulation of additional mutations (e.g. M41L, A62V, T69S, and K70R) leads to the emergence of virus displaying high-level resistance to thymidine analogues ( Matamoros et al. , 2004 ; Cases-González et al. , 2007 ) . Dual infection/competition experiments revealed that in the presence of low concentrations of AZT, removal of the two serine residues forming the dipeptide insertion in a multidrugresistant isolate does not cause a detrimental effect on the replication capacity of the virus ( Quiñones-Mateu et al. , 2002 ) . However, in the absence of drug, the insertions improved the fi tness of virus-carrying thymidine analogue mutations (e.g. M41L, L210W, T215Y, etc.). Although, multidrug-resistant mutants are able to maintain high viral loads in the presence of antiretroviral therapy, it should be noted that in vivo wild-type HIV variants outcompete those bearing the insertion, as demonstrated when therapy is interrupted Lukashov et al. , 2001 ) .

Non-nucleoside RT inhibitors bind to a hydrophobic cavity which is 8-10 Å away from the polymerase active site, and lined by the side-chains of Tyr181, Tyr188, Phe227, and Trp229 ( Kohlstaedt et al. , 1992 ) . High-level resistance appears quickly after treatment and involves amino acid changes in residues located at the inhibitor binding site (Table  4 .1). Again, resistance mutations often lead to reduced in vitro replication capacity. Examples are the nevirapine-resistance mutation V106A and the delavirdine-resistance mutation P236L that impair RNase H activity ( Gerondelis et al. , 1999 ; Archer et al. , 2000 ; Dykes et al. , 2001 ; Iglesias-Ussel et al. , 2002 ; Collins et al. , 2004 ) , as well as several mutations at codons 138 and 190, whose effects appear to be related to impaired DNA synthesis and RNase H degradation ( Pelemans et al. , 2001 ; Collins et al. , 2004 ; Wang et al. , 2006 ) .

The HIV-1 PR is a homodimeric enzyme composed of two polypeptide chains of 99 residues. The substrate binding site is located at the interface between both subunits. The side-chains of Arg8, Leu23, Asp25, Gly27, Ala28, Asp29, Asp30, Val32, Ile47, Gly48, Gly49, Ile50, Phe53, Leu76, Thr80, Pro81, Val82, and Ile84 form the substrate-binding pocket and can interact with specifi c inhibitors ( Wlodawer and Vondrasek, 1998 ) , such as those used in the clinical treatment of AIDS. Approved PR inhibitors share relatively similar chemical structures and cross-resistance is commonly observed in the clinical setting ( Menendez- Arias, 2002 ) . It is not unexpected that many resistance mutations affect residues of the inhibitor-binding pocket of the PR ( Table 4 .1 ). Studies carried out in vivo and in vitro have shown that several amino acid substitutions involved in drug resistance may have a deleterious effect on viral fi tness. Examples are D30N, I47A, I50V, G48V, and V82A ( Eastman et al. , 1998 ; Martinez-Picado et al. , 1999 ; Kantor et al. , 2002 ; Prado et al. , 2002 ; Yusa et al. , 2002 ; Colonno et al. , 2004 ) .

The deleterious effects caused by drug resistance mutations can be rescued by other amino acid replacements. For example, multidrug-resistant virus arising during prolonged therapy with indinavir contained PR with the substitutions M46I, L63P, V82T, and I84V ( Condra et al. , 1995 ; Martinez-Picado et al. , 1999 ) . Crystallographic studies of the mutant enzyme revealed that substitutions at codons 82 and 84 were critical for the acquisition of resistance, while the amino acid changes at codons 46 and 63, which are away from the inhibitor-binding site appear as compensatory mutations ( Chen et al. , 1995 ; Schock et al. , 1996 ) . Although compensatory mutations within the PR-coding region increase the catalytic effi ciency of the enzyme, there are other molecular mechanisms that lead to fi tness recovery during PR inhibitor treatments. Examples are: (i) mutations at Gag cleavage sites that increase polyprotein processing ( Doyon et al. , 1996 ; Zhang et al. , 1997 ; Pettit et al. , 2002 ) , (ii) mutations that affect the frameshift signal between the gag and pol genes that lead to an increased expression of pol products ( Doyon et al. , 1998 ) , or (iii) mutations outside of the cleavage sites that could affect the conformation of the Gag polyprotein and make the cleavage sites more accessible to the viral PR ( Gatanaga et al. , 2002 ; Myint et al. , 2004 ) .

For many years, the RT and the PR were the only targets of approved antiretroviral drugs. In 2003, enfuvirtide, a synthetic peptide that impairs virus-host cell membrane fusion, was licensed for clinical use. Resistance to enfuvirtide is mediated by amino acid substitutions at codons 36-38 of the envelope glycoprotein gp41. The amino acid sequences found at those positions in drug-sensitive viruses (DIV, SIV, GIV, or GIM) are replaced by SIM, DIM, or DTV in the drug-resistant clones ( Rimsky et al. , 1998 ) . As observed with PR and RT inhibitors, resistance mutations cause a fi tness loss, which was estimated to be approximately 10% in replication kinetics and growth competition experiments ( Lu et al. , 2004 ; Reeves et al. , 2005 ) . However, it should be noted that mutations in the V3 loop of the envelope glycoprotein gp120 can also affect the viral susceptibility to enfuvirtide ( Reeves et al. , 2002 ) , and further studies will be necessary to evaluate its impact on viral fi tness in vivo.

In August 2007, a CCR5 coreceptor antagonist known as maraviroc was approved for clinical use. Maraviroc has potent antiviral activity against CCR5-tropic HIV-1 variants, including primary isolates from various clades ( Dorr et al. , 2005 ) . Maraviroc-resistant HIV variants contained unique amino acid changes in the V3 loop (e.g. A316T and I323V) and other positions within the envelope glycoprotein, gp120, but continued to be phenotypically CCR5-tropic and sensitive to CCR5 antagonists in preclinical development, such as vicriviroc ( Westby et al. , 2007 ) .

Other antiretroviral drugs showing promising results in clinical trials are the integrase inhibitors raltegravir (licensed in October 2007) and elvitegravir. However, the information available on specifi c drug resistance mutations and their effects on the viral replication capacity is still preliminary.

This review of fi tness effects of drugresistance mutations in HIV-1 provides a dramatic illustration of the adaptive potential of a viral quasispecies. Acquisition of critical amino acid replacements for drug resistance, fi tness effects that favor selection of compensatory mutations either in a viral enzyme or in its target substrate, occurrence of clusters of mutations for multidrug resistance are but some of the mechanisms displayed by HIV-1 to persist in the human population.

The virological signifi cance of quasispecies theory becomes more apparent each year. Initial reports of extremely high error rates and great population diversity of RNA viruses were hotly disputed as being incorrect and inconsistent with often-observed stability in virus markers such as antigenicity, disease characteristics, host range, etc. High error rates and intra-population heterogeneity for RNA viruses are now widely accepted. Fortunately, early quasispecies theory presented a timely, remarkably prescient theoretical framework within which the behavior of replicating and evolving RNA virus populations could begin to be understood. Following elaboration by Eigen, Biebricher, Schuster, and colleagues, quasispecies-derived theory has been rapidly progressing and evolving. Its ground-breaking initial theoretical structure for exploring consequences of extreme biological error rates was informed by elegant molecular replication/ mutation kinetic studies with small RNA replicons in vitro. Original quasispecies theory was formally applicable to these in vitro experiments, and was necessarily generalized, idealized, and, in many specifi cs, openly unrealistic for real viruses. Some simplifying assumptions not applicable to viruses in the real world include: infi nite virus populations; global optima in the selective landscape; one most-fi t master sequence in a single, unvarying selective landscape; fi tness restricted to competition solely between one master sequence and diverse variants of equally low fi tness; and, fi nally, omission of complexities such as replicative interference, lethal mutations, complementation, recombination, etc.

Early modeling could not reasonably encompass all real-life complexities. To attempt inclusion of all would render any model (or alternative collection of models) hopelessly unwieldy, uninformative, and poorly predictive due to requisite alternate weightings of factors. Simplifi ed assumptions not conforming to complex realities need not detract from the ability of models to serve as starting points and guideposts toward new directions for experiment and theory. Quasispecies theory has indisputably led virology to powerful new insights, deductions, and directions. A few critics have suggested that the non-real world parameters in early quasispecies models, and the nonrealistic (and foregone) conclusions that can be contrived from them, are reason to reject the general validity and broad signifi cance of quasispecies. Such circular arguments are specious and trivial relative to the experimental and conceptual advances already-made, and yet-to-be-made, via quasispecies theory with its straightforward conclusions and more subtle implications.

Increasingly sensitive analyses of viral quasispecies in recent decades have produced many remarkable insights. The most basic, far-reaching, awesomely predictive tenet of quasispecies theory will never be overshadowed; numerous variant genomes are bound together through extreme mutation rates, forming obligatorily co-selected partnerships in a vast, error-prone mutant spectrum from which they cannot escape, and from which they inevitably and coordinately may exert myriad, changing, ultimately unforseeable effects on all life forms. This tenet has been unquestionably and elegantly confi rmed recently by the U. C. San Francisco, Stanford and Penn State groups (as reviewed above and elsewhere in this volume).

A signifi cant postulate of early quasispecies models was that of "" error catastrophe. "" This posits that replicase-generated quasispecies mutation rates are, through evolutionary selection, poised at, or near, an error threshold. Prolonged violation of this threshold (through replicase dysfunction, mutagens, elevated temperatures, nucleotide pool alterations, etc.) leads to virus extinction via a fast and irreversible transition, that has sometimes been equated with a phase transition in physics, as discussed in the opening chapter of this volume. Because the simplifi ed model employed nonrealistic parameters and envisioned indefi nite mutational drift, critics deny the existence of error thresholds and sharp transitions to error catastrophe. No real-world virus could conform to the simplifying assumptions employed in that model, but recent data from lethal mutagenesis experiments do demonstrate devolution to error catastrophe. Historical precedent for the term "" error catastrophe "" lies with Orgel ' s suggestion in 1963 of cascading coordinate collapse of cellular information within (and between) various interdependent cellular nucleic acid and protein trans -networks. We also employ the term in a broad manner for lethal mutagenesis. This is especially appropriate with mutagens such as 5-FU (which modify both viral and cellular nucleic acids and their encoded functions and structures). We cannot presently rule out some roles for mutagenized cellular, as well as viral, macromolecules, during lethal mutagenesis. Regardless, complex interactions of altered viral macromolecular networks are defi nitely involved. Extinction is mediated by "" trans -acting networks "" among abundant lethal defector genomes. The senior author ' s group in Madrid demonstrated (reviewed above) that strongly mutagenized RNA virus populations do collapse to extinction via a sharp transition, but without the non-lethal, continuous mutational drift exemplifi ed in the original quasispecies simulations. Extremely rapid extinctions are observed for low-fi tness input virus strains, which transition into error catastrophe during a single round of infection/mutagenesis. Lethal mutagenesis of FMDV and LCMV is mediated by full-length, replicating, interfering, lethal defector genomes. Total (defective and viable) genomic RNA mutation frequencies are elevated to varying extents, whereas specifi c infectivity of total genomic RNA is decreased by several orders of magnitude without any change of RNA consensus sequence. In light of quasispecies "" variant-ensemble "" behavior, it is not surprising that defective genomes can predominate within trans -acting networks during lethal mutagenesis, and continue to replicate even after extinction of LCMV infectivity. Defector trans -effects can provide positive complementation in concert with, or alternation with, (orthogonal) interference. Standard concepts of virus fi tness are only tangentially applicable within such collapsing trans -networks. Catastrophic decay of viral digital information proceeds on (at least) two levels: (1) genetic quenching due to egregious fi xation of genomic mutations in a trans -network environment that does not always select for optimal function of self-encoded proteins, and (2) phenotypic transquenching of potentially viable genomes via altered, defector-encoded (interfering) proteins. Possible roles of RNA recombination remain to be explored.

Defector-driven transitions will be challenging to dissect, and no theoretical model can possibly capture even their main intricacies. During lethal mutagenesis at high multiplicities of infection, each infected cell is a single compartment in which a separate, discrete error catastrophe event may devolve. Each discrete trans -network is disrupted and obscured during virus passages or RNA transfections following initial infection/ mutagenesis. Multiplicity of infection (for both viable and defector virions) is clearly a crucial variable during passages. Virus strains with low replicative fi tness (and mutagendebilitated genomes) theoretically should be (and are) more vulnerable than highly fi t strains to defector-mediated error catastrophe. Low-fi tness strains cannot quickly produce high yields during temporary escape from defector networks. Future investigations with controlled compartmentalization (e.g. characterization of isolated infectious centers, microinjection of single cells, etc.), together with molecular genetic construction/reconstruction of defi ned trans -networks will illuminate preextinction events.

The Madrid group has already verifi ed that ordinary, viable FMDV variant RNAs, and mixtures of variant RNAs bearing defi ned mutations in the capsid and polymerase genes can exert trans -complementation and interference effects on standard FMDV RNA following co-electroporation of cells. Clearly, at high multiplicities of co-electroporation, such mixtures of defi ned variant and control RNAs generate unique, mutually supportive or suppressive (complementing/interfering) trans -acting networks within each individual, coinfected cell. This provides strong analogies to events during the transitions of lethal mutagenesis. The compelling differences, of course, are that the latter devolve to extinction due to: (1) mutagenelevated mutation, AND elevated mutationfi xation rates in a poorly-selective trans -milieu;

(2) potent trans -quenching of surviving-andcollapsing infectious virus via interfering (lethal defector-encoded) proteins.

Thus, the quasispecies postulate of a rapid transition to extinction has been experimentally verifi ed, albeit the complex defector mechanisms for real viruses differ signifi cantly from those originally modeled, as indeed recognized and anticipated by Eigen (see above). It is evident that the details of lethal mutagenesis will likely differ among families of RNA viruses (e.g. those having mono-, bi-, or multipartitite genomes, strong or weak complementation, homologous or only non-homologous recombination, naked or enveloped capsids, etc.). However, it seems probable that error catastrophe will be observed in all. Although no theoretical model can possibly capture all the ingredients involved in the replicative collapse of a mutagenized viral population, it was the original error threshold which inspired the experiments currently being performed in several laboratories.

The tenets of Eigen, Biebricher, Schuster, and colleagues, derived from fi rst principles and tractable models, have had enormous infl uence in virology. This pervasive infl uence is in no manner weakened nor negated by original simplifying assumptions.

Genetic Diversity and Phylodynamics of Avian Coronaviruses in Egyptian Wild Birds,"Avian coronaviruses (ACoVs) are continuously evolving and causing serious economic consequences in the poultry industry and around the globe. Owing to their extensive genetic diversity and high mutation rates, controlling ACoVs has become a challenge. In this context, the potential contribution of wild birds in the disease dynamics, especially in domesticated birds, remains largely unknown. In the present study, five hundred fifty-seven (n = 557) cloacal/fecal swabs were collected from four different wild bird species from eight Egyptian governorates during 2016 and a total of fourteen positive isolates were used for phylodynamics and evolutionary analysis. Genetic relatedness based on spike (S1) gene demonstrated the clustering of majority of these isolates where nine isolates grouped within Egy/variant 2 (IS/885 genotype) and five isolates clustered within Egy/variant 1 (IS/1494/06 genotype). Interestingly, these isolates showed noticeable genetic diversity and were clustered distal to the previously characterized Egy/variant 1 and Egy/variant 2 in Egyptian commercial poultry. The S1 gene based comparison of nucleotide identity percentages revealed that all fourteen isolates reported in this study were genetically related to the variant GI-23 lineage with 92-100% identity. Taken together, our results demonstrate that ACoVs are circulating in Egyptian wild birds and highlight their possible contributions in the disease dynamics. The study also proposes that regular monitoring of the ACoVs in wild birds is required to effectively assess the role of wild birds in disease spread, and the emergence of ACoVs strains in the country.","Coronaviruses are classified into three well-accepted genera; alpha-, beta-, and gamma-coronavirus whereas deltacoronavirus [1,2] is proposed as an additional group in the family. Alphacoronaviruses and betacoronaviruses have been isolated from mammals, whereas gammacoronaviruses, represented by the infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), are detected primarily in birds including poultry [2] .

Viral RNA was extracted from the allantoic fluids using Trizol LS®reagent kit (ThermoFisher, Life Technologies Corporation|Carlsbad, CA 92008, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The eluted RNA in 30 µL of nuclease free water was stored at (−70 • C) until processing for the amplification. A single step RT-PCR was performed using the Verso One Step RT-PCR kit (ThermoFisher, Life Technologies Corporation|Carlsbad, California, USA) using previously reported primers for amplification of partial polymerase (RdRp) and full length S1 gene [6, 21] . PCR products were gel excised and purified individually using QIAEX ® Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Gene sequencing was carried out using a BigDye Terminator v3.1 cycle sequencing kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) in an ABI PRISM®300 using sequencing primers as described previously [22] .

The obtained sequences for RdRp (MF034358.1-MF034371.1) and S1 genes (MF034369.1-MF034385.1) were quality checked, assembled, edited using BioEdit software version 7.0.4.1 [23] and submitted to GenBank using BankIt tool of the GenBank (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/WebSub/ ?tool=genbank). Analysis of full length S1 protein was conducted to determine the presence of potential N-linked glycosylation sites among the isolated Egyptian ACoV strains using BioEdit software version 7.0.4.1 [23] . To elucidate the phylogenetic relationships and high level clustering pattern based on full length S1 gene between ACoVs reported here and previously characterized from Middle East including Egypt and other parts of the world; we first compiled a dataset of all available S1 gene sequences. Then, this dataset was aligned in BioEdit version 7.0.1 [23] using Clustal W algorithm and was trimmed to equal lengths. To avoid sequence length biasness in evolutionary incursion, all sequences that aligned poorly or with incomplete information were excluded from the analysis. A phylogenetic tree was constructed using the nucleotide sequences of the S1 genes. For maximum-likelihood analysis of the phylogenetic relationship, a best-fit model was chosen on which further calculations and an ultrafast bootstrap equivalent analysis were based. IQ-tree software version 1.1.3 was used for these operations [24] .

To explore the overall differences in selection pressure on the S1 gene, especially on the hypervariable regions (HVRs) sequences that define the cross-neutralization and escape mutant ACoV strains, we analyzed the occurrences of synonymous (dS) and non-synonymous (dN) substitutions using SNAP web tool (https://www.hiv.lanl.gov/content/sequence/SNAP/SNAP.html) [25] , which plots the cumulative and per-codon occurrence of each substitutions. Six methods (RDP, GeneConv, BootScan, MaxChi, Chimaera and SiScan) integrated in the RDP v3 program [26] were applied on the avian CoVs sequences reported here to estimate any recombination event and to detect any putative recombination breakpoint using the nucleotide alignment of the S1 gene sequences. These methods were applied using the following parameters: window size = 20, highest acceptable p-value = 0.001 and Bonferroni correction. For reliable results, any putative recombination events detected by more than one method were considered.

A total of 557 samples were collected from randomly selected wild birds dense and ACoV endemic areas from eight provinces. These samples were individually screened by the RT-PCR targeting the RdRp gene followed by the full length S1 gene of the ACoVs. From this screening, 2.5% positive rate (14 out of 557) was detected among all tested fecal/cloacal samples. We classified all species that were included in the analysis into four different families that reflected both their taxonomy and their ecology (Table 1) . These families were Passeridae (1 species, n = 140), Phasianidae (1 species, n = 136), Anatidae (1 species, n = 150) and Ardeidae (1 species, n = 131). Anatidaeily was most frequently noted as ACoV-positive (4.7%), followed by Ardeidae (3.1%) and Phasianidae (1.5%), while Passeridae had the lowest prevalence (0.7%). Furthermore, there were notable variations in the proportion of positive samples between provinces: Sharqia, Dakahlia, Kafr El Sheikh, Gharbia, Qalubia, Menofia and Benisuef ( Table 2) . The lowest prevalence rates were observed on Dakahlia (1.2%) and Menofia (1.7%), whereas Qalubia (2.5%), Gharbia (2.4%), Benisuef (2.3%) were at the mid-point, and the highest rates were detected at Kafr El Sheikh (5%) and Sharqia (3.3%) ( Table 2) . However, Giza province did not show any positive ACoV (Table 2) .

Phasianidae (1 species, n = 136), Anatidae (1 species, n = 150) and Ardeidae (1 species, n = 131).

Anatidaeily was most frequently noted as ACoV-positive (4.7%), followed by Ardeidae (3.1%) and Phasianidae (1.5%), while Passeridae had the lowest prevalence (0.7%). Furthermore, there were notable variations in the proportion of positive samples between provinces: Sharqia, Dakahlia, Kafr El Sheikh, Gharbia, Qalubia, Menofia and Benisuef ( Table 2 ). The lowest prevalence rates were observed on Dakahlia (1.2%) and Menofia (1.7%), whereas Qalubia (2.5%), Gharbia (2.4%), Benisuef (2.3%) were at the mid-point, and the highest rates were detected at Kafr El Sheikh (5%) and Sharqia (3.3%) ( Table 2 ). However, Giza province did not show any positive ACoV (Table 2 ). 

Comparison of nucleotide identity percentages, based up on S1 gene revealed that the fourteen isolates were 92-100% identity percentage (Table 3 ). In 2001, an Egyptian variant I strain (Egypt/Beni-Suef/01), closely related to the Israeli variant strain, was reported in different poultry farms [18] . Another variant was also identified in 2011 [27] and designated as Egyptian variant II. Deduced amino acids analysis was conducted to establish the genetic spectrum, origin, evolution, and the mutation trend analysis for Egyptian ACoVs. Hypervariable regions (HVRs) in the S1 gene showed distinct patterns among different viruses compared to the H120 and Ma5 strains (Table 4 ). In the analyzed sequence of the fourteen viruses in this study, amino acid mutations associated with virus tropism were identified at positions 38 (38N in only one virus while 38T in thirteen viruses) and 69 (69S in seven viruses and 69A in seven viruses) in the S1 protein of the variant strains. In addition, seventeen potential N-linked glycosylation sites in most of the Egyptian ACoV strains were found, with nine NXT and eight NXS sites in all the fourteen isolates reported in this study. 

Based on the amplified CoV polymerase (RdRp) gene fragments, the phylogenetic analyses confirmed that the all detected viruses in this study belonged to gamma-coronaviruses ( Figure 2 ) along with other ACoVs. Phylogenomic analysis based on S1 gene of the ACoVs collected from Egypt and rest of the world, indicated that Egyptian viruses reported here were clustered with isolates from Libya, Oman and Kurdistan and shared ancestors ( 

A pairwise comparison bioinformatics approach (SNAP) was applied to determine the synonymous and non-synonymous substitution rates and selective evolutionary pressure for the S1 protein. The results presented in Figure 5 indicate the selection trends where numbers above zero indicate the positive selection, around zero shows the neutral selection, and below zero indicates the negative or purifying selection. The selection profiles of the amino acid sequence of all fourteen Egyptian ACoV strains showed different patterns within the S1 protein. Analysis of subtract synonymous and non-synonymous substitution rates in the isolates also demonstrated the presence of purifying (negative) selection. The cumulative difference between the non-synonymous substitution rate (dN) and the synonymous substitution rate (dS) (i.e., dN-dS) revealed that positive selection along the spike (S1) protein while negative and neutral selection was also detected ( Figure 5 ). When the S1 genes of ACoV strains were used as the query, a number of possible recombination sites were identified. Recombination analysis for the aligned sequences under study report the detection of possible recombination events; (1) AY091552. 

Continuous generations of natural mutant viruses or quasispecies subpopulations may result in the adaptation of such viruses to evade the host immune system and to gain higher transmissibility to new hosts [28] . ACoVs are continuously evolving, and the variant strains are one of the major emerging problems in the Egyptian poultry industry for the past five years and have resulted in significant economic losses. Furthermore, the infection predisposes the host for secondary bacterial infections resulting in an even higher morbidity and mortality rates [29] . Different serotypes have been reported worldwide and new variant serotypes are continuously being recognized [4] . However, there is no clear classification criterion for the circulating ACoVs, worldwide, which possesses complications in establishing epidemiological linking. Previous molecular studies revealed that the S1 subunit of S gene of ACoV is responsible for determining its serotypes [30] and new ACoV genotypes could arise as a result of substitutions in the amino acids of the S1 subunit [3] . S1 subunit has three HVRs, located within amino acids 38-67, 91-141, and 274-387 [3] [4] [5] and these HVRs were considered an essential determinant of coronavirus serotype specificity [31] .

Factors that contribute in the evolution and emergence of ACoV in commercial poultry are largely unknown. Evidences are that wild birds might constitute transmission vectors for ACoVs even in a huge geographic territory. It has also been proposed that when an ACoV infects the same wild bird host, this could lead to the emergence of new variants of ACoV [32] and the possibility of recombination between different ACoV strains. To assess the ACoV existence and carrying-potential of Egyptian wild birds for the first time in the country, 557 cloacal swabs were randomly collected from different wild bird species in different Egyptian governorates. Detection of gamma-coronaviruses (ACoVs) in wild bird samples from geographically separated populations highlights the potential of wild birds in the possible dissemination of ACoV. Since most of the ACoV positive wild birds were migratory and that Egypt has been proposed to be an important gateway in the Middle East and North of Africa for most of the emerging infectious diseases, it is likely that the mixing of birds and viruses from different hemispheres can lead to disease transmission. From this and other studies, it is reasonable to assume that a great variety of hitherto undetected ACoVs exist in wild bird species. Previous studies that examined the host range and genetic diversity of CoVs have revealed that ACoVs in wild birds are present mainly in wildfowl (Anseriformes) and waders (Charadriiformes) [22, 33, 34] . Our results corroborate these findings and indicate that ACoVs are common among different wild birds. Conclusively, the data show that there is circulation of genetically divergent ACoVs among wild bird populations in geographically distinct areas of Egypt. Although the number of samples analyzed in this study was limited, it can be assumed that the genetic variation of ACoVs among wild birds is much higher than previously thought. Isolates of ACoV that are sequenced and reported here not only show a high similarity with isolates from Israeli, Libya and Oman strains but are also highly similar (99-100%) to the strains previously reported from commercial poultry flocks, which implies that certain strains may have the potential to spread directly or indirectly to distant regions or to other countries.

Although no discrete and globally accepted classification system exists for ACoV, our results revealed that most of ACoVs available on GenBank are divided into variant and classic groups based on the sequence of the full length S1 genes. The classic group has only the Massachusetts serotype (mass-like/vaccine strains) (GI-1 lineage) according to Valsastro et al. [8] . In 2001, an Egyptian variant I strain (Egypt/Beni-Suef/01), closely related to the Israeli variant strain, was reported on different poultry farms [18] . Another variant was also identified in 2011 [27] and designated as Egyptian variant II. Variant genotype can be subdivided into at least eight subgenotypes according to their origin and evolution; 4/91 genotype, Taiwan and China like, Australia variant, QX variant, IS/1494/06 (Egy/Variant-1) and IS/885 (Egy/Variant-2). Egy/Variant I and II are belonging to GI-23 lineage, which represents a unique geographic wild-type cluster confined to the Middle East according to Valsastro et al. [8] . Some have become dominant in the majority of farms and are involved in respiratory and renal pathologies in the last five years.

However, previous studies reported that the variant group (GI-23 lineage) represents a unique geographic wild-type cluster, indigenous and predominate within the Middle East that includes IS/885/00 and IS/1494/06 [8, 18, 35] , recent studies reported that the majority of the Egyptian ACoV strains (IBVs) belong to QX-like, 4/91, IS/1494/06 (Egy/Variant-1) and IS/885 (Egy/Variant-2) genotypes [27, 36] . These genotypes were formerly present in the Egyptian commercial farms five years ago with increasing the mortality rates in broiler flocks but had not been described before in wild birds because of low surveillance and epidemiological studies directed towards wild birds worldwide. Our results indicated the prevalence of Egy/variant 1 (IS/1494/06 genotype) (5/14; 35.7%), in spite of relative abundance of Egy/variant 2 (IS/885 genotype) (9/14; 64.3%). The emergence of Egy/variant 1 (IS/1494/06-like) and Egy/variant 2 (IS/885-like) in Egypt has been introduced to the poultry population raises several speculations; it could be due to the introduction of carriers during importations of chicks from Middle East countries where this genotype was endemic or due to the role of migratory birds as a source of infection [19] that has been proposed in this study. Likewise, clustering of some ACoVs isolated from wild and commercial birds in Libya, Oman, and Kurdistan and allocated within the same Egyptian clusters either Egy/variant 1 and or Egy/variant 2 highlights the role of wild birds for transmission of such viruses. These results indicate the circulation of ACoVs in Egyptian wild birds, which could potentially be through the wild birds of neighboring countries and support the possible role of wild birds in the transmission of such viruses.

Recombination has been well reported and is thought to be a contributing factor in the emergence and evolution of different coronavirus genotypes as well as different species of coronavirus [37] . Thor and colleagues reported that the principal mechanisms for generating genetic and antigenic diversity within ACoV indicate a progressive evolutionary change that is the result of recombination events in the ACoV genome that play a major role in the origin and adaptation of the virus, leading to the emergence of new IB genotypes and serotypes [38] . Many recombination events have been reported in different ACoV strains, not only between field (wild-type) and vaccine viruses but also among field viruses either within the same genotype (intra-genotypic) or between different genotypes (inter-genotypic) [39, 40] , giving rise to new ACoV genotypes [41] . Recombination analysis for the aligned sequences under study report the detection of recombination events; 1) AY091552.2 IBV IS/720/99/S and JX173489.1 IBV/Eg/CLEVB-1/012 strains to produce a recombinant strain MF034384 ACoV/Teal/Kafr El Sheikh-Egypt/VRLCU-13/2016; 2) KC197206.1 IBV/ck/Egypt/12vir6109-79/2012 and JX174186.1 IBV Ck/Eg/BSU-3/2011 strains to produce a recombinant strain MF034381 ACoV/Cattle erget/ Kafr El Sheikh -Egypt/VRLCU-10/2016, which may be a precursor for further variants. Further studies are required to determine the pathobiological and clinical features of this virus in a chicken model. In addition, continuous sequence analysis for the currently circulating IBVs is highly recommended to study the possible spread of this virus and for better understanding of its phylogenetic relatedness to other viruses. These results indicate a progressive recombination of events that occur among wild birds as well as between the circulating variant field strains. Positively selected fragments of genes encoding viral proteins exposed on the surface of the capsid have been documented in other viruses [42, 43] . There is an association between positively selected sites along the S1 subunit identified in this study and mapped neutralizing epitopes. It has been reported that mutations in the S1 protein often result in changes in antigenicity [5] . Likewise, parts of the hypervariable regions (HVR1, 2 and 3) defined in this study were shown to be under strong positive selection in the ACoV strains. Taken together, the strong positively selected motifs among the S1 protein may thus be associated with the immune response and receptor binding and would thus be important in future ACoV vaccine development.

This is the first report confirming the detection of ACoV in wild birds in different Egyptian governorates. Phylodynamic and evolutionary analysis indicate that wild bird ACoV strains are closely related to the infectious bronchitis viruses (IBVs) reported from commercial poultry, indicating their possible threat to commercial poultry. Intensified surveillance of wild birds is an important means of assessing the relative prevalence of ACoV variants, and this knowledge would aid risk assessments and risk management of these viruses. Wild bird surveillance that includes virus isolation may also be a tool for obtaining strains of ACoVs that can be used for vaccine development and diagnostics. Moreover, this study provides insights into the genetic diversity of ACoVs in wild birds' reservoirs. Further assessing the prevalence and effects of ACoV infections in wild birds will increase our knowledge on CoV interactions with their hosts and may suggest as yet unexploited avenues for combating CoV infections. There is a clear need for a better understanding of ACoV ecology through full genome sequencing that will provide detailed information on different subgroups, and this would require comprehensive data through better surveillance of wild birds.

Pathogen diversity drives the evolution of generalist MHC-II alleles in human populations,"Central players of the adaptive immune system are the groups of proteins encoded in the major histocompatibility complex (MHC), which shape the immune response against pathogens and tolerance to self-peptides. The corresponding genomic region is of particular interest, as it harbors more disease associations than any other region in the human genome, including associations with infectious diseases, autoimmune disorders, cancers, and neuropsychiatric diseases. Certain MHC molecules can bind to a much wider range of epitopes than others, but the functional implication of such an elevated epitope-binding repertoire has remained largely unclear. It has been suggested that by recognizing more peptide segments, such promiscuous MHC molecules promote immune response against a broader range of pathogens. If so, the geographical distribution of MHC promiscuity level should be shaped by pathogen diversity. Three lines of evidence support the hypothesis. First, we found that in pathogen-rich geographical regions, humans are more likely to carry highly promiscuous MHC class II DRB1 alleles. Second, the switch between specialist and generalist antigen presentation has occurred repeatedly and in a rapid manner during human evolution. Third, molecular positions that define promiscuity level of MHC class II molecules are especially diverse and are under positive selection in human populations. Taken together, our work indicates that pathogen load maintains generalist adaptive immune recognition, with implications for medical genetics and epidemiology.","a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111

The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) genes in vertebrates encode cell surface proteins and are essential components of adaptive immune recognition [1] . MHC proteins are endowed with highly variable peptide-binding domains that bind short protein fragments. The MHC region is one of the most polymorphic gene clusters in vertebrate genomes [2] . Co-evolutionary arms race with pathogens is considered largely responsible for the observed exceptionally high levels of genetic diversity [3] [4] [5] [6] , yet it cannot fully account for the observed geographic differences in human MHC genetic diversity [7, 8] . This indicates that, beyond MHC allelic diversity, other MHC-related factors contribute to the capacity of human populations to withstand pathogens. In this paper, we argue that peptide-binding repertoire size (or, shortly, promiscuity) of MHC alleles is one important factor.

Recent empirical studies demonstrated that there is a substantial variation in the size of the bound and presented antigen repertoire across MHC class I alleles. Certain MHC class I alleles appear to be promiscuous and are capable of binding an exceptionally large set of epitope peptide segments [9, 10] . For example, Paul and colleagues carried out bioinformatics analysis to predict the binding capacity of common HLA-A and HLA-B alleles to a set of 30,000 dengue virus-derived peptides [11] . The analysis revealed over 16-fold variation in the number of peptides bound by the different alleles, indicating significant variation in epitope repertoire size across HLA molecules. The authors selected three alleles for further study in an in vivo transgenic mouse model. Immunization of the corresponding HLA transgenic mouse strains with a set of dengue virus-derived peptides revealed a positive relationship between epitope repertoire size and immunogenicity. Similarly, Kosmrlj and colleagues computed the fraction of self-peptides that bind to various HLA-B molecules, and found that this fraction varies extensively across four HLA-B alleles [12] . The authors then demonstrated that the self-peptidebinding repertoire of HLA-B shapes the native repertoire of T-cell clones developed in the thymus, with implications for recognizing human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) epitopes. Their results could explain why individuals carrying HLA-B � 57 alleles can maintain low HIV RNA without therapy. Remarkably, analogous MHC class I alleles with the HLA-B � 27 superfamily is widespread in Chinese rhesus macaques, animals which show especially slow progression of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)/HIV [13] . Finally, by focusing on seven chicken MHC class I haplotypes and four human HLA-B alleles, Chappel and colleagues demonstrated that MHC class I molecules that can bind a wide range of viral epitopes show lowered expression on the cellular surfaces of immune cells, such as monocytes and lymphocytes [9] . The authors suggested that the breadth of epitope-binding repertoire shapes genetic susceptibility to Marek's disease virus in chickens and HIV disease progression in humans.

More generally, by recognizing more peptide segments, promiscuous MHC molecules may promote immune response against a broader range of pathogens and are hence generalists [9, 10] . Prior case studies in chicken indicate that this may be so [14] [15] [16] [17] . However, it remains to be established whether this relationship generally holds across MHC class I and II alleles and a wide range of infectious diseases. Specifically, we propose that in regions of high pathogen diversity, human populations should carry promiscuous MHC alleles. Moreover, as migrating human populations have been exposed to changing sets of pathogens [18] , shifts in MHC promiscuity level should have occurred repeatedly and in a rapid manner during the course of human evolution.

To test these predictions, we first focused on the human HLA class II DRB1 gene, for several reasons. First, DRB1 is the most variable HLA class II locus, with over 2,000 registered alleles [19] . Together with HLA-DRA, HLA-DRB1 encodes the heterodimeric HLA-DR protein complex, but HLA-DRA is basically invariant. Second, DRB1 shows the strongest general signature of selection among HLA class II loci [20] , while at the same time showing the weakest evidence for divergent allele advantage, an alternative mechanism at the genotype level for presenting a broader set epitopes [21] . Third, DRB1 has diversified very rapidly in the human lineage [22] . Many of the DRB1 alleles appear to be human specific and most likely evolved after the migration of ancestral human populations out of Africa [22] . These periods have been associated with human populations encountering numerous new pathogens [18, 23] . For other HLA class II loci, the level of genetic diversity is lower [19, 24] , probably driven by selection for functions partly unrelated to pathogens. Notably, HLA-DQ has a fundamental role in the development of immune tolerance [25, 26] , while HLA-DP contributes to the presentation of epitopes of intracellular origins [27] [28] [29] . Fourth, epitope-binding prediction algorithms show higher accuracy for DRB1 than for other HLA class II loci [30, 31] . Finally, the abundance of DRB1 on the cell surface is especially high compared with other HLA class II molecules [32] [33] [34] . Subsequently, we also evaluated promiscuity patterns of HLA class I molecules.

Estimates on epitope-binding promiscuity were derived from two sources: experimental assays that measured individual peptide-MHC interactions in vitro and systematic computational predictions. In a series of analyses, we show that predictions of our hypothesis are upheld, regardless of how HLA-DRB1 promiscuity level is estimated.

Given that large-scale experimental assays to measure individual peptide-MHC interactions are extremely tedious, we first employed established bioinformatics tools to predict the binding affinities of experimentally verified epitope peptides for a panel of 162 nonsynonymous HLA-DRB1 alleles, all of which are present at detectable frequencies in at least one human population [35] [36] [37] . The set of investigated epitopes was derived from the Immune Epitope Database (IEDB) and contains 2,691 peptide epitopes of 71 pathogens known to be bound by certain HLA class II alleles [38] (S1 Data). Epitopes showing high levels of amino acid similarity to each other were excluded from the analysis (See Methods). Most included epitopes are 15 to 20 amino acids long and are found in only one of the 71 pathogens (S1 Fig, S1 Data) . The NetMHCIIpan algorithm was used to predict individual epitope-MHC interactions [30] , not least because it outperforms other prediction algorithms [31] . The breadth of epitope-binding repertoire or, shortly, the level of promiscuity of individual HLA-DRB1 alleles was estimated as the fraction of epitopes with a binding affinity stronger than 50 nM to the given MHC molecule. This threshold corresponds to high-affinity binding, which is frequently observed in MHC molecules displaying immunodominance [39] . We found large variation in promiscuity levels across HLA-DRB1 alleles (S2 Fig, S2 Data) . Using a smaller dataset with information from both approaches, we show that the computationally predicted and the empirically estimated promiscuity values are strongly correlated with each other (Spearman's rho: 0.78, 

Taking advantage of the confirmed reliability of computational predictions, we next investigated the geographic distribution of HLA-DRB1 alleles. We first collected high-quality HLA-DRB1 allele prevalence data of 96 human populations residing in 43 countries from two databases and an article [35] [36] [37] . The weighted average of promiscuity level in each population was calculated based on the promiscuity values and allele frequencies of individual alleles in the population (See Methods). The analysis revealed a large variation in mean promiscuity across geographical regions and the corresponding human populations (S1 Table) . Importantly, several distantly related but highly promiscuous alleles contribute to this pattern (S1 Table) . Notably, an especially high allelic promiscuity level was found in Southeast Asia, an important hot spot of emerging infectious diseases [40] . To minimize any potential confounding effect of high genetic relatedness between neighboring populations, we merged populations with similar HLA allele compositions for all further analyses (See Methods).

Using the Global Infectious Diseases and Epidemiology Network (GIDEON), we compiled a dataset on pathogen richness in the corresponding 43 geographic regions [41] . It consists of 95 diseases caused by 168 extracellular pathogens, including diverse bacterial species, fungi, protozoa, and helminthes. Using the same protocol, we additionally compiled a dataset on the prevalence of 149 diseases in the same regions caused by 214 viral and other obligate intracellular pathogens. The dataset and methodology employed for the analysis are standardized and have been used previously in similar contexts [7, 8, 42] .

We report a strong positive correlation between extracellular pathogen diversity and mean promiscuity: HLA-DRB1 alleles that can bind epitopes from a broader range of pathogens are more likely to be found in regions of elevated pathogen diversity ( Fig 1A) . This pattern is unlikely to be explained by confounding factors, such as country size or HLA-DRB1 genetic diversity across countries (S2 Table) . By contrast, we found no significant association between HLA-DRB1 promiscuity level and diversity of intracellular pathogens (Fig 1B) . We conclude that the geographical distribution of promiscuous HLA-DRB1 alleles has been mainly shaped by the diversity of extracellular pathogens.

The above results hold-and are even stronger-when estimates on promiscuity were derived from empirical in vitro MHC binding data (shortly, in vitro promiscuity), downloaded from the IEDB database [38] (Fig 1C and 1D , S2 Table and S3 Data). However, these results do not exclude the possibility that the geographical link between pathogen diversity and promiscuity is indirect. More direct support on the causal relationship between the two variables comes from analysis of prior human genetic studies. To investigate this issue, we focused on two geographically widespread allelic groups with exceptionally high (HLA-DRB1 � 12) and exceptionally low (HLA-DRB1 � 03) promiscuity values, respectively, and conducted literature mining on their reported associations with infectious diseases (S3 Table) . As expected, HLA-DRB1 � 12 was associated with protection against at least five infectious diseases, while HLA-DRB1 � 03 was associated with susceptibilities to eight infectious diseases, which is highly unlikely by chance (Fisher test, P = 0.003) (S3 Table, S5 Data). The data also indicate local adaptation towards elevated promiscuity under diverse pathogen pressure. The HLA-DRB1 � 12:02 allele is prevalent in specific regions of Southeast Asia. Compared with other alleles detected in this region, HLA-DRB1 � 12:02 has a relatively high promiscuity value (top . Indeed, this allele is associated with protection from recurrent pulmonary tuberculosis, recurrent typhoid fever, and hepatosplenic schistomiasis (S5 Data), all of which are endemic diseases in Southeast Asia [44] [45] [46] . Remarkably, the frequency of this allele increases with extracellular pathogen diversity in this region ( Fig 2B) . Together, these observations support the hypothesis that promiscuous epitope binding of HLA-DRB1 alleles is favored by selection when extracellular pathogen diversity is high.

An important unresolved issue is how promiscuity has changed during the course of human evolution. Under the assumption that local pathogen diversity drives the evolution of epitope recognition of HLA class II alleles, promiscuity as a molecular trait should have evolved rapidly as human populations expanded into new territories. To investigate this issue, we combined an established phylogeny of HLA-DRB1 alleles [47] with predicted epitope-binding promiscuity values. We found that alleles with a high promiscuity level have a patchy distribution across the tree (S6 Fig), indicating that high promiscuity has multiple independent origins. To investigate this observation further, we selected a set of 96 HLA-DRB1 alleles with a detectable frequency in at least one human population and appropriate sequence data (see Methods). A comparison of all pairs of these alleles revealed that even very closely related alleles show major differences in promiscuity levels ( Fig 3A) . For example, alleles belonging to the HLA-DRB1 � 13 group show over 98% amino acid sequence identity to each other, but display as much as 57-fold variation in the predicted promiscuity levels. We conclude that the switch between high and low promiscuity levels has occurred repeatedly and in a rapid manner during the allelic diversification of the HLA-DRB1 locus. We next asked how selection on promiscuity has shaped the genetic diversity along the epitope-binding region of HLA molecules. To quantify protein sequence variability at each amino acid position, we calculated the Shannon entropy index based on the alignment of the 96 selected HLA-DRB1 alleles from above. For each position, we also calculated promiscuity fragility, that is, the median impact of single amino acid substitutions on promiscuity (see Methods). A strong positive correlation was found between Shannon entropy and promiscuity fragility ( The above data suggest a link between allele promiscuity and HLA-DRB1 diversification, probably as an outcome of selection for locally optimized promiscuity levels.

Finally, we note that several variable molecular sites in the binding region of HLA-DRB1 affect epitope-binding characteristics without any major impact on promiscuity per se. For example, our computational analysis indicates that mutations at amino acid site numbers 9 and 47 do not seriously affect promiscuity level ( Fig 3B) . However, several mutations at these sites are associated with binding self-peptides and thereby shape vulnerability to specific autoimmune diseases [49, 50] .

For all pairs of selected alleles, the predicted promiscuity difference between two HLA-DRB1 alleles is shown as a function of amino acid distance measured after excluding the epitope-binding region. Large differences in promiscuity can be observed even between closely related pairs of alleles (e.g., at zero amino acid distance). As a result, there is no correlation between amino acid distance and promiscuity fold difference (Spearman's rho = 0.02, P = 0.19). Amino acid distances were binned as shown on the figure (n = 308, 1,168, 564, 654, 1,492). Violin plots show the density function of promiscuity fold difference values for allele pairs in the given bin. White circles show median values; bold black lines show the interquartile range. (B) Sequence variability of an amino acid site in the epitope-binding region of HLA-DRB1 (measured as Shannon entropy) correlates positively with the site's promiscuity fragility, measured as the median predicted promiscuity fold difference caused by a random amino acid change at the given site (see inset, Spearman's rho: 0.76, P = 0.0001). Sites that have a larger impact on promiscuity are more diverse in human populations. Line in inset represents linear regression between the two variables. The same result was obtained when promiscuity fragility was calculated based on nucleotide substitutions instead of amino acid substitutions (Spearman's rho: 0.73, P = 0.0004, see Methods) or when sequence variability was measured as nonsynonymous nucleotide diversity (π A ) instead of sequence entropy (S7 Fig). Sites under positive selection as identified by Furlong and colleagues [48] show significantly higher promiscuity fragility (Wilcoxon rank sum test, P = 0.0012) and are marked with asterisks (see also S8 Fig) . The underlying data for this figure can be found in S4 Data.

The relationship between pathogen diversity and epitope-binding promiscuity may be more general, as similar results hold for the HLA-A locus. HLA-A is one of the three types of classical human MHC class I molecules and is mainly involved in the presentation of epitopes from intracellular pathogens [51] . In agreement with expectation, we report a positive correlation between local intracellular pathogen diversity and the HLA-A promiscuity level of the corresponding human populations (S9A and S9B Fig, S3 Data) . No marked positive correlation was found for two other MHC class I genes (HLA-B and HLA-C, see S9C to S9F Fig, and S3 Data) . Therefore, other unrelated evolutionary forces may shape the geographical distribution of promiscuous HLA-B and HLA-C alleles (S1 Text).

Central players of the adaptive immune system are the groups of proteins encoded in the MHC. By binding short peptide segments (epitopes), MHC molecules guide both immune response against pathogens and tolerance to self-peptides. The genomic region encoding these MHC molecules is of special interest, for two reasons. It harbors more disease associations than any other regions in the human genome, including associations with infectious diseases, autoimmune disorders, tumors, and neuropsychiatric diseases [52, 53] . A growing body of literature is now revealing that certain MHC class I alleles can bind a wider range of epitopes than others, but the functional implications of this variation remain largely unknown [10] . By recognizing a larger variety of epitopes, such promiscuous MHC alleles promote immune response against a broader range of pathogens at the individual level. Therefore, promiscuous epitope binding of MHC molecules should be favored by selection in geographic regions where extracellular pathogen diversity is high. Importantly, this mechanism is conceptually distinct from the well-established concept of heterozygote advantage at the MHC [54] , as it concerns individual alleles and not allele combinations or genotypes.

To test this hypothesis, we combined data on the geographic distribution of human MHC class II alleles and prevalence of extracellular pathogens, empirical/computational estimates of epitope-binding promiscuity, and phylogenetic analyses. Our main findings, strongly supporting our hypothesis, are as follows.

First, in geographical regions of high extracellular pathogen diversity, human HLA-DRB1 alleles have exceptionally high epitope-binding repertoires. This suggests that the geographical distribution of promiscuous HLA-DRB1 alleles has been shaped by the diversity of extracellular pathogens. The HLA-DRB1 � 12:02 allele highlights this point. HLA-DRB1 � 12:02 is a promiscuous allele that has been associated with protection from certain infectious diseases (S5 Data). As expected, this allele is especially prevalent in regions of Southeast Asia with elevated pathogen load (Fig 2B) .

It is well established that antigens presented by HLA class II molecules derive mainly from extracellular proteins [1] . However, HLA class II molecules have well-established roles in controlling immune response against viruses [55, 56] . Additionally, viral peptides are reported to be processed and presented also by the HLA class II pathway [57] . Therefore, it remains to be established why intracellular pathogen diversity has no major impact on the global distribution of HLA-DRB1 alleles.

Notably, the relationship between pathogen load and epitope-binding promiscuity may be more general, as similar results hold for the HLA-A locus: we found a positive correlation between local intracellular pathogen diversity and the HLA-A promiscuity level of the corresponding human populations (S9A and S9B Fig, S3 Data) .

Second, a phylogenetic analysis revealed major differences in promiscuity levels of very closely related HLA-DRB1 alleles. This suggests that high promiscuity level in HLA-DRB1 has evolved rapidly and repeatedly during human evolution. Finally, amino acid positions with a prominent role in shaping HLA-DRB1 promiscuity level are especially variable in human populations and tend to be under positive selection. In sum, we conclude that HLA promiscuity level is a human trait with paramount importance during adaptation to local pathogens.

Our work has important ramifications for future studies. MHC is the most variable region of the human genome, and the variation is associated with numerous infectious and immunemediated diseases [52, 53, [58] [59] [60] [61] [62] . The impact of MHC promiscuity level on population allelic diversity is an interesting area for future research. In a similar vein, MHC allelic diversity is associated with olfaction-based mating preferences in human and other animals [63] . The roles of MHC promiscuity in mating success and mating preferences are a terra incognita.

We note that the most promiscuous HLA-DRB1 alleles are rare in certain human populations (S1 Table; S2 Data). This suggest that these alleles are not particularly favored by natural selection in these areas. Why should it be so? First, high promiscuity may not be able to cope with the rise of novel and highly virulent pathogens. In such cases, displaying a particular epitope might be the most efficient way to achieve resistance, and high promiscuity might be suboptimal due to a reduced specificity [9, 10] . Second, high promiscuity level may elevate the risk of immune reactions against host tissues and non-harmful proteins [9, 64] . Clearly, future work should elucidate the evolutionary trade-offs between protection from pathogens and genetic susceptibility to autoimmune diseases. This will require high-throughput experimental methods to determine epitope-binding repertoire [65] , and HLA transgenic mice studies on the role of promiscuity in immune response [66] .

Finally, genetic variation within particular MHC genes influences vaccine efficacy [67] , rejection rates of transplanted organs [68] , susceptibility to autoimmune diseases [49] , and antitumor immunity [28, 69, 70] . Our work raises the possibility that, by altering the maturation and functionality of the immune system, the size of the epitope-binding repertoire of MHC alleles itself could have an impact on these processes. The exact role of MHC promiscuity in these crucial public health issues is an exciting future research area.

The IEDB has collected the results of individual and systematic studies on epitope binding by MHC alleles [38] . The experimental studies include HLA-binding assays, T-cell activation assays, and immunopeptidomic studies as well. Epitopes of all available viral, bacterial, and eukaryotic pathogens known to be bound by at least one HLA-I or HLA-II allele were extracted from IEDB. Reference proteomes of pathogenic species that carry at least one of the collected epitope sequences were retrieved from the Uniprot database (102 for HLA-I and 71 for HLA-II epitopes) [71] . Only epitopes of these species were analyzed further. All proteomes were scanned for each epitope sequence, and epitope sequences found in only one proteome (i.e., species-specific epitopes) were kept for further analysis. Highly similar epitope sequences were identified using Clustal Omega [72] and excluded as follows. A protein distance matrix was created and epitopes were discarded iteratively. In each iteration, the epitope pairs with the lowest k-tuple distance were identified. Then, the epitope with the highest average similarity to all other sequences was excluded. Iterations were repeated until distance values less than 0.5 (corresponding to greater than approximately 50% sequence identity) were eliminated from the matrix [73] . Note that this filtering procedure was carried out separately for epitope sequences bound by HLA-I and HLA-II.

Binding affinities of the remaining 3,265 HLA-I epitope sequences to 346 HLA-A, 532 HLA-B and 225 HLA-C alleles were predicted with the NetMHCpan-4.0 algorithm [74] . The binding of 2,691 HLA-II epitope sequences to 162 HLA-DRB1 alleles was predicted using the NetMHCIIpan-3.1 algorithm [30] . All 162 alleles are present in at least one of the human populations studied here (see below). The ""pep"" sequence input format was used for both HLA-I and HLA-II epitope-binding prediction. A binding affinity threshold of 50 nM was applied, yielding peptides that are likely to be immunodominant [39] . For alternative binding threshold definitions, see S4 Fig. For each binding threshold, epitope-binding promiscuity was defined as the fraction of the epitope set bound by a given allele.

To determine the epitope-binding promiscuity of HLA-DRB1 alleles based on previously published experimental data, we used the IEDB database [38] . Specifically, we downloaded all MHC ligand and T-cell assay data, which was available for 48 HLA-DRB1 alleles. Binding data of 20 alleles screened for at least 100 ligands each were further analyzed. The epitope set of each allele was filtered for highly similar sequences, as described above. As the majority of in vitro assay data were available in a binary format (i.e., presence or absence of binding), promiscuity was calculated as the fraction of positive binding assays for a given allele.

To calculate population-level promiscuity values, we obtained HLA allele frequency data from the Allele Frequency Net Database (AFND) and the International Histocompatibility Working Group (IHWG) populations [35, 36] . Haplotype-level data of the 13th International HLA and Immunogenetics Workshop (IHIW) populations were downloaded from dbMHC (National Center for Biotechnology Information [NCBI]; ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/mhc/mhc/Final %20Archive). Additionally, allele frequency data of the 14th and 16th IHIW populations, as published by Riccio and colleagues [37] , and populations in the AFND were used in the analyses. To avoid potential confounding effects of recent genetic admixture and migration, we focused on native populations, similarly to previous studies (S1 Table) [7, 8] . We excluded IHWG populations reported to deviate from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium [37]. Among the AFND populations and IHWG populations without haplotype-resolution data (14th and 16th IHIW), those comprising less than 100 genotyped individuals or those in which the sum of allele frequencies deviated from 1 by more than 1% were excluded. Populations reported in multiple databases were included only once in the analysis.

For each HLA loci, we calculated mean population promiscuity by averaging promiscuity values of alleles weighted by their relative frequencies in the populations. In all of these calculations, we used standardized (i.e., z-score) promiscuity values to make the in silico and in vitro values more easily comparable. Finally, when calculating population-level promiscuity based on in vitro promiscuity data, we excluded populations for which in vitro promiscuity values could be assigned to less than 50% cumulative allele frequency.

To tackle the issue of nonindependence of data points, we focused on populations instead of countries and grouped those populations that have highly similar HLA allele compositions, based on standard measures of genetic distance (see below). We merged populations with highly similar HLA allele compositions, allowing us to avoid pseudoreplication of data points while retaining informative allele frequency differences between populations residing in the same broad geographical areas.

To this end, we first generated a genetic distance matrix between populations with the adegenet R library using allele frequency data of the examined locus. We used the Rogers' genetic distance measure [75] because it does not assume that allele frequency changes are driven by genetic drift only, an unlikely scenario for HLA genes. Next, populations were merged using a network-based approach. Populations were treated as nodes and two nodes were connected if their genetic distance was under a cutoff value. Populations were grouped in an iterative manner. In each iteration, all maximal cliques (i.e., subsets of nodes that are fully connected to each other) in the network were identified. Maximal cliques represent groups of populations in which all populations have similar allele compositions to each other. Then, mean genetic distance within each clique was calculated. The clique with the lowest average distance was selected and its populations were grouped together. Then, this clique was deleted from the network. Iterations were repeated until no maximal cliques remained in the network. Grouping of populations was carried out using different distance value cutoffs (1st, 5th, 10th, and 15th rank percentile of all distance values). The resulting population groups and the individual populations that remained in the network were treated as independent data points in subsequent statistical analyses. Mean promiscuity level in population groups was calculated by averaging population promiscuity values.

Unless otherwise indicated, all figures are based on population groups using the 15th percentile genetic distance cutoff value. Importantly, using different cutoffs has no impact on our results (S3 Data). Finally, we note that genetic differences among human populations mostly come from gradations in allele frequencies rather than from the presence of distinctive alleles [76] . Therefore, traditional clustering of populations based on HLA composition would have been ill-suited for our purposes.

Data on 309 infectious diseases were collected from GIDEON [41] . For each disease, the number of causative species or genera (when species were not listed for the genus) was determined using disease information in the GIDEON database, as described previously [42] . Causative agents were classified into obligate intracellular and extracellular pathogen groups based on a previous study [7] and literature information. Putative facultative intracellular pathogens were excluded from the analysis. Diseases caused by agents that could not be clearly classified were also excluded from the analysis. Extracellular and intracellular pathogen diversity (richness) of each country was approximated by the number of identified endemic extracellular and intracellular species, respectively. Finally, we assigned country-level measures of pathogen and HLA diversity to population groups as follows. For each population group, extracellular and intracellular pathogen counts were calculated by averaging the corresponding country-level values across the populations within the group. For example, if a population group contained two populations residing in neighboring countries, then we assigned the average pathogen diversity of the two countries to it.

To examine associations between selected HLA allele groups and infectious diseases, we carried out a systematic literature search on PubMed database using the following terms:

""assoc � drb1 12 02"", ""assoc � drb1 1202"", ""assoc � drb1 12 01"", ""assoc � drb1 1201"", ""assoc � dr12"", ""assoc � drb1 � 12"", ""assoc � drb1 03 01"", ""assoc � drb1 0301"", ""assoc � dr3"", ""assoc � drb1 � 03"", ""assoc � dr17"", ""infect � drb1 12 02"", ""infect � drb1 1202"", ""infect � drb1 12 01"", ""infect � drb1 1201"", ""infect � dr12"", ""infect � drb1 � 12"", ""infect � drb1 03 01"", ""infect � drb1 0301"", ""infect � dr3"", ""infect � drb1 � 03"", and ""infect � dr17"". ""assoc � "" and ""infect � "" refer to any word beginning with these letters. Each resulting paper containing HLA association data was examined, and statistically significant associations between allele groups (DRB1 � 03 or DRB1 � 12) or common alleles in allele groups (DRB1 � 12:01, DRB1 � 12:02, DRB1 � 03:01) and infectious diseases were collected. Associations with diseases caused by intracellular pathogens were excluded from the analysis. HLA-disease associations were classified as beneficial or detrimental, if all related studies supported the beneficial or detrimental role of HLA allele/allele group in the development or course of the given disease. Otherwise, the association was classified as controversial. The results were summarized (S3 Table) , and statistical association between beneficial/detrimental effects and high/low promiscuity across allele groups was determined by a Fisher's exact test.

We used amino acid distance as a proxy for phylogenetic distance between pairs of DRB1 alleles. To this end, nucleotide sequences of DRB1 alleles that contained full exon 2 and 3 regions were downloaded from the IPD-IMGT/HLA database [19] . To limit our analyses to alleles that have an impact on the inferred promiscuity level of a population, we considered only those sequences that had a nonzero frequency in at least one human population (see above). From allele groups that code for the same protein sequence (synonymous differences, differentiated by the third set of digits in the HLA nomenclature), one of the alleles was randomly chosen. This selection procedure resulted in 96 alleles. Multiple alignment of nucleotide sequences was performed using the MUSCLE algorithm as implemented in the MEGA software [77] and converted to protein sequence alignments. Amino acid distance was calculated using the Jones-Taylor-Thornton substitution model in MEGA [77] (Fig 3A) . Epitope-binding region sites-as defined previously [30]-were excluded when calculating amino acid distance. The rationale behind this exclusion is that these sites are known to be under positive selection [78, 79] and are therefore less informative on evolutionary distance. Additionally, by removing these sites, the amino acid distance remains independent of promiscuity predictions. Finally, as intragenic recombination may distort the inference of evolutionary distance, we identified such events across all alleles following the protocol of Satta and colleagues [80] using GENE-CONV [81] and RDP algorithms [82] as implemented in the RDP software [83] . Recombinant alleles were removed when calculating amino acid distance.

We first defined the epitope-binding region of HLA-DRB1 alleles, as previously [30] . To estimate sequence diversity along the epitope-binding region, we employed two measures: standard Shannon entropy [84] and nucleotide diversity (π), a widely employed measure of genetic variation [85] .

Using the protein sequence alignment of the 96 alleles defined above, we calculated amino acid sequence variability as the Shannon entropy of the given amino acid site as follows:

where P i is the fraction of residues of amino acid type i at a given site, and M is the number of amino acid types observed at that site.

Nonsynonymous nucleotide diversity (π A ) measures the average number of nonsynonymous nucleotide differences per nonsynonymous site between two randomly chosen protein coding DNA sequences from the same population [85, 86] . π A was calculated for each amino acid site in the epitope-binding region for each population using DnaSP software [87] and custom-written R scripts. Nucleotide sequences of DRB1 alleles were downloaded from the IPD-IMGT/HLA database [19] .

The calculation is based on the work of Nei and colleagues [85] using the equation

where x i and x j are the frequencies of the ith and jth alleles in the population, respectively, and p A ij is the number of nonsynonymous nucleotide differences per nonsynonymous nucleotide site between the two codon sequences of the given amino acid site in the ith and jth alleles. To calculate π A for each population, allele frequency data of human populations were obtained, as described earlier (see above). An overall nucleotide diversity index was calculated by averaging π A across populations.

To calculate each amino acid site's impact on epitope-binding promiscuity (promiscuity fragility), promiscuity was predicted for each 19 possible amino acid change along the epitopebinding region of each of 96 alleles. The fold difference in promiscuity resulting from each amino acid substitution was calculated. The median promiscuity fold difference of each possible allele and amino acid change combination (96 × 19) was used to estimate promiscuity fragility at each amino acid position. As some of the 19 possible amino acid changes are not accessible via a single nucleotide mutation, and the accessible amino acid changes can have different likelihoods based on the codon sequence of the site and the genetic code, we also calculated promiscuity fragility based on each nonsynonymous nucleotide substitution of the codon instead of each amino acid substitution of the site.

All statistical analyses were carried out in R version 3.2.0 [88] . Smooth curves were fitted using the cubic smoothing spline method [89] . . We selected (i) 216 epitope sequences from this dataset, for which binding affinity data to all the 11 alleles were available, and (ii) 2,665 epitopes used for calculating in silico promiscuity throughout the paper, which were not used for the training of the NetMHCIIpan algorithm. In vitro and predicted promiscuity of the 11 alleles was determined at a 50 nM binding threshold using the selected 216 and 2,665 epitopes, respectively. We used standardized (i.e., z-score) allele promiscuity values for the comparisons. We report a strong correlation between the in silico and in vitro promiscuity . One might speculate that there might be no selection for elevated HLA-B promiscuity level due to a dominant balancing selection on this locus (see S1 Text) [7, 8] . Similarly, (E) the promiscuity level of HLA-C molecules showed no significant correlation with intracellular pathogen diversity (Spearman's rho: −0.14, P = 0.44). Finally, (F) HLA-C promiscuity level showed a marginally significant positive correlation with extracellular pathogen diversity (Spearman's rho: 0.35, P = 0.04). This is surprising, but this preliminary result needs to be considered with caution, and studied further in future works. For detailed explanation of these results, see S1 Text. Population groups were created using the 15th percentile genetic distance cutoff (see Methods). For a list of populations assigned to each group, see S6 Data. For results of multivariate models and obtained upon using alternative distance cutoff values, see S3 Data. Red curves indicate smooth curves fitted using cubic smoothing spline method in R (see Methods). The underlying data for this figure can be found in S4 Data. (TIF) S1 Table.

Genetic diversity and evolution of SARS-CoV-2,COVID-19 is a viral respiratory illness caused by a new coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2. The World Health Organization declared the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak a global public health emergency. We performed genetic analyses of eighty-six complete or near-complete genomes of SARS-CoV-2 and revealed many mutations and deletions on coding and non-coding regions. These observations provided evidence of the genetic diversity and rapid evolution of this novel coronavirus.,"A new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is spreading cross the world (Phan, 2020) . Since the virus emerged at the seafood wholesale market at the end of last year (Zhu et al., 2019) , the number of infected cases has been rising dramatically (Velavan and Meyer, 2020) . Human-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has been confirmed (Nishiura et al., 2020) . The virus has been detected in bronchoalveolar-lavage (Zhu et al., 2019) , sputum (Lin et al., 2020) , saliva (K.K. , throat (Bastola et al., 2020) and nasopharyngeal swabs .

Nucleotide substitution has been proposed to be one of the most important mechanisms of viral evolution in nature (Lauring and Andino, 2010) . The rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 raises intriguing questions such as whether its evolution is driven by mutations. To assess the genetic variation, eighty-six complete or near-complete genomes of SARS-CoV-2 were collected from GISAID [https://www.gisaid. org/]. These SARS-CoV-2 strains were detected in infected patients from China (50), USA (11), Australia (5), Japan (5), France (4), Singapore (3), England (2), Taiwan (2), South Korea (1), Belgium (1), Germany (1), and Vietnam (1). The pair-wise nucleotide sequence alignment was performed by ClustalX2 (Saitou and Nei, 1987) , and the sequence of the strain China/WHU01/2020/EPI_ISL_406716 was used as a reference genome.

Like other betacoronaviruses, the genome of SARS-CoV-2 has a long ORF1ab polyprotein at the 5′ end, followed by four major structural proteins, including the spike surface glycoprotein, small envelope protein, matrix protein, and nucleocapsid protein (Phan, 2020) . Our genetic analysis discovered three deletions in the genomes of SARS-CoV-2 from Japan (Aichi), USA (Wisconsin), and Australia (Victoria) as shown in Fig. 1 . Two deletions (three nucleotides and twenty-four nucleotides) were in the ORF1ab polyprotein, and one deletion (ten nucleotides) was in the 3′ end of the genome.

It is interesting that our nucleotide sequence alignment also revealed ninety-three mutations over the entire genomes of SARS-CoV-2 (Table 1) . Forty-two missense mutations were identified in all the major non-structural and structural proteins, except the envelope protein.

Twenty-nine missense mutations were in the ORF1ab polyprotein, eight in the spike surface glycoprotein, one in the matrix protein, and four in the nucleocapsid protein. Of note, three mutations (D 354 , Y 364 , and F 367 ) located in the spike surface glycoprotein receptor-binding domain. The spike surface glycoprotein plays an essential role in binding to receptors on the host cell and determines host tropism (Fung and Liu, 2019) . It is also the major target of neutralizing antibodies (Yu et al., 2020) . Mutations in the spike surface glycoprotein might induce its conformational changes, which probably led to the changing antigenicity. To date, a study on localization of amino acids involved in conformational changes of the SARS-CoV-2 spike surface glycoprotein structure is not available. The identification of these amino acids is of significance and should be investigated by further studies. 

Mutations found in the entire genome of SARS-CoV-2 strains. The number in the parentheses indicated the location of amino acid in its protein.

diseases Distribution and Evolutionary History of the Mobile Genetic Element s2m in Coronaviruses,"The mobile genetic element s2m has been described in several families of single-stranded RNA viruses. The function remains elusive, but an increasing number of s2m-containing sequences are being deposited in publicly available databases. Currently, more than 700 coronavirus sequences containing s2m can be found in GenBank, including the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus genome. This is an updated review of the pattern of s2m in coronaviruses, the possible functional implications and the evolutionary history.","The genomes of single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) viruses have complex secondary structures, maintained both through conventional and non-Watson-Crick base-pairing [1, 2] . Coronaviruses have the largest genomes of RNA viruses and have been shown to have several highly conserved secondary structures both in the 5 1 and 3 1 end of their genomes [1] . These structural motifs mainly function through protein binding or through direct RNA-RNA interactions. Some of these elements function merely as 'spacer elements', where neither the primary nor the secondary structure are critical [3] . In other cases, the stem-loop structure itself seems essential and base-pairing nucleotides may be substituted [4] . More complex structures, such as the 54-nucleotide hairpin-type pseudoknot, appear to be conserved both in structure and location, but not in sequence [5] . For most of these elements, the exact mechanism of function is unknown, but virus replication, viability and transcription are the main functional categories.

A 43-nucleotide genetic element with a highly conserved secondary (as well as primary and tertiary) structure has been described in four different families of positive-sense ssRNA viruses, Astroviridae, Caliciviridae, Picornaviridae and Coronaviridae [6] . The presence of this element in four distantly related groups of viruses and the scattered distribution within these groups has led to the conclusion that viruses have the ability to acquire it horizontally [6] . The 3 1 stem-loop structure, referred to as s2m, was originally described in astroviruses where it appears to have been present in the last common ancestor [6] [7] [8] , but the element has been most thoroughly studied in the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) where the three-dimensional crystal structure has been resolved to 2.7 A resolution [9] . The function remains obscure, but current hypotheses include hijacking of host protein synthesis through interactions with ribosomal proteins [9] and RNA interference (RNAi) via processing of the s2m elements into a mature microRNA [6] . In coronaviruses, the highly conserved nature of the element has also allowed the development of a PCR-based virus discovery strategy [10] .

The presence of s2m near the 3 1 end of some coronavirus genomes has been documented previously [6, 11] , but due to the exponential growth of gene sequence data available through public Diseases 2016, 4, 27 2 of 8 databases, this review is an update on the current status of s2m in this virus family. The evolutionary history is discussed and different hypotheses for the possible function of s2m are presented in light of recent progress in virus genomics.

A total of 20,068 coronavirus nucleotide sequences have been deposited in the current version of Genbank, and when translated into amino acid sequences, the complete ORF1ab polyprotein sequence could be found for 1113 of these entries. A phylogenetic analysis was performed using aligned ORF1ab sequences (Figure 1) , and numerous clusters of nearly identical accessions could be identified. The largest group comprised 328 sequences from the porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (328 OTUs). Many smaller clusters were also found, encompassing two to 183 sequences, and all serogroups were monophyletic with 100% bootstrap support ( Figure 1 ).

To get an overview of the current status for s2m in coronaviruses, all coronavirus nucleotide sequences were screened for the presence of the s2m motif using the strategy described by Tengs et al. [6] . The consensus sequence CGNGG(N)CCACGNNGNGT(N)ANNANCGAGGGT(N)ACAG was used as bait, allowing for possible insertions (N) and/or a single mismatch. Further, 708 of 20,068 (3.5%) of the sequences were found to contain the s2m motif (Table 1 ). However, s2m was not found in alpha coronaviruses and also appears to be absent in the Torovirus genus as well as the recently described Bafinivirus genus [12] , albeit only a small number of sequences were available from the two latter groups. In all instances, the s2m sequence was found in the non-coding, 3 1 end of the genome. Looking at coronavirus accessions annotated as 'complete genome', more than a third of the genomes appeared to be s2m-containing (Table 1 ). Many sequences have been generated using targeted (PCR-based) approaches that might not include the non-coding parts of the genome. This could explain why s2m appears to be approximately 10 times more common in complete genome sequences than in shorter GenBank submissions (Table 1) . Three phylogenetic clusters were found to contain s2m ( Figure 1 ). All of these groups were supported by 100% bootstrap values and thus are genetically distinct from related viruses not containing the element. Multiple hypothesis can be proposed in order to explain the distribution of s2m within the coronaviruses, including a model where s2m was present in the last common ancestor of this virus group and subsequently lost multiple times. However, given the mobile nature of the motif, a more parsimonious explanation includes two (or more) independent gains and a small number of losses. The gain of s2m at the base of the SARS-cluster (edge 1 in Figure 1 ) would not assume any losses in the beta coronaviruses, but for the gamma/delta coronavirus cluster, the evolutionary history seems to be more complicated. A gain at edge 4 would require multiple independent losses. There was no significant bootstrap support separating the Wigeon coronavirus and the Night-heron coronavirus sequences, so a monophyletic origin for these two strains could not be excluded. Loss in the common ancestor of this group combined with loss prior to the divergence of the Bottlenose dolphin coronavirus and the Beluga Whale coronavirus (edge 3) would thus indicate one gain and Diseases 2016, 4, 27 3 of 8 two independent losses. One could also hypothesize two independent gains (edge 2 and 5) in order to explain the s2m distribution in the gamma/delta cluster ( Figure 1 ).

Diseases 2016, 4, 27 3 of 8 one gain and two independent losses. One could also hypothesize two independent gains (edge 2 and 5) in order to explain the s2m distribution in the gamma/delta cluster ( Figure 1 ).

Coronavirus phylogeny with s2m-containing sequences highlighted. ORF1ab polyprotein amino acid sequences were aligned using the program MUSCLE [8] and default parameters. The phylogenetic analysis was performed using the program SeaView [9] and the neighbor joining clustering method with Kimura two-parameter distances. In order to avoid large clades of closely related sequences, operational taxonomic units (OTUs) with similar GenBank taxonomical annotation and almost identical sequences were identified and basal members of these monophyletic groups chosen to represent such sequence clusters. Looking at topology and branch lengths, branch 1 ( Figure 1 ) represents the shortest edge connecting an s2m-containing cluster with a virus strain not containing s2m. s2m is absent in Rousettus bat coronavirus HKU9, which is a cluster of eight nearly identical sequences basal to the SARS(-like) group. Rousettus bat coronavirus is thus far the only member of lineage D within the betacoronaviruses [13] . The most likely mechanism for transfer of the s2m element from one viral genome to another is through genetic recombination [6] . Recombination events are very common in single-stranded RNA viruses and have played an important role in the evolution of coronaviruses [14] . Nucleotide dot plot analyses of the Rousettus bat coronavirus versus the closest relatives in the SARS(-like) group revealed a high degree of sequence similarity in central parts of the genome, but did not identify any specific locus for recombination.

Excluding sequences with ambiguous bases, a total of 37 different s2m genotypes were found within the coronavirus sequences ( Figure 2 ). The great majority of the sequences could be folded into the canonical s2m stem-loop structure (Figure 3) , albeit a single sequence had an insertion in the second stem-forming motif (Figure 1 ; Infectious bronchitis virus DPI) and some of the sequences require non-Watson-Crick base-pairing, such as the wobble base-pair G-U [15] , in order to obtain the correct secondary structure. All clusters of identical s2m sequence groups were derived from viruses representing the same serogroups (beta, gamma or delta), indicating no recent transfers of the s2m element between these coronavirus clusters.

The s2m element from Pheasant coronavirus strain ph/UK/6/99 was folded using mfold [16] . Non-Watson-Crick base-pairings are shown in red. For a more detailed folding with tertiary interactions and long-range contacts indicated, see [9] .

For a mobile genetic element to be successful, especially in the context of rapidly evolving genomes such as those of RNA viruses, it must offer an immediate selective advantage. s2m viruses infect higher vertebrates, making the permissive host species a lot more closely related than the viruses. The observation that s2m can apparently be transferred between unrelated viruses and remain functional (under selection to maintain sequence and structure) suggests strongly that the target for s2m is host-specific and not viral. As there are no conserved elements flanking the s2m motif in viral genomes, it is also plausible that the element has an 'autonomous' function, independent of other viral genes, transcripts or genome secondary/tertiary structures. Somewhat surprisingly, the acquisition of s2m only has a subtle effect; exchanging the (non-s2m-containing) 3′- Figure 3 . s2m secondary structure.

Somewhat surprisingly, the acquisition of s2m only has a subtle effect; exchanging the (non-s2m-containing) 3 1 -end of a murine coronavirus (MCV) with the 3 1 -end of a SARS virus did not appear to have any dramatic consequences [17] , but 3 1 -ends from other coronaviruses were not able to replace the 3 1 -end of MCV and render it viable. There appears to be only a single sequence in GenBank with a deleted version of s2m (Infectious bronchitis virus strain ck/CH/LHLJ/07VII; accession number JF274479). This strain was discovered as an escape mutant in a vaccine development project, but did not appear phenotypically different from closely related viruses in culturing experiments [18] .

The folding of s2m is quite similar to the hairpin structures formed by microRNAs that are involved in RNAi-associated gene regulation, and s2m could potentially be involved in gene silencing. In vertebrates, pre-microRNA transcripts are generated in the nucleus and processed by the nuclear protein DGCR8 and the enzyme Drosha [19] . Processed pre-microRNAs are then exported from the nucleus in a process involving Exportin-5. The RNA is subsequently incorporated into the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) and eventually a functional RISC-bound small interfering RNA (siRNA) can serve as template for base-pairing recognition of messenger RNA (mRNA). The target mRNA is degraded, leading to a reduction in gene activity. ssRNA viruses generally replicate in the cytoplasm and earlier hypotheses on s2m function have thus been based on the assumption that the cellular components involved must be available in the cytosol. Recently, a paper was published documenting the presence of a non-canonical machinery for microRNA processing in the cytoplasm of human cells [20] . It has been well described that DNA viruses replicating in the nucleus can hijack the cellular machinery for RNAi activity for the regulation of both viral and host genes [21] , but these new results using a recombinant Sindbis virus show that this is also possible for RNA viruses. The presence of multiple copies of s2m in some virus genomes [6] can be explained by there being an additive effect: more copies of the RNA will enable the formation of more siRNA/RISC complexes and give a more profound effect on target genes. A hypothesis where s2m is involved in RNAi-based gene regulation is also compatible with the target being host-specific (homologous genes in the infected species) and s2m functionality being independent of the rest of the virus genome.

Observations arguing against an RNAi-like function would be that the stem region of s2m is a bit short compared to standard processed RNAi molecules (albeit mRNA binding regions as short as 17 base pairs have been reported [22] ). We were also unable to find any good candidate target genes using sequence similarity searches to look for potential microRNA binding sites, and even when looking at viruses infecting relatively closely related species (such as bats, see Figure 2 ), there was significant variability in the s2m stem regions that could be predicted to be involved in mRNA binding. These observations make it less likely that s2m is involved in conventional RNAi-based gene silencing.

Another hypothesis that would be compatible with the general assumptions regarding s2m functionality is that s2m is involved in the protection of the virus genome from being degraded by host ribonucleases. Coronaviruses are positive-sense ssRNA viruses with non-segmented genomes that are polyadenylated and capped. The genomes may serve as mRNA for the translation of viral polyproteins and contain two overlapping reading frames that encode precursor polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab through a frameshifting mechanism [23] . After infection, the viral genome is replicated and subgenomic RNAs are generated via negative-strand RNA intermediates [1, 24] . In flaviviruses, another group of positive-sense ssRNA viruses, the presence of secondary structure elements has been shown to inhibit RNA decay through the formation of nuclease-resistant noncoding RNAs [25, 26] . The small stem-loop structures described confer resistance to enzymatic degradation by the XRN1 5 1 -3 1 exoribonuclease. As the s2m element is near the 3 1 end of the coronavirus genome, inhibition of, for instance, XRN1 would only render the negative-strand versions of the genome (or subgenomic elements originating from the 3 1 flank) protected from decay, but resistance could also be gained through other mechanisms. Full-length coronavirus messenger RNAs share many features with endogenous transcripts and any interference with mechanisms involved in cellular mRNA turnover could also affect virus RNA stability. The exosome contains multiple proteins involved in 3 1 -5 1 Diseases 2016, 4, 27 7 of 8 degradation of RNA [27] , and inhibition or stalling of, for instance, the Dis3 or Rrp6 polypeptides by s2m could also protect full-length sense copies of the genome.

For some positive-strand ssRNA viruses, genome circularization has been shown to be essential for virus replication [28] . RNA circularization would require s2m to bind either directly or indirectly (mediated by RNA binding proteins) to the 5 1 end of the genome. The primary binding 5 1 site could either be a five-prime cap (5 1 cap) or an RNA structure (see discussion in [29] ). It is possible that there are conserved structural RNA elements with such a binding affinity near the 5 1 end in all s2m viruses, but it seems unlikely given the complete lack of sequence similarity when comparing data from the 5 1 flank of these genomes. The direct involvement of a 5 1 cap also seems implausible, as, for instance, s2m-containing picornaviruses lack 5 1 capping.

In order to elucidate the function of s2m, it seems imperative to establish a reverse genetics system for an s2m-containing viral strain. A good system could be an astrovirus-derived infectious construct, as there already are protocols described for the design of astrovirus cDNA clones that lead to the production of infectious viral particles [30] . Targeted mutations may be introduced and comparative studies performed using different permissive cell lines. Any changes in transcriptional activity, virus replication rates and/or viral RNA stability can be correlated with mutations interfering with the structure of s2m. Though s2m is present in some coronaviruses associated with severe infections in humans, such as SARS-CoV, there are other highly pathogenic viruses where s2m is absent (for instance the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus; MERS-CoV). The significance of having s2m for a viral strain remains to be resolved, but this mobile element still seems to be in play and it is likely to be found in newly emerging coronaviruses in the future.

The Evolutionary Dynamics of the Lion Panthera leo Revealed by Host and Viral Population Genomics,"The lion Panthera leo is one of the world's most charismatic carnivores and is one of Africa's key predators. Here, we used a large dataset from 357 lions comprehending 1.13 megabases of sequence data and genotypes from 22 microsatellite loci to characterize its recent evolutionary history. Patterns of molecular genetic variation in multiple maternal (mtDNA), paternal (Y-chromosome), and biparental nuclear (nDNA) genetic markers were compared with patterns of sequence and subtype variation of the lion feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV Ple ), a lentivirus analogous to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). In spite of the ability of lions to disperse long distances, patterns of lion genetic diversity suggest substantial population subdivision (mtDNA W ST = 0.92; nDNA F ST = 0.18), and reduced gene flow, which, along with large differences in seroprevalence of six distinct FIV Ple subtypes among lion populations, refute the hypothesis that African lions consist of a single panmictic population. Our results suggest that extant lion populations derive from several Pleistocene refugia in East and Southern Africa (,324,000-169,000 years ago), which expanded during the Late Pleistocene (,100,000 years ago) into Central and North Africa and into Asia. During the Pleistocene/Holocene transition (,14,000-7,000 years), another expansion occurred from southern refugia northwards towards East Africa, causing population interbreeding. In particular, lion and FIV Ple variation affirms that the large, well-studied lion population occupying the greater Serengeti Ecosystem is derived from three distinct populations that admixed recently.","Lion fossils trace to the Late Pliocene in Eastern Africa and the Early Pleistocene in Eastern and Southern Africa coincident with the flourishing of grasslands ,2-1.5 million years ago [1, 2] . By Mid Pleistocene (,500,000 years ago), lions occupied Europe and by the Late Pleistocene (,130,000-10,000 years ago) lions had the greatest intercontinental distribution for a large land mammal (excluding man), ranging from Africa into Eurasia and the Americas [3] . Lions were extirpated from Europe 2,000 years ago and within the last 150 years from the Middle East and North Africa. Today, there are less than 50,000 free-ranging lions [4] that occur only in sub-Saharan Africa and the Gir Forest, India ( Figure 1A) .

Understanding the broader aspects of lion evolutionary history has been hindered by a lack of comprehensive sampling and appropriately informative genetic markers [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] , which in species of modern felids requires large, multigenic data sets due to its generally rapid and very recent speciation [10, 11] . Nevertheless, the unique social ecology of lions [12] [13] [14] and the fact that lions have experienced well-documented infectious disease outbreaks, including canine distemper virus, feline parvovirus, calicivirus, coronavirus, and lion feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV Ple ) [15] [16] [17] [18] provide a good opportunity to study lion evolutionary history using both host and virus genetic information. Indeed, population genetics of transmitted pathogens can accurately reflect the demographic history of their hosts [19, 20] . Unlike other of the 36 cat species, lions have a cooperative social system (prides of 2-18 adult females and 1-9 males) and their populations can have high frequencies of FIV Ple , a lentivirus analogous to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), which causes AIDS-like immunodeficiency disease in domestic cats. FIV Ple is a retrovirus that integrates into the host genome and is transmitted by cell-to-cell contact, which in felids occurs during mating, fighting and motherto-offspring interactions. Thus, viral dissemination is a function in part of the frequency of contact between infected and naïve lions within and among populations. The virus is quite genetically diverse in lions [15, 18] , offering a unique marker for assessing ongoing lion demographic processes.

To unravel lion population demographic history we used a large multigenic dataset. Distinct sets of markers may not necessarily

The lion Panthera leo, a formidable carnivore with a complex cooperative social system, has fascinated humanity since pre-historical times, inspiring hundreds of religious and cultural allusions. Here, we use a comprehensive sample of 357 individuals from most of the major lion populations in Africa and Asia. We assayed appropriately informative autosomal, Y-chromosome, and mitochondrial genetic markers, and assessed the prevalence and genetic variation of the lion-specific feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV Ple ), a lentivirus analogous to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) that causes AIDS-like immunodeficiency disease in domestic cats. We compare the large multigenic dataset from lions with patterns of genetic variation of the FIV Ple to characterize the population-genomic legacy of lions. We refute the hypothesis that African lions consist of a single panmictic population, highlighting the importance of preserving populations in decline rather than prioritizing larger-scale conservation efforts. Interestingly, lion and FIV Ple variation revealed evidence of unsuspected genetic diversity even in the well-studied lion population of the Serengeti Ecosystem, which consists of recently admixed animals derived from three distinct genetic groups. Historical and current geographic distribution of lion, Panthera leo. A three-letter code pointing to a white dotted circle represents the geographic location of the 11 lion populations determined by Bayesian analyses [22] and factorial correspondence analyses [23] of the genetic distinctiveness of 357 lion samples (see text): GIR, Gir Forest, India; UGA, Uganda (Queen Elizabeth National Park); KEN, Kenya (Laikipia), SER, Serengeti National Park, Tanzania; NGC, Ngorongoro Crater, Tanzania; KRU, Kruger National Park, South Africa; BOT-I, southern Botswana and Kalahari, South Africa; BOT-II, northern Botswana; and NAM, Namibia. Green squares represent captive individual samples to explore the relationship of lions from more isolated/ endangered/depleted areas: ATL, Morocco Atlas lions (n = 4); ANG, Angola (n = 2); and ZBW, Zimbabwe (n = 1). Deduced historical expansions (M1 and M2) are represented by red arrows (see text). (B) Haplotype frequencies observed in the 11 lion populations for nDNA (ADA and TF), and mtDNA (12S-16S) genes, paralleled with the FIV Ple serum-prevalence frequencies (black -sero-positive; gray -indeterminate; white -sero-negative). Population sample sizes are indicated within parenthesis. (C) Statistical parsimony networks of lion ADA, TF, and 12S-16S haplotypes. Circle size is proportional to the haplotype frequency and crossbars represent the number of step mutations connecting haplotypes. The mtDNA haplotypes H5 and H6 are shaded gray as they were detected only in the individual samples from ANG, ATL, and ZBW, which do not group in unique population clusters (see text). doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1000251.g001 yield similar inferences of population history, as coalescent times vary as a function of their pattern of inheritance [21] . There is also a large variance in coalescent times across loci sharing a common pattern of inheritance especially in complex demographical histories (Table 1) . However, the accurate interpretation of the differences among loci can provide a more resolved and coherent population history, affording more-nuanced insights on past demographic processes, levels of admixture, taxonomic issues, and on the most appropriate steps for effective conservation and management of remaining populations.

The goal of this study was to assess the evolutionary history of lion by (1) characterizing lion population structure relative to patterns of FIV Ple genetic variation, (2) detect signatures of migration using both host and viral population genomics, and (3) reconstruct lion demographic history and discuss its implication for lion conservation. We assess genetic variation from 357 lions from most of its current distribution, including mitochondrial (mtDNA; 12S-16S, 1,882 bp), nuclear (nDNA) Y-chromosome (SRY, 1,322 bp) and autosomal (ADA, 427 bp; TF, 169 bp) sequences, and 22 microsatellites markers. We further document patterns of FIV Ple variation in lions (FIV Ple pol-RT gene, up to 520 bp).

Genetic analyses of 357 lions from throughout the extant species range showed that paternally inherited nDNA (SRY) and maternal inherited (mtDNA) sequence variation was generally low (only one paternal SRY-haplotype and 12 mtDNA haplotypes; p = 0.0066) ( Figure 1 ; Figure S1 ; Tables S1 and S2). The most common mtDNA haplotype H11 was ubiquitous in Uganda/Tanzania and parts of Botswana/South Africa, H1 was common in Southern Africa, and H7 and H8 were unique to Asian lions. The autosomal nDNA sequences showed fairly distinct patterns of variation ( Figure 1 ; Figure S1 ). Of the five ADA haplotypes, A2 was the most common and most-widely distributed. The other four haplotypes, which are derived and much less common, included one (A5) that was fixed in Asian lions. The three TF haplotypes were more widely and evenly distributed.

Levels of population subdivision among lions were assessed using microsatellite and sequencing data. Eleven groups were identified using Bayesian analyses [22] and three-dimensional factorial correspondence analyses [23] (Figure 2 ; Table S3 ). Most clusters represented geographically circumscribed populations: Namibia (NAM), Kruger National Park (KRU), Ngorongoro Crater (NGC), Kenya (KEN), Uganda (UGA), and Gir (GIR). Two distinct clusters were found in Botswana, BOT-I that included lions from southern Botswana and Kalahari (South Africa) (F k = 0.24) and BOT-II found exclusively in northern Botswana (F k = 0.18). Surprisingly, three distinct clusters were found in a single geographical locale (approximately 60640 km square) in the large panmyctic population of the Serengeti National Park (SER-I/SER-II/SER-III) (F k = 0.18, 0.21, and 0.15, respectively).

Two captive lions from Angola (ANG), one from Zimbabwe (ZBW) and four Morocco Zoo Atlas lions (ATL; presently extinct from the wild) ( Figure 1A) were included in the analyses to explore the relationship of lions from more isolated, endangered, or depleted areas. ANG and ZBW lions were assigned to BOT-II (q = 0.90 and 0.87; 90%CI: 0.47-1.00) and KRU (q = 0.85; 90%CI: 0.52-1.00) (Bayesian analyses [22] ) populations, respectively, as expected based on their geographical proximity. However, these lions differed from BOT-II and KRU by up to 8 mtDNA mutations, sharing haplotypes with the ATL lions (H5 in ANG and H6 in ZBW) ( Figure 1B and 1C). The ATL lions did not group in a unique cluster.

Both nDNA and mtDNA pairwise genetic distances among the 11 lion populations showed a significant relationship with geographic distance (R 2 = 0.75; Mantel's test, P = 0.0097; and R 2 = 0.15; Mantel's test, P = 0.0369; respectively) ( Figure 3 ). The significant positive and monotonic correlation across all the scatterplot pairwise comparisons for the nDNA markers (biparental) was consistent with isolation-by-distance across the sampled region. However, the correlation between nDNA F ST and geographic distance considerably decreased when the Asian GIR population was removed (R 2 = 0.19; Mantel's test, P = 0.0065) suggesting that caution should be taken in interpreting the pattern of isolation-by-distance in lions. We further compared linearized F ST estimates [24] plotted both against the geographic distance (model assuming habitat to be arrayed in an infinite onedimensional lattice) and the log geographic distance (model assuming an infinite two-dimensional lattice). The broad distribution of lions might suggest a priori that a two-dimensional isolationby-distance model would provide the best fit for the nDNA data (R 2 = 0.25; Mantel's test, P = 0.0022), but instead the onedimensional isolation-by-distance model performed better (R 2 = 0.71; Mantel's test, P = 0.0476) ( Figure S2 ). The pattern observed for the mtDNA (maternal) was more complex. While there was a significant relationship between mtDNA F ST and geographic distance, there was an inconsistent pattern across broader geographic distances ( Figure 3 ). This is partly due to the fixation or near fixation of haplotype H11 in six populations and the fixation of a very divergent haplotype H4 in KEN population ( Figure 1B and 1C). The removal of the KEN population considerably increased the correlation between mtDNA F ST and geographic distance (R 2 = 0.27; Mantel's test, P = 0.0035). Thus, the null hypothesis of regional equilibrium for mtDNA across the entire sampled region is rejected despite the possibility that isolation-by-distance may occur regionally.

These contrasting nDNA and mtDNA results may be indicative of differences in dispersal patterns between males and females, which would be consistent with evidence that females are more phylopatric than males. Alternatively, selection for matrilineally transmitted traits upon which neutral mtDNA alleles hitchhike is possible, given the low values of nucleotide diversity of the mtDNA (p = 0.0066). A similar process has been suggested in whales (p = 0.0007) [25] and African savannah elephants (p = 0.0200) [26] , where both species have female phylopatry and like lions, a matriarchal social structure. However, genetic drift tends to overwhelm selection in small isolated populations, predominantly affecting haploid elements due to its lower effective population size (Table 1) . Therefore, we suggest that the contrasting results obtained for nDNA and mtDNA are more likely further evidence that lion populations underwent severe bottlenecks. The highly structured lion matrilines comprise four monophyletic mtDNA haplo-groups ( Figure 4A ; Figure S3 ). Lineage I consisted of a divergent haplotype H4 from KEN, lineage II was observed in most Southern Africa populations, lineage III was widely distributed from Central and Northern Africa to Asia, and lineage IV occurred in Southern and Eastern Africa.

Seroprevalence studies indicate that FIV Ple is endemic in eight of the 11 populations but absent from the Asian GIR lions in India and in Namibia and southern Botswana/Kalahari regions (NAM/ BOT-I) in Southwest Africa ( Figure 1B ). Phylogenetic analysis of the conserved pol-RT region in 117 FIV-infected lions depicted monophyletic lineages [15, 18] that affirm six distinct subtypes (A-F) that are distributed geographically in three distinct patterns ( Figure 4B ; Figure S4 ). First, multiple subtypes may circulate within the same population as exemplified by subtypes A, B and C all ubiquitous within the three Serengeti lion populations (SER-I, SER-II and SER-III) and subtypes A and E within lions of Botswana (BOT-II) ( Figure 4B and 4C and Figure S4 ). Second, unique FIV Ple subtypes may be restricted to one location as subtype F in Kenya, subtype E in Botswana (BOT-II), subtype C in Serengeti, and subtype D in Krugar Park ( Figure 4B and 4C and Figure S4 ). Third, intra-subtype strains cluster geographically, as shown by distinct clades within subtype A that were restricted to lions within Krugar Park, Botswana and Serengeti and within subtype B that corresponded to Uganda, Serengeti and Ngorongoro Crater lions ( Figure 4B and 4C and Figure S4 ).

Not unexpectedly, FIV Ple pairwise genetic distances, represented as population F ST among the eight lion FIV-infected populations, were not significantly correlated with geographic distance (R 2 = 0.08; Mantel's test, P = 0.165) (Figure 3 ), and affirms that patterns of viral dissemination do not conform to a strict isolation-by-distance model. Rather, the two distinct clusters observed ( Figure 3 ) reflect the complex distribution of FIV Ple among African lions. Indeed, despite the low geographic distance within East-African lion populations, the FIV Ple genetic divergence showed a broader range in F ST (0.03 to 0.79 for most of first cluster; Figure 3 ). By contrast, approximately half of the range in F ST (0.26 to 0.69 for the second cluster; Figure 3 ) was observed among East and Southern Africa in spite of its large geographic separation. In contrast with the patterns observed in lions, linearized F ST estimates [24] for FIV Ple were better correlated with log geographic distance (two-dimensional lattice model) (R 2 = 0.15) than with geographic distance (one-dimensional model) (R 2 = 0.02), although in both cases the Mantel's test was not significant (P.0.2474) ( Figure S2 ).

The mtDNA coalescence dating suggested that the East African lineage I (KEN haplotype H4) had an old origin of ,324,000 years (95% CI: 145,000-502,000). Extant East African populations (KEN/NGC/SER-I/SER-II/SER-III) also showed a slightly significant higher nDNA allelic richness and genetic diversity (Table S4) . Moreover, the FIV Ple subtype diversity was higher in East African clades (exhibiting four out of the six known viral-strains), including the most divergent FIV Ple subtype C ( Figure 4B and 4C). These genetic data from lions and FIV Ple is consistent with the older origin of extant East African lions, which is further supported by the oldest lion fossils discovered in East Africa [1] .

Relative to East Africa, Southern lions have a slightly more recent mtDNA coalescence. Lineage II, found in NAM, BOT-II and KRU has an estimated coalescence of 169,000 years (95% CI: 34,000-304,000) and the more widespread lineage IV found in the Southern populations of BOT-I, BOT-II and KRU as well as the Eastern populations of SER (I, II, and III), NGC and UGA, coalesces ,101,000 years ago (95% CI: 11,000-191,000). However, the similar levels of nDNA genetic diversity, the occurrence of an exclusively Southern mtDNA lineage II and highly divergent FIV Ple subtypes, FIV Ple subtype D found only in KRU and subtype E exclusive to BOT-II, suggests that both East and Southern Africa were important refugia for lions during the Pleistocene. Therefore, the co-occurrence of divergent mtDNA haplotypes (6 to 10 mutations; Figure 1B and 1C) in southern populations may be the consequence of further isolation within refugia during colder climatic periods. Contemporary fragmentation of lion populations could further explain the results of nested-clade phylogeographical analysis (NCPA [27] ) ( Figure S5 ), which inferred restricted gene flow with isolation-by-distance between mtDNA haplotypes H9 (BOT-II) and H10 (KRU) (x 2 = 10.00, P = 0.0200), between haplotypes H1 (BOT-II/NAM) and H2 (KRU) (x 2 = 71.00, P#0.0001), and between haplotypes H9-H10 (BOT-II/KRU) and haplotypes H11-H12 (BOT-I/KRU/SER/NGC/UGA) (x 2 = 187.83, P#0.0001).

Further isolation within refugia (sub-refugia) may also have occurred in East Africa. This is suggested by the distinctive mtDNA haplotype H4 and the unique FIV Ple subtype F found in the Kenya population, which may have resulted from reduced gene flow across the Rift valley, a scenario that has been suggested for several bovid and carnivore populations (see [28] and references therein).

The best example of concordance between host genome markers and viral transmission patterns is observed in the Serengeti National Park in Tanzania. Our previous findings described markedly high levels of FIV Ple subtype A, B and C circulating within the Serengeti lion population to such an extent that 43% of the lions sampled were multiply-infected with two or three subtypes [15, 18] and were hypothesized to represent recent admixture of three formerly separated populations. Such result is confirmed here by lion genomic markers ( Figure 2 ). Further, although lions within the Serengeti can be assigned to one of three populations (SER-I, SER-II or SER-III) by host genomic markers, FIV Ple subtypes are distributed ubiquitously in all three, characteristic of rapid horizontal retroviral transmission subsequent to host population admixture. The possible isolating mechanism remains to be elucidated as there is no apparent barrier to gene flow in this ecosystem.

Based on patterns of genetic diversity and phylogenetic analysis of lion nDNA/mtDNA and FIV Ple markers, we propose a scenario of a period of refugia/isolation in the Late Pleistocene followed by two major lion expansions across Africa and Asia. The first expansion, supported by the mtDNA NCPA [27] (x 2 = 690.00, P#0.0001; Figure S5 ), was a long-distance colonization of mtDNA lineage-III (GIR/ATL/ANG/ZBW) around 118,000 years ago (95% CI: 28,000-208,000), with subsequent fragmentation of haplotypes H5-H6 into Central and North Africa and haplotypes H7-H8 into West Asia (M1- Figure 1A) . Support for this initial expansion is also found in nDNA. The ADA haplotype A5 fixed in GIR in also present in KEN, SER-II, and SER-III, suggesting that lions likely colonized West Asia from the East Africa refugia ( Figure 1B) . Such an expansion may have been favored by the start of a warmer and less arid period in Africa 130,000-70,000 years ago [29] . This ''out-of-Africa event'' would have occurred much later than the initial lion expansion through Eurasia based on fossils (,500,000 years ago) [3] . It is likely that multiple lion expansions occurred in the Pleistocene, as occurred with humans [21] .

A second, more recent lion expansion probably occurred at the Pleistocene/Holocene transition, this one from Southern Africa toward East Africa (M2- Figure 1A, Figure 3 ). This is reflected in the mtDNA linage IV, where haplotypes present in Southern lions are basal (older) to those found in the East. Overall, mtDNA population nucleotide diversity decreases from Southern to East Africa ( Figure 1B and 1C) , a finding supported by pairwise mismatch analysis [30] (raggedness, r = 0.086; P,0.001). The fixation of mtDNA haplotype H11 in BOT-I (otherwise fixed only in East Africa populations) suggests that the colonizing lions expanded northwards from the Kalahari Desert, which included bush, woodland and savannah habitats during the climatic fluctuations of the Pleistocene [31] . This expansion would have occurred relatively recently as the single rare tip mtDNA haplotype H12, found only in SER-I, is derived from the interior widespread haplotype H11 (,14,000-7,000 years; given one mtDNA substitution every 7,000 years; Table 1 ). This expansion is also supported by FIV Ple subtype A where haplotypes present in Southern lions (KRU and BOT-I) are basal to those found in the East (SER-I, SER-II and SER-III) and a decrease of nucleotidediversity of this FIV Ple subtype is observed from Southern (p = 0.15) to Eastern Africa (p = 0.03) ( Figure 3B ). Interestingly, a similar northward colonization process from Southern Africa has been suggested for some of the lion preys, namely the impala, greater kudu, and wildebeest [32, 33] .

If we had restricted our inferences to mtDNA, we might have concluded that East African lion populations, which are fixed or nearly fixed for haplotype H11, went extinct during the Pleistocene/Holocene transition (similar to the well known mega-fauna extinctions of the Late Pleistocene [34] ) and were then colonized by Southern populations. However, our population genomics data better fit a scenario of lion population expansion and interbreeding rather than simple replacement. First, genetic diversity and allelic richness at nDNA are slightly higher in East Africa populations relatively to those in Southern Africa. This is contrary to the expected pattern of population expansion in which there is usually a progressive decline in genetic diversity and allelic richness. Second, SER lions carry two diverse FIV Ple subtypes found only in East Africa (B-C), and not only FIV Ple subtype A, which was presumably introduced in East Africa coincidently with the mtDNA expansion event northwards from South. Third, the East African FIV Ple subtype B found in UGA/SER-I/SER-II/SER-III/NGC showed evidence of a population expansion (raggedness, r = 0.004; P,0.01; F s = 220.37; P,0.00001) and the highest nucleotide diversity observed within FIV Ple subtypes (p = 0.09). Four, the FIV Ple subtype diversity is higher in East African clades (four out of the six viral strains).

The utility of FIV Ple pol-RT as a marker of lion population structure and natural history is that it can be informative on a contemporaneous time scale, though it may be less useful at capturing more ancient demographic events. The extreme divergence among FIV Ple subtypes, considered with high sero-prevalence in eight of the 11 lion populations, and combined with patterns of geographic concordance, support the hypothesis that FIV Ple is not a recent emergence within modern lions [35] . Populations that harbor one private FIV Ple subtype such KEN (subtype F), BOT-II (subtype E), and KRU (subtype D) must have been sufficiently isolated for enough time for the virus to evolve into unique subtypes, a result corroborated by the high nDNA and mtDNA genetic structure present in these lion populations ( Figure 4 ). Thus, it is possible that the initial emergence of FIV Ple pre-dates the Late-Pleistocene expansions of contemporary lion populations [36] , but present day distributions are more useful indicators of very recent host population dynamics, a result also observed with FIV Pco in a panmictic population of pumas in western North America [19] .

Accurate interpretation of past and contemporary population demographic scenarios is a primary goal for the effective conservation of endangered species. In this study, we found substantial population subdivision, reduced gene flow, and large differences in FIV Ple sequence and sero-prevalence among lion populations, as well as evidence of historic secondary contact between populations ( Figure 3C ; Table S4 to S9). The very low population level of mtDNA nucleotide diversity, the number of haplotypes private to a single population (Figure 1) , and probably also the lack of SRY genetic variation across all male lions (haplotype S1, n = 183) suggests that lion numbers diminished considerably following the Late Pleistocene. The last century reduction in lion distribution further eroded its genomic diversity, and microsatellite variation suggested recent population bottlenecks in seven out of the 11 populations (standardized differences test, P,0.05; Table S5 ) [37] .

Although we did not explicitly try to address the adequacy of lion subspecies designations (currently only one African subspecies is widely recognized) [38, 39] , we provided strong evidence that there is no evidence of substantial genetic exchange of matrilines among existing populations as the AMOVA [40] withinpopulation component was uniformly high in all distinct subdivision scenarios (W ST <0.920; P,0.0001; three-six groups; Table S6 ). Similarly, significant population structure was detected from nDNA (F ST = 0.18), with low levels of admixture evident from Bayesian analysis [22] (a = 0.033). Therefore, employing a bottom-up perspective that prioritizes populations, rather than large-scale units (e.g. all African lions), might preserve and maintain lion diversity and evolutionary processes most efficiently [41] .

A total of 357 individuals were obtained across most of the lion range in Africa and Asia ( Figure 1A ; Table S1 ). Genetic variation among lion specimens was assessed using maternal (12S and 16S genes), paternal (SRY gene) and bi-parental autosomal (22 microsatelite loci, and the ADA and TF genes) markers (GenBank accession numbers: FJ151632-FJ151652). Analyses of mtDNA in Panthera species are complicated by the presence of a 12.5 kb mtDNA integration into chromosome F2 [42] . Accordingly, mtDNA specific primers were designed for the 12S and 16S genes (Table S2 ) and we used long-range PCR amplification. We designed primers to amplify segments of the ADA (exon 10 and intron 10) and the TF (intron 3) genes (Table S2) , two of the most variable protein loci in lion populations [5] , localized on the domestic cat Felis catus chromosome A3p and C2q, respectively. The Y-chromosome SRY-39UTR gene was also amplified [43] .

PCR products were amplified from 50 ng of genomic DNA in a 25 mL reaction system containing 1.5 mM MgCl 2 , 1.0 mM dNTPs, 0.25 units of AmpliTaq Gold DNA polymerase (Applied Biosystems), and 16 PCR buffer II; the amplification protocol was: denaturation 10 min at 95uC, a touch-down cycle of 95uC for 30 s, 52uC for 60 s decreased by 1uC in the next cycle for 10 cycles, 72uC for 120 s, then 35 amplification cycles of 95uC for 30 s, 52uC for 60 s, and 72uC for 120 s, followed by an extension of 10 min at 72uC. PCR products were sequenced on an ABI 377. Sequences were aligned and cleaned using SEQUENCHER (Gene Codes).

Twenty two polymorphic microsatellite loci (20 dinucleotide repeats: FCA006, FCA008, FCA014, FCA069, FCA077, FCA085, FCA091, FCA098, FCA105, FCA126, FCA129, FCA139, FCA205, FCA208, FCA211, FCA224, FCA229, FCA230, FCA247, and FCA281; and two tetranucleotide repeats: FCA391 and FCA441) were amplified [44] . Microsatellites were scored in an ABI 377 and analyzed using GENESCAN 2.1 and GENOTYPER 2.5. These loci are located on 11 of the 19 F. catus chromosomes, occurring in different linkage groups or at least 12 centimorgans apart [44, 45] .

Western blots using domestic cat and lion FIV as antigen were performed as previously described [46, 47] . The supernatant from virus-infected cells was centrifuged at 200 g for 10 min at 5uC. The resultant supernatant was centrifuged at 150,000 g at 4uC for 2 hours. Pelleted viral proteins were resuspended in 1/20 th of the original volume and total protein content was assayed using the Biorad Protein Assay. Twenty mg of viral protein were run on 4-20% Tris-Glycine gels and transferred to PDVF membranes (BioRad). Membrane strips were exposed 2-12 h to a 1:25 or 1:200 dilution of serum or plasma. After washing, samples were labeled with goat anti-cat HRP or phosphate conjugated antibody (KPL laboratories) at a 1:2000 dilution, washed, and incubated in ECL Western Blotting detection reagents (Amersham Biosciences) for 2 min, then exposed to Lumi-Film Chemiluminescent Detection Film (Boehringer Mannheim) or incubated in BCIP/ NBP phosphatase substrate (KPL laboratories) for 15 min [46] [47] [48] . Results were visualized and scored manually based on the presence and intensity of antibody binding to the p24 gag capsid protein.

Nested PCR amplification of partial FIV Ple pol-RT was performed [18, 46] . Briefly, first round PCR reactions used 100 ng of genomic DNA, 2.5 mM MgCl 2 and an annealing temperature of 52uC. Second round PCR reactions used identical conditions with 1-5 ml of first-round product as template. All PCR products were sequenced as described above for lion genetic analyses (GenBank accession numbers: AY549217-AY552683; AY878208-AY878235; FJ225347-FJ225382).

We used the GENETIX 4.02 [49] , GENEPOP 3.3 [50] , MICROSAT [51] , and DNASP 4.10 [52] to calculate the following descriptive statistics: (i) percentage of polymorphic loci (P 95 ), number of alleles per locus (A), observed and expected heterozygosity (H E and H O ), and number of unique alleles (A U ); (ii) assess deviations from HWE; (iii) estimate the coefficient of differentiation (F ST ), and (iv) nucleotide (p) and haplotype (h) diversity.

We tested the hypothesis that all loci are evolving under neutrality for both the lion and the FIV Ple data. For frequency data, we used the method described by Beaumont and Nichols [53] and implemented in FDIST (http://www.rubic.rdg.ac.uk/ mab/software.html). The F ST values estimated from microsatellite loci plotted against heterozygosity showed that all values fall within the expected 95% confidence limit and consequently no outlier locus were identified. For sequence data (lion nDNA/ mtDNA and FIV Ple pol-RT), we ruled out any significant evidence for genetic hitchhiking and background selection by assessing Fu and Li's D* and F* tests [54] and Fu's F S statistics [55] .

A Bayesian clustering method implemented in the program STRUCTURE [22] was used to infer number of populations and assign individual lions to populations based on multilocus genotype (microsatellites) and sequence data (ADA, TF, and mtDNA genes) and without incorporating sample origin. For haploid mtDNA data, each observed haplotype was coded with a unique integer (e.g. 100, 110) for the first allele and missing data for the second (STRUCTURE [22] analyses with or without the mtDNA data were essentially identical). For K population clusters, the program estimates the probability of the data, Pr(X|K), and the probability of individual membership in each cluster using a Markov chain Monte Carlo method under the assumption of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) within each cluster. Initial testing of the HWE in each of the populations defined by the geographic origin of sampling revealed no significant deviation from HW expectations with the exception of SER and BOT population (later subdivided by STRUCTURE [22] in 3 and 2 clusters, respectively; such deviations from HW expectations were interpreted as evidence of further population structuring). We conducted six independent runs with K = 1-20 to guide an empirical estimate of the number of identifiable populations, assuming an admixture model with correlated allele frequencies and with burn-in and replication values set at 30,000 and 10 6 , respectively. STRUCTURE also estimates allele frequencies of a hypothetical ancestral population and an alpha value that measures admixed individuals in the data set. The assignment of admixed individuals to populations using STRUCTURE [22] has been considered in subsequent population analyses. For each population cluster k, the program estimates F k , a quantity analogous to Wright's F ST , but describing the degree of genetic differentiation of population k from the ancestral population.

Patterns of gene flow and divergence among populations were described using a variety of tests. First, to visualize subtle relationships among individual autosomal genotypes, threedimensional factorial correspondence analyses [23] (FCA) were performed in GENETIX [49] , which graphically projects the individuals on the factor space defined by the similarity of their allelic states. Second, neighbor-joining (NJ) analyses implementing the Cavalli-Sforza & Edwards' chord genetic distance [56] (D CE ) were estimated in PHYLIP 3.6 [57] , and the tree topology support was assessed by 100 bootstraps. Third, the difference in average H O and A was compared among population groups using a twosided test in FSTAT 2.9.3.2 [58] , which allows to assess the significance of the statistic OS x using 1,000 randomizations. Four, the equilibrium between drift and gene flow was tested using a regression of pairwise F ST on geographic distance matrix among all populations for host nDNA(microsatellites)/mtDNA and FIV Ple data. A Mantel test [59] was used to estimate the 95% upper probability for each matrix correlation. Assuming a stepping stone model of migration where gene flow is more likely between adjacent populations, one can reject the null hypothesis that populations in a region are at equilibrium if (1) there is a nonsignificant association between genetic and geographic distances, and/or (2) a scatterplot of the genetic and geographic distances fails to reveal a positive and monotonic relationship over all distance values of a region [60] . We also evaluated linearized F ST [i.e. F ST /(12F ST )] [24] among populations. We tested two competing models of isolation-by-distance, one assuming the habitat to be arrayed in an infinite one-dimensional lattice and another assuming an infinite two-dimensional lattice. Both models showed that genetic differentiation increased with raw and logtransformed Euclidean distances, respectively [24] . We determined the confidence interval value of the slope of the regression for the nDNA data using a non parametric ABC bootstrap [61] in GENEPOP 4.0 [62] .

The demographic history of populations was compared using a variety of estimators based on the coalescence theory. First, signatures of old demographic population expansion were investigated for mtDNA and FIV Ple pol-RT haplotypes using pairwise mismatch distributions [63] in DNASP [52] . The goodness-of-fit of the observed data to a simulated model of expansion was tested with the raggedness (r) index [64] .

Second, the occurrence of recent bottlenecks was evaluated for microsatellite data using the method of Cornuet & Luikart [37] in BOTTLENECK [65] and using 10,000 iterations. This approach, which exploits the fact that rare alleles are generally lost first through genetic drift after reduction in population size, employs the standardize differences test, which is the most appropriate and powerful when using 20 or more polymorphic loci [37] . Tests were carried out using the stepwise mutation model (SMM), which is a conservative mutation model for the detection of bottleneck signatures with microsatellites [66] .

Third, to discriminate between recurrent gene flow and historical events we used the nested-clade phylogeographical analysis [27, 67] (NCPA) for the mtDNA data. When the nullhypothesis of no correlation between genealogy and geography is rejected, biological inferences are drawn using a priori criteria. The NCPA started with the estimation of a 95% statistical parsimony [68] mtDNA network in TCS 1.20 [69] . Tree ambiguities were further resolved using a coalescence criteria [70] . The network was converted into a series of nested branches (clades) [71, 72] , which were then tested against their geographical locations through a permutational contingency analysis in GEODIS 2.2 [73] . The inferences obtained were also corroborated with the automated implementation of the NCPA in ANECA [74] . To address potential weaknesses in some aspects of the NCPA analysis [75, 76] , we further validated the NCPA inferences with independent methods for detecting restricted gene-flow/isolation-bydistance (using matrix correlation of pairwise F ST and geographic distance) and population expansion (using pairwise mismatch distributions).

Four, to test the significance of the total mtDNA genetic variance, we conducted hierarchical analyses of molecular variance [40] (AMOVA) using ARLEQUIN 2.0 [77] . Total genetic variation was partitioned to compare the amount of difference among population groups, among populations within each groups, and within populations.

Phylogenetic relationships among mtDNA and FIV Ple pol-RT sequences were assessed using Minimum evolution (ME), Maximum parsimony (MP), and Maximum likelihood (ML) approaches implemented in PAUP [78] . The ME analysis for mtDNA consisted of NJ trees constructed from Kimura two-parameter distances followed by a branch-swapping procedure and for FIV Ple data employed the same parameter estimates as were used in the ML analysis. The MP analysis was conducted using a heuristic search, with random additions of taxa and tree-bisection-reconnection branch swapping. The ML analysis was done after selecting the best evolutionary model fitting the data using MODELTEST 3.7 [79] . Tree topologies reliability was assessed by 100 bootstraps. For the FIV Ple data, the reliability of the tree topology was further assessed through additional analyses using 520 bp of FIV Ple pol-RT sequences in a representative subset of individuals.

The time to the most recent common ancestor (TMRCA) for the ADA and TF haplotypes was estimated following Takahata et al. [80] , where we calculate the ratio of the average nucleotide differences within the lion sample to one-half the average nucleotide difference between leopards (P. pardus) and lions and multiplying the ratio by an estimate of the divergence time between lions and leopards (2 million years based on undisputed lion fossils in Africa) [81, 82] . The mtDNA TMRCA was estimated with a linearized tree method in LINTREE [83] and using the equation H = 2mT, where H was the branch height (correlated to the average pairwise distance among haplotypes), m the substitution rate, and T the divergence time. Leopard and snow leopard (P. uncia) sequences were used as outgroups. Inference of the TMRCA for microsatellite loci followed Driscoll et al. [6] where the estimate of microsatellite variance in average allele repeat-size was used as a surrogate for evolutionary time based on the rate of allele range reconstitution subsequent to a severe founder effect. Microsatellite allele variance has been shown to be a reliable estimator for microsatellite evolution and demographic inference in felid species [6] . [24] for lion (nDNA and mtDNA) and FIV Ple (pol-RT) genetic data plotted both against the geographic distance (model assuming habitat to be arrayed in an infinite one-dimensional lattice; one-dimension isolation-by-distance [IBD]) and the log geographic distance (model assuming an infinite two-dimensional lattice; twodimension isolation-by-distance) on geographic distance.

Feature Selection Methods for Identifying Genetic Determinants of Host Species in RNA Viruses,"Despite environmental, social and ecological dependencies, emergence of zoonotic viruses in human populations is clearly also affected by genetic factors which determine cross-species transmission potential. RNA viruses pose an interesting case study given their mutation rates are orders of magnitude higher than any other pathogen -as reflected by the recent emergence of SARS and Influenza for example. Here, we show how feature selection techniques can be used to reliably classify viral sequences by host species, and to identify the crucial minority of host-specific sites in pathogen genomic data. The variability in alleles at those sites can be translated into prediction probabilities that a particular pathogen isolate is adapted to a given host. We illustrate the power of these methods by: 1) identifying the sites explaining SARS coronavirus differences between human, bat and palm civet samples; 2) showing how cross species jumps of rabies virus among bat populations can be readily identified; and 3) de novo identification of likely functional influenza host discriminant markers.","Emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) continue to represent a significant public health threat, as illustrated by the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic and the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic. Of particular concern are the 60%+ of EIDs of zoonotic origin [1, 2] . In addition to influenza and SARS [3] , notable examples include hantaviruses [4] , Nipah and Hendra viruses [5] and HIV [6] .

While predicting the emergence of new pathogens is likely to remain an unachievable goal for the immediate future, an emphasis of current research has been to try to identify ecological, behavioural and biological predictors of cross-species transmission and consequent disease emergence [2, 7, 8, 9, 10] . The wealth of pathogen sequence data becoming available makes identification of pathogen genomic markers of emergence one of the more promising approaches [11] , particularly for RNA viruses given their high mutation rate and resulting high diversity at the population level [12] .

The identification of genetic markers predicting cross-species disease emergence faces many of the same challenges as genotypeto-phenotype mapping in other spheres, such as human genomewide association studies of risk factors for chronic diseases [13] . Principle among these are relatively small sample sizes coupled with a very large number of potential explanatory variables (single nucleotide substitutions and their interactions) [14, 15] . However, the much higher frequency of polymorphisms in RNA viruses and their fast population-level evolution offers unique challenges and opportunities.

While most viral variants generated in a specific host are selectively neutral in that host, upon crossing the species barrier they are under strong selective pressure. We expect selection to shape the relative frequencies of viral variants found in donor and recipient species. Specific hosts impose specific evolutionary landscapes on viruses which will translate into signature genetic sequences. We therefore expect comparisons of allele frequencies between sequences of the same pathogen isolated from different hosts to reveal a large subset of alleles which are conserved between host species and a smaller subset of host specific alleles. This comparison can be performed by statistical techniques able to discriminate phenotype (host) relevant variables (alleles). Here we apply feature selection methods which identify a subset of variable sites which can be used to build a robust phenotype classifier [16] . We focus on one algorithm for classification -the random forest algorithm (RFA) -that offers excellent performance in classification tasks, providing direct measures of variable importance and classification error [17] .

Our goals are two-fold. First, we investigate how well featureselection algorithms such as RFA can reliably classify RNA viruses according to their host species reservoir, thereby giving insight into pathogen evolution, and the frequency of cross-species transition events. Identification of functional polymorphisms is not critical in meeting this goal, though clearly is desirable. Second, we evaluate how well RFA can identify sets of sites that are functionally relevant to the phenotype of interest (in this case host species), in the context of dense RNA virus genomes and their high degree of linkage.

We first analyse polymerase gene sequences of RNA viruses to identify the genetic signatures predicting host species. As an example, Figure 1a represents the diversity of Flavivirus polymerase amino acid sequences (Table S2 ). Here we use principal component analysis (PCA) solely to visualise the variation between samples, not as a classification tool. Figure 1b illustrates how feature selection identifies amino acid positions which robustly classify samples by host species, resulting in clustering of samples which infect the same reservoir. The clustering of samples seen in the PCA plot is similar to that seen in the maximum likelihood tree (Figure 1c) , supporting the use of PCA as a useful tool for generating low-dimensional representations of genetic variation.

Second, we examine the potential of RFA applied as a phenotypic classifier to give insight into cross-species disease emergence. In this case, analysis of sequences of viruses which have fully adapted to particular host species -as in the Flavivirus example -is insufficient to distinguish between the subset of mutations required to allow cross-species emergence and later non-essential mutations which further increase viral fitness in a new species. We therefore need to examine data collected from zoonotic outbreaks. The 2003 SARS epidemic is a good example of a zoonosis which rapidly developed a high level of transmissibility in humans [3, 18, 19] . The pathogen was rapidly identified [3] and the origin of the virus was initially traced back to palm civets [19] , before bats were identified as the natural reservoirs of SARS-like coronaviruses [20] . We applied the RFA to nucleotide sequences of the spike protein of SARS-like coronaviruses (Table  S3) , recovered from human patients and palm civets from the 2003 and 2004 epidemics and bat sequences available in the Genbank database. Figure 2a illustrates the extent to which bat sequences differ from the human and palm civet sequences recovered in China in 2002-2004, and also highlights the similarity of palm civet and human sequences [19] . Analysis of the variation in the selected host-discriminant viral alleles (highlighted in Figure 3 ) reveals interesting relationships between host reservoirs (Figure 2b) . Firstly, there is noticeable genetic variation in the samples from human SARS patients collected in the early and mid-stages of the 2003 epidemic, compatible with adaptation of the virus to a new host species. The late 2003 samples were less variable, suggesting selective pressures may by then have stabilized [21] . Secondly, human patient samples from a small outbreak in January 2004 are more closely related to palm civet 2004 samples than to any human sample from the previous year, indicating that the 2004 outbreak represented an independent cross species transition [22] . The palm civet samples from 2003 were collected a few months after the human epidemic ended so there might have been an accumulation of mutations responsible for the substantial distance between palm civet 2003 samples and human 2003 samples. However, the close proximity between the bat samples and the first samples from the human 2003 epidemic suggests that the transition from palm civet to human occurred quite rapidly after the transition from bat to palm civet. With respect to our second goal -identifying functional relevant sites -it is notable that 12 of the 15 positions identified by feature selection coded for non-synonymous substitutions (Table  S4) , most of which are mapped onto the surface of the spike protein. It should be noted that of the 15 positions identified in the current study, 13 overlap with those found in [23] . The functional relevance of the two unique positions (239 and 311) found here and that of the 13 unique positions identified in [23] is not clear. When running the RFA for amino acid sequences of the same viruses, we obtain a subset of 12 significant amino acid positions that are coded for by the exact same non-synonymous substitutions highlighted by the RFA conducted on the nucleotide sequences.

High mutation rates in RNA viruses facilitate the overcoming of host specific barriers [24] particularly in ecological settings where hosts display high contact rates [8, 22] . However, cross-species transfer seems to be favoured between closely related host species [9, 25, 26, 27] , suggesting that the fitness landscape of host adaptation is shaped by host phylogeny. Streicker and colleagues [26] defined lineages of rabies virus associated to particular bat taxa, identifying 43 cross species transmission events involving 15 bat species. Here we reanalyse the complete nucleoprotein sequences available for five of those bat species (Table S5) . PCA applied to these sequences ( Figure 4a ) shows how viruses collected from 3 of the bats species (L. borealis, L. seminolus, L. cinereus) are extremely similar, with a substantially divergent lineage infecting E. fuscus bats and an isolated small cluster of viruses seen in T. brasiliensis. Applying RFA to predict host species to these sequences allows discrimination of L. cinereus specific traits (Figure 4b ), but does not significantly separate the L. borealis and L. seminolus clusters. This suggests that transmission of rabies virus between these two bat species is much more frequent than between any other pair of species examined. The advantage of RFA compared with phylogenetic methods is that it allows a probability of ''belonging'' to each host bat species to be estimated for each virus sample. Thus we can examine whether a virus isolated in one species is in fact native to a different host species. Figure 4b highlights the 8 outlier sequences (T1-T8) in this dataset -viruses which are closer to rabies viruses native to a different species from that in which they were isolated. For these 8 viruses, Figure 4c gives the RFA classification probabilities of these viruses to the 5 different host species considered. In six cases, the cross-species transitions thus identified agree with those identified in [26] . Five of these 8 transitions occurred between L. borealis and L. seminolus. This, and the relatively poor ability of RFA to choose between these species in classifying viruses (Table S6 ), suggests that phylogenetic closeness between host species ( Figure S4 ) facilitates cross-species transmission.

To address our second goal of investigating the functional relevance of identified discriminant features, we applied RFA to a collection of influenza A samples from distinct host species

Moving away from genome scan methods used for human GWAS (ultimately inappropriate for the short highly polymorphic genomes of RNA viruses), our work shows the power and potential of multi-class machine learning algorithms in inferring the functional genetic changes associated with phenotypic change (e.g. crossing a species barrier). We show that even distantly related viruses within a viral family share highly conserved genetic signatures of host specificity; reinforce how fitness landscapes of host adaptation are shaped by host phylogeny; and highlight the evolutionary trajectories of RNA viruses in rapid expansion and under great evolutionary pressure. We do so by (for each dataset) unveiling a set of phenotype characteristic mutations which are shown to be functionally relevant, thus providing new insights into phenotypic relationships between RNA viruses. These methods also provide a solid statistical framework with which the degree of host adaptation can be inferred, thus serving as a valuable tool for studying host transition events with particular relevance for emerging infectious diseases. These methods can then serve as rigorous tools of emergence potential assessment, specifically in scenarios where rapid host classification of newly emerging viruses can be more important than identifying putative functional sites.

focusing on two viral segments that have been suggested to be major determinants of host range and virulence [28] . First, as a critical validation of the RFA, we analysed H1N1 hemagglutinin (HA) amino acid sequences collected in human (pre and post 2009 pandemic) and swine hosts, since multiple sources of empirical evidence for the functional relevance of specific amino acids in that gene are available [29, 30, 31] . Second, we analysed the PB2 Influenza A gene, since it is highly conserved across subtypes and its evolution has been hypothesised to reflect host specific adaptation [32] .

The HA analysis serves not only as an assessment of the functional relevance of the positions being highlighted as host specific by RFA, but also as a benchmark of the method by direct comparison with a recently published study [33] which made use of an alternative feature-selection algorithm (Adaboost). We compare algorithm performance on three levels: prediction ability, percentage of selected amino acids in functionally relevant positions, and overlap of selected amino acids. We use full HA segment amino acid sequences and analyse the proportion of selected amino acids that fall in the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD), and in known antigenic sites. Table 1 summarises our findings by comparison with the Adaboost results [33] . There is substantial overlap with the sets of relevant positions between the two methods, although RFA seems to consistently identify a larger proportion of amino acids in HA's receptor binding domain (RBD), particularly those that are also known antigenic sites, with a greater predictive ability. Even if one were to aggregate the Adaboost results (Adaboost can only undertake binary classification, so two comparisons were needed to explore host-specific determinants for 3 virus groups), that algorithm identifies 47 significant positions, 20 (42.5%) of which belong to the RBD, 7 (35%) in known antigenic sites. A multi-class RFA is able to identify a significant larger subset of amino acids in known antigen sites (12 in the RBD plus 2 others), the functional relevance of which can be explored in future experimental studies. Table S7 lists all the positions selected as significant, while Figure 5 portrays allelic diversity across the HA samples analysed and gives clear intuition into why the identified sites were selected by RFA. We should note the absence of the 190 and 225 mutations (hallmark mutations of human-adapted H1N1 HA) from the subset of significant residues determined by RFA. Although these mutations confer optimal contact with the sialic acid receptors [29] , we find that 190D is highly conserved throughout our sequences, contrasting with the 190E amino acid found in avian samples. Residue 225 is picked as one of the 100 most informative sites for host discrimination by the RFA. All the virus groups examined contain samples with the 225D allele, while the 225G allele (the consensus in avian viruses) is present in some seasonal human and swine samples. Had we included avian samples in the analysis, the 225 positions would certainly be classified as highly host discriminant. Here, we identify other mutations which have empirically been found to influence contact with the a2-6 glycans, either by providing additional anchoring sites for the sialic acid (position 145); by forming a network interacting with Asp190 (186, 187 and 189); or by modulating the stability of those contacts (219 and 227) [34, 35] . Identified positions 155 and 131 are also thought to play a relevant role in binding to sialic acid receptors [34, 36] . Feature selection performed on the PB2 segment highlights subtype transcending functionally relevant amino acids from sequences of 7 influenza subtypes (H1N1, H1N2, H2N2, H3N2, H5N1, H3N8, H7N7), collected in 5 different hosts (humans, birds, pigs, dogs, and horses), as detailed in Table S8 . Overall, we identified a subset of 23 host discriminant positions (Table S9) , out of which only 7 fall outside known functional domains [37, 38] . Our results are substantially congruent (overlap of 7 identified positions out of 12) with those of a phylogenetic study aimed at identifying amino acid sites with strong support for different selection constraints in human and avian viruses [39] , even though our analysis is not limited to differences between these two hosts. A closer look at the identified sites in the most extensively studied functional domains (the 627 and NLS domains) reveals that all lie on the surface of the protein (Figure 6) , with mutations at positions 588, 591,627, and 702 being responsible for the most drastic conformational changes. Analysis of the physiochemical properties of the selected amino acids reveals side chain charge reversals in positions 591 and 627 (Table S9 ). The insertion of a lysine in an otherwise avian adapted H5N1 virus (which is unable to infect humans) has been shown to promote host adaptation [40, 41] and increase virulence [42, 43] . Conversely, mutation in amino acid 591 can reduce the selective pressure for mutations at amino acid 627, serving as an alternate human adaptive strategy [44] . This possible interaction is emphasised by the juxtaposition of residues 591 and 627, as observed in Figure 6 . Of the remaining selected amino acids, some refer to mutations that can alter domain structure, three of which are human discriminating (661, 674, and 702). Interestingly, only one of the selected sites (292) differentiates canine viruses from equine viruses. The paired mean distance between groups (measured in terms of the number of differences observed in the full gene sequences) is smallest for the canine and equine viruses (Table S10 ). These host species turn out to be the ones with the most recent common ancestor [45, 46] , lending additional support to the hypothesis that host phylogeny shapes evolution of viruses by affecting cross-species mutational barriers. However, influenza H1N1 viruses found in human hosts are more similar (on average) to avian viruses than to viruses found in other mammalian hosts. Bird viruses are also the least divergent comparison group from swine viruses, perhaps reflecting the avian origin of all influenza viruses, and that, for influenza, transmission between birds and some mammalian hosts (human and swine in this case) is more frequent than expected by their phylogenetic relationships, probably due to persistent exposure in domestic settings.

In recent years, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have become an increasingly popular tool to identify genetic determinants of non-infectious human diseases [47] . However, statistically rigorous genotype-to-phenotype mapping for pathogens has been The receptor binding domain refers to positions 114 through 268 of the HA segment. 2 The antigenic sites considered here are those defined as such in [60] . 3 The Adaboost algorithm as implemented in [33] . doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003254.t001

much less common. The methods used for human GWAS are particularly ill-suited to feature selection in RNA viruses, due to the short genome length, very high substitution rate and diversity, and the high degree of genetic linkage [48, 49] . Human GWAS tend to concentrate on common variants to explain the observed phenotypes [15, 49, 50] by looking at individual SNPs, thus having severe limitations in the presence of epistasis [15, 48, 50, 51] ; our work demonstrates that non-parametric machine-learning based methods -such as RFA -are more appropriate in the context of RNA viruses, by identifying sets of substitutions associated with a particular phenotypic class, rather than solely evaluating the significance of individual polymorphisms [48, 51] . The incorporation of interactions among predictor variables in RFA makes it possible to identify possible epistatic effects, as highlighted in Figure 3 , with substitutions being determinant for host discrimination when found together with other substitutions at other sites, but being fairly unimportant by themselves. While RFA and other related discriminative methods arise from a different theoretical paradigm from likelihood-based statistical models, their predictive performance can be readily assessed via bootstrapping and other resampling methods. Our work demonstrates that machine-learning based feature selection methods are a powerful tool for de novo discovery of likely functional host discriminating markers, whilst providing a measure of the relative importance of those markers to host specificity. More generally, we highlight the potential of RFA for gaining important biological insights on cross-species transitions of RNA viruses.. First, we find that even relatively distantly related viruses within viral families -that might be geographically isolated and transmitted by different routes -share highly conserved genetic signatures of host specificity. Second, we see that the fitness landscapes of host adaptation are shaped by host phylogeny, with evolutionary barriers generally being lower between closely related host species, though not always (influenza A viruses transfer between birds and some mammalian hosts being a counterexample). Third, our analysis of influenza A often selects sites with empirically proven functional relevance [34, 36, 41, 44] to host specificity -in the case of HA, playing critical roles in cell receptor binding; for PB2, being exposed on the protein surface ( Figure 6 ) and thus potentially interacting with host importin molecules to gain access to the nucleus [52] or with the nucleoprotein in the ribonucleoprotein complex [53, 54] .

Overall, genotype to phenotype mapping using host reservoir as the discriminant phenotype can reveal evolutionary trajectories of RNA viruses in rapid expansion and under great evolutionary pressure (capturing the effects of diversification and expansion in a new host, as well as the contraction of diversity following host adaptation), while establishing the genetic signatures imposed by specific hosts which permit cross-species transmission events to be identified. Although discriminant analysis approaches are typically marred by biases related to sampling efforts and founder effects [55] , RFA enables the circumvention of some of these biases through cross-validation, sampling with replacement and attribution of weights to unequally sampled groups (see Text S1 for more details). Even though some residual sources of bias are impossible to eliminate, these rigorous methods (which are computationally efficient and thus applicable to large numbers of sequences) are potentially useful for assessing the risk of viral emergence, and represent a powerful additional tool alongside phylogenetic analysis for analysing the phenotypic evolution of RNA viruses.

Feature selection methods try to find the subset of relevant features for building robust learning models that can accurately inform a classification algorithm [16] . We focussed on the random forest algorithm (RFA), since it offers excellent performance in classification tasks [17] , and provides direct measures of variable importance and classification error. Each tree in a random forest is trained on a bootstrap sample of the data, and at each split a random subset of the variables is chosen from all the available variables (in this case, a subset of positions in the sequence for each split). Final classification of each sample results from aggregating the votes of all trees in the forest. The importance measure of each variable is obtained as the loss of accuracy of classification caused by the random permutation of attribute values for that variable. RFA identifies which variables give the most discriminating information regarding the independent categorical variable of interest (host reservoir in this case). We used the varSelRF package in R to run the random forest algorithm [56] .

The information within a given sequence alignment was numerically recoded into an allele frequency matrix, using the adegenet R package [57] (see Text S1 for more details). Starting from a multiple sequence alignment, all conserved sites are discarded, and a presence/absence matrix of all other alleles is assembled. Since we are dealing with RNA viruses, this matrix is actually equivalent to a presence/absence matrix of amino acid/ nucleotide types in polymorphic sites (Table S1 ).

Outside of phylogenetic analysis, direct comparison of genetic sequences is challenging, due to the high dimensionality of the datasets, typically consisting of dozens of sequences containing thousands of nucleotides. However, the relationship between a set of viral sequences can be represented through dimensional reduction techniques such as principal component analysis (PCA) [58] . Here we use PCA simply as a tool to graphically represent the variance in our datasets and to highlight the relationships between the viral samples collected in different host species, similar to past studies [59] . Selecting the two dominant principal components (which in our study always explained more than 40% of the variance) allows for a straightforward interpretation of differences between any set of sequences through a two dimensional plot, with the scores for the two principal components serving as the coordinates. We can then assess how well feature selection clusters RNA viruses by phenotype class (here host reservoir) by applying PCA to both the original dataset and to the dataset consisting exclusively of sites selected by feature selection.

RFA prediction errors and variable importance are estimated from the samples which are left out of the training set at each split of the tree -the 'out-of-bag' samples. This makes RFA highly robust to over-fitting. Although RFA is unlikely to over-fit, we carried out cross-validation of the algorithm by performing multiple bootstrap runs of the feature selection procedure. Each bootstrap run is a new realisation of the complete feature selection procedure, thus removing selection bias concerns on the importance of the most significant variables.

"Genetic diversity, seasonality and transmission network of human metapneumovirus: identification of a unique sub-lineage of the fusion and attachment genes OPEN","adults and children living in tropical climate remains limited. HMPV prevailed at 2.2% (n = 86/3,935) among individuals presented with acute respiratory tract infections in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia between 2012 and 2014. Seasonal peaks were observed during the northeast monsoon season (November-April) and correlated with higher relative humidity and number of rainy days (P < 0.05). Phylogenetic analysis of the fusion and attachment genes identified the co-circulation of three known HMPV sub-lineages, A2b and B1 (30.2% each, 26/86) and B2 (20.9%, 18/86), with genotype shift from sub-lineage B1 to A2b observed in 2013. Interestingly, a previously unrecognized sub-lineage of A2 was identified in 18.6% (16/86) of the population. Using a custom script for network construction based on the TN93 pairwise genetic distance, we identified up to nine HMPV transmission clusters circulating as multiple sub-epidemics. Although no apparent major outbreak was observed, the increased frequency of transmission clusters (dyads) during seasonal peaks suggests the potential roles of transmission clusters in driving the spread of HMPV. Our findings provide essential information for therapeutic research, prevention strategies, and disease outbreak monitoring of HMPV.","within the A2 sub-lineage, named A2a and A2b based on the phylogenetic analysis of the nucleocapsid (N) and F gene sequences in a population of paediatric patients 11 . Different genetic sub-lineages of HMPV also co-circulate in a temporal fashion and a shift in the predominant circulating strain is not uncommon [12] [13] [14] .

Acute respiratory infections caused by viruses such as HRSV, influenza A virus and human parainfluenza virus, amongst others are seasonally-distributed 15 . In temperate countries, a higher prevalence of HMPV has been reported during the months of winter and spring, with a lower seasonality than HRSV 2, [13] [14] [15] [16] . Climate also plays an important role in determining the seasonality of HMPV in tropical countries. Previous studies have described a direct correlation between the number of rainy days and the increase in the number of HMPV infections 6, 8 . In addition to the number of rainy days, the effects of other important factors in a tropical climate such as the relative humidity, temperature and amount of rainfall on the prevalence of HMPV need to be investigated in order to provide a better understanding of its seasonality.

Molecular epidemiological surveillance can be used to infer the dynamics of disease transmission based on the genetic relatedness of viral sequences derived from the population, as shown for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) [17] [18] [19] , influenza virus 20, 21 , echovirus 22 and ebola virus 23 , amongst others. Although HMPV is one of the main causative agents of RTIs worldwide, little is known about the temporal dynamics of HMPV transmission in the population. Transmission networks inferred from the analysis of viral sequences elucidate the degree of the spread of an infection in a subset of the population that allows the identification of the population at high risk of transmitting the virus amongst each other, thus enabling the implementation of effective and targeted public health preventive measures to reduce the prevalence of new infections in the population at large 17, 18, 24 .

To date, studies on the epidemiological distribution and genetic diversity of HMPV have been reported mainly among the hospitalised and outpatient children worldwide 4, 7, 12, 25, 26 . Despite the significant burden of acute RTIs due to HMPV 9 , information regarding the seasonal distribution, circulating genotypes and the dynamics of disease transmission of HMPV in the general population of all ages in tropical countries are currently limited 6, 8, 27 . In this study, we aimed to investigate the genetic diversity, seasonality and transmission network of HMPV infections among outpatient adults and children in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia during a two-year period.

May 2014, a total of 3,935 nasopharyngeal samples were collected (comprising 3,706 adults and 229 children), among which 86 (2.2%) samples were tested positive for HMPV. Among the infected individuals, seven (8.1%) were co-infected with other respiratory virus, whereby six individuals were dually co-infected with either rhinovirus (n = 3), adenovirus (n = 1), influenza B (n = 1) or coronavirus (n = 1) while one individual was triply co-infected with rhinovirus and influenza A. Co-infection with HRSV was not observed. The study population was comprised predominantly of females (61.6%, 53/86). Among 86 individuals infected with HMPV, 76.7% (n = 66) were adults (median age: 34.0 years, interquartile range, IQR, 26.0-54.0 years), 18.6% (n = 16) were elderly, defined as ≥ 65 years old 2 (median age: 72.0 years, IQR, 69.8-75.0 years) and the remaining 4.7% (n = 4) were children (median age: 14.5 years, IQR, 12.8-16.3 years). The population was ethnically diverse, comprising of Malays (46.5%, 40/86), Indians (26.7%, 23/86), Chinese (23.3%, 20/86) and other ethnic groups (3.5%, 3/86). Overall, the patients reported a median total of 4.0 days (IQR, 3.0-7.0 days) since the onset of disease symptoms. Majority of the patients reported symptoms of cough (98.8%), followed by hoarseness of voice (89.5%), nasal discharge (72.1%), sneezing (70.9%), headache (69.8%), sore throat (69.8%), nasal congestion (67.4%) and muscle ache (65.1%). During the 28-months period, a higher prevalence of HMPV infections were reported in March 2012, April and November 2013 (Fig. 1) .

Next, we assessed the effects of various meteorological factors in the context of a tropical climate on the prevalence of HMPV throughout the study period. The prevalence of HMPV significantly correlated with higher relative humidity (r = 0.449, P = 0.019) and number of rainy days (r = 0.440, P = 0.022). On the other hand, an inverse correlation between the prevalence of HMPV with the ground temperature (r = − 0.281, P = 0.155) and particulate matter measuring 10 μ m or less in diameter (PM10) (r = − 0.163, P = 0.417) was observed, although the observation was statistically non-significant. The total amount of rainfall (r = 0.235, P = 0.258) was also associated with the prevalence of HMPV, although the observation was statistically non-significant.

Phylogenetic analysis and genetic diversity of the F and G genes. Among the 86 samples positive for HMPV infection, the partial F and G genes were successfully amplified in 98.8% (85/86) and 95.3% (82/86) of the total samples, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis of the newly-sequenced and reference partial F and G gene sequences showed the clustering of the sequences into two main genotypes -A and B, and at least five known sub-lineages -A1, A2a, A2b, B1 and B2, in agreement with previous studies ( Fig. 2A,B) [10] [11] [12] . Within genotype A, a total of 30.2% (26/86) of the newly-generated sequences clustered within the A2b sub-lineage. Interestingly, 18.6% (16/86) of the sequences clustered with a reference strain, HMPV CN/gz01/08/A2 (accession number: GQ153651) within a previously unrecognized sub-lineage of A2, supported by a strong bootstrap value of 98-99% in the phylogenies of both F and G genes. The unique clade was provisionally assigned as a novel sub-lineage of A2. In addition to Malaysia, previously published sequences from other countries (China, Vietnam, and Cambodia) were also grouped within this clade. Both A1 and A2a sub-lineages were not detected in our study population. Similarly, within genotype B, a total of 30.2% (26/86) of the sequences clustered within the B1 sub-lineage and 20.9% (18/86) of the sequences clustered within the B2 sub-lineage. In 2012, B1 sub-lineage circulated predominantly at 39.5% (15/38) of the population and a shift in the predominant genotype towards A2b (29.4%, 10/34) was observed in 2013 (Fig. 3) . Between January and May 2014, both A2b and B2 sub-lineages co-circulated at equal prevalence at 35.7% (5/14) . In addition to samples collected from four children in our current study population, phylogenetic analysis of the F and G genes sequenced from 21 the sequences clustered within the novel sub-lineage of A2, followed by A2b and B1 at 20.0% (5/25) each, and A2a and B2 at 4.0% (1/25) each ( Fig. 2A,B) . No sequences were detected in the A1 sub-lineage.

Based on the estimation of intra-genotype mean genetic distances of nucleotide and amino acid sequences of HMPV, F gene has higher sequence identities overall compared to G gene at both nucleotide (nt) and amino acid (aa) levels (F gene, nt: 88.7% and aa: 75.9% vs G gene: nt: 54.3% and aa: 27.6%, respectively) ( Table 1) . Sequences within the novel sub-lineage of A2 were highly identical at both nucleotide and amino acid levels in both F and G genes (F gene, nt: 99.1% and aa: 97.5% and G gene: nt: 95.7% and aa: 95.5%). Next, we estimated the inter-genotype mean genetic distances of the HMPV genotypes and sub-lineages (Table 2) . Sub-lineage distances between genotypes A and B were high in both F and G genes, estimated around 17.7-19.3% and 77.8-88.3%, respectively. Sub-lineage distances within genotype were estimated around 5.9-7.5% and 22.6-26.9% in the F and G genes, respectively. Within A2, genetic distances between sub-lineages A2a and A2b were 3.8% in the F gene and 13.0% in the G gene. Notably, the genetic distances between these sub-lineages and the novel sub-lineage of A2 were similar or higher, estimated around 3.6-4.4% and 11.9-12.9% in both the F and G genes, respectively. Specific amino acid substitutions were also present within the novel sub-lineage of A2 in the G protein, but not in the F gene. In comparison with A2a and A2b sub-lineages, eleven specific amino acid substitutions in the novel sub-lineage of A2 were identified at positions 40, 59, 93, 106, 148, 164, 188, 197, 199 , 216 and 227 (Table 3) . Taken together, based on the phylogenetic tree topology, genetic distances and specific amino acid substitution analyses in both the F and G genes, the newly identified sub-lineage was distinct from the previously described A2a and A2b sub-lineages.

In order to elucidate the dynamics of HMPV transmission among the adults and children population in the present study, we constructed transmission networks based on the pairwise distances using the TN93 model estimated from the newly-sequenced F and G genes. The lower 0.025 percentile of the inter-person genetic distances from database sequences, which represented the patristic distance cutoff for transmission cluster interpretation, were estimated at 0.2% and 1.2% for the F and G genes, respectively (Supplementary Table 1 ). In the F gene data set, 19 sequences (22.4%, 19/85) formed a total of nine clusters (comprising of eight dyads and one network) while in the G gene, 11 sequences (13.4%, 11/82) formed a total of five clusters (comprising of four dyads and one network), ranging between two and three individuals in size (Fig. 4A ). Of these clusters, only two dyads and one network were concordant in both genes. Overall, more transmission clusters were observed in the A2b sub-lineage than other sub-lineages in both the F (57.9%, 11/19) and G (63.6%, 7/11) genes. A known transmission pair of two epidemiologically-linked adult and child infected with the novel A2 sub-lineage was also observed in the F (but not in the G) gene. HMPV has been reported to be highly infectious within the first 4-6 days of infection 28 , after which its ability to cause infection in another individual declines. Hence we proceed to estimate the difference between estimated date of infection (denoted as Δ EDI) between existing members of clusters observed in the F and G genes to evaluate the reliability of the genetic-based approach in inferring transmission network. We found that a majority of the clusters inferred in the F (8/9 clusters) and G genes (4/5 clusters) had Δ EDIs of ≤ 7 days which provided substantial validation of the method used in this study (Fig. 4A ). Of note, the frequency of transmission clusters identified during the study period coincided with an increase in the detection of the respective HMPV sub-lineages in the population, as observed in the A2b (between September 2012 and April 2013) and B1 (between March and April 2012) sub-lineages (Fig. 4A,B) . 

To date, most studies were focused on describing the molecular epidemiology of HMPV in hospitalised children 4,7,12,25,26 and consequently, knowledge regarding the prevalence and genotypic distribution among the general population of all ages are limited 6, 29 . In addition, the seasonality and dynamics of disease transmission in countries with a tropical climate have not been analysed in detail. In the present study, we reported the recent molecular epidemiology of HMPV in an outpatient population of adults and children presented with symptoms of acute URTI in Kuala Lumpur during a two-year period. From 3,935 nasopharyngeal swabs collected between 2012 and 2014, the average prevalence of HMPV in the population was fairly low at around 2%, similar to previous studies conducted across all ages 6 . Conversely, HMPV was more prevalent among children in the hospitalised or community setting, with a reported prevalence of over 5% particularly among the young and immunocompromised children 1, 3, 4, 25, 30 . Although the overall prevalence of HMPV infection was low in our study population, a relatively higher monthly prevalence of up to 4-5% was observed during the November-April period (Fig. 1) , coincided with the northeast monsoon season which typically occurs in the region between October and March. We also showed that the prevalence of HMPV was significantly correlated with high relative humidity and the number of rainy days.

Throughout the study period, both HMPV genotypes A and B, including three known sub-lineages -A2b, B1 and B2 co-circulated all year round. Meanwhile, sub-lineages A1 and A2a were not detected in our study population. Similarly, sub-lineage A1 which circulated in China 31 , was also not detected in the neighbouring regions including Cambodia 6 , Thailand 8 and Singapore 4 ; and worldwide after 2006, in Austria 13 , Argentina 32 , Australia 33 , Canada 12 , and the United States 34, 35 . On the other hand, sub-lineage A2a circulated widely at a low prevalence in other countries including Thailand 8 and Canada 36 . Both A2b and B1 circulated predominantly in the population, with a combined prevalence of around 60% (Fig. 3) . We also observed a shift in the predominant circulating genotype from sub-lineage B1 to A2b in the population between 2012 and 2013, although a longer study period with more samples may be required to provide an accurate representation. Recently, genotype A2 has been associated with a more severe disease in hospitalised children in Jordan and Cambodia 6, 37 . Further studies to assess the impact of HMPV genotypes on disease severity are warranted. In addition to the known sub-lineages, a previously unreported sub-lineage of A2 was identified at a lower prevalence at around 19% in the population. Phylogenetic and pairwise distance analyses of the F and G genes sequence data including all publicly available global reference sequences confirmed the novelty of the sub-lineage which was distinct from other known sub-lineages within A2, such as A2a and A2b (Fig. 2, Table 2 ). More than half of the F and G sequences previously amplified among Malaysian children between 2010 and December 2012 7 were grouped within the novel sub-lineage of A2. Furthermore, several reference F and G gene sequences isolated from neighbouring countries including Vietnam, Cambodia and China, sampled between 2006 and 2011 also clustered with the Malaysian sequences within the novel sub-lineage of A2 and further suggesting that the novel sub-lineage of A2 might have been circulating in the region at a lower prevalence earlier (Fig. 2) . Further studies however are 

required to estimate its time of emergence in our study population and whether the proposed novel sub-lineage of A2 is also circulating in other regions besides Southeast and East Asia. Complete genome sequencing followed by rigorous phylogenetic and genetic distance analyses of the novel sub-lineage of A2 are necessary to confirm its assignment as a distinct sub-lineage. Analysis of epidemiological data is generally useful to estimate the temporal prevalence and seasonality of a viral pathogen. However the inclusion of transmission network information could elucidate the spread and dynamics of a disease attributed to specific genotypes or sub-lineages circulating in the population that further corroborate the observation from epidemiological surveillance of a disease. Using programming language-based approach, we inferred the transmission network of HMPV in the population based on the genetic sequences of the F and G genes. To the best of our knowledge, such analysis represents the first of which the spread and dynamics of HMPV transmission in the general population was mapped. Using the estimated cutoffs for the pairwise genetic distance between HMPV sequences and the EDI between individuals, below which individuals were classified as a transmission cluster, we identified up to nine transmission clusters (in the F gene) of HMPV circulating in the cohort between 2012 and 2014 (Fig. 4A) . The size of these clusters was generally small (dyads) and involved various HMPV sub-lineages, suggesting the presence of multiple sub-epidemics in the population with no apparent evidence of a major outbreak. Nonetheless, the increased frequency of transmission clusters correlated with the incidence of HMPV detection (Fig. 3B) , indicating the potential roles of transmission clusters in driving the spread of respiratory infections. We were also able to estimate the directionality of viral transmission between individuals within the cluster, which allows the identification of the putative donor/recipient that may be important in facilitating efforts to minimize forward transmission 18 . Nevertheless, it is important to note that the transmission clusters inferred herein reflected the genetic relatedness of the viral sequences and their direction of transmission, without implying an actual (direct) viral transmission between clustered individuals 18, 19, 24 .

In order to understand the potential transmission and spread of infectious diseases such as the pandemic influenza, there has been a considerable amount of research on the role of social contact network in spreading a disease within the community. These studies used conceptualized frameworks 38 or computational models 39 to investigate the social contact network among schoolchildren and teenagers, and simulate how network interventions can significantly contain the spread of influenza within a community. However, most studies relied on the use of survey and contact diaries method which are laborious and often unreliable due to self-report inaccuracies, such as incomplete or illegible survey forms 38 and failure to recall their network members precisely 40 . Therefore, our method presents a simple and unbiased approach to construct the transmission network based on the clustering of genetically-related viral strains sequenced from the infected individuals.

Although the potential use of transmission cluster in understanding HMPV spread has been demonstrated here, limitation does exist in the analysis, such as the lack of vital epidemiological information and the observed Table 3 . Lineage-specific amino acid substitutions within the human metapneumovirus (HMPV) sublineages of A2 in the attachment (G) protein open reading frame between position 14 and 228 a . a The position of amino acid was determined according to HMPV reference genotype A2, AY304360 HMPV NL/17/00/A2a. discordant clustering generated by different genetic regions. Firstly, to improve the cluster resolution and minimize potential discrepancies in the analysis, estimated clusters should be interpreted in parallel with information of contact history among members of a cluster, if available 41 . Likewise, the suitability of a genetic region can be determined through known transmission pairs sampled from well-documented outbreaks by assessing the reproducibility of the cluster features using multiple partial and even the complete genomes. In addition, although cluster overestimation may be unlikely in our analysis where the upper distance cutoffs were set below the lower 0.025 percentile of inter-person genetic distances 24, 42 , the availability of the intra-person genetic distances will nonetheless provide a better clue on the lower distance cutoffs. Due to the interim and self-limiting nature of the infection, it is indeed a challenge to collect serial samples throughout acute illness, which will not immediately benefit the patients. Lastly, as in many other molecular epidemiological surveillance studies, only a subset of the population was recruited and analysed. Therefore, the size, frequency and structure of the transmission clusters observed could have been more accurate by increasing the sample size involving more recruitment sites (but not necessarily longer study duration).

In summary, the present study characterised the recent prevalence, seasonality and genetic diversity of HMPV in a large outpatient population presented with acute respiratory tract infections in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. The incorporation of transmission network analysis further demonstrated a deeper understanding of HMPV transmission dynamics in the population. Due to the epidemiological impact of HMPV in causing acute respiratory infections, continuous molecular surveillance is warranted to inform the development of therapeutic and preventive approaches, and to facilitate the monitoring of disease outbreaks in the population.

Ethics statement. The study was approved by the University Malaya Medical Centre (UMMC) Medical Ethics Committee. Standard, multilingual consent forms allowed by the Medical Ethics Committee were used and written consent was obtained from all study participants. All experiments were performed in accordance with approved guidelines and regulations.

Study population and sample collection. Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from adults and children (aged 18 years and below) attending the primary care clinic in UMMC, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia for a period of 28 months between February 2012 and May 2014. Eligible individuals were those who experienced symptoms of acute upper RTIs (URTI) for not more than two weeks at the time of study recruitment, defined as the presence of either sneezing, nasal discharge/congestion, headache, sore throat, hoarseness of voice, muscle ache and cough, as implemented in other studies on both naturally acquired and experimental colds [43] [44] [45] [46] . The estimated number of days since the development of first disease symptom (estimated days after disease onset) was recorded. Nasopharyngeal swabs were stored in universal transport medium (Copan Diagnostics, California, USA) and transported to the laboratory for immediate processing.

Detection of human metapneumovirus. Total viral nucleic acid was extracted from 200 μ L of specimen using the NucliSENS easyMAG automated platform (bioMerieux, Durham, North Carolina, USA) according to the manufacturer's recommendation. One-step multiplex PCR was performed using the xTAG Respiratory Viral Panel (RVP) FAST Assay (Luminex Molecular Diagnostics Inc., Toronto, Canada) according to the manufacturer's recommendation 47 . An internal positive control (Escherichia coli phage MS2) and a positive run control (bacteriophage lambda DNA) were included to monitor the assay performance. The resulting median fluorescence intensities were analysed using the Luminex 200 IS platform (Luminex Molecular Diagnostics Inc.).

Amplification and sequencing of the F and G genes. Viral RNA from HMPV-positive samples was reverse-transcribed to cDNA using SuperScript III RNase H − Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, California, USA) and random hexamers (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, California, USA). The partial F open reading frame (ORF) (550 bp) and the complete G ORF (580-889 bp) of HMPV were amplified using primers as described previously 10 using BIO-X-ACT Short DNA Polymerase enzyme (Bioline Reagents Ltd, UK) under the following thermocycling conditions: initial denaturation at 95 °C for 5 minutes, followed by 35 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 30 seconds, annealing at 55 °C for 1 minute and elongation at 72 °C for 1 minute, and a final elongation step at 72 °C for 10 minutes. Overall, two separate sets of nested primers were used to amplify the G genes. For specimens that failed to be amplified, we used the following sets of newly designed nested primers: outer primers set F1_6206, 5′-AAAACAARAAWATGGGACAAG-3′ and R1_7176, 5′-TCAGGRAGATARACATTRACAG-3′ ; and inner primers set F2_6258, 5′ -RGCRAYWGACATGYTCAAAG-3′ and R3_7139, 5′ -GATCCATTGYYATTTRTCYC-3′ . Population sequencing was performed in both directions using an ABI PRISM 3730XL DNA Analyzer with BigDye terminators (Applied Biosystems). The newly-generated F and G gene sequences in this study were submitted in GenBank (accession numbers: KU254673 to KU254757 and KU320892 to KU320973).

Phylogenetic and sequence analysis. Global (n = 214) and regional (n = 170) published nucleotide sequences of HMPV F and G genes were retrieved from the GenBank database and aligned with the newly-generated sequences using the PRANK algorithm available on the GUIDANCE server 48, 49 . In addition, 21 HMPV F and G sequences amplified among paediatrics diagnosed with acute lower RTIs by our laboratory were also included in the phylogenetic analysis (GenBank accession numbers: KJ196300 to KJ1963023 and KT852792 to KT852803). These samples were collected between April 2010 and December 2012 and were laboratory-confirmed as HMPV-positive by direct fluorescent-antibody staining and/or virus culture, as described previously 7 . Reference strains of HMPV genotype A and B sub-lineages comprising AF371337 HMPV NL/1/00/A1, AY297749 HMPV CA/83/97/A2a, AY530095 HMPV JP/240/03/A2b, GQ153651 HMPV CN/gz01/08/A2, AY525843 HMPV NL/1/99/B1 and GQ153651 HMPV CA/75/98/B2 were included 1,12 . Phylogenetic trees were constructed by the neighbour joining method based on the Kimura two-parameter model with a transition-transversion ratio of 2.0 implemented in MEGA 5.05 50 . The reliability and robustness of the branching orders were analysed by bootstrap analysis of 1,000 replicates. The mean genetic distances of nucleotide and amino acid sequences within and between genotypes/sub-lineage were estimated using the Kimura two-parameter model in MEGA.

HMPV transmission network. The HMPV transmission network was inferred from the newly-sequenced F and G genes based on the Tamura-Nei 93 (TN93) pairwise distance estimates 51 performed using a custom script in Python (release 3.2.6) with 1,000 bootstrap replicates. A transmission cluster is characterised by the presence of at least two individuals (represented by nodes) whose viral sequences are genetically linked (represented by edges) at a given genetic distance threshold or cutoff 18, 19 . The genetic distance cutoff values can be determined between the highest and lowest values of intra-and inter-person distances (known as the patristic distances), respectively 24, 42 . However, since HMPV is associated with acute infection, measuring intra-person viral genetic distance is often challenging and impractical due to rapid viral clearance within a host. We therefore estimated the most probable cutoff values by determining the lower 0.025 percentile of the inter-person genetic distances calculated from the global F (n = 66) and G (n = 45) reference sequences representing all known genotypes and sub-lineages. Sequences from different individuals with genetic distance falling below these cutoffs were classified as transmission cluster. Clusters were described as dyads if they contain two nodes, and network if > 2 nodes 19 . The estimated date of infection (EDI) for each individual was predated from the number of days after disease symptoms onset as reported by the patients and the incubation period of 4-6 days for HMPV 28 . Difference between EDI for each individual was denoted as Δ EDI. In addition to genetic distance cutoff, adjacent nodes with a Δ EDI of less than 30 days were considered in cluster construction (viral shedding beyond 30 days following primary infection is probably uncommon, hence viral transmission may be very limited or absent). Such criterion was used for an acute infection in order to improve the analytical power of cluster determination by effectively eliminating genetically similar but epidemiologically unrelated viruses that may complicate transmission cluster interpretation. Probable direction of virus transmission within a cluster was also estimated by placing a directed edge from the putative ""donor"" node to the ""recipient"" node(s), where the EDI donor is older than the EDI recipient 18 .

"Genomic analysis of codon usage shows influence of mutation pressure, natural selection, and host features on Marburg virus evolution","Background: The Marburg virus (MARV) has a negative-sense single-stranded RNA genome, belongs to the family Filoviridae, and is responsible for several outbreaks of highly fatal hemorrhagic fever. Codon usage patterns of viruses reflect a series of evolutionary changes that enable viruses to shape their survival rates and fitness toward the external environment and, most importantly, their hosts. To understand the evolution of MARV at the codon level, we report a comprehensive analysis of synonymous codon usage patterns in MARV genomes. Multiple codon analysis approaches and statistical methods were performed to determine overall codon usage patterns, biases in codon usage, and influence of various factors, including mutation pressure, natural selection, and its two hosts, Homo sapiens and Rousettus aegyptiacus.","The Marburg virus (MARV) is a negative-sense singlestranded RNA virus with a genome size of 19 kb that encodes seven genes in a linear order. MARV belongs to family Filoviridae, which also includes the highly pathogenic Ebola virus (EBOV). The first documented evidence of MARV was in 1967 in laboratory workers and scientists at facilities in Germany and the former Yugoslavia via infected monkeys that were imported from north-western Uganda [1] . MARV is a zoonotic virus and has been detected in both infected and healthy Egyptian fruit bats (Rousettus aegyptiacus) in endemic areas in Africa; therefore, R. aegyptiacus are considered as its natural host. This is most likely the reason that MARV outbreaks have been mostly associated with individuals such as mine workers or tourists in the regions that these bats inhabit [2] . The typical symptoms include general malaise, acute fever, abdominal cramping, bleeding disorders, and shock [3] . Similar to its highly pathogenic cousin EBOV that is the cause of a recent ongoing outbreak, MARV also causes fatal viral hemorrhagic fever in humans and non-human primates with a fatality rate of up to 90 %. Therefore, there is a need for a detailed understanding of replication and evolution of this virus [3] [4] [5] .

It is known that the genetic code shows redundancy and most of the amino acids can be translated by more than one codon. This redundancy represents a key step in modulating the efficiency and accuracy of protein production while maintaining the same amino acid sequence of the protein. Alternative codons within the same group that codes for the same amino acid are often termed 'synonymous' codons, although their corresponding tRNAs might differ in relative abundance in cells and in the speed by which they are recognized by the ribosome. However, the synonymous codons are not randomly chosen within and between genomes, which is referred to as codon usage bias [6, 7] . This phenomenon has been observed in a wide range of organisms, from prokaryotes to eukaryotes and viruses. Studies on codon usage have identified several factors that could influence codon usage patterns, including mutation pressure, natural or translational selection, secondary protein structure, replication and selective transcription, hydrophobicity and hydrophilicity of the protein, and the external environment [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] . Moreover, considering the virus's genome size and other viral features, such as dependence on host's machinery for key processes, including replication, protein synthesis, and transmission, compared with prokaryotic and eukaryotic genomes, the interplay of codon usage among viruses and their hosts is expected to affect overall viral survival, fitness, evasion from host's immune system, and evolution [11, 14] . Therefore, knowledge of codon usage in viruses can reveal information about molecular evolution as well as improve our understanding of the regulation of viral gene expression and aid in vaccine design, where efficient expression of viral proteins may be required to generate immunity.

In the present study, we report genome-wide comprehensive analyses of codon usage and various factors that have contributed to the molecular evolution in MARV.

The complete genome sequences of 63 MARV strains were obtained from the National Center for Biotechnology (NCBI) GenBank database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). The accession numbers and demographics of the selected MARV genomes are provided in Additional file 1: Table S1 .

Identification of potential recombinant events in the MARV genomes were determined with the Recombination Detection Program (RDP) 4 Beta (version 4.27) software suite [15] , which incorporates several phylogeneticsubstitution and distance-based methods, including GENECONV [16] , RDP [17] , MaxChi [18] , Chimaera [19] , Bootscan [20] , SiScan [21] , 3Seq [22] , and LARD [23] . The P-value cut-off was set to 0.05 in all analyses, and the Bonferroni correction was applied. The default settings were used for all analyses.

The following compositional properties were calculated for the coding sequences of MARV genomes: (i) overall frequency of occurrence of the nucleotides (A%, C%, T/U%, and G%); (ii) frequency of each nucleotide at the third site of the synonymous codons (A 3S %, C 3S %, U 3S %, and G 3S %); (iii) frequencies of occurrence of nucleotides G + C at the first (GC 1S ), second (GC 2S ), and third synonymous codon positions (GC 3S ); (iv) mean frequencies of nucleotides G + C at the first and second position (GC 1,2S ); and (v) overall GC and AU content. The codons AUG and UGG are the only codons for Met and Trp, respectively, and the termination codons UAA, UAG, and UGA do not encode any amino acids. Therefore, these five codons are not expected to exhibit any usage bias and were therefore excluded from the analysis.

The RSCU values for all of the coding sequences of MARV genomes were calculated to determine the characteristics of synonymous codon usage without the confounding influence of amino acid composition and coding sequence size of different gene samples following a previously described method [24] . The RSCU index was calculated as follows:

where g ij is the observed number of the ith codon for the jth amino acid, which has n i kinds of synonymous codons. RSCU values represent the ratio between the observed usage frequency of one codon in a gene sample and the expected usage frequency in the synonymous codon family, given that all codons for the particular amino acid are used equally. The synonymous codons with RSCU values > 1.0 have positive codon usage bias and were defined as abundant codons, whereas those with RSCU values < 1.0 have negative codon usage bias and were defined as less-abundant codons. When the RSCU value is 1.0, it means there is no codon usage bias for that amino acid and the codons are chosen equally or randomly [25] . Moreover, the synonymous codons with RSCU values > 1.6 and < 0.6 were treated as over-represented and under-represented codons, respectively [26] .

CAI analysis is a quantitative method that predicts the expression level of a gene based on its coding sequence. CAI values range from 0 to 1. The most frequent codons have the highest relative adaptiveness towards its host, and sequences with higher CAIs are suggested to be preferred over those with lower CAIs [27] . The CAI analysis for MARV genes was performed using CAIcal server [28] . The synonymous codon usage patterns of the viral hosts (H. sapiens and R. aegyptiacus) were used as references. Non-synonymous codons and termination codons were excluded from the calculation. The reference datasets for H. sapiens and R. aegyptiacus were obtained from the Codon Usage Database [29] . The correlation analysis between CAI and ENC values was performed to determine the relative influence of mutation and selection. If selection is preferred over mutation, the correlation (r) between the two quantities should be very high (r → −1). In contrast, if mutation force is more important, r should approach 0 (no correlation) [30, 31] .

ENC analysis was used to quantify the absolute codon usage bias by evaluating the degree of codon usage bias exhibited by the MARV coding sequences, regardless of gene length and the number of amino acids. ENC values range from 20, which indicates extreme codon usage bias using only one of the possible synonymous codons for the corresponding amino acid, to 61, which indicates no bias using all possible synonymous codons equally for the corresponding amino acid. The larger the extent of codon preference in a gene, the smaller the ENC value. It is also generally accepted that genes have a significant codon bias when the ENC value is less than or equal to 35 [32, 33] . ENC was calculated using the following formula:

Where F k (k = 2, 3, 4, 6) is the mean of F k values for the k-fold degenerate amino acids, which is estimated using the following formula:

where n is the total number of occurrences of the codons for that amino acid and

where n i is the total number of occurrences of the ith codon for that amino acid. Genes for which the codon choice is only constrained by a mutation bias will lie on or just below the curve of the expected ENC values. Therefore, to elucidate the relationship between GC 3S and ENC values, the expected ENC values for different GC 3S were calculated as follows:

where s represents the given GC 3S % [32] .

PCA is a multivariate statistical method that is used to explore the relationships between variables and samples.

In the present study, PCA was used to analyze the major trends in codon usage patterns among MARVs coding sequences. PCA involves a mathematical procedure that transforms correlated variables (RSCU values) into a smaller number of uncorrelated variables called principal components. To minimize the effect of amino acid composition on codon usage, each coding sequence was represented as a 59 dimensional vector, and each dimension corresponded to the RSCU value of each sense codon, which only included synonymous codons for a particular amino acid excluding the codons AUG, UGG, and the three stop codons.

The neutrality plot or neutral evolution analysis was performed to determine and compare the extent of influence of mutation pressure and natural selection on the codon usage patterns of MARV by plotting the P 12 (GC 1,2S ) values of the synonymous codons against the P 3 (GC 3S ) values. In the plot, the regression coefficient against P 3 is regarded as the mutation-selection equilibrium coefficient and the evolutionary speed of the mutation pressure and natural selection pressure is expressed as the slope of a regression line. If all of the points lie along the diagonal distribution, no significant difference exists at the three codon positions, and there is no or weak external selection pressure. Alternatively, if the regression curve tends to be sloped or parallel to the horizontal axis, it means that the variation correlation between GC 1,2S and GC 3S is very low. Therefore, the regression curve effectively measures the degree of neutrality when selecting the effect that dominates evolution.

The Parity rule 2 (PR2) plot analysis was performed to investigate the impact of mutation and selection pressure on codon usage of genes. PR2 is a plot of AU-bias [A 3 /(A 3 + U 3 )] as the ordinate and GC-bias [G 3 /(G 3 + C 3 )] as the abscissa at the third codon position of the four-codon amino acids of entire genes. In this plot, the center of the plot, where both coordinates are 0.5, is the place where A = U and G = C (PR2), with no biasness between influence of mutation and selection rates (substitution rates) [34, 35] .

The RSCU values of MARVs and its two hosts, H. sapiens and R. aegyptiacus, were compared to determine influence of the host. The codon usage data of H. sapiens and R. aegyptiacus were obtained from the Codon Usage Database [29] . Furthermore, the influence of the overall codon usage patterns of hosts on the formation of the overall codon usage of viruses, defined as the similarity index D(A,B) [36] , was calculated as follows:

where R(A,B) is defined as a cosine value of an included angle between A and B spatial vectors and represents the degree of similarity between MARV and host overall codon usage pattern. a i is defined as the RSCU value for a specific codon among 59 synonymous codons of MARV coding sequence. b i is termed as the RSCU value for the same codon of the host. D(A,B) represents the potential effect of the overall codon usage of the host on that of MARV, and its value ranges from 0 to 1.0 [36] .

The relative abundance of dinucleotides in the coding regions of MARV genomes was calculated using a previously described method [37] . A comparison of actual and expected dinucleotide frequencies of the 16 dinucleotides in coding regions of MARV was also undertaken. The odds ratio was calculated using the following formula:

where f x denotes the frequency of nucleotide X, f y denotes the frequency of nucleotide Y, f y f x denotes the expected frequency of the dinucleotide XY, and f xy the frequency of the dinucleotide XY. This was calculated for each dinucleotide. As a conservative criterion, for P xy > 1.23 or < 0.78, the XY pair is considered to be over-represented or under-represented, respectively, in terms of relative abundance compared with a random association of mononucleotides.

Correlation analysis was carried out to identify the relationships between nucleotide composition, PCA, and codon usage patterns of MARV using Spearman's rank correlation analysis. All statistical analyses were carried out using SPSS 17 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) for Windows.

It has been previously shown that occurrence of recombination events at either gene or genome levels can influence codon usage bias patterns. For example, recombination can influence the effect of natural selection on codon usage [38] [39] [40] [41] . Therefore, to avoid influence of recombination on codon analysis, we first performed recombination analysis on the 63 MARV genomes. No evidence of recombination was found among MARV genomes. Therefore, coding sequences of all 63 of the initially selected MARV genomes were included in codon usage analysis as discussed in following sections.

To determine the potential impact of nucleotide constraints on codon usage, nucleotide composition analysis was performed. It was found that the A and U nucleotides were most abundant in MARV coding sequences with a mean composition of 31.9 and 27.7 %, respectively, compared with C (20.8 %) and G (19.6 %). The nucleotide composition at the third position of synonymous codons (A 3S , U 3S , G 3S , C 3S ) showed that the mean A 3S (31.3 %) and U 3S (33.0 %) were also highest compared with G 3S (17.7 %) and C 3S (18 %) ( Table 1 ). The mean AU and GC compositions were determined to be 59.6 and 40.4 %, respectively, highlighting that there is an AU-rich composition of MARV coding sequences. The analysis of nucleotide composition at first, second, and third positions of synonymous codons showed that GC 1S values ranged from 46.3 to 46.7 %, with a mean of 46.5 % and standard deviation (SD) of 0.12. GC 2S values ranged from 38.8 to 39.1%, with a mean of 39.0 % and an SD 0.08. GC 1,2S values ranged from 42.6 to 42.8 %, with an average of 42.7 % and SD of 0.05. In the case of GC 3S , the values ranged from 35.1 to 36.3 %, with a mean of 35.67 % and SD of 0.36; alternatively, the AU 3S values ranged from 63.6 to 65.0 %, with a mean of 64.33 % and an SD of 0.36. These data confirmed that a substantial portion of MARV coding sequences are composed of A and U nucleotides (Table 1) .

The patterns of synonymous codon usage in MARV coding sequences were assessed by RSCU analysis. All of the 18 most abundantly used codons for their corresponding amino acids in MARV coding sequences were A/U-ended and exhibited an equal distribution of A and U (A-ended: 9; U-ended: 9) ( Table 2 , Additional file 2: Figure S1 ). Analysis of over-and under-representation of codons showed that four out of 18 preferred codons had RSCU values >1.6. These are UUA(L), ACA(T), UCA(S), and AGA(R), whereas the RSCU values of the remaining preferred codons were also found to be >0.6 and <1.6. However, the under-represented (RSCU <0.6) and nonpreferred codons were all G/C-ended (Table 2) . Nucleotide composition and RSCU analyses showed that selection of the preferred codons has been mostly influenced by compositional constraints (A and U in this case), which accounts for the presence of mutation pressure.

To estimate the degree of codon usage bias within coding sequences of different isolates of MARV, ENC were calculated. The ENC values among MARV coding sequences ranged from 53.4 to 54.9, with a mean of 54.2 (ENC > 40) and an SD of 0.35 (Table 1) , indicating a relatively stable and conserved genomic composition among different MARV coding sequences.

To determine the trends in codon usage variation among coding sequences of different MARV isolates, we performed PCA on the RSCU values, which were examined as a single dataset (Fig. 1a) . The first principal axis (f' 1 ) accounted for 65.55 % of the total variation, and the next three axes (f' 2 -f' 4 ) accounted for 14.17, 10.48, and 2.36 % of the total variation in synonymous codon usage, respectively. Next, we plotted principal axes based on geographical locations of MARV isolates (Fig. 1b) . Three separate clusters were observed. Cluster A, which formed the largest cluster, consisted of isolates from the Demographic Republic of Congo (DRC), Uganda, and a single isolate from South Africa. The DRC isolates formed the majority of Cluster A. Cluster B was dominated by isolates from Uganda, Kenya, and a single isolate from DRC, whereas Cluster C consisted of all of the isolates from Angola and single isolates from Germany, the Netherlands, Uganda, and DRC.

To determine whether the biased codon choices are restricted to highly biased genes, the relation between A and U content and G and C content in four-fold degenerate codon families (alanine, arginine, glycine, leucine, proline, serine, threonine and valine) were analyzed by PR2 plot (Fig. 2) . It was found that A and U were used more frequently than G and C in MARV four fold degenerate codon families. This shows that preference towards codon To determine whether the patterns of codon usage have been influenced by mutation pressure, ENC-plot, correlation, linear regression and neutrality plot analyses were performed. In case of ENC-plot, The GC 3S values were plotted against ENC, which showed that all spots clustered slightly below on the left side of the expected curve (Fig. 3) . This indicates that mutational pressure has dominated in shaping codon usage patterns of MARVs.

In the next step, correlation analysis among the nucleotide compositions, codon compositions, and ENC values was performed (Table 3) . Several strong and significant correlations (P < 0.01; P < 0.05) were observed between nucleotide compositions and codon compositions. GC and GC 1,2S were also compared with GC 3S and highly significant positive correlations (GC 1,2S versus GC 3S : r = 0.747, P < 0.01; GC versus GC 3S : r = 0.828, P < 0.01) were observed. Furthermore, a significant positive correlation between GC 3S and ENC values (r = 0.424, P < 0.001) as well as a significantly negative correlation between AU 3S and In addition to correlation analysis, linear regression analysis was also performed to determine correlations between f' 1 and f' 2 and nucleotide constraints of MARV genomes (Table 4 ). In agreement to above findings, significant correlations were observed between both axes and compositional quantities indicating that mutation pressure has played a major role in shaping the dynamics of codon usage patterns within MARV genomes.

A neutrality plot was constructed between P 12 (GC 1,2S ) and P 3 (GC 3S ) values to determine the extent of variation between mutation pressure and natural selection (Fig. 4) . A significant positive correlation (r = 0.747, P < 0.01) was found between P 12 and P 3 values with a correlation coefficient of 0.926 ± 0.067, suggesting that the effect of 

To determine the potential influence of natural selection, linear regression analysis was performed between General average hydropathicity (GRAVY) and aromaticity (ARO) values and the f' 1 , f' 2 , ENC, GC, and GC 3S values to investigate the influence of natural selection on MARV codon usage patterns. The correlations of both GRAVY and ARO with f' 1 were non-significant, whereas GRAVY and ARO showed significant positive and negative correlations with f' 2 , respectively. Furthermore, it was found that GRAVY had significantly positive correlations with ENC, GC 3S , and GC values, whereas ARO had significant negative correlations with GC 3S and GC and non-significant correlations with the ENC value ( Table 5 ). The non-significant correlation of both GRAVY and ARO with f' 1 , which accounts for 65.55 % of the total variation, shows that natural selection has contributed to some extent; however, it is not the most substantial influencing factor on MARV codon usage patterns.

In order to determine codon usage optimization and adaptation of MARV to its hosts, CAI analysis was performed. A mean CAI of 0.712 was obtained for MARV genes in relation to H. sapiens, while a mean CAI of 0.534 was obtained in relation to R. aegyptiacus (Additional file 3: Table S2 ). There was a trend for a lower CAI values for MARV in relation to R. aegyptiacus, with the consequent lower efficiency of protein synthesis in R. aegyptiacus. Furthermore, correlation was investigated between CAI and ENC values to examine the relative influence of mutation pressure and natural selection. The CAI values of MARV genes in relation to H. sapiens and R. aegyptiacus were found to be 

To study the possible effect of dinucleotides on codon usage, we calculated the relative abundances of the 16 dinucleotides from the MARV coding sequences. The occurrence of dinucleotides was found to be non-random, and only CpU was present at the expected frequencies (i.e., 1.0) ( Table 6 ). Furthermore, only CpA was overrepresented and showed marginal over-representation (1.23 ± 0.01). CpG (mean ± SD = 0.51 ± 0.01) and GpC (mean ± SD = 0.90 ± 0.03) were both under-represented.

The analysis of RSCU values of both CpG-containing codons (CCG, GCG, UCG, ACG, CGC, CGG, CGU, and CGA) and GpC-containing codons (GCU, GCC, GCA, UGC, AGC, and GGC) showed that all codons were also under-represented (RSCU < 0.6) and were not preferred codons for their respective amino acids ( Table 2 ). Similar to CpG and GpC, the relative abundance of UpA also deviated from the ""normal range"" (mean ± SD = 0.69 ± 0.01) and was under-represented. Except for UUA (RSCU = 1.72), which is a preferred codon for the amino acid leucine, the remaining five UpA containing codons (CUA, GUA, UAU, UAC, and AUA) were under-represented (RSCU < 0.6) and not preferred codons. Five (UCA, ACA, GCA, CAA, and CAU) out of eight codons that contain CpA (CCA, CAG, and CAC) were also over-represented and preferred codons compared with the rest of the codons for their respective amino acids (Table 2) . Correlation between the relative abundance of dinucleotides with the f' 1 and f' 2 was also investigated. Fourteen and 12 out of 16 dinucleotides Table 3 Summary of correlation analysis between nucleotide constraints in MARV genomes The numbers in the each column represent correlation coefficient ""r"" values, which are calculated in each correlation analysis NS non-significant (P > 0.05) *represents 0.01 < P < 0.05 **represents P < 0.01 The numbers in the each column represents correlation coefficient ""r"" values, which are calculated in each correlation analysis NS non-significant (P > 0.05) *represents 0.01 < P < 0.05 **represents P < 0.01 (Table 6 ).

To determine the influence of host on MARV codon usage patterns, the codon usage of MARV isolates was compared with that of its two hosts, H. sapiens and R. aegyptiacus, via comparison of RSCU values. The results showed that the codon usage patterns and selection of preferred codons in MARV genomes is antagonist to both H. sapiens and R. aegyptiacus for majority of codons ( Table 2 ). The only exception was codon AGA, which was a preferred codon for the amino acid arginine in MARV and H. sapiens but not in R. aegyptiacus. Moreover, analysis of RSCU values in a heatmap also showed that the MARV RSCU values did not cluster along any of its hosts RSCU values (Additional file 4: Figure S2 ).

To determine how the overall codon usages of MARV's hosts have contributed to evolution of virus codon usage patterns, similarity index analysis was conducted. It was found that R. aegyptiacus exerted a more dominant effect on shaping MARV codon usage compared with that of H. sapiens, as the similarity index was found to be higher in R. aegyptiacus (Fig. 5 ).

In the present study, we analyzed synonymous codon usage in coding sequences from 63 MARV genomes to understand its molecular evolution under the influence of multiple viral, host, and environmental factors. It has previously been shown that codon usage bias, or preference for one type of codon over another, can be greatly influenced by overall genomic composition [42] . Nucleotide composition analysis showed that A and U nucleotides constitute the majority of overall nucleotide composition in MARV genomes ( Table 1) . The RSCU analysis also showed that MARV genomes exhibit greater codon usage bias toward A-and U-ended codons (Table 2) . Therefore, once it is established that there is codon bias toward A-and U-ended codons in MARV genomes, we next determined the extent of this bias within and in between different MARV isolates. This was accomplished by ENC analyses. In the case of MARV, the mean ENC value was found to be 54.2 in MARV coding sequences, which indicates slightly biased, relatively stable and conserved ARO aromaticity; NS non-significant (P > 0.05) *represents 0.01 < P < 0.05 **represents P < 0.01 Table 6 Summary of correlation analysis between the first two principal axes and relative abundance of dinucleotides in MARV genomes [46] , and West Nile virus (ENC: 53.81) [11] . A possible explanation given for this is that the low codon bias of RNA viruses might be advantageous for efficient replication in host cells by reducing the synthesis machinery competition between the virus and host with potentially distinct codon preferences. Whether the same holds true for MARVs as well, warrants further investigations. However, this can be attributed to the fact that MARVs maintain low yet surviving replication rate within in its natural host, R. aegyptiacus without causing any disease conditions [47] . Therefore, it seems that evolution of low codon bias within MARV coding sequences have enabled it to successfully maintain its survival cycle within both of its hosts each of which possess distinct codon usage preferences from that of MARV (Table 2) .

Considering the multivariate nature of codon usage, we next performed PCA analysis on RSCU values to determine the trends of codon usage variations that showed that f' 1 accounted for the major portion of codon usage variation followed by f' 2 . Moreover, MARV isolates formed three separate PCA clusters following distribution on principal axes. The clustering of diverse MARV lineages that are separated by thousands of miles within a single cluster as well as clustering of closely related lineages into different clusters highlights an important role of the mobility of MARV's natural host, R. aegyptiacus. This also indicates that the isolates of MARV might have independently evolved in three clusters after diverging from a common ancestor that potentially originated from DRC, based on inclusion of DRC isolates in all three clusters. Moreover, it appears that the geographical diversity and associated factors, such as presence of natural host within region of infection, climatic features, and host susceptibility, have contributed to shaping codon usage in MARV genomes.

Our initial analysis indicated influence of nucleotide constraints on MARV codon usage patterns. However, it has previously been shown that, although overall RSCU could reveal the codon usage pattern for genomes, it may hide the codon usage variation among different genes in a genome [48] , thereby indicating that composition frequencies of nucleotides are not always the only factor associated with codon usage patterns. The ENC plot is widely used to determine codon usage variation among genes in different organisms. It has been postulated that the ENC-plot of genes for which codon choice is constrained only by compositional constraints or mutation pressure will lie on the continuous curve of the predicted ENC values [32] . When the ENC and GC 3S values of MARVs were plotted, it was found that although none of the isolates fell on the expected continuous curve but clustered closely below the curve, thereby showing major influence of mutation pressure on MARV codon usage patterns and of natural selection to some extent. Besides that, it has also been reported previously that both mutation pressure and natural selection can influence the overall ENC and it might not be a robust index to show the relative contribution of mutation and selection on structuring codon usage patterns. Moreover, the codon usage bias of base composition of the genes of a species with A/U biased genomes will behave differentially than those species with G/C biased genomes, as such, ENC-GC 3S plot might be potentially misleading. In contrast, CAI is suggested as the most robust index for showing the influence of natural selection on codon usage patterns of such genes [27, 30, 31, 49] . CAI is regarded as a measure of gene expression and can be used to assess the adaptation of viral genes to their hosts. It has been postulated that the highly expressed genes exhibit a stronger bias for particular codons compared with genes that are less expressed. Compared with ENC, which is another way of calculating codon usage bias and measures deviation from a uniform bias (null hypothesis), CAI measures the deviation of a given protein coding gene sequence with respect to a reference set of genes [27] . If CAI value is high, then codon usage bias is extremely high and the influence of natural selection is prevailing. CAI values were calculated for MARV genes separately for both of its hosts. MARV genes showed higher CAI values for H. sapiens (0.712) as compared to R. aegyptiacus (0.534) indicating that natural selection from both hosts have influenced the codon usage patterns of MARV. Furthermore, comparative analysis of CAI values between MARV and its hosts suggests that MARV genes have optimized their codon usage patterns to utilize the translational resources of H. sapiens more efficiently than that of R. aegyptiacus. A higher CAI values of MARV genes for H. sapiens represents an interesting evolutionary step which might have supported MARV to turn out to be a highly pathogenic virus for H. sapiens and at the same time remaining completely harmless for its natural host, R. aegyptiacus.

Among multiple influencing factors, mutation pressure and natural selection are considered the two major factors that shape codon usage patterns [50] . A general mutation pressure that affects the whole genome would certainly account for the majority of the codon usage among certain RNA viruses [42] . The ENC and CAI analyses highlighted the influence of both mutation pressure and natural selection on codon usage patterns of MARV genes. In order to determine the share of each factor on evolution of MARV codon usage patterns, a neutrality plot analysis was performed which showed that influence of mutation pressure dominates over natural selection. Furthermore, we also examined the influence of mutation pressure on MARV codon usage via correlation and linear regression analyses between different nucleotide compositional constraints, ENC, and principal axes. Strong and significant correlations were observed, which indicates a dominant influence of mutation pressure. This was further supported when these indices were plotted against the first two principal axes via PCA, and significant strong correlations were observed. However, in the case of MARV genomes, involvement of factors other than mutation pressure such as natural selection cannot be ignored because nucleotide base compositions showed variation, distribution of MARV isolates were although close to but still below the expected curve on ENC plot, and there was a weak codon bias. A weak codon usage bias may be caused by natural selection when the viruses try to adapt to the host cell [51] [52] [53] . It has been suggested that, if synonymous codon usage bias is affected by mutation pressure alone, then the frequency of nucleotides A and U/T should be equal to that of C and G at the synonymous codon third position [53] . To test this phenomena in MARV, PR2 biasness plot analysis was performed on four fold degenerate codons. The occurrence frequency of AU and GC nucleotides at the synonymous codon third position was not found to be equal and AU biased preference was observed in four fold degenerate codons of MARV genes which indicates the potential influence of natural selection on codon usage patterns of MARV genes. In addition to this, correlation analysis between principal axes and GRAVY and ARO also revealed that, although natural selection has influenced MARV codon usage patterns to some extent, it is much weaker compared with mutation pressure.

Dinucleotide abundance has been reported to influence overall codon usage bias in several organisms, including DNA and RNA viruses [37, 54, 55] . Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9), which is a type of intracellular pattern recognition receptor (PRR), recognizes unmethylated CpGs, which leads to activation of several immune response pathways [56] . The vertebrate immune system relies on unmethylated CpG recognition in DNA molecules as a signature of infection, and CpG underrepresentation in RNA viruses is exclusively observed in vertebrate viruses; therefore, it is reasonable to suggest that a TLR9-like mechanism exists in the vertebrate immune system that recognizes CpGs when in an RNA context (such as in the genomes of RNA viruses) and triggers immune responses [57] . In contrast to the CpG usage of + ssRNA viruses that are greatly influenced by their hosts and because of which + ssRNA viruses mimic their hosts' CpG usage, -ssRNA viruses do not produce DNA intermediates during the replication of their genome. As a result, CpGs are under-represented, independent of the infected host or their phylogenetic relationship. The under-representation of CpG in -ssRNA viruses is therefore due to the U/A mutation bias in overall genomic composition that further indicates a dominating effect of mutation pressure [54, 58] . In the case of MARV, none of the dinucleotides were found at the expected frequencies and were also markedly underrepresented. As inferred from the RSCU analysis, codons containing CpG and UpA dinucleotides were also underrepresented and were not preferred codons for their respective amino acids within MARV genomes. These results collectively indicate that, although dinucleotide representation has some influence over the codon usage of MARVs, the overall influence is not strong because of exceptions among dinucleotide frequencies and selection of preferred codons in MARV genomes.

It has been previously shown that, among many other factors, the codon usage patterns of viruses are also affected by its hosts [59] . For example, the codon usage pattern of poliovirus is reported to be mostly coincident with that of its host [60] , whereas the codon usage pattern of hepatitis A was reported to be antagonistic to that of its host [61] . Alternatively, some viruses exhibit a mix of both coincidence and antagonism, such as the HCV [46] , enterovirus 71 [9] , and CHIKV [44] . However, MARV showed almost complete antagonism to both of its hosts, as inferred from the RSCU analysis with the exception for a common preferred codon for arginine between MARV and H. sapiens (Table 2) . A recent codon usage analysis in the EBOV, which is also from the same family as MARV and spread via bats, reported similar antagonism of RSCU toward its host, H. sapiens [43] . It has been proposed that the coincident portions of codon usage among viruses and their hosts could enable the corresponding amino acids to be efficiently translated, whereas the antagonistic portions of codon usage may enable viral proteins to be properly folded, although the translation efficiency of the corresponding amino acids might decrease [46] . Whether the same holds true for MARV warrants further investigations. In addition to the RSCU comparison analysis, we also performed a similarity index analysis to determine which of the MARV hosts have a dominant influence over its RSCU patterns. Evidence of selection pressure from both hosts was detected which is in agreement to the CAI analysis; however, level of pressure was significantly different. Compared with H. sapiens, R. aegyptiacus have a more profound effect on shaping MARV RSCU patterns, as inferred from the similarity index analysis. As R. aegyptiacus is consider as the natural reservoir and host for MARV, it makes sense that virus has evolved its genomic features to a stable level in order to better adapt to its primary host's environment. It has also been recently suggested that flight, a factor common to all bats but to no other mammals, provides an intensive selective force for coexistence with viral parasites through a daily cycle that elevates metabolism and body temperature analogous to the febrile response in other mammals. On an evolutionary scale, this hostvirus interaction might have resulted in the large diversity of zoonotic viruses in bats, possibly through bat viruses adapting to be more tolerant of the fever response and less virulent to their natural hosts [47] .

"Trypanosome species in neo-tropical bats: Biological, evolutionary and epidemiological implications","Bats (Chiroptera) are the only mammals naturally able to fly. Due to this characteristic they play a relevant ecological role in the niches they inhabit. These mammals spread infectious diseases from enzootic to domestic foci. Rabbies, SARS, fungi, ebola and trypanosomes are the most common pathogens these animals may host. We conducted intensive sampling of bats from the phyllostomidae, vespertilionidae and emballonuridae families in six localities from Casanare department in eastern Colombia. Blood-EDTA samples were obtained and subsequently submitted to analyses of mitochondrial and nuclear genetic markers in order to conduct barcoding analyses to discriminate trypanosome species. The findings according to the congruence of the three molecular markers suggest the occurrence of Trypanosoma cruzi cruzi (51%), T. c. marinkellei (9%), T. dionisii (13%), T. rangeli (21%), T. evansi (4%) and T. theileri (2%) among 107 positive bat specimens. Regarding the T. cruzi DTUs, we observed the presence of TcI (60%), TcII (15%), TcIII (7%), TcIV (7%) and TcBAT (11%) being the first evidence to our concern of the foreseen genotype TcBAT in Colombia. These results allowed us to propose reliable hypotheses regarding the ecology and biology of the bats circulating in the area including the enigmatic question whether TcBAT should be considered a novel DTU. The epidemiological and evolutionary implications of these findings are herein discussed.","Bats are considered the only mammals naturally capable of maintaining a stable flight. These organisms correspond to approximately 20% of known mammal species classified to date and divided into two suborders (megachiroptera and microchiroptera) (Teeling et al., 2005) . Most bats are considered insectivores, the rest are frugivores, fish-eaters and blood eaters (vampire bats). They play a relevant role in flower pollination and fruit seed dispersal (Hodgkison et al., 2003) . Bats are important components of neo-tropical communities as they occupy a large variety of trophic niches and are often the most species-rich and abundant mammals in the area (Dietz and Kalko, 2006; Giannini and Kalko, 2004) . Neo-tropical bats such as Carollia, Myotis, Artibeus and Desmodus play a relevant role in neo-tropical ecosystems as they disperse seeds, pollinate flowers and control insect populations (Bernard, 2001; Kunz et al., 2007) . The ecology of these mammals highlight their relevance as reservoirs of infectious diseases and zoonotic pathogens due to their high ability of mobility, broad distribution and social behaviour (communal roosting and fission-fusion social structure). Among these pathogens emerge rabies, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), henipavirus, possibly ebola and the trypanosomes (Guyatt et al., 2003; Li et al., 2005; Halpin et al., 2000; Hamilton et al., 2012a,b) .

Trypanosomes (genus Trypanosoma) are usually transmitted by arthropods or leech vectors. Among the Trypanosoma genus exists four clear clades depending on the host that the parasite infects (aquatic clade, mammalian clade, terrestrial clade and avian clade); within the mammalian clade emerges the Trypanosoma cruzi clade containing T. c. cruzi, T. c. marinkellei, T. dionisii, T. conorhinii, T. rangeli and other mammalian trypanosomes. This clade is of extreme interest in terms of public health; Chagas disease caused by T. c. cruzi represents an important human pathology in the Americas and the heterogeneity displayed by this taxon is exhibited in at least six discrete typing units (DTUs) widely distributed in humans, insect vectors and reservoirs named from T. c. cruzi I to T. c. cruzi VI (TcI-TcVI) with the emergence of one new genotype strictly associated to bat species (Myotis and Noctilio) in Brazil and Panama (Zingales et al., 2009 (Zingales et al., , 2012 Marcili et al., 2009a; Pinto et al., 2012) . This might suggest that host-fitting is the main mechanism of trypanosomes evolution (Hamilton et al., 2012b) . Nevertheless, many authors have suggested that the T. cruzi clade is the sister clade of a recently discovered bat-trypanosome species from Africa named T. erneyi supporting what is now named the bat-seeding hypothesis in the diversification of T. cruzi clade (Lima et al., 2012; Hamilton et al., 2012b) .

Different studies have attempted to elucidate the prevalence of Trypanosomes in bats observing the occurrence of 3-9% in surveys conducted in South America (Marinkelle, 1976; Dias et al., 1942; Deane, 1961) . In neo-tropical bats the most common trypanosome species detected are T. cruzi cruzi, T. c. marinkellei, T. dionisii, T. rangeli and T. conorhinii (Baker et al., 1978; García et al., 2012; Marcili et al., 2009a,b) . In Colombia exists one single survey where T. cruzilike infections were detected in a considerable number of bat specimens (Marinkelle, 1976) . Despite this effort, no conclusive results associating the biology, ecology and evolution of trypanosomes and bats have emerged. In this context, we undertook intensive sampling of neo-tropical bats from an endemic area of Chagas disease in Colombia with a high rate of T. cruzi transmission in order to unravel the distribution of bat trypanosomes in the area with the aim of obtaining reliable information about the transmission dynamics of these protozoans with special focus on elucidating the relevance of this subpatent infections in the biology, evolution and ecology of neo-tropical bats.

Bat specimens were captured in six localities across the Casanare department in Eastern Colombia (Fig. 1) . A total of 175 specimens were captured in Nunchia (3 bats), San Luis de Palenque (45 bats), Yopal (13 bats), Agua Azul (22 bats), Maní (21 bats) and Tamara (71 bats) using nets and procedures permitted by the Ministerio del Medio Ambiente in Colombia obtaining appropiate geographical coordinates of capture (Table S1 ). Blood samples (200 lL) were collected in EDTA and transferred to Guanidine-EDTA buffer for complete lysis of the blood and preservation of DNA fragments. Bats were identified to species level using DNA barcoding previously developed for neo-tropical bats (Clare et al., 2011) .

The blood samples in guanidine buffer (GEB) were submitted for DNA extraction using the Qiamp miniprep kit following the manufactureŕs instructions (Qiagen, Barcelona, Spain). The DNA aliquots were submitted to amplification based on a barcoding approach using three genomic regions; we employed the partial region of cytochrome b gene (cytb), the region V7 of the SSU rDNA 18S gene (SSU rDNA) fragment and gGAPDH as previously established for the discrimination of Trypanosomes species (Marcili et al., 2009a; García et al., 2012) . The amplification was accomplished in a final volume of 20 lL using 1Â Buffer (Corpogen, COL), 5 mM MgCl 2 , 1 lM of primers, 10 lM of dNTPs, 0.5U of Taq Tucan (Corpogen, COL) and 20 ng of DNA. The mix was submitted to 29 cycles of amplification, the amplicons were visualised in 2% agarose gels stained with red gel. The PCR products were cleaned up by isopropanol precipitation and sequenced by the dideoxyterminal method in an automated capillary sequencer (AB3730, Applied Biosystems, UK). The resulting sequences were edited in MEGA 5.0 (Tamura et al., 2011) and aligned using ClustalW 1.8 (Thompson et al., 1994) . All edited sequences were deposited in GenBank and assigned accession numbers (KC951574-KC951627). For the identification of Trypanosomes species, the sequences obtained were compared with reference sequences from T. c. cruzi (from the six DTUs and the TcBAT genotype), T. c. marinkellei, T. dionisii, T. conorhinii, T. evansi, T. theileri and T. rangeli retrieved from GenBank. 

The final set of sequences from each gene fragment was evaluated in ModelTest 3.7 where the most appropriate evolutionary model was selected based on the AIC (Akaike Information Criterion). A maximum composite likelihood (MCL) analysis using a Tamura-3 parameter model and the Neighbour-Joining algorithm was run in RAxML 7.2.5 on the CIPRES project (Cyberinfrastructure for Phylogenetic Research) portal 2.0 servers. Trees were constructed for individual gene fragments in order to unravel the evolutionary drivers among the species detected. To evaluate the robustness of the nodes in the resulting phylogenetic trees, 1000 bootstrap replicates were performed. The final trees were rooted with T. brucei.

Neo-tropical bats were captured in six municipalities across the department of Casanare in Colombia where Chagas disease is highly endemic. The results of morphological features and DNA barcoding allowed us to discriminate the bats species diversity as follows: In Nunchia municipality 100% of the bats species sampled was from the species Carollia perspicillata. In Agua azul municipality, four distinct species were sampled observing C. perspicillata (54%), Myotis oxyotus (9%), Desmodus rotundus (23%) and Artibeus planirostris (14%). In Maní municipality we observed the ocurrence of C. perspicillata (43%), M. oxyotus (14%), D. rotundus (10%) and Artibeus planirostris (33%). In San Luis de Palenque municipality we detected C. perspicillata (42%), M. oxyotus (20%), D. rotundus (13%), Rhynchonycteris naso (11%), A. planirostris (8%) and A. fuliginosus (6%). In Tamara municipality we observed C. perspicillata (41%), M. oxyotus (10%), D. rotundus (13%), R. naso (11%), A. planirostris (4%) and A. fuliginosus (21%). Lastly, in Yopal we obtained C. perspicillata (85%) and M. oxyotus (15%) (Fig. 2) .

After observing the distribution of bat species we employed the barcoding approach based on three independent molecular markers in different regions of the trypanosome genome. There had to be a consensus among the three molecular makers for the accurate discrimination of trypanosome species. In all the cases the three markers showed congruence. A high prevalence of trypanosome infection was detected among the bats sampled finding a rate of infection of 61.2% across the 175 specimens analysed. In the 107 bats positive for trypanosomes infection the ocurrence of trypanosome species from the subgenus schyzotrypanum and megatrypanum being as T. cruzi cruzi (51%), T. c. marinkellei (9%), T. dionisii (13%), T. rangeli (21%), T. evansi (4%) and T. theileri (2%) was observed. The distribution of trypanosome species infecting each bat species and geographical niche is observed in Fig. 2 . Regarding the rate of infection by T. c. cruzi DTUs as previously described, from the 55 bats infected by this trypanosome we observed the presence of TcI (60%), TcII (15%), TcIII (7%), TcIV (7%) and TcBAT (11%), likewise the distribution of T. c. cruzi DTUs infecting each bat species and geographical niche is observed in Fig. 3. 

Reliable maximum likelihood phylogenetic reconstruction was conducted using the three molecular markers employed (cytb, SSU rDNA and gGAPDH). A total of 8% of the samples showed heterozygous positions in the nuclear gGAPDH loci. Therefore, these sequences were removed from the phylogenetic reconstruction in order to avoid uncertain interpretations regarding the topologies. The topologies of the three markers were congruent. We also employed sequences retrieved from Genbank to detect the genetic relatedness among reference sequences and the sequences obtained from Colombian trypanosomes. The topology of the ML tree corroborated the high affinity of TcBAT to TcI and the status of emergent genotype of TcBAT in the natural history of T. c. cruzi taxon (Fig. 4) . No outliers were detected on the whole dataset.

A tailored diversity of trypanosome species from bats was sampled in a relevant area of Casanare department in Colombia. The molecular approach herein reported allowed us to observe a positivity of 61% of infection by trypanosomes from the schyzotrypanum and megatrypanum subgenus. This is a high and not unexpected rate of infection since in similar analyses performed in Panamian bats a rate of infection of 11.6% by T. c. cruzi was detected (Pinto et al., 2012) . Also, different surveys in Brazilian bats have shown positivity for trypanosomes of 80% (D'Alessandro et al., 1971; Marinkelle, 1972) . In some reports using direct microscopic examination the prevalences range from 2.4% to 9% in Colombian and Brazilian bats (Marinkelle, 1976; Dias et al., 1942; Deane, 1961; Marinkelle and Duarte, 1968 ). These findings reinforce previous statements showing the important role that bat species play in the transmission of these parasites causing a high risk of pathogen transmission in those areas where bat-human interaction is frequent.

The distribution of the trypanosome species among the bats is strongly linked with the biology and the ecology of these mammals. We sampled bat species that belonged to three distinct families (Phyllostomidae, Vespertilionidae and Emballonuridae). We observed six distinct species after the completion of the survey (Fig. 2) . C. perspicillata was the most frequent species in all six provinces surveyed and showed the highest percentage of infection (T. c. cruzi, T. c. marinkellei, T. rangeli and T. dionisii). On the other hand, bats from the genus Myotis, Rhynchonycteris and Artibeus were detected and infected with T. c. cruzi, T. c. marinkellei, T. rangeli and T. dionisii in low proportions. After an exhaustive revision in the literature of the trypanosome species that infect Carollia, Myotis, Rhynchonycteris and Artibeus we observed congruence in the patterns of infection with the ones observed among our dataset (Marinkelle, 1972; García et al., 2012) . Moreover, it is necessary to consider the ecology of these bats. These species usually feed on insects, fruits or pollen (Cloutier and Thomas, 1992) . It is common that these bats get infected when they ingest insects infected with these trypanosomes. In this sense, triatomine insects are the main hosts of T. c. cruzi, T. c. marinkellei and T. rangeli. Many authors have suggested that Cavernicola pilosa a triatomine bug that can be found on the caves where the bats live is the principal responsible for bat infection (Dias et al., 1942; Marinkelle, 1966; Oliveira et al., 2008) . Albeit, C. pilosa has never been found infected with T. rangeli or with T. dionisii.

These bat species usually live on palms of the genus Attalea and Elaeis that are highly infested by Rhodnius prolixus which has been found naturally infected with T. c. cruzi and T. rangeli (Vallejo et al., 2009) . This premise also needs to consider the insect vector of T. dionisii where cimids have been detected in the region surveyed. This implies that insectivory life is the best explanation for these bats to be naturally infected. Nevertheless, stercorarian or salivarian and congenital transmission routes cannot be excluded since these bats do inhabit in the canopy of the palms where triatomine bugs may transmit T. rangeli, but further studies are required to ensure this hypothesis. Additionally, recent studies in Venezuelan bats have demonstrated that in Molossus colossus; T. c. cruzi may be transmitted to the offspring suggesting a high risk of kinetoplastid transmission (Añez et al., 2009) .

One interesting finding is the ocurrence of T. evansi and T. theileri in merely one bat species. Desmodus rotundus was found infected with T. c. cruzi, T. rangeli, T. theileri and T. evansi; we find it relevant to highlight this bat species since it is the unique hematophagous species sampled and collected in the dwellings of houses. In terms of ecology, the route of infection of this bat species could be double; Bats may acquire T. evansi and T. theileri by blood ingestion from cattle and/or vectorial transmission (Family Tabaniidae). To our concern this is the first report of T. theileri in Colombian bats and is not unexpected since different surveys conducted in the area have demonstrated the presence of these trypanosomes in cattle (Wells et al., 1982; Cassalett et al., 2011) . Otherwise, infection by T. rangeli and T. c. cruzi has also been reported in bovines but in a very low proportion (Fujita et al., 1994) . The question raises whether the merely unique mechanism for acquisition of infection is by blood ingestion of cattle or if maybe while this bat species inhabit the palms, caves or others, some triatomines may transmit T. c. cruzi/T. rangeli by stercorarian/salivarian routes. Lastly, it is interesting to consider that T. c. cruzi was the most frequent trypanosome species in D. rotundus which implies a tremendous risk of parasite transmission even though knowing per se the high antropophilic behaviour this bat species display.

T. c. cruzi is the agent of Chagas disease, a tropical pathology that affects more than 10 million people in Latin-America (Rassi et al., 2012) . Mammals from 100 different orders have been described as potential reservoirs of T. c. cruzi suggesting that this zoonosis cannot be eradicated (Jansen and Roque, 2010) . Neo-tropical bats play a relevant role as reservoirs of this parasite as demonstrated by plenty of studies across the continent (Añez et al., 2009; Marcili et al., 2009a; Herrera et al., 2011; García et al., 2012; Marinkelle, 1976) . We observed that the most frequent hemoflagellate in all the bats sampled was T. c. cruzi, which corroborates the important epidemiological role of this mammal (Fig. 2) . Likewise, we conducted an accurate discrimination of T. c. cruzi DTUs observing the predominance of TcI with the foreseen presence of TcII, TcIII, TcIV and the first report of TcBAT in Colombia (Fig. 3) . This is in accordance with the predominance of TcI in humans, reservoirs and insect vectors from the region (Ramírez et al., 2012) . This information is of paramount relevance in terms of ecology and phylodynamics of these DTUs; TcI, TcIII and TcIV are mainly associated to the sylvatic cycle of transmission with sporadic reports in domestic foci. Additionally, studies in Brazil have demonstrated that bats are mainly infected by TcI, TcIII and TcIV (Marcili et al., 2009b; Lisboa et al., 2008; Zingales et al., 2012) . The interesting findings overcome in the detection of TcII that has been associated to the domestic cycle of transmission with sporadic reports in sylvatic reservoirs (Yeo et al., 2005; Zingales et al., 2012) . Despite of the ecological niche that TcII occupies, this DTU has been extensively reported in Brazilian bats from the species Carollia and Noctilio (Phyllostomatidae) (Marcili et al., 2009a; Lisboa et al., 2008) . Nevertheless, an emergent genotype previously named as TcBAT was detected in our dataset; in this sense the infection by this genotype was observed in Carollia, Myotis and Rhynchonycteris bats, which is in accordance with previous reports (Marcili et al., 2009a) . This suggests that TcBAT is not only encountered in Brazil and Panama (Pinto et al., 2012) . Also, the ability of this genotype to infect mammalian cells in vitro strongly suggest the importance of conducting studies to unravel the genetic properties that this genotype displays and whether this genotype should be assigned as a novel DTU (Maeda et al., 2011) . The orthodox overlook of T. c. cruzi DTUs in bat species suggests the importance of these reservoirs in the natural cycle of the parasite. Some authors suggest that marsupials were the first hosts of the T. cruzi taxon but the recent advances in the evolution of bats have allowed some authors to propose the 'bat-seeding' hypothesis suggesting that the fact that bat fossils were discovered about 55 mya might imply that the first reservoirs of T. c. cruzi could have been bats; also supported by the speciation processes of trypanosomes and lastly explained by the migration of these mammals (Hamilton et al., 2012a,b; Teeling et al., 2005) . As herein demonstrated, bats play a paramount role in the dispersion not only of T. c. cruzi DTUs. These mammals may disperse many trypanosome species and the host-fitting features could determine the emergence of new cryptic species, as is the case of TcBAT genotype. The relatively recent arrival of bats to South America and their mobility by flight, suggests that T. cruzi like trypanosomes of bats are derived from either T. cruzi I or T. cruzi II (Z2)/Z3 by habitat sharing or, for insectivorous bats, by consumption of infected triatomine bugs (Gaunt and Miles, 2000) . This premise needs to be fully studied and corroborated with the aim of unravelling the natural history of T. c. cruzi.

In summary we conducted, to our knowledge, the first molecular descriptive study of bat trypanosomes in Colombia with direct detection of the parasites from EDTA-blood. The distribution of the trypanosomes identified implies that an intensive and active transmission of parasites is occurring in the region and especially among bat populations. This represents important epidemiological implications with special focus on Chagas disease since this area is endemic for this pathology in Colombia. Also, foreseen trypanosome species were detected with novel reports of T. theileri and TcBAT. Likewise, evolutionary trends could be ruled out observing that T. erneyi was corroborated as the plausible sister clade of T. cruzi and bats as the first and natural reservoirs of Chagas disease in the Americas. The TcBAT genotype needs to be screened in the entire American continent where Chagas disease is endemic to obtain conclusive premises regarding the ecology and distribution of this genotype. Lastly, we suggest conducting new studies in order to unravel the population genetics of TcBAT, schyzotrypanum and megatrypanum subgenus in order to obtain robust and reliable information about the biology of trypanosomes in Colombia as suggested by C.J. Marinkelle in the last decades.

Widespread Divergence of the CEACAM/PSG Genes in Vertebrates and Humans Suggests Sensitivity to Selection,"In mammals, carcinoembryonic antigen cell adhesion molecules (CEACAMs) and pregnancy-specific glycoproteins (PSGs) play important roles in the regulation of pathogen transmission, tumorigenesis, insulin signaling turnover, and fetalmaternal interactions. However, how these genes evolved and to what extent they diverged in humans remain to be investigated specifically. Based on syntenic mapping of chordate genomes, we reveal that diverging homologs with a prototypic CEACAM architecture-including an extracellular domain with immunoglobulin variable and constant domainlike regions, and an intracellular domain containing ITAM motif-are present from cartilaginous fish to humans, but are absent in sea lamprey, cephalochordate or urochordate. Interestingly, the CEACAM/PSG gene inventory underwent radical divergence in various vertebrate lineages: from zero in avian species to dozens in therian mammals. In addition, analyses of genetic variations in human populations showed the presence of various types of copy number variations (CNVs) at the CEACAM/PSG locus. These copy number polymorphisms have 3-80% frequency in select populations, and encompass single to more than six PSG genes. Furthermore, we found that CEACAM/PSG genes contain a significantly higher density of nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) compared to the chromosome average, and many CEACAM/PSG SNPs exhibit high population differentiation. Taken together, our study suggested that CEACAM/PSG genes have had a more dynamic evolutionary history in vertebrates than previously thought. Given that CEACAM/PSGs play important roles in maternal-fetal interaction and pathogen recognition, these data have laid the groundwork for future analysis of adaptive CEACAM/PSG genotype-phenotypic relationships in normal and complicated pregnancies as well as other etiologies.","Carcinoembryonic antigen cell adhesion molecules (CEA-CAMs) and pregnancy-specific glycoproteins (PSGs; also known as Schwangerschafts Protein 1) are characterized by an N-terminal immunoglobulin variable domain-like region followed by a varied number of immunoglobulin constant domain-like structures. The prototypic member, CEA (or CEACAM5), was initially discovered as a membrane-anchored tumor antigen [1] . CEACAM subfamily proteins have since been shown to play important roles in the regulation of immune responses, angiogenesis, the differentiation of mammary glands, insulin signaling turnover, tumorigenesis, and metastasis [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12] . By contrast, PSGs have been characterized as highly glycosylated major proteins from human syncytiotrophoblasts during pregnancy. High levels of human PSGs have been detected in maternal serum as early as 3 days postfertilization, coinciding with the attachment of the blastocyst to the uterine wall, and were believed to be critical for protecting the semiallotypic fetus from the maternal immune system during pregnancy in, at least, primates [13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19] .

Whereas the CEACAM/PSG genes were previously considered eutherian-specific, recent studies have shown that homologs with 30-50% protein sequence similarity to human CEACAMs are present in the marsupial opossum and monotreme platypus [20, 21] . Interestingly, the inventory of CEACAM/PSG genes in mammals appeared to vary greatly even among closely related species. For example, whereas mice contain 27 CEACAM/PSG homologs, rats have only 16 counterparts [20, 21] . In addition, earlier studies of nucleotide substitution and the dN/dS ratio in primates and rodents showed that select CEACAM/PSG genes underwent positive or purifying selection [22, 23] . These earlier observations suggested that the duplication/retention of CEA-CAM/PSG genes could be susceptible to environmental selection, and the process could be similar to the birth, fixation, and loss of adaptive genes such as olfactory receptors and killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs) in select vertebrates [24, 25, 26] . Because the analysis of nucleotide or amino acid selection across closely related species provides only a rough estimate of genetic variation within a narrow time frame, how unique the evolution of CEACAM/PSG genes in vertebrates remains to be investigated. In addition, the difficulty in analyzing CEACAM/PSG gene evolution was further aggravated by the large variation in gene repertoire among species, which violates various assumptions of statistical methods commonly used in the analysis of gene selection. Accordingly, we hypothesized that an integrative analysis that encompasses a wide time spectrum is needed to better understand the evolution of CEACAM/PSG genes. Here, based on syntenic mapping of chordate genomes and the analysis of genetic variations in humans, we show that CEACAM/PSG genes represent an independent branch of the immunoglobulin superfamily, and were frequently subject to selection by geneenvironmental interactions. Importantly, we also found that human CEACAM/PSG locus is enriched with genetic variations, and the PSG gene inventory could range from 12 to 30 copies among individuals, indicating an ongoing selection of these genes in major, geographically separated human populations. Because PSGs and CEACAMs are important for normal pregnancy and immune responses, our study thus provides a framework for further exploration of adaptive genotype-phenotype relationships involving these fast-evolving genes in reproduction, pregnancy complications, and other patho-physiologies in humans.

All animal works were conducted according to the National Institute of Health standards as set forth by the ''Guide for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals''. The collection and use of zebrafish were conducted according to Protocol 12806, assigned to Dr. Sheau Yu Teddy Hsu at Dept. of OB/GYN at Stanford University School of Medicine, approved by the Stanford University APLAC. The pufferfish sample was a gift from Dr. Sheau Yu Teddy Hsu. The deceased fish were part of Dr. Hsu's personal collection of deceased tropical fish, and the work did not involve any live pufferfish. All work related to platypus tissues was done according to the policies of the animal ethics committee at The University of Adelaide. Platypus tissues were obtained from a deceased adult male platypus under the Animal ethics permits AEEC R.CG.07.03 and AEC S-49-200 to Dr. Frank Grutzner.

We used the CEACAM classification proposed by Beauchemin et al. (1999) [27] and Kammerer et al. (2007) [22] . If an orthologous relationship to human proteins could not be defined, the proteins were denoted by the generic gene name in the GenBank. In nonmammalian species, all CEACAM family genes were annotated with a Roman letter based on their chromosomal localization.

Genomic and protein sequences of known CEACAM family genes from humans, mice, rats, and dogs as well as the genomes of major model species were obtained from the NCBI databases (ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes), the archive!ensembl database (http://may2012.archive.ensembl.org/index.html), or the JGI database, (http://genome.jgi-psf.org). Sequence alignment was carried out using the program MUSCLE (http:// phylogenomics.berkeley.edu) and Tcoffee (http://tcoffee.crg.cat/ apps/tcoffee/index.html).

Genes belonging to the CEACAM/PSG family from different species were first determined by comparing known CEACAM sequences to genomic contigs using the program BLAST and a series of reciprocal pairwise sequence comparisons as well as the program Genscan [28] . Initially, human and mouse CEACAM sequences were compared against the genomes and proteomes of chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes), Rhesus monkey (Macaca mulatta), bushbaby (Otolemur garnettii), mouse lemur (Microcebus murinus), dog (Canis familiaris), opossum (Monodelphis domestica), platypus (Ornithorhynchus anatinus), chicken (Gallus gallus), turkey (Meleagri gallopavo), zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata), clawed frog (Xenopus tropicalis), West Indian Ocean coelacanth (Latimeria chalumnae), medaka fish (Oryzias latipes), zebrafish (Danio rerio), pufferfish (Takifugu rubripes and Tetraodon nigroviridis), stickleback (Gasteroteus aculeatus), little skate (Leucoraja erinacea), sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus), amphioxus (Branchiostoma floridae), and tunicates (Ciona intestinalis and Ciona savignyi). Unique protein sequences with E,0.0001 were analyzed with additional blast searches against the human nonredundant protein database to detect the best reciprocal hits. In this step, we excluded homologs for other proteins with IgV-like and IgC-like motifs that did not share a common root with mammalian CEACAMs. Due to sequence divergence, the relationship between newly identified homologs and human CEACAMs cannot be determined unambiguously. Based on this observation and earlier studies, we reasoned that CEACAM family genes likely underwent extensive neo-functionalization or sub-functionalization after gene duplication, and that heterotachy incurred by functional divergence led to the difficulty in phylogeny analysis [29] . Therefore, we sought to determine the phylogenetic relationship of novel CEACAM family genes with syntenic mapping.

Chromosomal localization of CEACAM family genes was obtained from the NCBI database. Syntenic maps were downloaded from the Ensembl's BioMart data mining tool (http:// www.ensembl.org/multi/martview) and Genoscope database (http://www.genoscope.cns.fr/externe/English/Projets/ Projet_C/data/synteny/TN_HS_SYNT) [30, 31] . The exact locations for human, chimpanzee, Rhesus monkey, bushbaby, mouse lemur, dog, rat, mouse, opossum, platypus, X. tropicalis, O. latipes, D. rerio, T. rubripes, and T. nigroviridis (co)-orthologs were also verified by BLAT searches using the UCSC Genome Bioinformatics webserver (http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgBlat) [32] . We inferred that a pair of duplicates in teleosts would be whole genome duplication (WGD)-derived co-orthologs if they were located on human-T. nigroviridis or human-D. rerio syntenic chromosomal regions. By contrast, CEACAM found on neighboring loci on the same chromosome were determined to have been derived from tandem duplications. Therefore, the presence of an ancestor for a select group of CEACAMs in the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of a select lineage was deduced from analyses combining BLAST results and syntenic mapping. However, we cannot exclude the possibility, albeit a low probability, that some teleost homologs found on duplicated syntenic chromosomal regions were not WGD-derived coorthologs.

CEACAM orthologs appear to expand quickly and repeatedly in multiple vertebrate lineages, which is similar to what happened with olfactory and vomeronasal receptors [26] . Due to the high divergence of CEACAM protein sequences, it is impossible to obtain a reliable alignment that includes all CEACAM homologs. We resorted to select representative genes from each lineage so that outlier sequences were not included in the multiple sequence alignment. We constructed representative sets of genes from three targeted clades: primate only, mammal only, and fish only. The amino-acid sequences were aligned using MUSLE v3.8 with default settings [33] . The pairwise genetic distances between amino-acid sequences was estimated using the JTT matrix-based method [34] . All ambiguous positions were removed for each sequence pair. The phylogenetic trees were first constructed using the Neighbor-Joining method [35] implemented in MEGA v5.05 [36] . The bootstrap consensus tree was inferred from 1,000 replicates to represent the phylogenetic relationship between sequences of the proteins analyzed [37] .

The phylogenetic trees were also inferred by using the Maximum Likelihood method based on the JTT matrix-based model. The tree with the highest log likelihood is presented. The topology of the tree was constructed using proml in Phylip v3.69 [38] . Initial tree(s) for the heuristic search were obtained automatically by applying Neighbor-Join and BioNJ algorithms to a matrix of pairwise distances estimated using a JTT model, and then selecting the topology with superior log likelihood value. The tree is drawn to scale, with branch lengths which were estimated using codeml of PAML [39] . The bootstrap values of trees in which the associated taxa clustered together shown next to the branches were obtained from 100 replicates.

The chromosome 19 SNPs were analyzed based on NCBI dbSNP Build 129 (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP/index. html). We computed the unbiased estimate of the F ST for gene region SNPs in the HapMap II using the SPSmart server [40] . LD plots for CEACAM/PSG gene regions were generated using the HaploView 4.1 [41] . The LD blocks were determined using an r2 threshold of 0.8. Analysis of CNVs was performed using the International HapMap Project server (http://hapmap.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/index.html.en) and manual search of individual publications.

All animal works were conducted according to the National Institute of Health standards as set forth by the ''Guide for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals''. The collection of platypus and zebrafish tissues was done according to the policies of the animal ethics committee at The University of Adelaide and Stanford University, respectively. Platypus tissues were obtained from a deceased adult male platypus under the Animal ethics permits AEEC R.CG.07.03 and AEC S-49-200 to Dr. Frank Grutzner. Zebrafish tissues were collected according to the Stanford University APLAC Protocol 12806. Pufferfish tissues were a gift from Dr. Sheau Yu Teddy Hsu at Stanford University School of Medicine.

To verify the zebrafish CEACAM family genes in zebrafish, EST clones were obtained from Open Biosystem and analyzed with dideoxy sequencing. Expression analysis was also performed using snap frozen tissues collected from four adult zebrafish D. rerio and an adult male platypus O. anatinus as well as three deceased adult pufferfish T. nigroviridis. Total RNA was extracted using an RNeasy Mini Extraction kit (Qiagen) or the standard Trizol method. One microgram of RNA was reverse-transcribed in a total reaction volume of 20 ml containing 5 mM MgCl2, 106 buffer, 10 mM dithiothreitol, deoxyribonucleotide triphosphates, Poly-T primers, RNAsin 20 U, and 200 U of MuLV enzyme. Samples were incubated for 45 min at 42uC and 3 min in boiling water. PCR-amplification was performed in 20-ml samples containing 2.0 ml of cDNA, 4.6 ml of water, 2 ml of 10x PCR buffer, 1.2 ml of 25 mM MgCl2, 2 ml of 2.0 mM dNTP, 4 ml of forward and reverse primers, and 0.2 ml of Takara Ex Taq polymerase (5 U/ ml). After 2 min at 94uC, the amplification was carried out with 35 cycles at 94uC for 30 s and 68uC for 240 s.

To verify that the predicted platypus genes were expressed as mRNA and eliminate the possibility of amplification from DNA templates, gene-specific PCR primers were designed based on sequences on two separate exons.

In agreement with earlier studies, the CEACAM/PSG locus was found to be located near a cluster of marker genes, including TGFB1, ATP1A3, ZNF574, PAFAH1B3, TMEM145, CNFN, LIPE, ETHE1, XRCC1, TOMM40, APOE, and SIGLEC8, in a variety of eutherian genomes ( Fig. 1 , a and b) [20, 21] . In humans, chimpanzees, and Rhesus monkeys, this locus encodes 25, 18, and 24 CEACAM/PSG genes, respectively, in a 10-Mbp region on chromosome 19 ( Fig. 1a , Table S1 in File S1). These primate CEACAM/PSG genes can be physically divided into two clusters. The cluster I contained the better characterized CEACAM1,3-8 and PSG genes whereas the second cluster included the recently identified CEACAM16, 18-20, and 22-23 genes (Fig. 1a) . Although the total number of CEACAM/PSG genes in Rhesus monkeys was close to that of humans, the majority of PSG-like genes in this primate did not show a 1:1 orthologous relationship with those of apes. Instead, phylogenetic tree analysis using either Neighbor-Joining or Maximum Likelihood methods showed that most PSG-like genes in Rhesus monkeys clustered in a sub-branch in phylogenetic trees, suggesting that the expansion of PSG genes in Rhesus monkeys was independent of those in apes (Figs. 2a and 3a).

The number of CEACAM homologs in wet-nosed primates (Suborder Strepsirrhin; Lemuriforme, i.e., bushbaby and mouse lemur), which split from dry-nosed primates (Suborder Haplorrhini) ,40 million years ago, was limited to 4-6 (Table S1 in File S1). Likewise, most non-primate mammals (e.g., cat, guinea pig, tree shrew, rabbit, squirrel, cow, hedgehog, microbat, shrew, elephant, small Madagascar hedgehog, and armadillo) contained 4-6 CEACAM homologs. There is an absence of PSG-like genes in these species, suggesting that PSG genes of dry-nosed primates were derived from lineage-specific duplications. Among nonprimate eutherians investigated, rodents appeared to be the only group to have a large number of CEACAM homologs (16 in rats and 27 in mice) [20, 21, 42] .

Syntenic mapping showed that metatherian opossum encodes approximately three dozen CEACAM homologs with overall sequence similarities to CEACAM1 and 5. Among them, eleven homologs clustered with CEACAM/PSG locus marker genes TOMM40 and APOE on chromosome 4 ( Fig. 1b ; Table S2 in File S1). On the other hand, the prototherian platypus encoded only four CEACAM homologs (OanCEACAM16, 16LI, 20LI, and 20LII)( Fig. 1b ; Table S2 in File S1), and a pair of these homologs are positioned in tandem (Fig. 1b, Contig 2758 ). While CEACAM homologs from metatherian and prototherian mammals exhibit overall sequence similarity with eutherian counterparts, they have diverged extensively in domain structure and protein length as well as gene inventory, suggesting the absence of true orthologous (Table S2 in File S1). For the opossum, only paralogs mapped on chromosomes 2 and 4 are shown. Those found on unknown chromosomes are described in Table S2 in File S1. Among these homologs, eleven (MdoCEACAMI-XI) were found to cluster in a 2-Mbp span on chromosome 4, which also contained the marker genes TOMM40 and APOE. On the other hand, the platypus genome encoded four CEACAM homologs (OanCEACAM16, 16LI, 20LI, and 20LII)( Table S2 in File S1). In X. tropicalis, three homologs (XtrCEACAMI-III) were located near marker genes, including LIPE, CNFN, TMEM145, PAFAH1B3, and ZNF574. The chromosomal number and the genomic contig number are indicated at the top of the schematic representation of each genomic fragment. CEACAM family genes are indicated by red diamond-shaped symbols. Marker genes are identified by colored diamond-shaped symbols. The relative position of genes on chromosomes and contigs is shown next to the gene symbols. c) Syntenic mapping of CEACAM loci in teleosts. The genomes of the medaka fish (O. latipes), stickleback (G. aculeatus), zebrafish (D. rerio), and two pufferfishes (T. rubripes and T. nigroviridis) encode 1-12 CEACAM family genes. Syntenic mapping indicated that zebrafish and T. nigroviridis CEACAM genes are located on whole genome duplication (WGD)-derived chromosome fragments, and that zebrafish CEACAMs on chromosome 16 are located on three separate loci (I, II, and III). The WGD-derived syntenic chromosomal regions in teleosts are indicated by a yellow background. The chromosomal number and the genomic contig number are indicated at the top of the schematic representation of each genomic fragment. CEACAM family genes are indicated by red diamond-shaped symbols. Marker genes are identified by colored diamond-shaped symbols. The relative position of genes on chromosomes and contigs is shown next to the gene symbols. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0061701.g001 relationship between these homologs and those of humans. Interestingly, although phylogenetic trees built with the Neighbor-Joining method showed little confidence on the relationship of most opossum and platypus homologs with those of eutherian homologs (Fig. 2b) , phylogenetic trees built with the Maximum Likelihood method suggested that mammalian CEACAMs can be separated into two major branches: CEACAM16/18/20 and those clustered with the better characterized human CEACAM1like members ( Fig. 3b; Fig. S1 in File S1). In addition, the majority of metatherian homologs clustered in a sub-branch appeared to separate from those of human CEACAM1-like members.

Syntenic mapping showed that CEACAM family genes are also present in genomes of basal tetrapods and teleosts (Fig. 1, b and c; Table S3 in File S1). However, no CEACAM homolog was identified in the genome of chicken, turkey (M. gallopavo), zebra finch (T. guttata), sea lamprey (P. marinus), and cephalochordate (amphioxus, B. floridae) and urochordates (tunicates, C. intestinalis and C. savignyi). In the clawed frog X. tropicalis, there are at least eight homologs, and three of them (XtrCEACAMI-III) were located close to marker genes including, LIPE, CNFN, TMEM145, PAFAH1B3, and ZNF574. In pufferfish, T. rubripes encoded at least six homologs ( Fig. 1c ; Table S3 in File S1), and three of these genes (scaffold 256, TruCEACAMI-III) were 5 Kbp from a PAFAH1B3 ortholog. Likewise, the homolog on scaffold 35 (TruCEACAMIV) was 20 Kbp from an XRCC1 ortholog (Fig. 1c) . On the other hand, the closely related pufferfish T. nigroviridis contained only three homologs (TniCEACAM Ia, Ib, and II). TniCEACAM Ia and II were found near marker genes ZNF574 and ATP1A3, and PAFAH1B3, LIPE, TMEM145, and TOMM40a, respectively. By contrast, TniCEACAM Ib was located with a second TOMM40 ortholog (TOMM40b) and an ETHE1 ortholog. Based on the understanding that a WGD occurred before the divergence of teleosts and osteoglossomorphs more than 230-350 million years ago [30, 42, 43] , TniCEACAM Ia and Ib as well as the pair of TOMM40 (a and b) genes likely represent WGD-derived co-orthologs.

Contrastingly, zebrafish and stickleback each contained at least ten CEACAM homologs ( Fig. 1c ; Table S3 in File S1). Most zebrafish homologs were found on two WGD-derived syntenic chromosome fragments that also contained co-orthologous ATP1A3 genes (ATP1A3a and 3b) as well as orthologs of ETHE1, ZNF574, PAFAH1B3, CNFN, LIPE, APOE, and TOMM40. In sticklebacks, at least five homologs on genome group XX (GacCEACAMI-V) were located close to marker genes CNFN, PAFAH1B3, XRCC1, and ETHE1. On the other hand, the medaka fish (O. latipes) contained only one CEACAM homolog on chromosome 16, which was surrounded by homologs of ATP1A3, PAFAH1B3, CNFN, LIPE, and TMEM145. Likewise, the West Indian Ocean coelacanth (L. chalumnae) contained at least one CEACAM homolog (DNA scaffold JH127065.1). Interestingly, a CEACAM homolog was also identified in a cartilaginous fish, little skate (L. erinacea; Class Chondrichthyes; FF598979.1, EE990618.1, and FF601895.1 in the EST database).

Furthermore, we found that hallmark sequences of the immunoglobulin superfamily (i.e., B cell receptors [BCRs], T cell receptors [TCRs] , and FcRc receptors), the cytoplasmic immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) [44, 45] , are present in select teleost homologs (Fig. S2 in File S1).

Taken together, these in silico analyses suggested that CEA-CAM-like gene found in basal taxonomy are orthologous to human CEACAM genes, but have undergone extensive local duplication or gene loss, resembling the repeated expansion of CEACAM/PSG genes in select therian mammals. In support of this observation, phylogenetic trees built with Neighbor-Joining and Maximum Likelihood methods indicated that five of the eight zebrafish CEACAMs on chromosome 16 (DreCEACAMI-V) form a sub-branch in which no homologs from other species are present, indicating that lineage-specific expansion could account for the large number of CEACAM homologs found in select fish species (Figs. 2c and 3c ).

In addition, these data implied that, 1) CEACAM genes originated before the evolution of cartilaginous fish, 2) mammalian CEACAM/PSG genes evolve from one or two ancestral genes that were located adjacent to ATP1A3, ZNF574, PAFAH1B3, CNFN, LIPE, TOMM40, and APOE in the MRCA of teleost fish and tetrapods (Fig. S3 in File S1), and 3) CEACAM/PSG genes belong to an independent branch of the immunoglobulin superfamily that evolved in parallel with BCRs, TCRs, and FcRc receptors early in vertebrates.

To verify that CEACAM homologs identified in lower taxonomy represent expressed genes, we analyzed the expression of select homologs in tissues of platypus, T. nigroviridis, and D. rerio using RT-PCR with gene-specific primers (Table S4 in File S1). Analyses of intestinal mRNA samples from a deceased platypus confirmed that at least two of the four platypus CEACAMs (OanCEACAM16 and 20LI) are constitutively expressed in the intestine, a tissue that exhibits pathological responses to overexpression of human CEACAMs in mice [46] (Fig. 4a) . Likewise, zebrafish homologs, including DreCEACAMI, VII, and X, were constitutively expressed in a variety of tissues (Fig. 4b, right panel) . On the other hand, analyses of eight T. nigroviridis tissues showed that the expression of three CEACAMs in this species is tissuespecific. TniCREAMIa, Ib, and II are selectively expressed in the brain, skin, and gut, respectively (Fig. 4b, left panel) .

It has been hypothesized that the repeated expansion of CEACAM/PSG genes in primates and rodents could be associated with positive selection of select members [22, 23] . The hypothesis is supported by the finding that PSG genes in apes and Rhesus monkeys could be derived from independent expansion even though Rhesus monkey ancestors diverged from those of humans only 25 million years ago. This observation led us to further hypothesize that the selection shaping CEACAM/PSG gene repertoire in apes could be ongoing, and human CEACAM/ PSG genes, as a group, could continue to diverge at a pace greater than that of other genes. To test this hypothesis, we investigated the extent of genetic variations (i.e., CNVs and SNPs) in human CEACAM/PSG genes, and whether the occurrence of CNVs and SNPs differs among human populations. In these analyses, richness and diversity of structural and nucleotide variations were used as proxies to determine the tendency for selection.

Analysis of structural variations based on earlier array studies using low-density probes showed the presence of various types of gain and/or loss of genomic fragment encompassing CEACAM/ PSG genes [47, 48, 49, 50] . These CNVs range from a few kb to as large as 0.8 Mb in a small fraction of individuals ( Fig. S4 in File S1). Consistently, recent data based on high-density probe comparative genome hybridization analysis and/or genome sequencing indicated that CNVs at the CEACAM/PSG locus are pervasive, and most of these CNVs are results of large segmental duplications (Fig. 5a) [51, 52, 53] .

Whereas there are at least 387 unique CNVs that are larger than 500 bp (range from 0.5 to 379 kb) on chromosome 19, 14 of them affected the CEACAM/PSG locus. Of the 46 CNVs that encompassed a .20-kb region, a disproportionate 17.4% (8 out of 46 CNVs) of them were located at the CEACAM/PSG locus (Fig. 5b) . Three of these CNVs actually represented the longest gains or losses of chromosome segment on chromosome 19, and all these CNVs affected multiple PSG genes: CNVR3824.1 (379 kb, encompassing PSG1, 2, 6, 7, 10, and 11), CNVR7658.2 (238 kb, including PSG1, 6, 7, 10, and 11), and CNVR7658.5 (252 kb, including PSG2, 4, 5, and 9)( Table S5 in File S1). Among CNVs, those have a frequency higher than 1% are distinguished as copy number polymorphisms. Based on this criterion, almost all CEACAM/PSG CNVs represented common copy number polymorphisms (.3% frequency) that have been retained in recent human history. Furthermore, we estimated that the copy number of PSG genes could range from 12 copies in individuals who are homozygous for gene loss at CNVR7658.2 to 30 copies in individuals with homozygous gene gains at CNVR7658.5, instead of 22 copies found in most individuals.

In addition, CNVs at the CEACAM/PSG locus exhibited high population differentiation (Table S5 in File S1). For example, CNVR7655.1 and CNVR7656.1 were found in 5% of the CEU (U.S. residents with northern and western European ancestry) populations, but not in the YRI (Yoruba from Ibadan in African) populations. On the other hand, CNVR7657.1 was unique to YRI populations (15%). By contrast, the CNVR3825.1 that encompassed PSG4 is specific to ,80% of East Asians (ASN, pooled samples of Chinese, Japanese, and Koreans).

Given that gain or loss of a whole set of genes are rare events in human genomes, these observations indicated that gene duplication/retention and loss occurred frequently at the CEACAM/ PSG locus, and these events could be under strong selection after the separation of major human populations in the last 40-80 thousand years.

Because the redundancy of CEACAM/PSG genes could distort common methods used to detect population differentiation of SNPs (including the so-called outlier approaches, in which candidate loci were identified in the extreme tails of empirical distributions, and neutrality tests), we used two alternative approaches to test whether there is an enhanced richness and diversity of SNPs in human CEACAM/PSG genes. First, we compared the density of synonymous and nonsynonymous generegion SNPs in CEACAM/PSG genes to those of other genes on chromosome 19. Although the density of synonymous SNPs within CEACAM/PSG genes was similar to the average of other genes, the density of nonsynonymous SNPs in CEACAM/PSG genes was significantly higher than that of the rest of genes on chromosome 19 (Table 1 , p,0.01). Consistently, whereas 40% of CEACAM/ PSG genes contained at least one nonsynonymous SNP, only 8.3% of the 1,363 other genes on chromosome 19 contained nonsynonymous SNPs (Table 2 ). These data suggested that CEACAM/ PSGs are enriched with genetic diversity in the coding region.

Second, we analyzed whether high-frequency nonsynonymous SNPs (i.e., has an average frequency .10%) in CEACAM/PSG genes exhibit population differentiation in the International HapMap II populations using the empirical distribution of the F ST statistic, which has been widely used to detect alleles that were selected after human populations left Africa ,60 thousand years ago. In support of our hypothesis, we found that only 3.2% (N = 43) and 2.6% (N = 34) of a total of 1327 non-CEACAM/PSG genes contained at least one coding SNP with F ST scores in the top 15% and 10% bracket of all SNPs, respectively. On the other hand, seven and three out of 25 CEACAM/PSG genes (28% and 12%) had at least one coding SNP with F ST scores in the top 15% and 10% bracket, respectively. In addition, we found that eight out of these 25 genes contained gene region SNPs with F ST scores in the top 5% bracket (Table S6 in File S1). In addition to CEACAM/PSG genes, chromosome 19 encodes several gene families that exhibit functional and evolutional characteristics similar to CEACAM/PSGs. These progressive gene families includes sialic acid binding Ig-like lectin, leukocyte immunoglobulinlike receptor, and olfactory receptor gene families [29, 31, 42, 43, 54, 55] . They encode secreted ligands or cell surface receptors, and the family size expanded multiple times during the evolution of primates. Interestingly, 25% and 19.4% of genes in these three families contained at least one nonsynonymous SNP with F ST scores in the top 15% and 10% bracket, respectively (Table 3) . Therefore, the ratio of genes containing coding SNP(s) with a high F ST score in CEACAM/PSG and these three progressive gene families is categorically higher than other genes (conserved genes) on chromosome 19 (Fig. 6, Table 3 ). RT-PCR detection of transcripts of DreCEACAMI, VII, and X in kidney, testis, ovary, gill, gut, head, heart, liver, and fin of D. rerio (right panel) as well as TniCEACAMI-III in brain, muscle, gut, kidney, heart, liver, gill, and skin of T. nigroviridis (left panel) using gene-specific primers (Table S4 in File S1).

These high F ST CEACAM/PSG SNPs included several CEACAM1 polymorphisms (F ST scores in the top 1% bracket: rs8111171, rs8110904, and rs8111468) that were repeatedly identified as targets of positive selection in human populations [56, 57] . The ancestral allele at rs8110904 was found in 99% of CEU populations whereas the derived allele was found in 100% of ASN populations (Table S6 in File S1). On the other hand, the derived allele of nonsynonymous SNPs in CEACAM8 (rs8103051) and PSG11 (rs10414166) were unique to YRI and CEU populations, respectively. The SNP rs12610545 in CEACAM18 was unique to Eurasians (Table S6 in File S1). Likewise, analysis based on the CEPH-HGDP project (Centre d'Etude du Polymorphisme Humain-Human Genome Diversity Panel; 944 unrelated individuals from 52 populations) [58, 59, 60] showed that nonsynonymous SNPs in PSG4, CEACAM1, CEACAM18, and CEACAM21 are among those with the highest population differentiation in world populations (Fig. S5 in File S1).

In addition, analysis of linkage disequilibrium (LD) at the CEACAM/PSG locus among HapMap II populations indicated that CEACAM7-5-6, PSG11-2-5-4, and CEACAM21-4 regions exhibit long-range LD patterns. Importantly, LD patterns in these regions are population specific. In the CEACAM7-5-6 region, extensive LD was obvious only in CEU and ASN, but not YRI populations (Fig. S6a in File S1). At the PSG11-2-5-4 region, a unique pattern of LD was only shared by CEU and YRI populations (Fig. S6b in File S1). On the other hand, extensive LD at the CEACAM21-4 region was only found in ASN populations (Fig. S6c in File S1). 

Syntenic mapping of chordate genomes showed that CEACAM orthologs are present in lower taxonomy, and the number of CEACAM homologs ranges from zero in amphioxus, tunicates, sea lamprey and chicken to more than three dozen in the opossum. The radical divergence of gene inventory occurred even among species under the same family, perhaps reflecting the extensive birth-and-death of CEACAM/PSG genes in response to environmental selection. Interestingly, CEACAM/PSG genes appeared to evolve in a similar manner in humans. The CECAM/PSG locus contained a higher density of nonsynonymous SNPs compared to other genes on the same chromosome. In addition, these genetic variations exhibited high population differentiation in geographically separated human populations. Similar to studies of SNPs, we found that structural variations are common at the PSG locus, and these copy number polymorphisms exhibit population differentiation. Together with earlier studies on the dN/dS ratio in primate and rodent species [22, 23] , these results indicated that CEACAM/PSG genes had a more dynamic evolutionary history than previously thought.

In the last decade, significant progress has been made in our understanding of CEACAM/PSG genes from species-specific searches to the elaborate analysis of positive and negative selection among species [22, 23] . However, due to the extensive divergence in CEACAM/PSG sequences, it has been difficult to extrapolate animal studies to humans and vice versa, thereby limiting our understanding of the molecular and biochemical nature of CEACAM/PSG signaling. Here, syntenic mapping has clarified the relationship of various CEACAM-like genes identified in noneutherian mammals and basal taxonomy. In addition, our analysis implied that the characteristic CEACAM-signaling pathway that involves the recruitment of downstream molecules such as phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, SHP1 phosphatase, and RAC-GTPase by ITAM or ITIM motifs could have evolved in the MRCA of teleosts and tetrapods, but not in urocordates, cephalochordates or sea lamprey [7, 61] . Furthermore, our analysis indicated that CEACAM/PSG gene family represents an independent branch of the immunoglobulin superfamily. Earlier analyses of adaptive immunity have shown that jawed and jawless vertebrates developed antigen receptors independently, and the hallmark of adaptive immunity of vertebrates, including major histocompatibility complex molecules and T/B-cell receptors originated in jawed vertebrates [42, 54] . Thus, the immunoglobulin variable and constant domain-containing CEACAM family genes have evolved in parallel with BCRs, TCRs, and FcRc receptors in jawed vertebrates.

Changes in selection pressures over time could leave diverse footprints of selection in genes. In general, the methods for detecting the action of selection vary with timescales. On the longest timescales, selection is evidenced by differences in gene inventory and gene functions. At shorter timescales, selection is indicated by an excess of nonsynonymous changes as compared to synonymous substitutions. At time scales ,80 thousand years, positively selected SNPs in humans could be detected by an excess of derived alleles in LD because there is no sufficient time for the genetic diversity to be restored by mutation and drift [56, 62] . However, none of these studies alone could provide a comprehensive view of how divergent the evolution of a gene family was. This is particularly true for gene families that contain redundant members. In addition, varied arrangements of functional domains among paralogs, such as those found in CEACAM/PSG genes, could add to the challenge of analysis of gene evolution [56, 62] . In the present study, we broadened the study of CEACAM/PSG gene evolution in two directions: the identification of CEACAM homologs in basal taxonomy (long timescale) and the investigation of genetic diversity in humans during a short timescale (i.e., after the Out-of-Africa human migration). On the first front, we found that CEACAM genes evolved in a radical manner in various lineages. In an extreme instance, these genes were completely lost (i.e., avian species). On the second front, we took two complementary approaches-local variations in density of coding SNPs/ CNVs and population-based assessment of genetic variations-to assess the extent of divergence. In these analyses, genes on chromosome 19, rather than the genome-wide samples, were selected to account for local substitution rate variation. In these analyses, we found CEACAM/PSG genes contain high density of nonsynonymous SNPs and CNVs, and many of these genetic variations exhibit high population differentiation, indicating extensive gene-environmental interactions at the CEACAM/ PSG locus. In addition, these data suggested that the selection force shaping the expanded CEACAM/PSG gene inventory in Old World primates is ongoing in humans. Whereas the underlying mechanism remains to be investigated, the evolutionary course of these genes could be a result of combinations of factors. First, the high frequency of genetic variations at the CEACAM/ PSG locus could be a result of relaxed constraint. Recent studies have revealed that an estimated 5-10% of the vertebrate gene repertoire consist of _progressive (vs. conserved) gene families which mainly function in immunity, reproduction, and chemosensory [25, 63, 64, 65] , and that ligands and cell surface receptors could be preferentially retained after gene duplications, perhaps due to low constraints imposed by fewer interacting protein partners compared to intracellular polypeptides that form complexes with many partners in two-way communication [66, 67] . Because CEACAMs and PSGs mainly function as cell surface receptor or secreted ligand, their evolution could be similar to that of a variety of progressive genes, including olfactory receptors, male gamete-associated reproductive genes, KIRs, and other immune-associated gene families, which experienced frequent birth-and-death of duplicated genes in response to environmental pressures.

Second, the frequent occurrence of CNVs at the PSG locus could be partly attributed to the presence of repetitive sequences.

It is well accepted that frequent gene gain and gene loss in progressive genes could be the result of unequal crossover of genes with repeated domains, which can promote rearrangements through their own repeatability [68, 69] . Similarly, recent studies have shown that CNV mutation rates in duplication-rich regions could be significantly higher than SNPs due to their propensity to undergo nonallelic homologous recombination, thereby making CNV to be recurrent at specific loci [70] . Physiologically, the redundancy of CEACAM/PSG genes could be selected for the provision of a robustness against null phenotypes in individuals [71, 72] . In support of this hypothesis, it has been shown that transgenic mice deficient for Ceacam1, 9, or 10 exhibit minimal or no aberrant phenotypes [3, 73, 74] . In addition, the enhanced redundancy could, theoretically, further reduce the constraint and add new opportunities for genetic drift or selection to operate on new alleles, thereby allowing the accumulation of nonsynonymous SNPs in duplicated PSG genes. However, it is important to note that the presence of repeated sequences alone could not account for the selection of high genetic variations at the CEACAM/PSG locus. Recent studies of CNV hotspots in humans have identified several duplication-rich regions on chromosome 19, which contain clusters of zinc finger proteins (ZNFs, with a total of 204 members on chromosome 19) [75] . However, these ZNF cluster loci did not exhibit appreciable increases of genetic variations as compared to other genes on chromosome 19. For example, the ratio of ZNF family genes that have a high F ST nonsynonymous SNP (5.4%) is similar to that of other genes on the same chromosome (3.2%).

Third, genetic variations at the CEACAM/PSG locus could be associated with functional elements that were selected by the environment. Recent analyses of SNPs showed that human genomes contain hundreds of loci that exhibit signatures of positive selection (i.e., gene-environmental interactions) [56, 76] , and a number of these genetic variants are associated with the evolution of a variety of common traits (e.g., appearance, physiological adaptations) and pathologies in humans [76, 77, 78, 79] . Likewise, CNVs have been associated with a number of human phenotypes and diseases [80, 81] . For example, amylase CNVs were highly associated starch contents of the food among human populations [82] , whereas, CNVs at the CCL3L-CCL4L locus were associated with the susceptibility to autoimmune disorders, HIV-1 infection, and asthma [83, 84, 85] . While PSG physiology could be dosage insensitive (PSG copy number could range from 12 to 30 in normal individuals), the observation that CEACAM/PSG variations are comparable to those of genes under rapid adaptive evolution in primates [86, 87] suggested that CEACAM/PSG variation-associated changes in functional characteristics or gene expression could help determine survival and reproductive success of the carrier.

Fourth, CEACAM/PSG genes, particularly PSGs, could be selected to provide a strict immunocompatibility between the mother and the infant, or to broaden pathogen resistance during pregnancy. Given that CEACAM/PSGs could act through homophilic and heterophilic interactions [7, 9] , the pressure to select new variants could be self-enforced if the carrier of a new immuno-modulation CEACAM/PSG variant favors fetus with the new variant as a result of immunocompatibility. By the same token, this mechanism could also contribute to the high population differentiation of select CEACAM/PSG variants. Therefore, our finding could represent an important vehicle for exploring novel genotype-phenotype relationships in PSG-mediated fetal-maternal interactions. In addition, our study raised the possibility that genetic variations at the PSG locus could be involved in the manifestation of reduced fertility and various pregnancy complications in select individuals. In support of our speculation, a recent report indicated that there could be a nominal relationship between PSG11 gene copy variation and the occurrence of preeclampsia [88] .

In a nutshell there are at least four factors, including (1) relaxed selection associated with cell surface molecules, (2) gene redundancy and functional robustness, (3) continual selection of functional elements, and (4) the maintenance of immunocompatibility, that could have contributed to the survival advantage and divergence of CEACAM/PSG genes.

Unifying Viral Genetics and Human Transportation Data to Predict the Global Transmission Dynamics of Human Influenza H3N2,"Information on global human movement patterns is central to spatial epidemiological models used to predict the behavior of influenza and other infectious diseases. Yet it remains difficult to test which modes of dispersal drive pathogen spread at various geographic scales using standard epidemiological data alone. Evolutionary analyses of pathogen genome sequences increasingly provide insights into the spatial dynamics of influenza viruses, but to date they have largely neglected the wealth of information on human mobility, mainly because no statistical framework exists within which viral gene sequences and empirical data on host movement can be combined. Here, we address this problem by applying a phylogeographic approach to elucidate the global spread of human influenza subtype H3N2 and assess its ability to predict the spatial spread of human influenza A viruses worldwide. Using a framework that estimates the migration history of human influenza while simultaneously testing and quantifying a range of potential predictive variables of spatial spread, we show that the global dynamics of influenza H3N2 are driven by air passenger flows, whereas at more local scales spread is also determined by processes that correlate with geographic distance. Our analyses further confirm a central role for mainland China and Southeast Asia in maintaining a source population for global influenza diversity. By comparing model output with the known pandemic expansion of H1N1 during 2009, we demonstrate that predictions of influenza spatial spread are most accurate when data on human mobility and viral evolution are integrated. In conclusion, the global dynamics of influenza viruses are best explained by combining human mobility data with the spatial information inherent in sampled viral genomes. The integrated approach introduced here offers great potential for epidemiological surveillance through phylogeographic reconstructions and for improving predictive models of disease control.","The emergence and worldwide dispersal of novel human pathogens is increasingly challenging global public health [1] .

Notable recent examples include novel influenza strains, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus and Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, which all exploit today's complex and voluminous transport networks to rapidly disseminate in a globalized world. In the context of human infectious diseases, the worldwide air transportation network is by far the best studied system of global mobility [2] . Air travel likely drives the global circulation of seasonal influenza A (H3N2) viruses [3] , and may explain seasonal dynamics in the absence of locally-persistent strains between epidemic seasons. Retrospective modeling of the 'Hong Kong flu' H3N2 pandemic in 1968 indicates that the virus spread through a global network of cities interconnected by air travel [4] . Numerous modeling and simulation studies have subsequently explored the potential influence of air travel on influenza virus spread, e.g. [5] [6] [7] [8] , but few have attempted to verify such models against underlying empirical data on human movement patterns [9] .

Two studies on the timing and rate of seasonal influenza transmission across the United States of America (USA) highlight the difficulty of using standard epidemiological data to disentangle the relative contributions of different human transportation systems to influenza spread. Using weekly time series of excess mortality due to pneumonia and influenza (P&I), Viboud et al. [9] demonstrated that the patterns of timing and incidence of outbreaks across the continental USA are most strongly associated with rates of movement of people to and from their workplaces, and to a lesser extent with the distance between locations and various measures of domestic transportation. In contrast, Brownstein et al. [10] concluded that the rate of inter-regional spread and timing of influenza in the USA, as measured using weekly P&I mortality statistics, is predicted by domestic airline travel volume in November. These discordant findings generated significant debate [11] , especially in the context of a potential pandemic of pathogenic influenza [12] , which would require rapid decisions to be made on the implementation of travel restrictions.

As a historical record of epidemic spread, viral genetic sequence data may offer a valuable source of information for the empirical verification of epidemiological models. Several studies have demonstrated their utility and power, for example by revealing the genetic dynamics of influenza A H3N2 seasonality [13] and the spatial patterns of global H3N2 circulation [3, 14] . More generally, it is recognized that the genetic diversity of rapidly evolving viruses like influenza should be analysed in a framework that unifies evolutionary and ecological dynamics [15] . Current attempts to reconstruct viral spread through time and space from genetic data, however, typically fit parameter-rich models to sparse spatial data and result in phylogeographic patterns that are difficult to relate directly to underlying ecological processes [16] . Together with potential sampling bias, this complicates phylogeographic tasks, such as the characterization of source-sink dynamics in seasonal influenza. It is therefore unsurprising that different studies on the global circulation of H3N2 are sometimes inconsistent [3, 14, 17] , despite the importance of such work for influenza surveillance and vaccine strain selection.

Here we use a model-based approach to explicitly tests spatial epidemiological hypotheses by integrating empirical data on human movement patterns with viral genetic data. This framework enables us to measure the relative contribution of different predictive variables to viral spatial spread. We apply this approach to seasonal H3N2 dynamics and use it to identify key drivers of the global dissemination of influenza viruses. Analysis of different sampling schemes, including one that represents the community structure in global air transportation, provides consistent support for air travel governing the spatial dynamics of seasonal H3N2 infections. Using epidemiological simulations, we further demonstrate that estimates resulting from the merger of human air travel and H3N2 influenza genetics best capture the observed global expansion of pandemic H1N1 influenza in 2009.

We complemented a previously collected hemagglutinin sequence data set, comprising 1,441 sequences sampled globally from 2002 to 2007 [3] , with publicly available sequences sampled within the same time interval. The allocation of the sequence data into 15 and 26 geographic regions as well as into 14 air communities is described in detail in Supporting information Text S1.

The worldwide air transportation network is defined by a passenger flux matrix that quantifies the number of passengers traveling between each pair of airports. We use a dataset provided by OAG (Official Airline Guide) Ltd. (http://www.oag.com), containing 4,092 airports and the number of seats on scheduled commercial flights between pairs of airports during the years 2004-2006. We take the number of seats on scheduled commercial flights from airport i to j to be proportional to the number of passengers traveling.

To identify air transportation communities, we approximate a maximal-modularity subdivision of the 1,227-largest-airport network by employing a recently described stochastic Monte-Carlo approach [18] . Modularity provides a measure of how well the connectivity of a network is described by partitioning its nodes into non-overlapping groups; for a definition we refer to [19] . For any given partition, modularity will be high if connectivity within groups is high and connectivity among groups is low. For large networks, a variety of methods have been introduced to approximate their optimal subdivision. The method we employ here generates an ensemble of high modularity subdivisions and computes the consensus in this ensemble by superposition. For further details we refer to [18, 20] and in Text S1 we describe how we incorporate subdivision uncertainty in our phylogeographic approach.

We employ a novel approach to simultaneously reconstruct spatiotemporal history and test the contribution of potential predictors of spatial spread. The approach extends a recently developed Bayesian method of phylogeographic inference [21] into a generalized linear model (GLM), by parameterizing each rate of among-location movement in the phylogeographic model as a log linear function of various potential predictors. For each predictor j, the GLM parameterization includes a coefficient b j , which quantifies the contribution or effect size of the predictor (in log space), and a binary indicator variable d j , that allows the predictor to be included or excluded from the model. We estimate the d variables using a Bayesian stochastic search variable selection (BSSVS) [22, 23] , resulting in an estimate of the posterior inclusion probability or support for each predictor. This approach uses the data to select the explanatory variables and their effect sizes from a pre-defined set of predictors that can explain the phylogenetic history of among-location movement while simultaneously

What explains the geographic dispersal of emerging pathogens? Reconstructions of evolutionary history from pathogen gene sequences offer qualitative descriptions of spatial spread, but current approaches are poorly equipped to formally test and quantify the contribution of different potential explanatory factors, such as human mobility and demography. Here, we use a novel phylogeographic method to evaluate multiple potential predictors of viral spread in human influenza dynamics. We identify air travel as the predominant driver of global influenza migration, whilst also revealing the contribution of other mobility processes at more local scales. We demonstrate the power of our inter-disciplinary approach by using it to predict the global pandemic expansion of H1N1 influenza in 2009. Our study highlights the importance of integrating evolutionary and ecological information when studying the dynamics of infectious disease.

reconstructing the ancestral locations in the evolutionary history. In Text S1, we (i) provide more mathematical detail of the GLM model, (ii) describe novel transition kernels for efficient statistical inference, (iii) propose prior specifications and (iv) explain how Bayes factors can be calculated for each predictor based on d estimates. The method introduced here is implemented in the BEAST software package [24] .

The GLM approach offers many statistical advantages over other approaches [25] in efficiently testing spatial hypotheses (see Text S1 for a detailed comparative analysis). Commonlyused Bayesian measures of model fit (such as marginal likelihood estimation using the harmonic mean), which can be applied to models with among-location movement rates fixed to a particular predictor, have been shown to perform poorly [26] [27] [28] . Although more accurate alternatives have recently been proposed [26] [27] [28] , they are computationally prohibitive on large data sets such as those studied here. Importantly, the previous approach provides only a relative ranking of different models and, unlike the GLM model, cannot identify which of the top-ranked predictors need to be jointly considered as explanatory variables. A further advantage of the GLM approach is that in addition to providing a measure of support for each predictor, it can also quantify the contribution or effect size of each predictor by estimating the associated coefficients (b).

For the spread of seasonal influenza, we consider several potential predictors of global migration, including different logtransformed measures of geographical distance, absolute latitude, air transportation data, demographic and economic data, viral surveillance data, antigenic evolution and sequence sample sizes (described in more detail in Text S1). Text S1 also reports the evolutionary and demographic models used in BEAST and describes how phylogenetic uncertainty is approximated during phylogeographic inference.

Phylogeographic movement events among locations are modeled by a continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) process along each branch of the viral phylogeny. Although both the transitions among locations (Markov jumps) and the waiting times between transitions (Markov rewards) are not directly observed, posterior expectations of these values can be efficiently computed [29, 30] . Here, we implement posterior inference of the complete Markov jump history through time in BEAST and use these estimates to assess the source-sink dynamics of influenza and to evaluate the predictive performance of phylogeographic models.

To compare the performance of different migration rate models in predicting global pandemic spread, we simulate a stochastic meta-population susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model with n = 14 populations, matching the 14 air communities analyzed in the phylogeographic model. The model tracks the number of susceptible (S), infected (I) and recovered (R) individuals in each population each day of the simulation. The simulations begin with a single initial infection in Mexico on January 5th 2009 [31] . Infection spreads through mass-action within each population according to the following epidemiological parameters. Population-specific host population size is equal to human population size (Text S1). Basic epidemiological parameters are based on empirical estimates from H1N1: the duration of infection was chosen as 3 days [31] and the basic reproductive number (R 0 ) or average number of secondary infections arising from a primary infector during their infectious period in a completely susceptible population was chosen as 1.3 [31] . This results in a transmission rate b~0:433. Although estimates of R 0 for pandemic H1N1 vary across studies, the exact R 0 value is unlikely to affect the comparative simulations we perform as this is expected to equally impact the overall expansion rate and not the relative migration dynamics across populations. Force of infection l j within population j scales with infected frequency across populations following l j~P n i~1 r ij bI i S j =N j , where the coupling coefficient r ij represents the rate of contacts from population i to population j relative to within-population contacts and r jj~1 . Other pairwise coupling coefficients are taken to be proportional to pairwise migration estimates, so that r ij~c m ij , where m ij is the air travel based or phylogenetically estimated rate of migration from population i to population j per year and parameter c is fitted to the data. Parameter c is the only free parameter in this model and we set this to the value that maximizes correspondence between simulations and observations (see below). This ensures that we can use phylogeographic migration rates as per capita migration rates in the simulation model, despite their different scales. Compartments are updated according to a t-leaping algorithm [32] with one-day intervals.

Migration rates between populations in the SIR model are defined according to four scenarios, as follows: (A) equal rates, (B) rates proportional to the amount of air travel occurring between them (in terms of the number of passengers moving from one population to another), (C) rates proportional to Markov jump estimates based on a standard phylogeographic model (undertaken with and without BSSVS to reduce the number of rate parameters) and (D) a GLM model that only considers air travel as a predictor. To compare the spread of influenza under these simulated models to recorded H1N1 pandemic spread, we measure the relative correspondence between the mean peak times (across 100 simulations) and the observed peak times for all locations except Mexico (based on World Health Organization data; Text S1). Correspondence was measured using the Spearman's rank correlation coefficient, and tested with associated p-values obtained using a permutation test (Text S1), as well as using the mean average error (MAE; in days). We consider the Spearman's rank correlation coefficients to be more appropriate for our comparison because they are more robust to outliers, which are clearly present in the observed peaks. Therefore, the scaling of between-population coupling c for the various migration matrices was also adjusted so as to maximize Spearman's rank correlation.

To identify key factors in the seasonal dispersal of human influenza viruses, we use a Bayesian model selection procedure to estimate the phylogeographic history of H3N2 viruses sampled worldwide between 2002 and 2007 (Text S1), while concurrently evaluating the contribution of several potential predictors of spatial spread. In addition to considering two geographic discretizations of the available data, we also identify community structure in global air travel by determining partitions with high intracommunity connectivity and low inter-community connectivity (Methods). Although this approach is blind to the airports' geographic locations, the 14 resulting global air communities are spatially compact with few exceptions (Fig. 1) . We find air communities that are largely specific to Oceania, China, Japan, Sub-Saharan Africa, Mexico and Canada. Madagascar, Réunion and some Caribbean destinations are examples of exceptions that are, as non-European locations, connected to a European air community.

Our analysis reveals that many potential predictors of global influenza virus spread are not associated with viral lineage movement, specifically, geographical proximity, demography and economic measures, antigenic divergence, epidemiological synchronity and seasonality do not yield noticeable support (Fig. 2) . Instead, we find consistent and strong evidence that air passenger flow is the dominant driver of the global dissemination of H3N2 influenza viruses. This is reflected in both the estimated size of the effect of this variable (*1 on a log scale) and the statistical support for its inclusion in the model (posterior probability .0.93 and Bayes factor .760). This effect size means that viral lineage movement rates are about 15 times higher for connections with the highest passenger flow compared to connections with the lowest flow, controlling for all other predictors. The result is robust when we repeat the analysis (i) using different partitions of sampling locations (air communities and different geographic partitions, Fig. 2 ), (ii) using different sequence sub-samples for the air communities (Fig. S1 ), (iii) using the full data set or a small but more balanced number of sub-samples (Fig. S2) , and (iv) using a more liberal prior specification on predictor inclusion (Fig. S3) . We down-sampled particular air communities or geographic regions relative to their population sizes (Text S1), which still leaves considerable heterogeneity in sample sizes, explaining why they are included as an explanatory variable in the GLM model. Our aim is not to demonstrate a role for sample sizes in phylogeography, but by explicitly including them as predictive variables, we raise the credibility that other predictors are not included in the model because of sampling bias. We note that the sample size predictors may in fact absorb some of the effect of air travel because a GLM model that only considers passenger flux as a predictor of H3N2 movement among the air communities results in a higher mean effect of size of about 1.5.

To also explore spatial dynamics at smaller scales, we further partition large geographical regions that are administratively coherent, such as the USA, China, Japan and Australia, resulting in 26 global sampling regions (Text S1). In this analysis, air travel again predicts viral movement (posterior probability .0.99 and Bayes factor .18000), but the movement is also inversely associated with geographical distance between locations (posterior probability = 0.76 and Bayes factor = 87), and, less intuitively, with origin and destination population densities (although the size of the latter effects are weaker, Fig. 2 ). The negative association of population density with viral movement may suggest that commuting is less likely, per capita, to occur out of, or into, dense subpopulations.

Although not the main focus of the current study, our integrated approach also provides phylogeographic reconstructions that offer insights into the global source-sink dynamics of human influenza. The trunk or backbone of phylogenies reconstructed from temporally-sampled hemagglutinin genes (Fig. 3) represents the lineage that successfully persists from one epidemic year to the next [14, 33] . We determine the spatial history of this lineage using Markov rewards in the posterior tree distribution, thereby estimating the contribution of each location to the persistence of the trunk lineage from 2002 to 2006 (Fig. 3) . These estimates provide strong support for mainland China as the principal H3N2 source population, occupying close to 60% of the trunk time in the H3N2 phylogenies (Fig. 3) , followed by Southeast Asia, which comprises about 15% of the trunk time. We further examine temporal heterogeneity in the source-sink process by combining a summary of the estimated trunk location through time together with an phylogenetic summary in Fig. 3 impact of temporal sampling heterogeneity on these estimates because the Southeast Asian trunk dominance precedes a period of higher sampling availability for Southeast Asia relative to mainland China (Fig. 3) . The important role of mainland China in seeding the global seasonal spread of human influenza results in a high net migration out of this air community (Fig. S4) . However, air communities that do not contribute significantly to the trunk can also maintain high net outflow, in particular the USA, which may be seeded by relatively few introductions each year whilst exporting comparatively more viruses to other locations during the epidemic season.

In order to assess the extent to which evolutionary analyses such as ours benefit from integrating host mobility data, we examine their predictive performance by using them to predict the relative timing of the geographic spread of the pandemic H1N1 influenza variant that emerged in 2009. We conduct simulations of the spread of a novel pathogen out of Mexico using an SIR model whose transmission parameters are informed by epidemiological estimates obtained for pandemic H1N1 [31] and whose spatial spread is determined by one of four different migration rate models, each defined by a different matrix of movement rates among all pairs of locations (Methods). We measure the relative correspondence between the simulated and observed H1N1 peaks for each location except Mexico using a Spearman's rank correlation coefficient (r) and mean absolute error (MAE; in days) (Fig. 4 ). An equal rates model (A), which does not express any migration rate preference, results in a weak match (r~0:11, P = 0.73, MAE = 40.9 days) between the simulations and the observed spatial spread of H1N1 (Fig. 4) , indicating that the population sizes included in the SIR model for each region offer limited predictive performance. As expected, adding information on the number of airline passengers (model B) yields a large improvement in correspondence between simulations and observations (r~0:61, P = 0.03, MAE = 35.8 days). In contrast, a standard parameterrich phylogeographic model that is only informed by sequence data and not air traffic information (model C) yields only part of this improvement in predictive performance (r~0:47, P = 0.10, MAE = 39.4 days). However, if inference under model C is made more efficient by focusing on a small set of parameters (using BSSVS, [21] ; see Methods) then phylogeographic estimates yield a predictive performance (r~0:62, P = 0.02, MAE = 36.4 days, Fig. S5 ) that is close to that of the air travel model (B). Finally, The inclusion probabilities are defined by the indicator expectations E½d because they reflect the frequency at which the predictor is included in the model and therefore represent the support for the predictor. Indicator expectations corresponding to Bayes factor support values of 10 and 100 are represented by a thin and thick vertical line respectively in these bar plots. The contribution of each predictor, when included in the model (bDd~1), where b is the coefficient or effect size, is represented by the mean and credible intervals of the GLM coefficients on a log scale. NA 1 : no conditional effect size available because the predictor was never included in the model. We tested different population size and density measures, different incidence-based measures and different seasonal measures (Text S1), but only list the estimates for a representative predictor for the sake of clarity. The estimates for the full set of predictors are summarized for each sub-sampled data set in Fig. S5 . NA 2 : no indicator expectation or conditional effect size available because the predictor was not available for this discretization of the sequence data. doi:10.1371/journal.ppat.1003932.g002 the GLM model (D) predicts the observed spread of H1N1 more accurately than all other models (r~0:82, P,0.01, MAE = 32.3), suggesting that global influenza transmission is best predicted by combining passenger flux data with the information on viral lineage movement contained in sequence data. The simulations generally correspond better with observed H1N1 peaks during the initial period of pandemic expansion, while the epidemic peaks for Russia and Africa occur significantly earlier in the simulations than in reality. This is likely due to the multi-peaked character of the regional epidemics (Text S1); the H1N1 virus spreads to most of the world during the first pandemic wave, whereas regions like Russia and Africa appeared to miss the first wave entirely. Seasonal effects that are unaccounted for by our simulation may at least partly explain the outliers, but they affect the models we aim to compare in a very similar way. Because of the outliers, we consider the non-parametric Spearman's r to be a more appropriate measure of correspondence than the MAE, but they are consistent in their model ranking. We note that absolute prediction errors can be considerably improved by only considering the 9 air communities that peaked prior to September, 2009, which returns a MAE of 11.2 day for the GLM model. However, because of the difficulties in establishing initial waves and their peaks, and the uncertainty in our epidemiological model, we caution against more detailed interpretation of these simulations beyond the general trends we extract here.

The prevention and control of influenza at the global scale relies critically on our understanding of its mode of geographical dissemination. Here, we demonstrate that such dynamics are most powerfully investigated by combining phylogeographic history with empirical data on the patterns of human movement worldwide. Our analysis strongly suggests that air travel is key to global influenza spread, an intuitive result that has long been predicted by modeling studies (e.g. [5] ), but has, until now, remained difficult to obtain from empirical data. The dominant predictors of influenza spread will undoubtedly be scale-dependent, as indicated here by the importance of geographic distance as a predictor within more confined geographic areas (Fig. 2) , which may represent forms of human mobility other than air travel, such as workplace commuting [9] . This indicates that our statistical framework could also prove valuable in testing hypotheses at smaller scales, where the underlying spatial processes may be less obvious, provided adequate sequence and empirical movement data are available. One of the limitations of the current heterogeneous sampling of H3N2 sequences worldwide is that geographic partitions need to be adjusted to account for the number of samples per location, which results in regions of widely different areas and population sizes. More representative sampling across the globe, or within a more geographically confined area of interest, will allow for more appropriate geographic partitioning and may facilitate more detailed spatial hypothesis testing based on the associated demographic and mobility measures. In particular, if sequences were sampled appropriately then our inference method could incorporate the rich geographic data that is currently available as global gridded population data sets [34] . In addition, many of the predictors used here can be improved in accuracy and resolution, for example by accounting for seat occupancy and actual origin-destination flows in air traffic passenger fluxes.

Due to the difficulties associated with geographic partitioning, we used algorithms to optimally define communities in the global air transportation network as an alternative strategy to specify phylogeographic states, and subsequently show that our GLM results are robust to the different partitions used. Because air travel is a consistent and highly supported explanatory variable for global influenza dispersal, communities within the air transportation network are likely to provide the most appropriate spatial structuring of our data. However, in addition to the partitioning itself, further research is also needed to select the appropriate number of samples from the resulting regions to improve on ad hoc down-sampling based on population size.

Although identifying the causes of pathogen spread is of great importance in spatial epidemiology, integrating this information in evolutionary models also offers major advantages for phylogeographic reconstructions and their relevance to infectious disease surveillance and pandemic preparedness. By capturing a more realistic process of spatial spread, our novel approach results in more credible reconstructions of spatial evolutionary history, which may shed further light on the persistence and migration dynamics of human influenza viruses. Because of the importance of influenza dynamics for vaccine strain selection, different phylogeographic reconstructions have attempted to characterize the global population structure of the virus and have arrived at somewhat mixed findings [3, 14, 17] . This may be explained by the use of both different sampling and different methodology. The data and methods used here corroborate the explorations of antigenic and genetic divergence by [3] and demonstrate the prominence of mainland China and Southeast Asia as locations of trunk lineage persistence. Our findings are however based on roughly the same genetic data, and our approach of inferring the spatial history of the trunk lineage through Markov reward estimates may be viewed as the more direct, statistical equivalent of measuring strain location distance from the trunk [3] . Although we find a strong signal for the presence of the trunk lineage in mainland China and Southeast Asia, our analysis is restricted to the period 2002 to 2006, and thus we make no conclusions about the location of the trunk lineage outside of this period. The degree of temporal stochasticity in the source location of seasonal influenza and its heterogeneity among different influenza variants has yet to be determined and requires datasets of longer duration. Moreover, we suggest that analyses of future data sets that are more comprehensively sampled through time will also benefit from phylogeographic models that can accommodate temporal heterogeneity in movement rates. Such models may also improve the performance of some explanatory variables. For example, in the analysis presented here, we do not consider the absence of support for seasonality as a predictor in our GLM model as evidence against seasonality in H3N2 spread. Rather, it simply reflects the difficulty in incorporating seasonality into a time-homogeneous model of lineage movement. Developments are now underway to appropriately accommodate heterogeneity in spatial spread through time.

By using models to predict the observed global emergence of pandemic H1N1, we demonstrate that an approach that integrates passenger flux data with viral genetic data provides a more accurate prediction of global epidemic spread than those which include only one source of information. Although the prediction improvement of the combined data over the passenger flux data alone is not very large, it remains remarkable because we attempt to predict the spatial expansion of an epidemic lineage (pandemic H1N1) from the seasonal dynamics of another lineage (H3N2) and because the main process underlying the global dispersal of H3N2 influenza appears to be air travel itself. Passenger flux data among pairs of locations is symmetric, thus it is possible that the phylogeographic data is capable of capturing asymmetry in the seasonal process of viral spread, which may also be important in explaining the spatial expansion of pandemic H1N1. Investigations using more advanced simulation techniques, e.g. [35] , may be able to build upon the conceptual bridge between genetic data and epidemiological modeling implied by our findings. Future prediction efforts may also need to focus on alternative scenarios of spatial spread, as highlighted by the recent emergence of a novel avian influenza H7N9 lineage in China [36] . Should this virus evolve sustained human-to-human transmissibility, then airline-passenger data and flight routes from the outbreak regions in particular, would be able to pinpoint worldwide regions of immediate risk. If the virus remains restricted to avian hosts, however, risk maps for the transmission of avian influenza viruses (perhaps based on predictors calibrated against H5N1 avian influenza) may help to target H7N9 surveillance and control efforts. In conclusion, our framework is applicable to different infectious diseases and provides new opportunities for explicitly testing how host behavior and ecology shapes the spatial distribution of pathogen genetic diversity.

The XML file, airCommunitiesMM_1.xml, specifies the data for one of the air community subsets as well as the model and MCMC settings. The empirical trees file required to run the analysis, subset1.trees, contains a sample of 500 trees from the posterior distribution of the sequence analysis. (ZIP) Figure S1 Predictors of global H3N2 diffusion among the 14 air communities for three different sub-samples of the sequence data. Each combination of inclusion probability bar plot and corresponding coefficient plot represents the GLM results for one of the three different sub-samples of the H3N2 sequence data. These sub-samples were obtained by randomly down-sampling the four locations with the highest number of samples relative to their population size for each sampling year. The inclusion probabilities are defined by the indicator expectations E½d because they reflect the frequency at which the predictor is included in the model and therefore represent the support for the predictor. Indicator expectations corresponding to Bayes factor support values of 10 and 100 are represented by a thin and thick vertical line respectively in these bar plots. The contribution of each predictor, when included in the model (bDd~1), where b is the coefficient or effect size, is represented by the mean and credible intervals of the GLM coefficients on a log scale. If the inclusion probability is zero for a predictor, no corresponding GLM coefficient is shown. We tested different population size and density measures, different incidencebased measures and different seasonal measures (Text S1), but only list the estimates for a representative predictor for the sake of clarity.

These sub-samples were obtained by randomly down-sampling 25 sequences from locations for which the number samples available exceeded that number. The inclusion probabilities are defined by the indicator expectations E½d because they reflect the frequency at which the predictor is included in the model and therefore represent the support for the predictor.

As opposed the analysis reported in main manuscript (Fig. 2) , which specifies a prior probability of 0.019 on each predictor's inclusion, we here specify a prior probability of 0.5 on the inclusion of each predictor. Indicator expectations corresponding to Bayes factor support values of 3 and 20 are shown as a thin and thick vertical line respectively in these bar plots. The contribution of each predictor, when included in the model (bDd~1), where b is the coefficient or effect size, is represented by the mean and credible intervals of the GLM coefficients on a log scale.

We tested different population size and density measures, different incidence-based measures and different seasonal measures (Text S1), but only list the estimates for a representative predictor for the sake of clarity. NA 2 : no indicator expectation or conditional effect size available because the predictor was not available for this discretization of the sequence data. A comparison with the analysis reported in main manuscript (Fig. 2) indicates that our results are robust to the prior specification for the inclusion probabilities; only the scale of the Bayes factor support shifts to lower values because of the higher prior odds (1:1 as opposed to 0.019:0.981) in this case.

"Comparative Analysis of Transcriptional Profiles of Adult Schistosoma japonicum from Different Laboratory Animals and the Natural Host, Water Buffalo","Schistosomiasis is one of the most widely distributed parasitic diseases in the world. Schistosoma japonicum, a zoonotic parasite with a wide range of mammalian hosts, is one of the major pathogens of this disease. Although numerous studies on schistosomiasis japonica have been performed using laboratory animal models, systematic comparative analysis of whole-genome expression profiles in parasites from different laboratory animals and nature mammalian hosts is lacking to date.","Schistosomiasis is one of the most serious parasitic diseases and affects more than 200 million people globally, based on conservative estimates [1, 2] . Schistosomiasis is caused mainly by three Schistosoma species: Schistosoma japonicum, Schistosoma mansoni, and Schistosoma haematobium. S. japonicum is endemic in Asia, principally China and the Philippines, whereas S. mansoni and S. haematobium are distributed in Africa and the Middle East. S. mansoni is also prevalent in South America [3] . Schistosomes have a complex developmental life cycle and exhibit sexual dimorphism. The life cycle comprises seven morphologically discrete stages (i.e., egg, miracidium, mother sporocyst, daughter sporocyst, cercaria, juvenile schistosomulum, and adult worm), complicating the control and prevention of schistosomiasis [4] . In contrast to the other two Schistosoma species known to infect humans, S. japonicum is a true zoonotic parasite that utilizes a wide range of mammalians as definitive hosts, including bovines, mice, rabbits, goats, pigs, and dogs [5, 6] .

Previous studies have indicated that the susceptibility of different mammalian hosts to S. japonicum infection varies; water buffaloes, rats, horses, and pigs are less susceptible to infection than mice, rabbits, yellow cattle, and goats [5] . Schistosomes derived from different mammalian hosts also exhibit visible changes in morphology, such as the length and width of worms, tegument, sucker and gynoecophorus [7, 8] . In the last decade, a number of gene expression profiling studies of schistosomes have been conducted using various analytical approaches, and the findings have tremendously facilitated improved understanding of the molecular basis of schistosome developmental biology, host-parasite interactions and the pathogenesis of schistosomiasis (see more in reviews [9] [10] [11] ). The majority of schistosomes used in those studies were isolated from laboratory animals such as BALB/c mice, C57BL/6 mice, and New Zealand white rabbits.

Recently, numerous differentially expressed genes that may influence parasite survival and development were identified by comparative proteomic analyses [12] and microarray analysis [13] of schistosomula from susceptible BALB/c mice, less susceptible Wistar rats and resistant reed voles. Yang et al. comparatively analyzed the gene expression profiles of S. japonicum derived from natural reservoir host yellow cattle, goats and water buffaloes using microarrays, and suggested that the gene expression patterns of some genes in schistosomes in natural hosts and laboratory animals may be diverse [7, 8] . Data obtained using laboratory animals may not be completely transferable to natural hosts. A comparison of the gene expression profile of S. japonicum in its natural reservoir hosts and laboratory animals will undoubtedly facilitate our understanding of parasite biology. Previous epidemiological studies have revealed that bovines, particularly water buffaloes, are the major natural reservoir of S. japonicum and play a vital role in schistosomiasis transmission in China [14] [15] [16] [17] . Therefore, we performed comparative analyses of the gene expression profiles of S. japonicum from the natural reservoir host, water buffalo, with those from laboratory animal mice and rabbits using a genome-wide microarray approach. Our results will be of significance for the screening of anti-schistosome targets and vaccine candidates using laboratory animals to further facilitate the control of schistosomiasis in natural reservoir hosts in endemic areas.

All procedures performed on animals in this study were conducted following animal husbandry guidelines of the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and with permission from the Experimental Animal Committee with the Ethical Clearance Number IPB-2011-6.

S. japonicum-infected Oncomelania hupensis were provided by the Hunan Institute of Parasitic Diseases, Yueyang, China. Laboratory BALB/c mice (nine mice), C57BL/6 mice (nine mice), New Zealand white rabbits (three rabbits) and natural reservoir host water buffaloes (three buffaloes) were infected with 40-400 freshly released cercariae through the upper back using the cover glass method [18] . Adult worms were perfused out the hepatic portal vein of infected animals at approximately 7 weeks, washed briefly with PBS and soaked immediately in RNAlater Solution (Ambion, CA, USA) and stored at -80°C until total RNA was extracted.

Total RNA was extracted from worms from different animals using the RNeasy Mini kit (QIA-GEN), and contaminating genomic DNA was removed from RNA samples using a DNA-free kit (Ambion, CA, USA). The quantity and quality of the RNA samples were assessed using a ND-1000 spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technologies, Wilmington, DE) and denaturing agarose gel electrophoresis.

Schistosome genome-wide microarrays were used to analyze the gene expression profiles of S. japonicum derived from different laboratory animals and the natural host, water buffalo. The design and construction of the microarray and the methods used in microarray hybridization and feature extraction have been previously reported [19] [20] [21] . The full details of this schistosome microarray design have been deposited in the Gene Expression Omnibus public database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo) under platform accession number GPL18617. Briefly, a total of 21,861 target sequences (20, 194 sequences derived from S. japonicum and 1667 sequences derived from S. mansoni) were provided to Roche NimbleGen for array design. For each sequence, 3 or 4 60-mer oligonucleotide probes were designed. Probes with random sequences were printed as negative control (background signal) and eight spike-RNA probes from the intergenic sequence of yeast as hybridization controls. The microarray was manufactured by Roche NimbleGen. Microarrays were printed in a 12×135 K feature format. cDNA was labeled with a fluorescent dye (Cy3-dCTP) using cRNA Amplification and Labeling Kit (CapitalBio, Beijing, China). Hybridization was performed using three biological replicates for all samples at CapitalBio. Procedures of array hybridization, washing, scanning, and data acquisition were carried out according to the NimbleGen Arrays user's guide. The arrays were scanned using MS200 scanner (NimbleGen Systems) with 2 μm resolution, and NimbleScan software (NimbleGen) was used to extract fluorescent intensity raw data from the scanned images. The normalized expression data of genes was generated using the Robust Multichip Average (RMA) algorithm [22] [23] [24] , which consisted of three steps: a background adjustment, quantile normalization and final summarization. The outlier probes were identified and the contribution of outlier probes was reduced in the reported gene expression level, which has been demonstrated to improve the sensitivity and reproducibility of microarray results. Then, the expression value of a gene is a weighted average of all probes when both background correction and quantile normalization were performed. Raw data and normalized gene level data from the arrays have been deposited at the public database Gene Expression Omnibus under the accession number GSE65327. Genes were considered differentially expressed by expression fold-change (FC) 2 between any two compared worm samples and p<0.05 (Student's t-test). The stably and abundantly expressed genes among the adult worms from the four mammalian hosts were extracted using coefficient of variation (CV) 0.1 and fluorescence intensity 10,000 on the basis of retrieval of a panel of well characterized Schistosoma genes of which the intensity values were greater than 10,000. Hierarchical clustering analysis of selected genes was performed to generate heat maps using the software Cluster 3.0 [25] and Heatmap Builder 1.0 [26] .

A subset of genes with different expression patterns were selected for further validation using real-time PCR as previously described [19] . Real-time PCR primers were designed using Primer Express 3.0 software (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, USA) (S1 Table) . For each sample, 1 μg of total RNA was used to synthesize the first strand cDNA using a Reverse Transcriptase Kit (Invitrogen, CA, USA) with oligo (dT) 12-18 primers (Invitrogen) in a final volume of 20 μl. PCR reactions were performed in technological triplicate on a 7300 Real-Time PCR system (Applied Biosystems) using SYBR Green QPCR Master Mix (Agilent Technologies, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The 26S proteasome non-ATPase regulatory subunit 4 gene (PSMD4, GenBank Accession No. FN320595), which has been validated as a reliable reference gene in transcriptomic analysis of S. japonicum, was employed as a reference gene in the real-time PCR analysis [19] . The relative expression level of each gene was analyzed using SDS 1.4 software (Applied Biosystems).

Gene sequences were functionally annotated using Blast2GO [27] , and the output provided combined graphics for three categories of gene ontology (GO) terms: biological processes, molecular functions, and cellular components. The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) automated annotation server was used to assign pathway-based functional orthology to differentially expressed genes [28] . Signal peptides were predicted using the program SignalP 4.1 server employing both the neural network and hidden Markov model [29] , and transmembrane helices were predicted using TMHMM 2.0 [30] .

Identification and phylogenetic analysis of S. japonicum venomallergen-like protein (SjVAL) genes SjVAL genes were identified using the BLASTp and InterProScan [31] algorithms. Initially, the sequences of S. mansoni venom-allergen-like proteins (SmVALs) [32] were used for BLASTp searches of S. japonicum predicted protein sequence database [33] and the non-redundant protein sequence database [34, 35] of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) (e-value cut-off: 10 −5 ). CD-HIT v4.5.4 software (http://www.bioinformatics.org/cd-hit/) was then used to eliminate redundant protein sequences from the obtained putative SjVALs using the criteria of 95% identity and 80% coverage between two sequences. Finally, all remaining protein sequences were confirmed by the presence of SCP/TAPS-representative protein domains (IPR014044) using InterProScan [31] . A phylogenetic relationship tree was built using the full-length amino acid sequences of Schistosoma VALs in the following steps. First, sequences were aligned using ClustalX [36] and then refined manually, and a phylogenetic tree was finally generated using MEGA 5.0 software [37] by the neighbor-joining (NJ) method (the bootstrap test was performed with 1000 replicates). 

AAY43180.1 (SmVAL1), AAY43181.1 (SmVAL2), AAZ04923.2 (SmVAL3), AAY43182.1 (SmVAL4), ABB88846.2 (SmVAL5), CCD74794.1 (SmVAL6), AAZ04924.1 (SmVAL7), ABW98681.1 (SmVAL8), ABB88845.1 (SmVAL9), ABO09814.2 (SmVAL10), ABA54555.1 (SmVAL11), ABB88844.1 (SmVAL12), ABB88843.1 (SmVAL13), ABO09815.1 (SmVAL14), CCD80670.1 (SmVAL15), CCD74792.1 (SmVAL16), CCD74934.1 (SmVAL17), CCD80318.1 (SmVAL18), CCD80317.1 (SmVAL19), CCD80812.1 (SmVAL20), CCD80564.1 (SmVAL21), CCD59744.1 (SmVAL22), CCD80666.1 (SmVAL24), CCD80667.1 (SmVAL25), CCD80638.1 (SmVAL26), CCD80648.1 (SmVAL27) and CCD80636.1 (SmVAL28).

This study compared the transcriptional profiles of adult worms isolated from experimental animals (BALB/c mice, C57BL/6 mice and New Zealand white rabbits) and the natural host (water buffaloes) using genome-wide microarray analyses and combinatorial bioinformatics. First, we assessed a common correlation of all the genes within arrays between biological replicates of schistosomes from the same host to assess the quality of the biological replicates. As expected, the correlation coefficient (r) between biological replicates was >0.99, demonstrating a strong consistency between the biological replicates of worms from the same host (Table 1) . Similar results were obtained by correlation analyses of biological replicates for the global expression profiles of schistosomes from water buffaloes, yellow cattle and goats [7, 8] . We then investigated the transcriptional profile correlation between worm samples from different hosts using an average of three biological replicates. The results demonstrated that the transcriptional profiles between worms from different hosts were also highly similar as a whole (r>0.98, Table 2 ).

A series of pairwise comparisons between schistosomes isolated from the four mammalian hosts was performed to identify differentially expressed genes. Using FC2 and p<0.05, subsets of differentially expressed gene products were identified: 180 (buffalo vs. C57BL/6), 116 (buffalo vs. BALB/c), 97 (buffalo vs. rabbit), 263 (rabbit vs. C57BL/6), 172 (rabbit vs. BALB/c) and 67 (C57BL/6 vs. BALB/c). The distributions of the up-and down-regulated genes between the paired comparisons are displayed as scatter plots (Fig 1 and S2 Table) . It is understandable that adult worms from C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice shared more similar transcriptional profiles than those from rabbits and buffaloes due to the evolutionary distance between the two animal species. Previous studies have shown that fewer differentially expressed genes were identified in schistosomes between water buffalo and yellow cattle (69 genes) than between water buffalo and goat (485 genes) [7, 8] .

After integrating these subsets of differentially expressed genes, a total of 450 non-redundant genes were used for hierarchical clustering to enable collective visualization by gene and array (See supplementary S3 Table for details). As expected, these genes were clustered into four subgroups, of which genes of the biological replicates were clustered together, and branched by the host origination of the samples (Fig 2) . The result further demonstrated high consistency between the biological replicates. The heat map demonstrated that these differentially expressed genes clustered into two major transcriptional patterns: cluster I, genes that were up-regulated in schistosomes isolated from C57BL/6 mice and BALB/c mice and downregulated in schistosomes isolated from buffaloes and rabbits; and cluster II, genes that were down-regulated in schistosomes isolated from C57BL/6 mice and BALB/c mice and up- regulated in schistosomes isolated from buffaloes and rabbits (Fig 2) . Meanwhile, several other clusters of differentially expressed genes were also identified by hierarchical clustering: cluster III, genes highly expressed in the worms from rabbits; cluster IV, genes up-regulated in worms from buffaloes; cluster V, genes up-regulated in worms from C57BL/6 mice; and cluster VI, genes highly expressed in worms from BALB/c mice (Fig 2) . A list of representative differentially expressed genes from each cluster is displayed in detail as a heat map (Fig 3) .

We also compared our results with previous studies on gene expression profiles of S. japonicum derived from the natural mammalian hosts, buffaloes, cattle and goats [7, 8] . Some of these differentially expressed genes in adult schistosomes from the different hosts have been identified in previous studies, such as CNUS0000098059, CNUS0000105021, CNUS0000096235, CNUS0000102644, FN318955 and FN313838. Meanwhile, a number of differentially expressed genes identified by previous studies were not identified in our study since the fluorescence intensity values of these genes were below the cut-off value (S4 Table) .

To validate the microarray transcription data, a subset of ten genes with various biological functions and different expression patterns was selected for real-time PCR validation. The realtime PCR results well matched the microarray data (Fig 4) with a significant correlation factor of 0.943 (Spearman's Rho, p<0.0001, n = 40), thereby validating the microarray results. GO and KEGG pathway analyses of differentially expressed genes GO analysis was performed to summarize and explore the major GO categories of the differentially expressed genes which may be susceptible to host environments. A total of 174 gene sequences were annotated with GO terms in three independent categories: biological processes (161 gene sequences), molecular functions (170 gene sequences), and cellular components (50 gene sequences) (Fig 5 and S3 Table) . The biological processes analysis revealed that the Hierarchical clustering of differentially expressed genes in worms from BALB/c mice, C57BL/6 mice, rabbits and water buffaloes. The heat map of 450 differentially expressed genes extracted from the microarray dataset is shown (three biological replicates were performed for each worm sample). Six major clusters of differentially expressed genes were identified: cluster I, genes significantly expressed in worms from BALB/c mice and C57BL/6 mice; cluster II, genes highly expressed in worms from water buffaloes and rabbits; cluster III-VI, genes respectively up-regulated in the worms from rabbits, water buffaloes, C57BL/6 mice and BALB/c mice. The color scale represents relative expression levels: red, up-regulated; green, down-regulated; and black, unchanged. predominant genes were involved in response to metabolic processes, including primary metabolic process, organic substance metabolic process, cellular metabolic process and nitrogen compound metabolic process. For molecular functions, the majority of genes were annotated with binding activity such as organic cyclic compound binding activities, heterocyclic compound binding activity, and ion binding activity. Notably, genes coding for proteins associated with membrane accounted for the major portion of annotated genes in the cellular components analysis.

Comparative genomics analysis of well characterized signaling pathways between schistosome and mammalian host indicates that schistosome genome encodes various growth factors, receptors and other critical components to regulate numerous cellular processes during tissue development and organogenesis. These components share high sequence similarity with mammalian orthologues, implying that schistosomes may utilize host components as developmental signals besides their own pathways [33] . The KEGG pathway analysis showed that many of these differentially expressed genes were involved in signaling transduction pathways, such as calcium signaling pathway, cAMP signaling pathway, PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, Rap1 signaling pathway, Ras signaling pathway, ErbB signaling pathway and MAPK signaling pathway (Table 3) . Previous studies has also found that genes involved in ErbB signaling pathway and MAPK signaling pathway were differentially expressed in worms from buffaloes and goats [8] . Moreover, the S. japonicum genome reveals that schistosomes are not able to de novo synthesize fatty acids, sterols, purines, essential amino acids, which must be acquired from their hosts. Analysis of the KEGG pathways assigned to metabolic process indicated that these differentially expressed genes mainly participated in amino acid, energy, nucleotide and lipid metabolism (Table 3) , which is consistent with the findings of Yang et al. [7] . All the results above further prove that schistosomes can exploit host nutrients and signaling pathways for growth and development, and host environments can affect the survival and development of the parasites. For instance, human tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI), which acts as a plasma Kunitz-type serine protease inhibitor, is an anti-coagulation protein that plays an important role in the regulation of the blood coagulation cascade [38] . Interestingly, the S. japonicum TFPI gene (CAX69506.1) was significantly up-regulated in the intra-mammalian stage of the parasite life cycle and variously expressed in schistosomes from different hosts (S1 Fig) . It will be engrossing to investigate the function of the TFPI gene in schistosomes in connection with the blood parasitic environment. Notably, one trematode eggshell synthesis protein gene (TES, pfam08034), AAW25913.1, was significantly up-regulated in worms from C57BL/6 mice, buffaloes and rabbits comparing with those from BALB/c mice. The trematode eggshell synthesis protein genes have been identified in several trematode parasites, which are crucial for eggshell synthesis, a key step for determining the quality and quantity of eggs laid [39] . Annexins are a multigene family of calcium-dependent phospholipid-binding proteins, and members of this family have been identified in major eukaryotic phyla [40] . In humans, annexins interact with various cell-membrane components by forming networks on the membrane surface that are involved in the regulation of membrane organization, cell differentiation and migration, intracellular signaling by enzyme modulation and ion fluxes [40] [41] [42] . Although annexins lack signal peptides for secretion, some extracellular members have been identified that act as receptors for serum proteases on the endothelium as well as inhibitors of neutrophil migration and blood coagulation [40] . In addition, some human annexin isoforms are involved in immunoregulatory functions such as the resolution of inflammation [43] . In S. mansoni, three annexin genes (Smp_074140, Smp_074150 and Smp_077720) have been identified by proteomic analysis as the membrane-associated constituents of the tegument surface [44] . Of the annexins, Smp_077720 is significantly up-regulated in the transition from free-living cercaria to parasitic schistosomulum and adult worm and binds to the tegument surface membranes in a calcium-dependent manner [45] . We identified three annexin domain-containing protein genes (AAX26603.2, CAX70178.1 and AAP06415.1) that were differentially expressed in schistosomes from the four different mammalian hosts. AAX26603.2 and CAX70178.1 were significantly up-regulated in worms from BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice compared with worms from buffaloes and rabbits, but the opposite expression pattern was observed for AAP06415.1 (Fig 3) . This result indicates that these genes are either under different regulatory mechanisms or that the encoded proteins are functionally different. In addition, a gene coding for a putative endoribonuclease (AAX27316.2) containing the conserved endoribonuclease XendoU domain was significantly up-regulated in schistosomes from mice compared with those from buffaloes and rabbits. XendoU, which was first identified in Xenopus laevis, is a U-specific, metal iondependent endoribonuclease and is involved in the processing of intron-encoded small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNA) [46] [47] [48] . Schwarz et al. recently determined that the calcium-dependent endoribonuclease XendoU promotes endoplasmic reticulum network formation through local RNA degradation [49] .

Notably, we observed that many of these differentially expressed genes were annotated as hypothetical proteins. Sequence alignment analysis revealed that these genes shared no sequence similarity to any sequence present in the non-redundant protein sequence (nr) databases of NCBI at a cut-off E value of 10 −5 (except for Schistosoma species). Thus these Schistosoma-specific genes are likely specialised for parasitism by schistosomes, although their functions are unknown. Here, we identified a panel of four Schistosoma-specific genes (AAW25097.1, AAW27175.1, AAW24713.1 and CAX69761.1) that encoded a putative signal peptide and were overexpressed in worms from mice compared with those from buffaloes and rabbits. These four genes also exhibited a similar expression pattern among different developmental stages: significant down-regulation in the transition from free-living cercaria to parasitic schistosomulum and adult worm, and no expression in the egg stage (worms isolated from rabbits) (Fig 6) . The intriguing expression patterns of these Schistosoma-specific genes spark interests in further characterization of their function and their potential contribution to successful parasitism. Stably and abundantly expressed genes in adult schistosomes from different laboratory animals and buffaloes Using microarray fluorescent intensity 10,000 as the cut-off value, 1,540 gene products that exhibited the lowest coefficient of variation (0.1) in expression among the worms isolated from different hosts were obtained (S5 Table) . A list of selected genes with various functions is presented in Fig 7. The gene annotation results revealed that many of these stably and abundantly expressed genes are conventional housekeeping genes, some of which have been proved to be constitutively expressed across the schistosome lifecycle, such as eukaryotic translation factors, ribosomal proteins, histone proteins, tubulins, proteasome subunits, and NADH dehydrogenase subunits [19, 50] . The genes encoding S. japonicum 26S proteasome non-ATPase regulatory subunit 4 (PSMD4) and NADH dehydrogenase (ubiquinone) flavoprotein 2 (NDUFV2) have been extensively used as references for real-time PCR analysis [19, 20, 51, 52] . Comparative genomics analysis indicated that a substantial proportion of these schistosome genes share various sequence identity with their homologous counterparts in H. sapiens. Importantly, crystal structures of some of the human proteins are available, providing a foundation for the future screening of compounds that specifically target schistosome proteins based on structural disparity (S5 Table) . Some of the genes identified in the present study have been previously characterized as important functional genes for schistosome and potential anti-schistosome targets, although some of these genes were developmentally regulated during the lifecycle. For example, some genes encoding schistosome proteases (legumain, cathepsin B, C, D and L) that were upregulated from cercariae to adult worms play key roles in obtaining nutrients from the host [20, 53] . The schistosome tegumental aquaporin gene, which is important for parasite osmotic regulation, is most highly expressed during the intravascular life stages [54] , and the schistosome thioredoxin glutathione reductase gene has been validated as a potential drug target for schistosomiasis chemotherapy [55, 56] .

The schistosome tegument is a dynamic host-interactive surface that is involved in nutrition, immune evasion/modulation, excretion, osmoregulation, sensory reception, and signal transduction [54, 57] . The most promising schistosome vaccine candidates are proteins located on the surface of the worms, such as the tegument proteins TSP-2 (tetraspanin protein) and Sm29 [58] [59] [60] . In S. mansoni, TSP-2, which plays a prominent part in the parasite tegument development and maturation, seems to be an effective vaccine antigen against the blood fluke [61, 62] . A set of 107 genes with putative signal peptides and 276 genes with putative transmembrane helices were identified by sequence interrogation with SignalP 4.1 and TMHMM 2.0. These proteins may be secreted or surface-exposed and thus capable of interacting with the external environment. More importantly, we determined that a significant number of these stably expressed genes in adults were peculiar to Schistosoma species or the phylum Platyhelminthes and have no identity to genes in other organisms. Encouragingly, one of these Schistosomaor phylum Platyhelminthes-specific genes (SjSP-13) has been identified as a novel biomarker for immunodiagnosis of S. japonicum infection exhibiting extremely high sensitivity (90.4%) and specificity (98.9%), with nearly no cross-reactivity with other fluke infections [63] . Therefore, Schistosomaor phylum Platyhelminthes-specific genes, particularly secreted and transmembrane proteins, may be regarded as novel potential anti-parasite drug targets or vaccine candidates for future studies.

Structurally related members of the sperm-coating protein/Tpx-1/Ag5/PR-1/Sc7 (SCP/TAPS; Pfam: PF00188) family have been characterized in a wide range of eukaryotes, including parasites [64] . Parasitic helminth SCP/TAPS proteins have been proposed to play important biological roles in the transition from the free-living to the parasitic stage during the invasion of the mammalian host [64, 65] . In S. mansoni, this family is termed venom-allergen-like proteins (SmVALs) and comprises at least 28 members [32] . SmVALs can be divided into two groups and exhibit various gene expression patterns throughout the entire life-cycle, including genes exclusively expressed in stages involved in intermediate host invasion or definitive host invasion and ubiquitously expressed genes [32] . Because of their potential functional classification, expression patterns and localization, SmVALs have been proposed as potential drug targets and vaccine candidates, and some members have been well characterized recently [66] [67] [68] . For instance, Farias et al. have demonstrated that SmVAL4 and SmVAL26 stimulate differential allergic responses in a murine model of airway inflammation [66] ; and in a recent study, egg-derived SmVAL9 was found to carry an N-linked glycan containing a schistosome-specific difucosyl element and function as an immunogenic target during chronic murine schistosomiasis [68] . In our study, 20 non-redundant S. japonicum venom-allergen-like protein (SjVAL) genes were identified in the genome. In order to illuminate the phylogenetic relationships of VALs in the two Schistosoma species, we constructed a phylogenetic tree using all the fulllength protein sequences, except SmVAL23 of which conserved domain was incomplete. The result revealed that all the Schistosoma VALs could also be divided into two groups: sequences in group one contain the SCP_euk conserved domain (cd05380) and only a partial sequence had homologous counterparts between the two Schistosoma species; sequences in group two contain the SCP_GAPR-1_like conserved domain(s) (cd05382) and the majority had homologous counterparts (Fig 8A) . Microarray analysis revealed that ten SjVAL genes were transcribed in adult worms, including four genes (AAW25717.1, AAW27353.1, CAX74321.1 and Sjp_0038950) that were differentially transcribed in worms from the four hosts and six genes (AAP06001.1, Sjp_0038960, AAW25247.1, AAW25499.1, AAW25007.1 and CAX74107.1) that were stably expressed in worms from the four hosts ( Fig 8B) . All four differentially expressed SjVAL genes belonged to group one, and three encoded proteins with a putative signal peptide, which may be excreted/secreted proteins and interact with their immediate environment. Moreover, further expression analysis, based on our recently released S. japonicum microarray data for cercaria, schistosomulum, adult worm and egg (GEO accession number: GSE57143) [20] indicated that these ten genes exhibited diverse expression patterns in the four developmental stages (Fig 8C) . It suggests that the majority of Schistosoma VALs, if not all, may be susceptible to the environment in the life cycle implying a role in function of host adaptation. In S. mansoni, six SmVAL genes were demonstrated to be highly expressed in the cercaria by microarray analysis of larval stages associated with infection of the mammalian host, implying that the functions of these enigmatic genes are mostly associated with entry into the mammalian host [69] . Specifically, the transcription of gene Sjp_0038960 is restricted to the schistosomulum and adult stages, suggesting that this gene is important for schistosome parasitism in the mammalian host. Notably, only one gene, AAW25499.1, was constantly expressed among the four developmental stages, indicating that this gene may play a fundamental role in the schistosome life cycle. Indeed, AAW25499.1 was also stably expresses in worms from different mammalian hosts.

In conclusion, we systematically compared the gene expression profiles of schistosomes from laboratory animal hosts (BALB/c mice, C57BL/6 mice and rabbits) and the natural host (water buffaloes). The global transcriptional profiles of schistosomes from the four different hosts were generally coincident with each other. Meanwhile, a panel of differentially expressed genes was identified, which mainly involved in signal transduction and metabolism processes. A set of Schistosomaor phylum Platyhelminthes-specific genes were differentially or stably expressed in schistosomes from the four different hosts and should be targeted in future hypothesis-driven functional studies. The findings of this study provide a rational basis for schistosomiasis research in different laboratory animals and natural mammalian host at the transcriptional level and a valuable resource for the screening of anti-schistosomal intervention targets.

Origins and Evolution of the Global RNA Virome,"Viruses with RNA genomes dominate the eukaryotic virome, reaching enormous diversity in animals and plants. The recent advances of metaviromics prompted us to perform a detailed phylogenomic reconstruction of the evolution of the dramatically expanded global RNA virome. The only universal gene among RNA viruses is the gene encoding the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). We developed an iterative computational procedure that alternates the RdRp phylogenetic tree construction with refinement of the underlying multiple-sequence alignments. The resulting tree encompasses 4,617 RNA virus RdRps and consists of 5 major branches; 2 of the branches include positive-sense RNA viruses, 1 is a mix of positive-sense (ϩ) RNA and double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) viruses, and 2 consist of dsRNA and negative-sense (Ϫ) RNA viruses, respectively. This tree topology implies that dsRNA viruses evolved from ϩRNA viruses on at least two independent occasions, whereas ϪRNA viruses evolved from dsRNA viruses. Reconstruction of RNA virus evolution using the RdRp tree as the scaffold suggests that the last common ancestors of the major branches of ϩRNA viruses encoded only the RdRp and a single jelly-roll capsid protein. Subsequent evolution involved independent capture of additional genes, in particular, those encoding distinct RNA helicases, enabling replication of larger RNA genomes and facilitating virus genome expression and virus-host interactions. Phylogenomic analysis reveals extensive gene module exchange among diverse viruses and horizontal virus transfer between distantly related hosts. Although the network of evolutionary relationships within the RNA virome is bound to further expand, the present results call for a thorough reevaluation of the RNA virus taxonomy. IMPORTANCE The majority of the diverse viruses infecting eukaryotes have RNA genomes, including numerous human, animal, and plant pathogens. Recent advances of metagenomics have led to the discovery of many new groups of RNA viruses in a wide range of hosts. These findings enable a far more complete reconstruction of the evolution of RNA viruses than was attainable previously. This reconstruction reveals the relationships between different Baltimore classes of viruses and indicates extensive transfer of viruses between distantly related hosts, such as plants and animals. These results call for a major revision of the existing taxonomy of RNA viruses.","required for polymerase activity (21) (22) (23) . RdRps belong to the expansive class of polymerases containing so-called Palm catalytic domains along with the accessory Fingers and Thumb domains (24, 25) . In addition to viral RdRps, Palm domain polymerases include reverse transcriptases (RTs) of retroelements and reverse-transcribing viruses and the DNA polymerases that are responsible for genome replication in cellular organisms and diverse DNA viruses. Within the Palm domain class of proteins, RT and the ϩRNA virus RdRps are significantly similar in sequence and structure and appear to comprise a monophyletic group (22, (24) (25) (26) . More specifically, the highest similarity is observed between the ϩRNA virus RdRps and the RTs of group II introns. These introns are widespread retrotransposons in prokaryotes that are thought to be ancestral to the RTs of all other retrotransposons as well as retroviruses and pararetroviruses (recently jointly classified as the order Ortervirales) of eukaryotes (27) (28) (29) (30) .

A phylogenetic analysis of the ϩRNA virus RdRps revealed only a distant relationship between the leviviruses and the bulk of the eukaryotic ϩRNA viruses, leaving the ancestral relationships uncertain (31) . The origin of eukaryotic ϩRNA viruses from their prokaryotic counterparts is an obvious possibility. However, given the dramatically greater prevalence of ϩRNA viruses among eukaryotes compared to the narrow spread of leviviruses and ""levi-like viruses"" in bacteria, an alternative scenario has been proposed. In this scenario, RdRps of the prokaryotic and eukaryotic ϩRNA viruses independently descended from distinct RTs (11, 31) . Among eukaryotic ϩRNA viruses, phylogenetic analysis of the RdRps strongly supports the existence of picornavirus and alphavirus ""supergroups,"" which are further validated by additional signature genes (7, 15) . However, both the exact compositions of these supergroups and the evolutionary relationships among many additional groups of viruses remain uncertain. Some RdRp phylogenies suggest a third supergroup combining animal ""flavi-like viruses"" and plant tombusviruses, but this unification is not supported by additional shared genes and thus remains tenuous (7, 15, 21) .

The similarity of RdRps among dsRNA viruses is limited, but these RdRps are similar to various degrees to ϩRNA virus RdRps. Therefore, different groups of dsRNA viruses might have evolved from different ϩRNA viruses independently, on multiple occasions (15, 32) . Although it is not entirely clear how prokaryotic dsRNA viruses fit into this concept, evidence of an evolutionary affinity between cystoviruses and reoviruses has been presented (33, 34) .

For a long time, the evolutionary provenance of ϪRNA virus RdRps remained uncertain due to their low sequence similarity to other RdRps and RTs (23) . However, recent protein structure comparisons point to a striking similarity between the RdRps of ϪRNA orthomyxoviruses and those of ϩRNA flaviviruses and dsRNA cystoviruses (35) . All these findings notwithstanding, the overall evolutionary relationships among the RdRps of ϩRNA, ϪRNA, and dsRNA viruses and RTs remain unresolved. In particular, whether the RdRps of ϩRNA and ϪRNA viruses are mono-or polyphyletic is unclear.

Many deep evolutionary connections between RNA virus groups that were originally thought to be unrelated have been delineated using the results of pre-metagenomicera evolutionary studies. These discoveries culminated in the establishment of RNA virus supergroups (7, 9, 36) . However, the evolutionary provenance of many other RNA virus groups remained unclear, as did the relationships between the RNA viruses of the 3 Baltimore classes and retroelements and their ultimate origins. The prospects of substantial progress appeared dim because of the extreme sequence divergence among RNA viruses, which could amount to irrevocable loss of evolutionary information.

Recent revolutionary developments in virus metagenomics (metaviromics) dramatically expanded knowledge of the diversity of RNA viruses and provided an unprecedented amount of sequence data for informed investigation into RNA virus evolution (11, 17, 37) . The foremost development was the massive expansion of the known invertebrate virome, which was achieved primarily through meta-transcriptome sequencing of various holobionts. The subsequent phylogenetic analysis revealed previously unknown lineages of ϩRNA and ϪRNA viruses and prompted reconsideration of high-rank virus unifications, such as ϩRNA virus supergroups (14, (38) (39) (40) (41) . The RNA viromes of fungi and prokaryotes also underwent notable expansion, albeit it was not as extensive as that of invertebrates (13, 42, 43) .

Here we reexamine the evolutionary relationships among and within the 3 Baltimore classes of RNA viruses through a comprehensive analysis of the available genomic and metagenomic sequences. In particular, to build a phylogenetic tree of thousands of viral RdRps, we designed an iterative computational procedure that alternates phylogeny construction with refinement of the underlying multiple alignments. Although RNA viruses have relatively short genomes (ϳ3 to 41 kb), the combined gene repertoire (pangenome) of these viruses includes numerous genes that are shared, to various degrees, by related subsets of RNA viruses. To obtain further insight into virus evolution, we therefore attempted to reconstruct the history of gain and loss of conserved proteins and domains in different virus lineages. We also investigated evolution of the single jelly-roll capsid protein (SJR-CP), the dominant type of capsid protein among ϩRNA viruses. Our analysis revealed patterns that are generally congruent with the RdRp phylogeny and provide further insights into the evolution of different branches of RNA viruses. Finally, we analyzed a bipartite network in which RNA virus genomes are connected via nodes representing virus genes (44, 45) to identify distinct modules in the RNA virosphere. The results shed light on the evolution of RNA viruses, revealing, in particular, the monophyly of ϪRNA viruses and their apparent origin from dsRNA viruses, which seem to have evolved from distinct branches of ϩRNA viruses on at least two independent occasions.

Comprehensive phylogeny of RNA virus RNA-dependent RNA polymerases: overall structure of the tree and the 5 major branches. Amino acid sequences of RdRps and RTs were collected from the nonredundant National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database and analyzed using an iterative clustering-alignmentphylogeny procedure (see Fig. S1 in the supplemental material) (see Materials and Methods for details). This procedure ultimately yielded a single multiple alignment of the complete set of 4,617 virus RdRp sequences (see Data Set S1 in the supplemental material) and 1,028 RT sequences organized in 50 ϩ 2 clusters (50 clusters of RdRps and 2 clusters of RTs; see Materials and Methods for details). This sequence set did not include RdRps of members of the families Birnaviridae and Permutatetraviridae, distinct groups of RNA viruses that encompass a circular permutation within the RdRp Palm domain (46) and therefore could not be confidently included in the alignment over their entire lengths.

The phylogenetic tree of RdRps and RTs ( Fig. 1 ; see also Data Set S2) was assembled from a set of trees that represent three hierarchical levels of relationships. At the lowest level, full complements of sequences from each cluster were used to construct clusterspecific trees. At the intermediate level, up to 15 representatives from each cluster were selected to elucidate supergroup-level phylogeny. At the highest level, up to 5 representatives from each cluster were taken to resolve global relationships (Data Set S3A and S4). The final tree (Data Set S2) was assembled by replacing the cluster representatives with the trees from the previous steps.

The large number and immense diversity of the viruses included in our analysis create serious challenges for a systematic, phylogeny-based nomenclature of the identified evolutionary lineages of RNA viruses. Many such lineages consist of viruses newly discovered by metaviromics and are not yet formally classified by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) and therefore cannot be assigned formal names. For the purpose of the present work, we adopted a semiarbitrary naming scheme using the following approach. (i) We use taxon names that had been fully accepted by the ICTV as of March 2018 (47) whenever possible. These names are recognizable through their capitalization and italicization and rank-specific suffixes (e.g., -virales for orders and -viridae for families). As is the common practice in virus taxonomy, the officially classified members of each ICTV-approved taxon are referred to via vernacular designations (recognizable through their lack of capitalization and italicization). For instance, the members of the ICTV-approved order Bunyavirales are called bunyaviruses, whereas those of the family Tombusviridae are called tombusviruses. However, in this work, both taxon and vernacular terms are to be understood sensu lato: if our analysis indicates certain viruses to be members of or very closely related to an ICTV-established taxon, we consider them members of that taxon despite the lack of current ICTV recognition. As a result, the order Bunyavirales has more members in our analysis than in the official taxonomy. (ii) We use vernacular names in quotation marks for viruses/lineages that are clearly distinct from those covered by the official ICTV framework. Whenever possible, we use names that circulate in the literature (e.g., ""hepeliviruses,"" ""statoviruses""). In the absence of such unofficial names, we name the lineage reminiscent of the next most closely related lineage (e.g., ""levi-like viruses"" are a clearly distinct sister group to Leviviridae/leviviruses). (iii) Monophyletic clusters that transcend the currently highest ICTV-accepted rank (i.e., order) are labeled according to terms circulating in the literature (i.e., ""alphavirus supergroup,"" ""flavivirus supergroup,"" and ""picornavirus supergroup""). (iv) Lineages represented by a single virus are labeled with the respective virus name.

Rooting the phylogenetic tree, generated using PhyML (48) , between the RTs and RdRps resulted in a well-resolved topology of RNA viruses in which the tree splits into 5 major branches, each including a substantial diversity of viruses (Fig. 1) .

Branch 1 consists of leviviruses and their eukaryotic relatives, namely, ""mitoviruses,"" ""narnaviruses,"" and ""ourmiaviruses"" (the latter three terms are placed in quotation marks as our analysis contradicts the current ICTV framework, which classifies mitoviruses and narnaviruses as members of one family, Narnaviridae, and ourmiaviruses as members of a free-floating genus, Ourmiavirus).

Branch 2 (""picornavirus supergroup"") consists of a large assemblage of ϩRNA viruses of eukaryotes, in particular, those of the orders Picornavirales and Nidovirales; the families Caliciviridae, Potyviridae, Astroviridae, and Solemoviridae, a lineage of dsRNA viruses that includes partitiviruses and picobirnaviruses; and several other, smaller groups of ϩRNA and dsRNA viruses.

Branch 3 consists of a distinct subset of ϩRNA viruses, including the ""alphavirus supergroup"" along with the ""flavivirus supergroup,"" nodaviruses, and tombusviruses; the ""statovirus,"" ""wèivirus,"" ""yànvirus,"" and ""zhàovirus"" groups; and several additional, smaller groups.

Branch 4 consists of dsRNA viruses, including cystoviruses, reoviruses, and totiviruses and several additional families.

Branch 5 consists of ϪRNA viruses. Each of these 5 major branches of the tree is strongly supported by bootstrap replications (Fig. 1 ). Assuming the RT rooting of the tree, branch 1, which consists of leviviruses and their relatives infecting eukaryotes, is a sister group to the rest of RNA viruses; this position is highly robust with respect to the choice of the phylogenetic method and parameters. This tree topology is compatible with the monophyly of the RdRps and, by inference, of RNA viruses and the origin of eukaryotic RNA viruses from a prokaryotic RNA virus ancestor shared with leviviruses. The deeper history remains murky. We have no information on the nature of the common ancestor of retroelements and RNA viruses, let alone on whether the ancestor was an RNA virus or a retroelement. However, parsimony considerations suggest that a retroelement ancestor is more likely given that capsids first appeared in the virus part of the tree rather than having been lost in retroelements.

The next split in the tree occurs between branch 2 and the short stem that formally joins branches 3, 4, and 5. However, the unification of branch 3 with branches 4 and 5 is weakly supported and might not reflect actual common ancestry.

Arguably, the most striking feature of the RNA virus tree topology is the paraphyly of ϩRNA viruses relative to dsRNA and ϪRNA viruses. Indeed, according to this phylogeny, ϪRNA viruses evolved from within dsRNA viruses, whereas dsRNA viruses are polyphyletic (Fig. 1 ). One major group of dsRNA viruses that includes partitiviruses and picobirnaviruses is firmly embedded within ϩRNA virus branch 2, whereas another, the members of a larger dsRNA virus group that includes cystoviruses, reoviruses, totiviruses, and viruses from several other families comprise a distinct branch, branch 4, which might be related to ϩRNA virus branch 3 (Fig. 1 ). This placement of the two branches of dsRNA viruses is conceptually compatible with the previous evolutionary scenarios of independent origins from ϩRNA viruses. However, the presence of a strongly supported branch combining 3 lineages of dsRNA viruses that infect both prokaryotes and eukaryotes suggests a lesser extent of polyphyly in the evolution of dsRNA viruses than originally proposed (15, 32) .

An alternative phylogenetic analysis of the same RdRp alignment using RAxML yielded the same 5 main branches, albeit some with weak support (Data Set S3B). Furthermore, although the dsRNA viruses are split the same way using RAxML as in the PhyML tree, the nested tree topology, in which branch 4 (the bulk of dsRNA viruses) is lodged deep within ϩRNA viruses and branch 5 (ϪRNA viruses) is located inside branch 4, is not reproduced (Data Set S3B). Instead, branches 4 and 5 are separate and positioned deep in the tree, immediately above the split between branch 1 and the rest of the RdRps. Given the poor resolution of the RAxML tree and a strong biological argument, namely, the absence of identified ϪRNA viruses in prokaryotes or protists (with the exception of the ""leishbuviruses"" infecting kinetoplastids [49, 50] ; see also Discussion below), we believe that the tree topology presented in Fig. 1 carries more credence than that shown in Data Set S3B. Nevertheless, these discrepancies emphasize that utmost caution is due when biological interpretation of deep branching in trees of highly divergent proteins is attempted.

The RdRp is the only universal protein of RNA viruses. Accordingly, other viral genes must have been gained and/or lost at different stages of evolution. Thus, after performing the phylogenetic analysis of RdRps, we assigned the proteins and domains shared by diverse viruses to the branches of the RdRp tree. Multiple alignments and hidden Markov model (hmm) profiles were constructed for 16,814 proteins and domains encoded by RNA viruses, and a computational pipeline was developed to map these domains on the viral genomes (Data Set S5). The resulting patterns of domain presence/absence in the branches of the RdRp tree were used to reconstruct the history of the gains and losses of RNA virus genes (or proteins and domains, for simplicity), both formally, using the ML-based Gloome method (51) , and informally, from parsimony considerations. These reconstructions reveal a high level of branch specificity in the evolution of the gene repertoire of RNA viruses. The only protein that is likely to have been gained at the base of the eukaryotic virus subtree (branches 2 to 5) (which also includes the bacterial cystoviruses) is the single jelly-roll capsid protein (SJR-CP) (Fig. S2A ). Retroelements lack capsid proteins, and therefore, there is no indication that SJR-CP was present in the hypothetical element that encoded the common ancestor of RdRps and RTs. Furthermore, reconstruction of the evolution of branch 1 (leviviruses and their relatives) argues against the ancestral status of SJR-CP in this branch.

(ii) Branch 1: leviviruses and their descendants. The current RdRp tree topology combined with gene gain-loss reconstruction suggests the following evolutionary scenario for branch 1 ( Fig. 2A) : a levivirus-like ancestor that, like the extant members of the Leviviridae, possessed a capsid protein unrelated to SJR-CP (19, 52) gave rise to naked eukaryotic RNA replicons known as ""mitoviruses"" and ""narnaviruses."" These replicons consist of a single RdRp gene (Fig. 2B ) and replicate in mitochondria and in the cytosol of the host cells of fungal and invertebrate hosts, respectively (the latter hosts were identified in metaviromic holobiont analyses) (14, 53) . Recently, the existence of plant ""mitoviruses"" has been reported although it is not known whether these viruses reproduce in the mitochondria (54) . The ""narnavirus"" RdRp is also the ancestor of the RdRp of the expanding group of ""ourmiaviruses"" (Fig. 2A) . ""Ourmiaviruses"" were originally identified in a narrow range of plants, and genomic analysis revealed the chimeric nature of these viruses, with a ""narnavirus""-like RdRp but SJR-CPs and movement proteins (MPs) which were apparently acquired from ""picorna-like"" and ""tombuslike"" viruses, respectively (55) . Use of metaviromics has led to the identification of numerous related viruses associated with invertebrates, many of which encode distinct SJR-CP variants and some of which acquired an RNA helicase ( Fig. 2B and S2 ) (14) . Thus, the evolution of this branch apparently involved the loss of the structural module of leviviruses, which yielded naked RNA replicons that reproduced in the mitochondria of early eukaryotes. A group of these replicons subsequently escaped to the cytosol, which was followed by the reacquisition of unrelated structural modules from distinct lineages of eukaryotic viruses inhabiting the same environment (Fig. 2B ). This complex evolutionary scenario emphasizes the key role of modular gene exchange in the evolution of RNA viruses.

(iii) Branch 2: picornavirus supergroup. Expansive branch 2 generally corresponds to the previously described ""picornavirus supergroup"" (Fig. 1 and 3) (7, 31) . Some of the virus groups that were previously considered peripheral members of this supergroup, such as totiviruses and nodaviruses, were relocated to different branches in the present tree (branches 4 and 3, respectively), whereas the viruses of the order Nidovirales were moved inside branch 2 from an uncertain position in the tree. Nevertheless, the core of the supergroup remains coherent, suggestive of common ancestry. Within branch 2, 3 major clades are strongly supported (Fig. 3A) ; however, many of the internal branches are less reliable, so that the relative positions of partitivirus-picobirnavirus, potyvirusastrovirus, and nidovirus clades within branch 2 remain uncertain.

The largest and most coherent of the branch 2 clades includes the cornerstone of the picornavirus supergroup, the ϳ826 viruses-strong order Picornavirales (56), expanded with caliciviruses, solinviviruses, and a multitude of unclassified viruses infecting invertebrates, vertebrates, fungi, protists, and undefined hosts (for viruses discovered by metaviromics) (Fig. 3) (11, 14, 17, (57) (58) (59) . The second largest, deep-branching clade consists of two lineages that include, respectively, ϩRNA and dsRNA viruses (Fig. 3 ). The ϩRNA virus lineage combines astroviruses and potyviruses, the evolutionary affinity of which is well recognized (31, 60) . The dsRNA lineage includes the members of the families Amalgaviridae, Hypoviridae, Partitiviridae, and Picobirnaviridae, with each of these families greatly expanded by unclassified affiliates. Finally, the ""middle"" clade is smaller and less diverse; it encompasses nidoviruses, including the longest of all ϩRNA virus genomes (61) , and solemoviruses with much shorter genomes (Fig. 3) . Notably, some members of the family Luteoviridae and Heterocapsa circularisquama RNA virus, the only known alvernavirus (62) , are nested within the solemovirus clade. Given the lack of support beyond the phylogenetic affinity of the RdRps and the dramatic differences in the genomic architectures of nidoviruses and solemoviruses, the possibility that this unification was caused by a tree construction artifact is difficult to rule out (the branch support notwithstanding).

Hypoviruses, representing a group of fungal capsidless RNA replicons, have been traditionally viewed as dsRNA viruses. However, comparisons of genome architectures and phylogenetic analyses suggested that hypoviruses are derivatives of potyviruses (Continued on next page) Global RNA Virome ® that have lost the capsid protein (63, 64) . In the current RdRp tree, hypoviruses cluster with the dsRNA viruses of the partitivirus-picobirnavirus clade rather than with potyviruses (Fig. 3 ). Whether this position is an artifact of tree construction or whether hypoviruses actually share the RdRps with dsRNA viruses is unclear.

The partitivirus-picobirnavirus clade within branch 2 represents a transition to the bona fide dsRNA Baltimore class (Fig. 3) . Typical partitiviruses and picobirnaviruses have minimalist genomes that consist of two dsRNA segments encapsidated separately into distinct 120-subunit Tϭ1 capsids (65) (66) (67) (68) . These genome segments encode, respectively, RdRps and CPs that are clearly homologous between the two families. The CPs of the partitivirus-picobirnavirus clade have been suggested to be distantly related to those of other dsRNA viruses that belong to branch 4 (33, 69) . Notably, this clade also includes some naked RNA replicons that reproduce in algal mitochondria or chloroplasts, use a mitochondrial genetic code, and, in terms of lifestyle, resemble ""mitoviruses"" (14, 70, 71) . By analogy, the origin of the partitivirus-picobirnavirus group in an as-yet-undiscovered lineage of prokaryotic RNA viruses seems likely. More specifically, this group of dsRNA viruses could have evolved through reassortment of genomic segments encoding, respectively, a ϩRNA virus RdRp of branch 2 (possibly a naked RNA replicon) and a dsRNA virus capsid protein related to those of branch 4 viruses. The most recently evolved branch of partitiviruses is characterized by larger, 4-to 6-partite genomes, in contrast to the mono-or bipartite genomes in the deeper branches (14) . This observation emphasizes a major tendency in virus evolution: increases in genome complexity via gradual acquisition of accessory genes (72) .

Apart from the SJR-CP, an apparently ancestral protein that is likely to represent a shared derived character (synapomorphy) of branch 2 is a serine protease that is present in members of the order Picornavirales (with the diagnostic substitution of cysteine for the catalytic serine), members of the potyvirus-astrovirus clade, solemoviruses, alvernavirus, and nidoviruses ( Fig. 3B ; see also Fig. S2B ). As demonstrated previously, this viral protease derives from a distinct bacterial protease, probably of mitochondrial origin, which is compatible with an early origin of branch 2 in eukaryotic evolution (31) .

The reconstruction of protein gain and loss, together with the comparison of genome architectures in this branch, revealed extensive rearrangements as well as gene and module displacement ( Fig. 3B ; see also Fig. S2B). Branch 2 includes viruses with relatively long genomes and complex gene repertoires (nidoviruses, potyviruses, and many members of Picornavirales) along with viruses with much shorter genomes and minimal sets of genes (astroviruses and solemoviruses). Clearly, evolution of branch 2 viruses involved multiple gene gains. Of special note is the gain of 3 distinct helicases in 3 clades within this branch: superfamily 3 helicases (S3H) in members of Picornavirales, superfamily 2 helicases (S2H) in potyviruses, and superfamily 1 helicases (S1H) in nidoviruses ( Fig. 3B ; see also Fig. S2B ). This independent, convergent gain of distinct helicases reflects the trend noticed early in the study of RNA virus evolution, namely, that most viruses with genomes longer than ϳ6 kb encode helicases, whereas smaller ones do not. This difference conceivably exists because helicase activity is required for the replication of longer RNA genomes (73) . Another notable feature is the change of virion morphologies among potyviruses (replacement of ancestral SJR-CP by an unrelated CP forming filamentous virions) and nidoviruses (displacement by a distinct nucleocapsid protein). The dramatic change in virion morphology and mode of ge-

Nidoviruses also gained ribonucleases and other accessory proteins that are involved in genome replication, virulence, and other aspects of the infection cycle of these largest known RNA viruses (61, (74) (75) (76) .

(iv) Branch 3: ""alphavirus supergroup"" and ""flavivirus supergroup"" and the extensive diversity of ""tombus-like viruses."" Branch 3 is the part of the ϩRNA virus RdRp tree that underwent the most dramatic rearrangements compared to previous versions. This branch consists of two strongly supported clades of ϩRNA viruses: (i) the assemblage that originally was defined as the ""alphavirus supergroup"" (7, 15) joined by several additional groups of viruses and (ii) flaviviruses and related viruses (""flavivirus supergroup""; Fig. 1 and 4 ). In the former clade, the alphavirus supergroup encompasses an enormous diversity of plant, fungal, and animal ϩRNA viruses and consists of 3 well-supported lineages, namely, tymoviruses, virgaviruses/alphaviruses/endornaviruses, and hepeviruses/benyviruses, each accompanied by related viruses that often form as-yet-unclassified lineages (Fig. 4A ). Within the ""alphavirus supergroup"" alone, the genome lengths range from ϳ6 to ϳ20 kb. Despite this length variation, all supergroup members harbor a conserved RNA replication gene module encoding a CapE, S1H, and RdRp; the conservation of this module attests to the monophyly of the supergroup (Fig. 4B) .

In contrast, virion architectures differ dramatically even within each of the three lineages of the ""alphavirus supergroup."" The major structural themes include variants of icosahedral capsids formed by SJR-CP (e.g., bromoviruses and tymoviruses); unrelated icosahedral capsids enveloped in a lipoprotein bilayer (togaviruses); flexuous filamentous capsids formed by a distinct type of CP (alphaflexiviruses, betaflexiviruses, gammaflexiviruses, and closteroviruses); and rigid rod-shaped capsids assembled from another distinct CP (benyiviruses and virgaviruses). It was traditionally thought that the latter capsid type is specific to viruses of flowering plants (20) . However, the recent discovery of a virgavirus-like CP in invertebrate viruses (e.g., Bě ihǎi charybdis crab virus 1 [ Fig. 4B ]) (14) suggests that the emergence of this unique CP fold antedates land colonization by plants at ϳ100 million years ago (Mya). Yet another ""structural"" theme is offered by endornaviruses, naked RNA replicons which, similarly to the hypoviruses in branch 2 (see above), originally were classified as dsRNA viruses. However, endornaviruses possess all the hallmarks of the alphavirus supergroup and are clearly derived from ϩRNA viruses of this group. They seem to have been mislabeled dsRNA viruses due to the accumulation of dsRNA replication intermediates in infected cells (18, 77) . A parallel loss of the CP genes apparently occurred in the deltaflexiviruses, which, in RdRp phylogenies, form a sister group to the flexible filamentous gammaflexiviruses (78) , and in the umbraviruses that are included in the family Tombusviridae based on the RdRp phylogeny. Notably, unlike most other capsidless viruses that are vertically inherited, umbraviruses can hijack capsids of coinfecting luteoviruses for aphid transmission (79) .

Within branch 3, the phylogenetically compact alphavirus supergroup is embedded within the radiation of diverse virus groups, including the well-known tombusviruses and nodaviruses, along with several newcomers discovered via metaviromics, such as the ""statovirus,"" ""wèivirus,"" ""yànvirus,"" and ""zhàovirus"" groups (14, 80, 81) (Fig. 4A ). Our RdRp analysis revealed remarkable phylogenetic heterogeneity within and among these groups and split the ""tombus-like viruses"" into 5 lineages with distinct evolutionary affinities (groups ""Uncl.

[unclassified] inv. [invertebrates]"" and subsets of ""tombus-like viruses"" and ""nodaviruses"" in Fig. 4A ). This subdivision is also supported by the analysis of the CPs of these viruses (see section on SJR-CP evolution) (Fig. 7) . Therefore, in contrast to the alphavirus supergroup, nodaviruses, and the flavivirus supergroup, the term ""tombus-like"" loses its evolutionary and taxonomic coherence. Accordingly, we use the term ""tombusviruses"" (without quotation marks) only for one lineage that includes the members of the current family Tombusviridae along with a broad variety of related plant and invertebrate holobiont viruses (14) .

The previously suggested, tenuous Flaviviridae-Tombusviridae affinity is gone in the present tree, although members of both families belong to the same major branch, branch 3. Plant tombusviruses (and members of closely related plant virus genera), representing the only group of ""tombus-like viruses"" that was available at the time of previous analyses (7, 21) , now form but a small twig deep within the large assemblage that we refer to as tombusviruses. Tombusviruses are affiliated with ""statoviruses"" (80) and with a subset of unclassified viruses from invertebrate holobionts rather than with flaviviruses (Fig. 4A) . Flaviviruses now form a separate clade within branch 3, the flavivirus supergroup that includes members of four recognized flaviviral genera (Pegivirus, Hepacivirus, Flavivirus, and Pestivirus), the newly discovered ""jı ngménviruses"" with segmented genomes (38) , and a variety of unclassified, extremely divergent ""flavi-like viruses"" of animals and plants. This clade is split into two well-supported lineages; one includes pegiviruses and hepaciviruses, and the other consists of the rest of flaviviruses (Fig. 4A ). Flaviviral virions are enveloped, with the envelope proteins forming an external icosahedral shell, whereas the core nucleocapsid is apparently disordered; the evolutionary provenance of the core protein, with its distinct fold, is unclear (19, 82, 83) . Notably, flaviviral envelope proteins are class II fusion proteins that are closely related to alphavirus envelope E1 proteins (84) . The theme of gene swapping between these distantly related virus groups of branch 3 is further emphasized by the homology between the alphavirus CPs that form icosahedral capsids under the lipid envelopes and the flavivirus nonstructural NS3 proteases that share a chymotrypsin-like fold (84) . Because the RdRp tree topology implies that the alphavirus ancestor is more recent than the ancestor of flaviviruses (Fig. 1) , such adoption of the NS3 protease for a structural role is suggestive of emerging alphaviruses borrowing their structural module from preexisting flaviviruses (19) .

The hallmark of branch 3 is the capping enzyme (CapE), which is present in the entire ""alphavirus supergroup"" and in flaviviruses ( Fig. 4 ; see also Fig. S2B). A highly divergent version of CapE has been identified in nodaviruses (85) and, in our present analysis, in the additional subset of viruses that grouped with nodaviruses, as well as in a few viruses scattered throughout the clade. Formally, CapE is inferred to be ancestral in the entire branch 3. However, CapEs of ""alphavirus supergroup"" members, nodaviruses, and flaviviruses are related only distantly to one another, and at least the latter have closer eukaryotic homologs, namely, the FtsJ family methyltransferases (86, 87) . Furthermore, tombusviruses, statoviruses, yànviruses, zhàoviruses, wèiviruses, and members of the Pegivirus-Hepacivirus lineage of flaviviruses lack CapE, putting into question its presence in the ancestor of this branch ( To an even greater extent than in branch 2, the apparent routes of virus evolution in branch 3 involve lineage-specific gene capture that resulted in evolution of complex CP-Spro, capsid protein-serine protease; E, envelope protein; fCP, divergent copies of the capsid protein forming filamentous virions; Hsp70h, Hsp70 homolog; MP, movement protein; NS, nonstructural protein; nsP2 to nsP3, nonstructural proteins; Ppro, papain-like protease; prM, precursor of membrane protein; rCP, capsid protein forming rod-shaped virions; RiS, RNA interference suppressor; S1H, superfamily 1 helicase; S2H, superfamily 2 helicase; SJR2, single jelly-roll capsid proteins of type 2; Spro, serine protease; vOTU, virus OTU-like protease; NS, nonstructural protein. Distinct hues of same color (e.g., green for MPs) are used to indicate the cases when proteins that share analogous function are not homologous.

Global RNA Virome ® genome architectures (Fig. 4B) . The most notable cases are the closteroviruses and divergent flaviviruses that have genomes of up to 20 to 26 kb, rivalling coronaviruses in terms of genome length and the complexity of the gene repertoire (38, (88) (89) (90) .

The lack of genes assigned to the common ancestor of branch 3 (with the obvious exception of the RdRp) prevents development of a coherent evolutionary scenario for the entire branch. In the case of the clade encompassing the ""alphavirus supergroup"" and related viruses, a potential common ancestor could be a simple virus that encoded only an RdRp and a SJR-CP, a CP fold most broadly represented in this clade, including diverse tombusviruses, nodaviruses and members of Bromoviridae, and Tymoviridae within the ""alphavirus supergroup."" Proposal of such an ancestor for the flavivirus clade is challenged by the lack of viruses with short and simple genomes among flaviviruses. Indeed, the lengths of the genomes in this clade range from ϳ9 kb to ϳ26 kb, with even the shortest ones encoding at least three of the flavivirus signature genes (serine protease [Spro], S2H, and RdRp). One potential clue, however, is provided by ""jı ngménviruses,"" with tetrapartite genomes in which the protease-helicase modules and the RdRps are encoded by separate genome segments; two other segments apparently encode structural proteins of unclear provenance (38) . This genome architecture could hint at an ancestral flavivirus genome that was assembled from genes borrowed from preexisting viruses, one of which possessed a divergent ""tombus-like virus"" RdRp. Although the origins of branch 3 are murky, major trends in its subsequent evolution clearly included lineage-specific gene capture, starting with helicases and CapEs in the ancestors of the major lineages and followed by diverse genes in smaller groups (Fig. 4B) .

(v) Branch 4: dsRNA viruses. Branch 4, which joins branch 3 with weak support, includes the bulk of the dsRNA viruses ( Fig. 1 and 5 ). All dsRNA viruses in this branch share a unique virion organization and encode homologous CPs. In particular, the specialized icosahedral capsids of these viruses, involved in transcription and replication of the dsRNA genome inside cells, are constructed from 60 homo-or heterodimers of CP subunits organized on an unusual Tϭ1 (also known as pseudo-Tϭ2) lattice (69, 91) . The only exceptions are the chrysoviruses, which encode large CPs corresponding to the CP dimers of other dsRNA viruses and form genuine Tϭ1 capsids (92) . The icosahedral capsids of partitiviruses and picobirnaviruses, which encode RdRps belonging to branch 2, are also constructed from 60 homodimers (66, 67, 93) and have been suggested to be evolutionarily related to those of the dsRNA viruses from RdRp branch 4 (94) despite little structural similarity between the corresponding CPs. Totiviruses, many of which have ""minimal"" genomes encoding only RdRps and CPs, comprise one of the two major clades in branch 4, whereas cystoviruses, the only known prokaryotic dsRNA viruses, together with members of the vast family Reoviridae, which consists of multisegmented dsRNA viruses infecting diverse eukaryotes, comprise the second clade (Fig. 5) . The concept of the closer phylogenetic affinity between cystoviruses and reoviruses appears to be corroborated by the fact that the inner Tϭ1 icosahedral capsid is uniquely encased by the outer icosahedral shell constructed on a Tϭ13 lattice in both families (34) . Both cystoviruses and reoviruses appear to have gained many cladespecific genes, in particular, RecA-like packaging ATPases of the former (95) and the CapEs of the latter that are only distantly related to CapEs of other RNA viruses and likely were acquired independently (96, 97) ( (vi) Branch 5: ؊RNA viruses. Branch 5, the 100% supported lineage combining all ϪRNA viruses, is lodged within branch 4 as the sister group of reoviruses, and this position is upheld by two strongly supported internal branches in the RdRp tree ( Fig. 1  and 6 ). The ϪRNA branch splits into 2 strongly supported clades. The first clade encompasses the 348 viruses-strong membership of the order Mononegavirales (98), along with the members of the distantly related family Aspiviridae (99), 3 groups of ϪRNA viruses discovered through metaviromics (""chǔ viruses,"" ""qínviruses,"" and ""yuèviruses"") (14, 39) , and a group of unclassified fungal viruses (Fig. 6A) (42, 100) . In contrast to the members of the Mononegavirales, most of which possess unsegmented genomes, the remainder of this clade is characterized by bi-, tri-, or even tetraseg-mented genomes (Fig. 6B) . The second clade combines the family Orthomyxoviridae, the genus Tilapinevirus (101), and the large order Bunyavirales (394 viruses) (102) . The latter order consists of two branches, one of which is the sister group to the orthomyxovirus/tilapinevirus clade (albeit with weak support). The numbers of negativesense or ambisense genome segments in this clade range from 2 to 3 in most of bunyaviruses to 8 in viruses of the genus Emaravirus and the orthomyxovirus/tilapinevirus group (10, 99, 101, 103) . A notable acquisition in the first clade is a CapE, whereas members of the second clade share ""cap-snatching"" endonucleases (En) (10) .

Patterns of the single jelly-roll capsid protein evolution. The SJR-CP is the dominant type of CP among ϩRNA viruses and is also found in members of one family of dsRNA viruses (Birnaviridae). Structural comparisons indicate that SJR-CPs of RNA viruses form a monophyletic group and likely were recruited from cellular SJR proteins on a single occasion during the evolution of RNA viruses (19) . The short length and high divergence of SJR-CPs preclude adequate resolution in phylogenetic analysis; thus, we performed profile-profile sequence comparisons and clustering of all viral SJR-CP sequences in our data set (see Materials and Methods for details). Analysis of the resulting network reveals patterns that are generally congruent with the RdRp phylogeny and provides further insights into the evolution of different branches of RNA viruses. At conservative P value thresholds (P Ͻ 1e Ϫ10 ), the majority of SJR-CPs segregated into two large clusters, both of which contained representatives from RdRp branch 2. Cluster 1 included the members of Picornavirales and Caliciviridae and diverse ""picornalike viruses"" of invertebrates, whereas cluster 2 consisted of the members of the families Astroviridae, Luteoviridae, and Solemoviridae and ""sobemo-like viruses"" (Fig. S3 ). In addition, cluster 2 contained members of several families from RdRp branch 3, namely, Tombusviridae (and diverse ""tombus-like viruses""), Hepeviridae, a subgroup of Nodaviridae, and ""statoviruses.""

At less-restrictive P value thresholds (P Ͻ 1e Ϫ03 ), all SJR-CPs were interconnected, largely through making contacts to the core of cluster 2. Only ""ourmiaviruses"" had stronger affinity to picornaviruses in cluster 1 (Fig. 7) . This pattern of connectivity is consistent with the radiation of SJR-CPs from a common ancestor, likely resembling sequences from cluster 2 of branch 2. This analysis also reveals high CP sequence divergence among members of some families (e.g., Bromoviridae) and numerous cases of apparent CP gene replacement. For instance, the CPs of nodaviruses fall into two groups; one is related to the turreted CPs of tetraviruses, and the other is similar to CPs of tombusviruses, mirroring the RdRp phylogeny (Fig. 7) . At a greater phylogenetic distance, CPs of astroviruses and hepeviruses are closely related despite their affiliation with branches 2 and 3, respectively, suggesting CP gene replacement in the ancestor of one of the two families. Given that the CPs of hepeviruses connect to SJR-CPs of other viruses through astroviruses, CP gene replacement most likely occurred in the ancestor of hepeviruses (Fig. S3) . Notably, the CPs of ""zhàoviruses,"" ""wèiviruses,"" and ""tombus-like"" and ""sobemo-like"" viruses (representing a diverse virus assemblage within the solemovirus branch, to the exclusion of bona fide Solemoviridae) did not form discrete clusters but rather were affiliated with diverse virus groups, suggesting extensive recombination in these viruses, with multiple CP gene exchanges (Fig. 7) . In the case of unclassified ""narnaviruses"" and ""ourmiaviruses,"" the CP genes apparently were acquired on more than 3 independent occasions from different groups of viruses, emphasizing the impact of recombination and gene shuffling in the evolution of RNA viruses. Previously, a similar extent of chimerism was also observed among singlestranded DNA (ssDNA) viruses (104, 105) , highlighting the evolutionary and functional plasticity of short viral genomes.

The modular gene-sharing network of RNA viruses: gene transfer and module shuffling. The pronounced structural and functional modularity of virus proteomes and the pervasive shuffling of the genomic regions encoding distinct protein modules are key features of virus evolution (11, 15, 17) . Therefore, a productive approach to the study of the virosphere that complements phylogenetics is the construction and analysis of networks of gene sharing. Bipartite networks, in which one type of node corresponds to genes and another to genomes, have been employed to investigate the double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) domain of the virosphere (45) . This analysis revealed hierarchical modular organization of the network, with several modules that included Global RNA Virome ® nonobvious connections between disparate groups of viruses (44, 106) . Although this type of analysis is less informative for RNA viruses due to the small number of proteins encoded in each viral genome, the ""pan-proteome"" of RNA viruses is large (Data Set S5), prompting us to experiment with bipartite gene sharing networks for RNA viruses. The initial search for statistically significant modularity identified 54 distinct modules, most of which included a single virus family (Fig. 8A and B) . Remarkably, the family Reoviridae has been split into 5 modules, highlighting the vast diversity of this family, comparable to that seen in order-level taxa. Among the exceptions, the most expansive module included the viruses of the order Picornavirales (module 29), together with those of the family Caliciviridae (module 47), which are linked through the conserved suite of genes that includes those encoding SJR-CP, chymotrypsin-like protease, S3H, and the RdRp (Fig. 8A and C) . Viruses of the order Bunyavirales were also recovered in a single module characterized by the presence of a conserved nucleocapsid (with the exception of the families Nairoviridae and Arenaviridae) and the cap-snatching endonuclease (module 51; Fig. 8A and C) .

The next stage of the network analysis aimed at detecting the supermodules that are formed from the primary modules via connecting genes. The results of the analyses of the supermodules of RNA viruses failed to attain statistical significance due to the small number of shared genes; nevertheless, some notable connections were revealed by this analysis. Specifically, 8 overlapping supermodules were identified (Fig. 8C) . The largest and, arguably, most remarkable is a supermodule that combines ϩRNA, dsRNA, and ϪRNA viruses that share the capping enzymes, S1H (with the exception of Reoviridae and Mononegavirales), and additional connector genes (e.g., the OTU family protease) that link some of the constituent modules. The second largest supermodule combines large subsets of viruses from RdRp branches 2 and 3 that are connected through the SJR-CP and the chymotrypsin-like protease. Another supermodule encompasses enveloped ϩRNA viruses of the families Flaviviridae and Togaviridae and ϪRNA viruses of the order Bunyavirales (except for Arenaviridae) that share homologous envelope glycoproteins (except for flaviviruses) and class II fusion proteins.

Information from gene sharing is inherently limited for RNA viruses due to the small number of genes in each genome. Nevertheless, the bipartite network analysis revealed prominent ""horizontal"" connections that are underlain either by actual gene exchange or by parallel acquisition of homologous genes by distinct RNA viruses.

Host ranges of RNA viruses: evolutionary implications and horizontal virus transfer (HVT). RNA viruses have been identified in representatives of all major divisions of eukaryotes, whereas in prokaryotes, members of two families of RNA viruses are known to infect only a limited range of hosts (11, 13, 15, 31) . For branch 1 in our phylogenetic tree of RdRps, the route of evolution from leviviruses infecting prokaryotes to eukaryotic ""ourmiaviruses"" of plants and invertebrates is readily traceable and involves a merger between a levivirus-derived naked RNA replicon that eukaryotes most likely inherited from the mitochondrial endosymbiont with the SJR-CP of a eukaryotic ""picorna-like virus."" Notably, such a merger seems to have occurred on at least three other independent occasions in branch 1 because several groups of invertebrate holobiont ""narnaviruses"" and some ""ourmiaviruses"" encode distantly related SJR-CPs that apparently were acquired from different groups of plant and animal viruses (Fig. 7) .

The case of cystoviruses is less clear given that this clade is sandwiched between eukaryotic viruses in branch 4 and therefore does not seem to be a good candidate for classification as the ancestor of this branch. It appears more likely that the ancestor was a toti-like virus, whereas cystoviruses were derived forms, which would imply virus transfer from eukaryotes to prokaryotes. However, an alternative scenario might be considered. No known prokaryotic viruses are classified in branch 2, but it has been proposed that the picobirnaviruses, for which no hosts have been reliably identified, actually are prokaryotic viruses. This proposal is based on the conspicuous conservation of functional, bacterium-type, ribosome-binding sites (Shine-Dalgarno sequences) in picobirnavirus genomes (107, 108) . Should that be the case, viruses of prokaryotes might be lurking among totiviruses as well. Then, branch 4 would stem from a prokaryotic ancestor, obviating the need to invoke virus transfer from eukaryotes to prokaryotes to explain the origin of the cystoviruses.

We made an attempt to quantify the potential horizontal virus transfer (HVT) events in the RNA viruses that represent the 5 major branches of the RdRp tree. The leaves of the tree were labeled with the known hosts, the entropy of the host ranges for each subtree was calculated, and the resulting values were plotted against the distance from the root (Fig. 9 ). By design, for all branches, entropy (host diversity) drops from the maximum values at the root to zero at the leaves. All branches show substantial host range diversity such that, for example, at the half-distance from the root to the leaves, all branches, except for branch 1, retain at least half of the diversity (Fig. 9 ). Furthermore, the differences between the branches are substantial, with the highest entropy observed in branch 4 (dsRNA viruses) and branch 5 (ϪRNA viruses). With all the caveats due to potential errors and ambiguities in host assignment, this analysis strongly suggests that HVT played an important role in the evolution of all major groups of RNA viruses.

RNA virus evolution coming into focus. This work was prompted by the advances of metaviromics, which have dramatically increased the known diversity of RNA viruses (11, 13, 17, 37, 57) . We reasoned that this expansion of the RNA virosphere could provide an improved understanding of virus evolution. Although further progress of metaviromics and enhanced phylogenomic methods will undoubtedly change current ideas, we believe that some key aspects of RNA virus evolution are indeed coming into focus.

The expanded diversity of RNA viruses, combined with the iterative procedure for phylogenetic analysis, allowed us to obtain a tree of all RdRps and the most closely related RTs in which the main branches are strongly supported and thus appear to be reliable (Fig. 1) . To our knowledge, the picture of RNA virus evolution emerging from the tree has not been presented previously. The tree seems to clarify the relationships between the 3 Baltimore classes of RNA viruses by revealing the nested tree structure in which dsRNA viruses evolved, on at least two occasions, from ϩRNA viruses, whereas ϪRNA viruses evolved from a distinct group of dsRNA viruses.

The derivation of ϪRNA viruses from dsRNA viruses is, arguably, the most unexpected outcome of the present analysis, considering the lack of genes (other than the RdRp gene) shared by these virus classes. Clearly, given that the primary evidence behind the derivation of ϪRNA viruses from within dsRNA viruses comes from deep phylogeny, extreme caution is due in the interpretation of this observation. However, the pronounced similarity between the three-dimensional (3D) structures of the RdRps of ϪRNA influenza virus A and bacteriophage 6 dsRNA cystovirus (35) is compatible with our findings. Further, because virtually no ϪRNA viruses are known in prokaryotes or unicellular eukaryotes (with the single exception of the ""leischbuviruses"" in parasitic trypanosomatids [50] , which were likely acquired from the animal hosts of these protists), their later origin from a preexisting group of ϩRNA or dsRNA viruses appears most likely.

The ϩRNA to dsRNA to ϪRNA scenario of RNA virus genome evolution also makes sense in terms of the molecular logic of genome replication-expression strategies. Indeed, ϩRNA viruses use the simplest genomic strategy and, in all likelihood, represent the primary pool of RNA viruses. The dsRNA viruses conceivably evolved when a ϩRNA virus switched to encapsidating a replicative intermediate (dsRNA) together with the RdRp. Naked replicons similar to those of ""mitoviruses,"" hypoviruses, and endornaviruses might have been evolutionary intermediates in this process. This switch does not seem to be as ""easy"" and common as previously suspected (15, 32) but, nevertheless, appears to have occurred at least twice during the evolution of RNA viruses. The Global RNA Virome ® origin of ϪRNA viruses is the next step during which the plus strand is discarded from the virions, perhaps simplifying the processes of transcription and replication. Conceivably, the evolution of dsRNA and ϪRNA viruses, in which transcription and replication of the viral genomes were confined to the interior of virions or nucleocapsid transcription/replication complexes and no dsRNA accumulated in the infected cells, was driven by the advantage of escaping some of the host defense mechanisms, in particular, RNA interference (RNAi) (109, 110) . The membrane-associated replication complexes of ϩRNA viruses could represent an initial step in this direction (9) .

Obviously, evolution of the RdRp does not equal evolution of viruses; other genes, in particular, those encoding capsid and other structural proteins, are crucial for virus reproduction, and these genes often have different histories. The reconstruction of gene gain and loss sheds some light on these aspects of RNA virus evolution. The ancestors of each of the major branches of RNA viruses (except for branch 1) appear to have been simply organized ϩRNA viruses resembling tombusviruses (Fig. 10) . Thus, these types of viruses encoding RdRps and SJR-CPs might have been ancestral to the bulk of eukaryotic RNA viruses (apart from those in branch 1 that derive directly from prokaryotic leviviruses). The subsequent parallel capture of different helicases enabled evolution of increasingly complex genomes via accumulation of additional genes (Fig. 10) . Notably, similar levels of complexity, with a complete coding capacity of 20 to 40 kb, were reached independently in 4 branches of the RdRp tree, namely, branch 2 (coronaviruses), branch 3 (closteroviruses and flaviviruses), branch 4 (reoviruses), and branch 5 (filoviruses and paramyxoviruses) (Fig. 3 and 6) .

Gene exchange and shuffling of gene modules are important factors of RNA virus evolution. For example, it appears that all dsRNA viruses in the two major clades within Fig. 1 legend. Only the genes corresponding to RdRp, CP, and helicases (S1H, S2H, and S3H for the helicases of superfamilies 1, 2, and 3, respectively) are shown systematically. The helicases appear to have been captured independently and in parallel in 3 branches of ϩRNA viruses, facilitating the evolution of larger, more complex genomes. Additional genes, namely, the Endo and Exo genes (for endonuclease and exonuclease, respectively) and the Hsp70h gene (heat shock protein 70 homolog), are shown selectively, to emphasize the increased genome complexity, respectively, in Nidovirales and in Closteroviridae. The virion architecture is shown schematically for each included group of viruses. Icosahedral capsids composed of unelated CPs are indicated by different colors (see the text for details). The question mark at the hypothetical ancestral eukaryotic RNA virus indicates the uncertainty with regard to the nature of the host (prokaryotic or eukaryotic) of this ancestral form. The block arrow at the bottom indicates the time flow and the complexification trend in RNA virus evolution.

Wolf et al. branches 2 and 4 share homologous structural modules that combine with distinct RdRps. At least in the case of partiti-picobirnaviruses in branch 2, the dsRNA virus (""toti-like virus"") CP apparently displaced the ancestral SJR-CP. However, this particular protein structure does not seem to be essential to encapsidate a dsRNA genome; birnaviruses, whose provenance is uncertain due to the permutation in their RdRps, retain SJR-CP, which is most closely related to SJR-CP of nodaviruses and tetraviruses (19) . An even more striking example of module shuffling is presented by amalgaviruses, dsRNA viruses that group with partitiviruses in the RdRp tree but encode a distant homolog of the nucleocapsid protein of ϪRNA bunyaviruses (111) (112) (113) (114) . More generally, structural and replication modules have been repeatedly shuffled during the evolution of ϩRNA viruses. Examples include displacement of the ancestral SJR-CP by a filamentous CP in potyviruses and by a helical nucleocapsid protein in nidoviruses and multiple cases of displacement with rod-shaped-like CP and unique nucleocapsid proteins in branch 3. Thus, exchange of genes and gene modules among RNA viruses is pervasive and can cross the boundaries of Baltimore classes.

Another recurring trend in RNA virus evolution is the loss of the structural module, resulting in the emergence of naked RNA replicons such as ""narnaviruses"" and ""mitoviruses"" in branch 1, hypoviruses in branch 2, and endornaviruses, umbraviruses, and deltaflexiviruses in branch 3 (18) . On some occasions, broad horizontal spread of a gene led to a major shift in the lifestyle of viruses, such as adaptation of viruses to new types of hosts. The primary cases in point are the movement proteins (MPs) of plant viruses that are represented in all 5 branches of the RdRp tree and, outside the RNA part of the virosphere, in plant caulimoviruses and badnaviruses and in ssDNA viruses (115) .

The prevalence of HVT and the overall course of RNA virus evolution. Arguably, the most striking realization brought about by metaviromics analyses concerns the diverse host range of numerous groups of viruses, even tight ones that occupy positions near the tips of the RdRp tree. Extending early observations on the highly unexpected similarities between viruses of animals and plants, recent metaviromic analyses revealed numerous clusters of indisputably related viruses infecting animals and plants or plants and fungi or, in some cases, animals or plants and protists. The results of the analyses of evolutionary relationships between viruses with distinct host ranges are supported not only by the phylogeny of the RdRp but also by the fact that these viruses share additional conserved domains, such as, for example, SJR1, S3H, and 3C-Pro in the case of Picornavirales members infecting protists, plants, fungi, invertebrates, and vertebrates (Fig. 3) .

Invertebrates are particularly promiscuous hosts for viruses, often sharing the same virus group with distantly related organisms. Certainly, much caution is due in the interpretation of host range assignments from metaviromics, especially those resulting from holobiont studies. Viruses identified in holobiont samples of (for example) invertebrates could actually infect protists associated with these animals (50) or could represent contamination from fungal or plant or even prokaryotic sources. These uncertainties notwithstanding, the extensive diversity of hosts even within small branches of the RdRp tree is undeniable. A coevolution scenario in which the ancestors of all these viruses originated from the common ancestor of the respective groups of eukaryotes and coevolved with the hosts implies an enormous diversity of RNA viruses in early eukaryotes. This scenario appears to be highly unlikely given the apparent paucity of RNA viruses in the extant protists (although new metaviromic studies might substantially expand the range of protist viruses). The pervasive HVT alternative seems much more plausible, especially given that arthropods, nematodes, and other invertebrates are well known as virus vectors and thus fit the role of RNA virus reservoirs (11) .

In addition to invertebrates, which appear to be the dominant HVT agents, fungi could also play an important role in HVT within the global RNA virome. Indeed, fungi that are tightly associated with plants and insects often share closely related viruses with these organisms (116) (117) (118) . Furthermore, an indisputable case of cross-kingdom transfer of an insect iflavirus to an entomopathogenic fungus has been recently described (119) .

These findings appear to be most extensively compatible with a grand evolutionary scenario (Fig. 10) in which the ancestor of the eukaryotic RNA virome was a levi/ narnavirus-like naked RNA replicon that originally reproduced in mitochondria and then combined with a host carbohydrate-binding SJR protein (19) or a preexisting SJR-CP from a DNA virus to form a simple ancestral virus. Given that viruses of branches 2, 3, and 4 are present in modern protists, it appears likely that these branches emerged in early eukaryotes. However, because of the apparent dominance of the viruses of RdRp branch 2 (members of the ""picornavirus supergroup"" in general and of the ""aquatic picorna-like viruses"" clade in particular) in protists, this branch likely diversified first, whereas the diversification of branches 3 and 4 occurred later, after ancestral protist viruses were transferred to marine invertebrates during the Cambrian explosion. Results of the recent analysis of the viromes of ctenophores, sponges, and cnidarians suggest that substantial diversification of RNA viruses had already occurred in these deeply branching metazoa (120) . Invertebrates brought their already highly diverse RNA virome to land at the time of terrestrialization and subsequently inoculated land plants. In land plants, RNA viruses, particularly those of branch 3, dramatically expanded, perhaps in part because of the exclusion of competing large DNA viruses. Finally, it seems plausible that, given the high prevalence of ϪRNA viruses in metazoa and their virtual absence in protists (with the exception of the recently discovered ""leishbuviruses"" that likely invaded their parasitic protist hosts via HVT from an animal host [49, 50] ), the viruses that comprise RdRp branch 5 evolved in animals via mixing and matching genes from reovirus-like and flavivirus-like ancestors.

The impending overhaul of RNA virus taxonomy. The expansion of the global RNA virome thanks to the advances of metaviromics, combined with the phylogenomics results, seems to call for an overhaul of the current virus taxonomy on multiple levels. Most importantly, creation of a coherent, hierarchical system with multiple taxonomic ranks seems to be imminent. This process has already started with the proposal of a phylum rank for ϪRNA viruses, for which monophyly is unequivocally supported by the present analysis ( Fig. 1 and 6 ). This phylum could consist of two subphyla with multiple classes and orders. At least 4 additional phyla of RNA viruses can be confidently predicted to emerge, including the dsRNA viruses of branch 4 and the ϩRNA viruses of branches 1, 2, and 3. Each of these phyla will undoubtedly have a rich internal structure. In addition, some of the current families do not seem to be compatible with the expansive RdRp trees presented here and in a previous analysis (14) . For instance, the families Coronaviridae, Togaviridae, and Rhabdoviridae are likely to be split into two families each.

While the present study was in preparation, a major attempt at a comprehensive virus classification was published (121) . This work analyzed a dendrogram that was produced from matrices of distances between viruses derived from sequence similarity scores combined with measures of gene composition similarity. Unlike our present analysis, this approach presupposes monophyly of each of the Baltimore classes. Furthermore, given that their analysis was based on measures of similarity rather than on phylogenetic analysis proper, this approach is best regarded as producing a phenetic classification of viruses rather that an evolutionary reconstruction as such. Some of the groups delineated by this method, particularly those among ϩRNA viruses, are closely similar to those reported here. Others, however, are extensively different; for instance, the order Mononegavirales is not classified as monophyletic in their dendrograms. We did not attempt a complete comparison; such an exercise could be useful in the future for better understanding the routes of RNA virus evolution.

Concluding remarks. Through metaviromics, many aspects of the global RNA virome evolution can be clarified. Certainly, reconstruction of the deepest events in this evolutionary history is bound to remain tentative, especially because the RdRp gene is the only universal gene of the RNA viruses and is hence the only one that can serve as the template for evolutionary reconstructions. At the depth of divergence characteristic of RdRps, the relationship between the major branches in the tree cannot be established with confidence. Nevertheless, monophyly of several expansive groups, in particular, the 5 main branches in the RdRp tree, is strongly supported. Because of the stability of these branches, biologically plausible scenarios of evolution emerge under which dsRNA viruses evolved from different groups of ϩRNA viruses whereas ϪRNA viruses evolved from dsRNA viruses.

Evolutionary reconstructions suggest that the last common ancestors of each major lineage of eukaryotic ϩRNA viruses were simple viruses that encoded only the RdRp and a CP, most likely of the SJR fold. Subsequent evolution involved independent capture of distinct helicases which apparently facilitate replication of larger, more complex ϩRNA genomes. The helicase-assisted replication of ϩRNA genomes created the opportunities for parallel acquisition of additional genes encoding proteins involved in polyprotein processing and virus genome expression, such as proteases and capping enzymes, respectively, and proteins involved in virus-host interactions, such as MPs or RNAi suppressors of plant viruses. In addition to these processes of vertical evolution of RNA viruses, the results from phylogenomic analyses reveal multiple cases of gene module exchange among diverse viruses and pervasive HVT, often between distantly related hosts, such as animals and plants. Together, these processes have shaped a complex network of evolutionary relationships among RNA viruses.

The much-anticipated comprehensive exploration of the RNA viromes of prokaryotes and unicellular eukaryotes, such as free-living excavates, chromalveolates, rhizaria, amoebozoa, and choanoflagellates, as well as deeply rooted metazoa, will undoubtedly help in developing better-supported evolutionary scenarios for each of the 5 major branches of the RNA virus tree. Nevertheless, it is already clear that the current taxonomy of RNA viruses is due for a complete overhaul.

Phylogeny of RNA-dependent RNA polymerases. Protein sequences belonging to RNA viruses (excluding retroviruses) and to unclassified viruses were downloaded from the NCBI GenBank database in April 2017 (122) . Initial screening for RdRp domains was performed using PSI-BLAST (123) (E value of 0.01, effective database size of 2 ϫ 10 8 sequences) with position-specific scoring matrices (PSSMs) produced from the available RdRp alignments. The sources included group-specific alignments for ϩRNA viruses and dsRNA viruses (12, 31) and the 4 PFAM alignments for the ϪRNA viruses (pfam00602, pfam00946, pfam04196, and pfam06317) from the NCBI conserved domain database (CDD) (124) . Additionally, a set of RTs from group II introns and non-long-terminal-repeat (non-LTR) retrotransposons was extracted from GenBank as an outgroup.

Extracted RdRp footprints were filtered for the fraction of unresolved amino acids (at most 10%) and clustered using UCLUST (125) with a similarity threshold of 0.9. One representative from each cluster was selected for further analysis. The resulting set contained 4,640 virus RdRps. This set went through several rounds of semimanual curation whereby sequences were clustered using UCLUST, aligned using MUSCLE (126) , and cross-searched against each other and their parent sequences (often representing complete viral polyproteins) using PSI-BLAST and HHSEARCH (127) . Upon obtaining the results of these searches, the boundaries of the RdRp domain were expanded or trimmed to improve their compatibility with each other.

The RdRp and RT sequences were subjected to an iterative clustering and aligning procedure, organized as follows. Initially, sequences were clustered using UCLUST with a similarity threshold of 0.5. The clustered sequences were aligned using MUSCLE, and singletons were converted to pseudoalignments consisting of just one sequence. Sites containing more than 67% gaps were temporarily removed from alignments, and pairwise similarity scores were obtained for clusters by the use of HHSEARCH. Scores for a pair of clusters were converted to distances as follows: the d A,B ϭ Ϫlog[s A,B /min(s A,A ,s B,B ) formula, in which d A,B is the distance between cluster A and cluster B and s A,B is the HHSEARCH score for the comparison of these clusters, was used to convert scores s to distances d. The matrix of pairwise distances was used to calculate the mean by the unweighted pair group method using average linkages (UPGMA) (128) . Shallow tips of the tree were used as the guide tree for a progressive pairwise alignment of the clusters at the tree leaves using HHALIGN (127) , resulting in larger clusters. This procedure was reiterative, ultimately resulting in the single alignment of the whole set of 4,640 virus RdRp sequences and 1,028 RT sequences.

During the clustering procedure, 50 virus RdRp clusters, consisting of 1 to 545 sequences, were defined. These clusters represented either well-established groups of related viruses (roughly comparable to the ICTV family rank) or, in case of poorly characterized and unclassified viruses, groups of well-aligned RdRps that were clearly distinct from others. In all cases, uncertainties were treated conservatively, i.e., favoring placing sequences with questionable relatedness into separate clusters. Additionally, RT sequences were placed into two clusters consisting of group II intron RTs and non-LTR retrotransposon RTs. For each cluster consisting of three or more sequences, an approximate maximum likelihood (ML) phylogenetic tree was constructed from the cluster-specific alignment using the FastTree program (129) (Whelan and Goldman [WAG] evolutionary model with gamma-distributed site rates) with sites that contained more than 50% gaps removed from the alignment. Trees were rooted using a variant of the midpoint rooting procedure such that the differences between the (weighted) average root-to-tip distances in the subtrees on the opposite sides of the root were minimized.

To resolve the structure of the global relationships, up to five representatives from each cluster were selected using the within-cluster trees to ensure the diversity of the selected sequences. This procedure resulted in a set of 228 virus RdRps and 10 RTs. The alignments of the selected sequences were extracted from the master alignment and filtered for sites containing more than 50% gaps. A ML phylogenetic tree was reconstructed for the resulting alignment using PhyML (48) (Le Gascuel [LG] evolutionary model with gamma-distributed site rates and empirical amino acid frequencies; support values were calculated using aBayes method implemented in PhyML). Another form of branch support, i.e., bootstrap support provided by the transfer (BOOSTER) phylogenetic bootstrap method (130) , was also used to assess the reliability of the major tree divisions. Alternatively, the same RdRp alignment was used as the input for ML phylogenetic analysis using RAxML (LG evolutionary model with gamma-distributed site rates and empirical amino acid frequencies).

RdRps in the global tree were divided into 5 major branches (supergroups). Up to 15 representatives from each cluster were selected to form supergroup-level alignments. The respective trees were reconstructed from these alignments using the same procedure (PhyML tree with LG evolutionary model with gamma-distributed site rates and empirical amino acid frequencies).

The overall tree was assembled manually by first replacing the supergroup representatives in the global tree with the supergroup trees and then replacing the cluster representatives with the cluster trees. The lower-level trees were rooted according to the arrangement of the representatives in the upper-level tree.

Identification of protein domains. Protein domains were identified using a representative set of RNA virus genomes, including representative members of ICTV-approved virus families and unclassified virus groups. This set was annotated manually using sensitive profile-profile comparisons with the HHsuite package (127) , and hmm profiles for annotated proteins or their domains were generated by running one iteration of HHblits against the latest (October 2017) uniclust30 database (131) . Each annotated profile was assigned to a functional category (e.g., Љcapsid protein_jelly-roll,Љ Љchymotrypsinlike proteaseЉ). These profiles were used to annotate the genomes of all of the viruses that were included in the RdRp phylogenetic analysis and for which complete (or near-complete) genome sequences were available. Profiles for the latter proteins were generated by running one iteration of Jackhmmer (132) against the UniRef50 database. Protein regions that did not have significant hits were extracted and clustered with cluster analysis of sequences (CLANS) (133) , and groups containing at least three members were identified, annotated (if possible), and added to the manually annotated profile database. The last step of the domain identification procedure was then repeated using the updated RNA virus profile database. Highly similar viruses (with identical domain organizations and Ͼ94% identical RdRps) were removed from the data set. In addition, only one representative genome was retained for some members of overrepresented species (e.g., Hepacivirus C). Many genomes (e.g., alphaviruses, tombusviruses, and nidoviruses) encoded readthrough proteins, resulting in domains from the shorter protein contained within the longer readthrough protein. Such redundancies were removed by filtering out the shorter of the two proteins sharing Ͼ80% identity. The final set of annotated genomes included 2,839 viruses.

Reconstruction of the history of gene gain and loss. The protein domains identified in the 2,839 virus genomes were mapped onto the composite tree of virus RdRps. A set of 500 representatives was chosen among the (mostly complete) genomes. The domain complement data and the respective tree were analyzed using the GLOOME program (51) . Domain gains and losses were inferred at each tree branch using the difference of posterior probabilities for the domain occurrence in the nodes at the proximal and the distal ends of the branch (differences with values above 0.5 imply gain; differences with values below Ϫ0.5 imply loss).

Clustering analysis. The SJR CP network was generated by performing all-against-all comparisons of the SJR CP profiles. To generate hmm profiles, SJR CP sequences were extracted from the total proteome of RNA viruses and two iterations of HHblits were performed against the uniprot20_2016_02 database. The resulting profiles were compared to each other with HHsearch (127) . Their similarity P values were extracted from the result files and used as an input for CLANS program (133) . Clusters were identified using a network-based algorithm implemented in CLANS. Resulting clusters were manually inspected and refined.

Analysis of bipartite gene-genome networks. A bipartite network was built to study the patterns of gene sharing among viral genomes (44, 106) . After removal of genomes with fewer than 2 domains and of domains that appeared in less than 3 genomes, the network consisted of 2,829 nodes, of which 2,515 corresponded to genomes and 314 to domains. Genome and domain nodes were connected by links wherever a domain was present in a genome. A consensus community detection approach was used to identify the modules of the network (134, 135) . First, we ran 500 replicas with Infomap (136) (bipartite setting, using domains as factors) and built a similarity matrix by assigning to each pair of nodes a similarity value equal to the fraction of replicas in which both nodes were placed in the same module. Then, hierarchical clustering was performed on the similarity matrix, setting the number of clusters equal to the median number of modules obtained in the 500 replicas. Order statistics local optimization method (Oslom) software (137) was subsequently used to filter significant modules with a P value threshold equal to 0.05. To detect higher-order (super)modules, we first identified connector domains as those present in at least 2 modules with prevalence greater than 0.65. The second-order network, composed of 54 modules and 34 connector domains, was searched for second-order modules with Infomap (500 replicas, bipartite setting with connector domains as factors). Due to the small size of the second-order network, consensus community detection did not qualitatively improve the results of the search, and therefore we took the replica with the best Infomap score and skipped hierarchical clustering for this and subsequent steps of the higher-order module search. After assessing statistical significance with Oslom, 4 second-order modules were recovered, encompassing 12 of the original modules associated with closely related virus families. A third-order network was built by pooling the 4 second-order modules with the 46 modules that remained unmerged. The third-order network was analyzed in the same manner to obtain the 9 supermodules. None of these supermodules was assessed by Oslom as significant.

Quantification of virus host range diversity. Known hosts or, in case of viruses isolated from holobionts, virus sources were identified for 3,456 viruses. The host taxonomy (analyzed to the phylum level) was mapped to the leaves of the combined tree. The tree was ultrametrized, and the weights were computed for all leaves as described in reference 138. Each internal node of the tree therefore defines a set of leaves with assigned hosts; the distribution of (weighted) relative frequencies of hosts can be characterized by its Shannon entropy. Each leaf has one host defined such that the entropy of the host range distribution is 0 whereas the host diversity is maximal at the root. The entropy generally declines along the tree because viruses that belong to relatively shallow branches tend to share their host ranges. The node depth versus node host range entropy data were averaged for each major branch separately using a Gaussian kernel with a bandwidth equal to 10% of the total tree depth.

Natural selection and infectious disease in human populations,"The ancient biological 'arms race' between microbial pathogens and humans has shaped genetic variation in modern populations, and this has important implications for the growing field of medical genomics. As humans migrated throughout the world, populations encountered distinct pathogens, and natural selection increased the prevalence of alleles that are advantageous in the new ecosystems in both host and pathogens. This ancient history now influences human infectious disease susceptibility and microbiome homeostasis, and contributes to common diseases that show geographical disparities, such as autoimmune and metabolic disorders. Using new high-throughput technologies, analytical methods and expanding public data resources, the investigation of natural selection is leading to new insights into the function and dysfunction of human biology.","Infectious pathogens are arguably among the strongest selective forces that act on human populations1. Migrations and cultural changes during recent human evolutionary history (the past 100,000 years or so) exposed populations to dangerous pathogens as they colonized new environments, increased in population density and had closer contact with animal disease vectors, including both conventionally domesticated animals (for example, dogs, cattle, sheep, pigs and fowl) and those exploiting permanent human settlement (for example, rodents and sparrows)2, 3. Consequently, both birth and mortality rates increased markedly4.

Host genetics strongly influences an individual's susceptibility to infectious disease5, 6. Pathogens that diminish reproductive potential, either through death or poor health, drive selection on genetic variants that affect resistance; selection is likely to be most evident for pathogens with a long-standing relationship with Homo sapiens, including those that cause malaria, smallpox, cholera, tuberculosis and leprosy7 (Fig. 1) . We also contend with new threats, such as AIDS and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Some pathogens cause acute illnesses such as smallpox and cholera but, once survived, pose little additional threat. Other pathogens -for example, those causing malaria, tuberculosis and leprosy, as well as parasitic worms -can be carried as chronic infections and impair nutrition, growth, cognitive development and fertility. The timing, strength and direction (that is, positive, negative or balancing) of selection shape the patterns of variation that remain in the genome. These signatures of selection will therefore vary with the age, geographical spread and virulence of the pathogen.

Key events in recent human evolution (boxes outlined in black) are juxtaposed with the estimated ages of infectious disease emergence (boxes outlined in red). The fragmentation of the human lineage into genetically and geographically distinct populations (blue lines) accelerates with migration out of Africa. Later, these populations started mixing more (blue shaded regions between the populations) along trade routes (such as the Silk Road), through colonization and through high rates of global travel nowadays.

For those with access, modern medicine radically diminishes exposure to various pathogens. In developed countries, vaccination, better nutrition and improved public health have eliminated diseases that were common in the past8. Common immune-mediated diseases may be partly caused by evolutionary adaptations for resistance and symbiosis with potentially dangerous microorganisms9, 10, 11, 12. For example, decreased gut microbiome diversity in residents of developed countries13 may alter mucosal immune responses14. Understanding host-pathogen interactions will inform the development of new therapies both to counter ongoing pathogen evolution and to better manage immune-mediated diseases15.

Here, we review how the technological revolution in genomics allows us to examine human adaptation to infectious disease in new ways. Natural selection leaves distinctive signatures in the genome, as genetic variants that improve survival and reproduction increase in frequency, and detrimental variants vanish. Hundreds of candidate regions of selection were identified in early genomic data sets, but only few adaptive variants were identified16. Highthroughput biotechnology enables large-scale surveys of genome diversity, genome-wide association studies (GWASs), next-generation sequencing, and high-throughput experimental and bioengineering approaches17. Together with expanding computational capacity18, these tools offer new power to find and functionally elucidate adaptive changes. Pathogen susceptibility and immune traits are particularly amenable to mapping approaches that combine scans for natural selection and genetic association. We consider how these new genomic analyses provide insights into human evolution and have implications for human health. We focus primarily on examples in which selection is connected to infectious disease susceptibility through additional phenotypic associations or functional investigations.

Natural selection is the tendency for traits to increase or decrease in frequency in a population depending on the reproductive success of those exhibiting them. Positive selection increases the frequency of favoured alleles, negative selection eliminates detrimental alleles, and balancing selection favours diversity. This process leaves unusual patterns of genetic diversity that mark selected loci (that is, signatures of selection) when compared with the background distribution of genetic variation in the genome, which is assumed to evolve under neutrality to a large extent19. Population events that alter genetic diversity -including bottlenecks, expansions, splits and admixture -complicate accurate detection of selected loci.

Scans for natural selection have been made possible by statistical tools to detect signatures of selection and by rapidly expanding whole-genome data sets in multiple human populations. Whereas early scans relied on single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping arrays, next-generation sequencing technologies now enable generation of whole-genome sequence data sets for analysis. Such data sets have several advantages. They do not suffer from ascertainment bias, which is the distortion in measures of genetic diversity and neutral variation20 created by the nonrandom sampling of SNPs on arrays. In addition, sequence data make it feasible to dissect loci with complex patterns of selection and short blocks of linkage disequilibrium (LD), such as the haemoglobin beta (HBB) gene that is associated with sickle cell anaemia21. Finally, as sequencing can detect potentially all variation throughout an individual's genome, the search for the precise causal variant driving selection is facilitated; however, as for SNP genotyping arrays, the comprehensiveness of capturing population-wide variation will depend on the number of individuals sampled.

Here, we briefly describe a few commonly used signatures that can help to elucidate human adaptations to pathogens. Various excellent resources provide more detailed background on statistical methods for detecting selection22, 23, 24, 25, 26.

Positive selection increases the prevalence of genetic variants that improve survival and fertility. For example, a mutation that protects against malaria by disrupting expression of the Duffy antigen gene DARC (also known as FY), which encodes the receptor used by the Plasmodium vivax malarial parasite to enter red blood cells, has reached fixation in most of sub-Saharan Africa27. Positive selection can act on new variants or on standing variation that becomes favourable owing to environmental changes28, 29.

The test used to detect positive selection depends on when the selection occurred and on whether the variant is standing or new28. Very ancient selection may leave an excess of fixed, functional (for example, protein-coding) genetic changes that have been acquired over millions of years and through repeated selective sweeps. A selected variant that increases rapidly in frequency in the past ~250,000 years can be detected as an unusual reduction in genetic diversity. Recent positive selection (within the past 5,000-100,000 years) can be found with three different signals: unusually large allele frequency differences between populations, unusually high frequency of newly derived variants and unusually extended LD caused by the rapid increase in frequency of a single allele. The LD-based methods30 are particularly useful for detecting incomplete sweeps (that is, variants increasing in prevalence but not to fixation), which are more common in recent human evolution than complete sweeps31, 32, 33, 34.

These methods have detected hundreds of loci with signatures of selection in the human genome16, 28, 30, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41 . Their sensitivity to recent events depends on the strength of selection, as more advantageous variants increase to detectable frequencies faster. The comparison of many individuals from closely related populations using treebased methods can help to detect smaller selection-driven changes in allele frequencies42. Combining several different tests for selection improves sensitivity to a wider range of selection regimes, helps to narrow down candidate regions and pinpoints a small number of top causal candidates28, 33, 43. Pathogen resistance alleles are prime candidates for discovery, as they are likely to be both recent and common, and have increased in frequency owing to the burden of disease.

Balancing selection maintains multiple alleles at a locus. A variant may confer a heterozygous advantage; for example, at the HBB sickle cell locus, heterozygous carriers are malaria resistant to a large extent but otherwise healthy, which gives them a reproductive advantage in malaria-endemic environments over homozygous wild-type individuals (who are susceptible to malaria) and homozygous carriers (who have sickle cell disease and high childhood mortality27). Alternatively, the advantage conferred by a variant may depend on its prevalence. Diversifying selection favours high levels of polymorphism, as in the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). MHC diversity confers resistance to a broader range of pathogens44 and is strongly selected for45. In humans, MHC diversity correlates with local pathogen diversity, which is consistent with pathogen-driven balancing selection46. Selection at this locus is of particular interest, as it harbours more bona fide disease associations than any other region in the human genome47, 48, including associations to infectious disease susceptibility (including AIDS49, 50, 51, leprosy52, leishmaniasis53, hepatitis B54, 55, 56, hepatitis C57 and human papilloma virus (HPV) infection58), autoimmune disorders, cancers and neuropsychiatric diseases. regions with signatures of balancing selection -MHC and 125 other loci64 -were enriched for membrane glycoproteins. These are proteins exploited by a broad range of pathogens as receptors for cell invasion and to evade the host immune response, which suggests that the selection was pathogen driven65, 66, 67.

Negative selection eliminates existing detrimental variation from a population68. For example, when human populations in the Ganges River Delta encountered pathogenic Vibrio cholerae, individuals of blood type O had higher risk of dying from severe cholera, which put them at a strong reproductive disadvantage. Nowadays, populations in the choleraendemic Ganges River Delta have the lowest rates of blood type O in the world, which is consistent with negative selection69, 70. Purifying selection is the ongoing removal of deleterious alleles as they arise. Signatures of purifying selection include decreased overall diversity, loss of functional variation and an excess of rare alleles68. Purifying selection also manifests as a lack of substitutions between species, and this signal is used to identify functionally important, highly conserved genomic regions in cross-species comparisons71.

GWASs identify genomic variants that are significantly correlated with a phenotype of interest, typically in large sample cohorts. The sample size required is smaller if variants are at high prevalence, have strong effects and are in regions of extensive LD72, 73, all of which are characteristics of positively selected loci (Fig. 2) . As beneficial alleles increase in prevalence, they carry nearby variants with them (known as genetic hitchhiking); these nearby variants can thus be proxies for the causal allele and enhance power to detect association.

The US National Institutes of Health (NIH) Catalog of published GWASs includes all strong SNP-trait associations (P <1×10 −5 ) from 1,900 curated publications48. However, only 68 publications are related to pathogen susceptibility, and most of those (63%) are focused on AIDS (16 studies), hepatitis B (12 studies) and hepatitis C (15 studies). The remainder includes GWASs of tuberculosis (5 studies), prion diseases (3 studies), malaria (3 studies), leprosy (2 studies), smallpox (2 studies) and 9 others (see Supplementary information S1 (table)). Before GWASs, a candidate gene approach was used to find strong-effect variants that were associated with disease susceptibility in HBB, DARC and SLC4A1 (solute carrier family 4 (anion exchanger), member 1 (Diego blood group)) for malaria, and the CCR5 (chemokine (C-C motif) receptor 5) gene for AIDS74. However, candidate gene studies were generally underpowered, and beyond these textbook examples most previous associations have so far failed to replicate in GWASs75. For example, of 22 tuberculosisassociated genes, none were significantly associated in a GWAS of 11,425 Africans, nor were these genes overrepresented among nominally significant results76, 77, 78. Candidate gene studies of infectious disease susceptibility have been reviewed in detail elsewhere79.

Integrating selection metrics into GWASs can increase their power. A study of malaria resistance loci in Africa found that when association results are weighted on the basis of evidence of positive selection, power increases by 1-2 orders of magnitude80, 81. Another approach was used to identify positively selected drug resistance loci in the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum; the sample was partitioned into two populations defined by phenotype (for example, resistant and susceptible), and regions of selection were identified in resistant individuals82. Furthermore, as described above, selection increases the power of GWASs themselves by driving the emergence of common alleles of strong effect. Indeed, using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, we found that variants in positively selected regions in the NIH Catalog of published GWASs are more significantly associated with the tested phenotype (P KS = 2 × 10 −7 ) than those in the rest of the genome33.

Similar to many other human traits, adaptation to pathogens is likely to be polygenic33, 83, as mutations in many genes emerge and increase in prevalence through selection. Pathwaybased approaches scrutinize candidate regions identified in GWASs84 to elucidate functional pathways that are disrupted in complex human diseases85. The same approach can be applied to candidate selected regions; however, as natural selection acts on many traits, they are less powered. Only when a particular pathway is repeatedly selected for in a population, such as skin pigmentation in Europeans, do we expect significant enrichment.

For an allele to be selected it must have a functional effect, but the relevant phenotype is typically unknown. Selected regions therefore present an opportunity to develop a systematic process for functionally characterizing genetic variation. In a few cases, a selected region contains well-characterized genes that offered clear functional hypotheses, for example, Toll-like receptor 5 (TLR5, which is involved in bacterial flagellin sensing33) (Fig. 3A) , apolipoprotein L1 (APOL1, which encodes a serum factor that lyses Trypanosoma brucei86) ( Fig. 3B ) and HBB (which influences infection by P. falciparum27 (see above)). For genes with unknown or diverse functions, identification of the selected trait is more complicated. Moreover, most selection signals are non-genic and are likely to alter poorly characterized regulatory regions of the genome43, 87, 88.

Functional elucidation remains a difficult and mostly manual process, and benefits enormously when candidate variants are narrowed down to a small number. New methods for detecting selection are remarkably effective at identifying top functional candidates among all variants in selected regions -a list that can be further reduced by incorporating GWAS results, expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) and functional annotations33, 89. Useful resources include the 1000 Genomes Project, which aims to identify all common (>1%) human genetic variation by sequencing >1,000 individuals90, and the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) Project, which aims to characterize all functional elements in the genome91. Breakthroughs in next-generation sequencing, high-throughput functional screens, single-cell genomics, microfluidics, chromosome conformation capture and genome engineering approaches now make it possible to test many variants in parallel, to investigate non-genic regions and to functionally screen the whole genome17, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99. 

The dynamics of host-pathogen interactions (for example, length of exposure, geographical spread, morbidity and mortality, and co-occurring environmental events) influences the genetic architecture of resistance variants in modern populations (Fig. 4) . Many different modes of selection shape patterns of variation in humans (reviewed in Refs 25, 26) , and selection scans using current methods and data sets can only detect a subset of selected loci. The most conspicuous signals are perhaps left by positive selection in recent human evolutionary history. This is the timeframe during which many major pathogens first emerged ( Fig. 1; Table 1 ), which suggests that this mode of selection is particularly relevant to studies of infectious disease susceptibility. Moreover, finding beneficial variants that are favoured by recent selection could suggest new medical therapies. Transforming genetic discoveries into improved healthcare will take time, but understanding natural resistance is an important first step.

We note that some have questioned the extent of recent positive selection in humans in light of a recent paper31. In that paper, the authors estimated that during the past 250,000 years, ~0.5% of nonsynonymous substitutions have swept to fixation (that is, 100% prevalence), and such an observation has been interpreted to suggest that very few positively selected variants can be found in humans. In actuality, this corresponds to ~340 adaptive nonsynonymous mutations in the 1000 Genomes Project data. Moreover, much (probably most) adaptive evolution occurred in regulatory, non-coding regions100, 101, and most recent selective sweeps are far from complete102. Thus, the actual number of positively selected loci could be much larger.

Under the framework of recent positive selection, one would anticipate that genetic variants conferring pathogen resistance that are moderately old (dating since the human migrations from Africa but at least thousands of years old), that were geographically limited in history and that exerted strong positive selective pressure will be most readily detected, provided that the studies are carried out in the population with the history of disease exposure. Many of the pathogen studies so far are imperfect fits for these criteria. Here, we review some of the prominent diseases of human history (Table 1) , and discuss the strengths and limitations of investigating natural selection and association for these traits.

Malaria is caused by obligate parasitic Plasmodium spp., which infects hundreds of millions of people and kills ~1 million children annually103. P. falciparum has afflicted humans for ~100,000 years, and a rapid upsurge of malaria ~10,000 years ago increased selective pressure on some human populations27, 104. As a result, incidence of sickle cell disease and other inherited red blood cell disorders that are associated with malaria resistance (for example, α-thalassemia, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency and ovalocytosis) coincides with the geographical distribution of malaria27.

The presence of a disease in a population may indicate that the pathogen exerts selective pressure, but the inverse -absence of disease -can also be meaningful. Although P. falciparum is common in sub-Saharan Africa, P. vivax is noticeably absent. A mutation in the human DARC gene105 that disrupts expression of the Duffy antigen receptor to prevent infection106 has become 100% prevalent. In a possible example of convergent evolution, an independent DARC mutation is prevalent in Southeast Asia where P. vivax is common107.

As expected in the host-pathogen evolutionary 'arms race', the high prevalence of Duffynegative hosts could be driving P. vivax to adapt. Strains of P. vivax have emerged in Africa that can infect Duffy-negative individuals108 and that carry new variants of the gene encoding Duffy-binding protein109.

The long history and strong selective pressure exerted by malaria may paradoxically complicate detection of resistance loci by GWASs. When selection drives multiple resistance variants to arise in a locus (for example, HBB and MHC), patterns of selection and association are more complex. Further complicating GWASs of malaria susceptibility, most cases occur in African populations, in which LD is short and highly variable between populations. Thus, causal variants are poorly tagged by SNP genotyping arrays21, 110. Methods that successfully tackle these challenges are being developed, including GWASs by sequencing, improved imputation and Bayesian statistical approaches that allow heterogeneity in effect size and location110, 111, 112. An initial malaria GWAS in West Africa with 2,500 cases, 3,400 controls and 400,000 SNPs found no genome-wide significant associations21. Increasing the sample set to 3,500 cases, 4,300 controls and 800,000 SNPs (4 million after imputation) found HBB, ABO and two novel loci: one is intergenic and the other is in the ATP2B4 gene, which encodes an erythrocyte calcium channel111. An international collaborative GWAS of severe malaria is likely to identify more loci113.

Leprosy is a chronic disease caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium leprae and causes infertility, disfiguring skin lesions, social ostracism, permanent physical disability and shortened lifespan114, 115, 116, 117, 118 . M. leprae is an ancient and obligate human pathogen with a phylogeography that follows human migrations119. Although not immediately fatal, leprosy infection decreases fertility118 by up to 85%120, which poses a potent selective pressure. Consistent with selection that favours resistance variants, most people nowadays are genetically protected against M. leprae121. Indeed, host genetics has such a large role in susceptibility that, before the disease was proved to be caused by bacteria, leprosy was thought to be an inherited disease rather than an infectious one122, 123.

Leprosy was endemic in Europe with a prevalence of 10-40%124 until the sixteenth century; its subsequent rapid decline is still unexplained. Currently, it remains a major public health burden in India, China and South America125. The genetics of leprosy susceptibility differs between populations. GWASs in Han Chinese implicated the bacterial pattern recognition receptor NOD2 and three other components of NOD2-mediated innate immunity52, 126, but these associations did not replicate in an independent study of Indians and Malawians127. The Indian cohort instead had strong association to a functional knockout mutation in the TLR1 gene that protects against leprosy128. This variant is nearly absent in the Han Chinese population (2%) and rare in Indians (9%) but extremely common Karlsson Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts in Europeans (70%)129 owing to positive selection130. A locus associated with leprosy susceptibility in Chinese populations that is near the immune regulator gene cylindromatosis (CYLD)131, 132 may also be positively selected in Europeans (Fig. 5 ). Selection at leprosyassociated loci in European populations, together with the evidence from Indian and Chinese studies that risk loci differ between populations, suggests that combining European selection scans with a European GWAS might offer the most power. However, as leprosy is now rare in Europe, a GWAS would require a phenotypic proxy. Alternatively, as technology improves for analysing ancient DNA samples, thousands of medieval skeletal remains in Europe, many of which have lesions indicative of leprosy124, may be usable in archaeological GWASs.

Tuberculosis is an often lethal disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which infects one-third of the human population. Similar to the pathogens causing malaria and leprosy, M. tuberculosis is an ancient and obligate human pathogen that is estimated to have emerged in East Africa ~40,000 years ago133 and to have spread around the world with ancient human migrations134. Consistent with long host-pathogen co-evolution, only 10% of infected individuals develop active disease; in most infected individuals the host immune system contains the pathogen. Host genetic factors are strongly implicated in susceptibility135. Despite this, a GWAS of tuberculosis susceptibility found only 2 significant associations in a huge data set of 11 million SNPs and, after replication, nearly 23,000 individuals76, 136, compared with 490,000 SNPs and 9,200 individuals in the leprosy GWAS136.

What explains the different outcomes of the tuberculosis and leprosy GWASs? One possible factor is that M. tuberculosis is more genetically diverse than M. leprae134, and particular lineages of M. tuberculosis may have adapted to specific populations137. As individual tuberculosis status varies with how the host genetics interacts with the infecting M. tuberculosis strain, an accurate phenotype would include sequence data from the pathogen.

In addition, tuberculosis resistance can be defined either as preventing or containing infection. Finally, co-infection with other pathogens increases the risk of developing active tuberculosis (for example, HIV infection increases risk by 21-34-fold138).

Phenotypic ambiguity, strain differences and strain-host interactions reduce the power of GWASs to associate host genetic factors with tuberculosis susceptibility139, but the evidence of host-pathogen co-evolution suggests that incorporating tests of selection into GWASs may be particularly powerful. The strongest association so far is found in a GWAS carried out primarily in Africa, which implicates a region downstream of the Wilms tumour 1 (WT1) gene that has signatures of positive selection in East Asians33, 136.

During the 1980s, the highly variable and fast evolving retroviral pathogen HIV-1 emerged to cause a global infectious disease pandemic that has killed >30 million people140. HIV-1 infects immune cells and causes a progressive and incurable failure of the immune system that allows other opportunistic infections, such as tuberculosis, to take hold. Both HIV-1 and the distantly related virus HIV-2 are predicted to be recent (<100 years) cross-species transmissions of simian immunodeficiency viruses (SIVs) into humans141. SIVs are mostly non-pathogenic species-specific lentiviruses carried by at least 41 African primate species142. Some SIVs have infected the same host for >30,000 years and probably much longer143. In the last century, at least ten primate-to-human SIV transmissions have been documented142. This suggests that human populations, particularly those in Africa, may have experienced ancient lentivirus epidemics and driven variants that confer resistance to modern HIV strains to prevalence through natural selection. The role of host genetics in HIV infection has been extensively researched, and the NIH Catalog of published GWASs lists at least 15 HIV-related publications (4 of which report significant associations of P < 1 × 10 −8 ), but any connection to ancient selection remains unclear.

Among the first HIV resistance variants to be elucidated is a 32-base deletion in the cell surface receptor gene CCR5 (known as CCR5Δ32) that prevents the expression of the receptor on T cells and confers complete HIV immunity on homozygous carriers144, 145.

On the bases of the high prevalence of the variant in northern Europe and the apparently high LD with nearby variants, some researchers hypothesized that CCR5Δ32 was <1,000 years old and that positive selection for resistance to Yersinia pestis (the causative agent of the plague) increased its prevalence146, which led to various follow-on studies. However, re-evaluation of the locus using newer and denser genetic maps found no evidence to support positive selection acting on this locus, which highlights the necessity of dense genome-wide data sets when identifying loci with exceptional patterns of variation147. Subsequent work on CCR5 highlights the medical relevance of identifying naturally occurring resistance variants. Patients infused with autologous CD4 T cells that are engineered with a CCR5disrupting mutation designed to phenotypically mimic CCR5Δ32 showed partial resistance to HIV infection148.

The strongest signals of HIV resistance are in the MHC loci, which are under extreme positive and balancing selection. In a GWAS comparing individuals infected with HIV who do not develop clinical disease (that is, HIV controllers) to individuals with advanced disease, MHC variants provided an explanation for 19% of the phenotypic variance49. They included a protective regulatory variant that is correlated with increased expression of human leukocyte antigen C (HLA-C)149. Although higher HLA-C expression protects against HIV progression, it also increases risk of the inflammatory disorder Crohn's disease150, which highlights the potential for health repercussions of pathogen-driven selection.

Cholera -a notoriously deadly disease with historic mortality rates as high as 50%151, 152, 153 -is caused by the V. cholerae bacterium and endemic to the Ganges River Delta154 of Bangladesh, where cholera is still prevalent now155, 156, 157. Host genetic factors strongly influence susceptibility69, 70 to this dangerous pathogen, which suggests selection favouring cholera resistance variants. Consistent with this hypothesis, the region has the world's lowest prevalence of blood type O, which is associated with an increased risk of severe cholera69, 70.

A genome-wide scan for positive selection in a Bangladeshi population identified >300 selected regions. The most strongly selected genes were also associated with cholera susceptibility in a targeted analysis158. A gene set enrichment analysis159 found that two types of genes were statistically overrepresented in the selected regions compared with the rest of the genome: genes encoding potassium channels that are involved in cyclic AMPmediated chloride secretion, and genes encoding components of the innate immune system that are involved in nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) signalling. The success of the enrichment analysis suggests that cholera resistance in Bangladesh, similarly to pigmentation in Europe, provides an exceptionally strong evolutionary advantage and has driven selection at many different genomic loci.

The history of selection could make GWASs of cholera susceptibility in Bangladesh particularly powerful. As cholera is still common in Bangladesh, unlike leprosy in Europe, such a study is feasible. The results could help to elucidate the power for mapping positively selected resistance variants that protect against other pathogens with geographical disparity and high mortality.

The single-stranded RNA viruses of the genus Norovirus are the leading cause of extremely contagious viral gastroenteritis outbreaks worldwide160; they are particularly dangerous to young children and cause up to 200,000 deaths each year in developing countries161. The origin of Norovirus is obscured by the rapid evolution of these viruses162, 163, 164, but complex signals of selection in humans suggest that they could be very old. Individuals who are homozygous for null mutations of the fucosyltransferase 2 (FUT2) gene do not secrete ABO antigens and are protected against some strains165, 166, 167. Non-secretors are common worldwide (for example, in 20% of Caucasians). The underlying FUT2 mutational spectrum is unexpectedly complex, as it is comprised of multiple independent mutations that vary in frequency between populations and that have diverse evolutionary signatures, from long-term balancing selection to recent positive selection168.

Great pandemics inflict massive mortality and are of particular interest to evolutionary geneticists. The most striking modern example is the 1918 influenza pandemic, which was caused by an unusually lethal strain of influenza A that killed 50-100 million people, including many previously healthy young adults169, 170. Influenza is almost certainly very old: Hippocrates described a flu-like illness ~2,400 years ago171. Observational data suggest that host genetics influences susceptibility to severe illness172; for example, cases of the highly pathogenic H5N1 strain show strong familial aggregation173. Recently, interferon-induced transmembrane proteins (IFITMs) have been implicated in resistance to influenza A. IFITMs inhibit in vitro replication of some pathogenic viruses174, and IFITM3 expression protects against infection by multiple strains of influenza A in vitro and in vivo175. Hospitalized patients with severe influenza were significantly more likely to carry a splice acceptor site variant in IFITM3 that reduces its ability to restrict influenza virus replication in vitro175. Versions of IFITM3 that protect against influenza seem likely to confer a selective advantage, and selection scans show signals of recent positive selection in the IFITM3 region175.

Only a century ago, smallpox -caused by the Variola virus -ravaged human societies with mortality rates of up to 30%. It was an ancient and widespread scourge, and was described in historical records thousands of years old from China, India and Egypt. It is now gone and represents the only infectious disease in humans that has been eradicated by modern medicine. Variola virus has a highly conserved (>99.6% across 45 isolates) 186-kb double-stranded DNA genome176. Its extremely low mutation rate, simple genetic makeup and reliance on humans as its only host limited its ability to adapt and facilitated its eradication.

The age and phylogeography of smallpox is unresolved despite efforts to integrate historical records with sequence data from 45 viral isolates176, 177. We noted that, for 32 viral isolates with documented mortality, death rates are lower in Africa (0.4−12%) than elsewhere (4−38%), even though all isolates were from a single phylogenetic clade178. This is consistent with selection for resistance in Africa, where the smallpox virus is predicted to have evolved from a rodent-borne ancestor tens of thousands of years ago and where outbreaks of other poxviruses continue nowadays. Human evolutionary history may help to clarify the origins of smallpox.

With smallpox eradicated, vaccine response is used as a crude phenotypic proxy for studying host resistance. Two GWASs that included European, African American and Hispanic populations identified 37 SNPs associated with cytokine response to vaccination179, 180 (P < 1 × 10 −8 ). Most of the significant associations (65%) were found in African Americans, even though their sample size was half of that of the European cohorts, which is consistent with a larger effect due to selection in Africa. These results are preliminary: the studies had relatively small sample sizes (~200 African Americans), no overlap in their results and no replication. Incorporating tests for natural selection could add power for detecting true associations.

The hygiene hypothesis proposes that autoimmune disorders are partly caused by differences between the pathogen-rich environment in which our immune system evolved and the more sterile modern world. In the absence of diverse pathogens from which to defend ourselves, our immune responses may turn on us12. Loci associated with common inflammatory disorders are enriched for signals of positive selection1, 181, 182, 183, and GWASs have proved particularly powerful for this class of diseases184. Elucidating the effect of ancient selection for pathogen resistance should help to decipher the aetiology of autoimmune diseases89 but will require more data on immune responses to common pathogens. In cases in which selected variants have pleiotropic effects, pathogen-driven selection may even underlie diseases with no apparent immune component.

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a group of disorders, including Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, that are caused by autoimmune attacks on the gastrointestinal system. One hundred and sixty-three distinct loci have been significantly associated with IBD risk using meta-analyses of up to 75,000 European cases and controls, and these loci are strongly enriched for signatures of selection11, 117. Moreover, seven of the eight leprosy susceptibility loci52, 126 are also associated with increased IBD risk54, 125. Risk allele frequencies at some IBD loci correlate with local pathogen diversity, which is consistent with pathogen-driven selection185.

These observations broadly support the hygiene hypothesis and connect autoimmunity to ancient evolution for pathogen resistance. However, the relationship is not straightforward.

Of the four leprosy risk loci that precisely overlap IBD association peaks11, the IBD risk variant is associated with decreased leprosy risk at only two loci; the other two associate with increased risk. Further complicating the story, one of those two -the variant in NOD2 -is associated with both an increased risk of Crohn's disease and protection against ulcerative colitis186.

One potential source of the seemingly discrepant GWAS results is population differences. Whereas the 163 IBD loci were identified in cohorts of European ancestry, the leprosy GWASs were carried out in East Asian populations. The NOD2 pathway association with leprosy resistance in East Asians has not been replicated in other populations127. In addition, East Asians rarely carry the functional knockout mutation in TLR1 that is common in Europe. Experimental data suggest that TLR1 and NOD2 activate distinct pathways in response to leprosy infection187; thus, correlating East Asian pathogen resistance variants with autoimmune disease risk in Europeans may not be informative.

A second factor is simply the lack of data on many pathogens. The remarkable overlap between GWAS loci of leprosy and IBD may reflect a bias in the available data, as leprosy is only one of the few pathogen susceptibility GWASs completed. Not a single GWAS has been carried out, for example, on susceptibility to parasitic worms, which are potentially of great relevance to gastrointestinal disorders such as IBD.

Coeliac disease is a strongly heritable188 (~80%) inflammatory intestinal disorder triggered by gluten consumption. Despite severely affecting nutritional intake, coeliac disease occurs at 1-2% in Europe189 and up to 6% in North African Sahrawi190. Loci associated with coeliac disease have signatures of positive selection181. A functional analysis of one selected locus in the SH2B adaptor protein 3 (SH2B3) gene found that individuals who are homozygous for the coeliac risk allele (~22% of the European population) have stronger activation of the NOD2 pathway and a 3-5-fold higher pro-inflammatory cytokine response to lipopolysaccharide191. Better protection against bacterial infection may have conferred a selective advantage that outweighed the increased risk of coeliac disease risk. Inferring selection pressure is problematic, as gluten consumption and thus the selection against coeliac disease probably changed with agriculture. A crude estimate of the age of the SH2B3 Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts variant based simply on haplotype length suggested that it was very recent191 (<2,000 years old). However, simulations suggest that the long haplotype tests used to detect the selection at SH2B3 are sensitive to selection events ~5,000-50,000 years ago28, which implies that the SH2B3 selection could date to either before or after the spread of agriculture through Europe ~10,000 years ago192. Accurately dating selected variants is challenging and requires methods that can both estimate multiple parameters and test various ancestry models, such as Approximate Bayesian Computation193.

African Americans suffer from kidney disease -including focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) and hypertension-attributed end-stage kidney disease (H-ESKD) -at higher rates than European Americans. A region around the myosin heavy chain gene MYH9 was associated with FSGS and H-ESKD in African Americans, but no causal variants were found194, 195. One study86 expanded the search to include an adjacent signal of African positive selection at the APOL1 gene. Using data from the 1000 Genomes Project, they tested all polymorphisms with large frequency differences between Africans and Europeans in this expanded interval and identified two independent coding variants in APOL1 that are strongly associated with FSGS (odds ratio = 10.5) and H-ESKD (odds ratio = 7.3). In vitro assays showed that the kidney disease-associated variants lyse T. brucei rhodesiense, which is the trypanosome parasite that causes the most acute, virulent form of sleeping sickness (Fig. 3B) . The authors propose that ancient selection for resistance to sleeping sickness or a related pathogen in Africa contributes to the high rates of kidney disease in African Americans.

One of the oldest topics in genetics -natural selection for pathogen resistance -is being transformed by high-throughput biotechnology that offers unprecedented power to examine genome evolution. New research finds that both the most ancient signals of balancing selection (on cell surface glycoproteins) and some of the clearest signals of recent positive selection (on TLRs) implicate pathogens as the strongest selective pressure to drive the evolution of modern humans. Incorporating ancient history into disease susceptibility studies will identify functional variants and elucidate cellular mechanisms, and facilitate the development of new therapies for a surprisingly wide range of human illnesses. The range of diseases affected by ancient pathogen-driven selection extends beyond infectious diseases and immune-mediated disorders. Inflammatory and immunity genes are associated with psychiatric diseases, including schizophrenia196 and autism197, and the role of host genetics in maintaining a healthy microbiome is only starting to be examined14. At the dawn of genomic medicine, our ancient evolutionary history is one of our most powerful resources for understanding human biology towards improving human health. a | The variants in a population-wide sample are shown for a schematic genomic locus. The red region indicates a variant that provides selective advantage (such as a host variant that confers relative resistance to an infectious agent). Positive selection of that variant rapidly increases its prevalence in a population and also the prevalence of nearby alleles that are in linkage with it. b | Positive selection on a variant is detectable with three types of signals: high levels of differentiation (that is, when positive selection in one geographical region causes larger frequency differences between populations than those expected for neutrally Karlsson A | A genome-wide scan for signals of positive selection in the Yoruban population of Nigeria found a strongly selected nonsynonymous single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) that alters the pathogen recognition protein Toll-like receptor 5 (TLR5) (part Aa) and that is predicted to disrupt TLR5 activation in response to flagellated bacteria33 (part Ab). Cell lines that carry the new TLR5 variant (Leu616Phe) had significantly reduced nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) signalling in response to flagellin, which is potentially protective against some bacterial infections (part Ac). Error bars represent the standard error of the mean over at least three independent experiments; P values are indicated above the bar graphs. B | Two For pathogens that predate human dispersal from Africa, ancient and complex signals of selection are shared between human populations, and there are variable implications for genome-wide association studies (GWASs). For widespread pathogens that are more recent, the range of new resistance variants will be more limited, but selection is harder to detect when it is shared between populations. For recent pathogens that affect specific populations, GWASs in the selected populations will be particularly powerful, as causal variants will have been driven to high prevalence. Selection signals from one population may help to detect resistance loci in other unselected populations, but only if resistance variants arise in the same genetic loci. For GWASs of very new diseases, supplementing these studies with methods to detect selection will add no power, unless variants that confer resistance also protect against more ancient pathogens. Examples of pathogens matching each scenario are given on the right.

"Molecular Sciences Effects of AntagomiRs on Different Lung Diseases in Human, Cellular, and Animal Models","Introduction: MiRNAs have been shown to play a crucial role among lung cancer, pulmonary fibrosis, tuberculosis (TBC) infection, and bronchial hypersensitivity, thus including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma. The oncogenic effect of several miRNAs has been recently ruled out. In order to act on miRNAs turnover, antagomiRs have been developed. Materials and methods: The systematic review was conducted under the PRISMA guidelines (registration number is: CRD42019134173). The PubMed database was searched between 1 January 2000 and 30 April 2019 under the following search strategy: (((antagomiR) OR (mirna antagonists) OR (mirna antagonist)) AND ((lung[MeSH Terms]) OR (""lung diseases""[MeSH Terms]))). We included original articles, published in English, whereas exclusion criteria included reviews, meta-analyses, single case reports, and studies published in a language other than English. Results and Conclusions: A total of 68 articles matching the inclusion criteria were retrieved. Overall, the use of antagomiR was seen to be efficient in downregulating the specific miRNA they are conceived for. The usefulness of antagomiRs was demonstrated in humans, animal models, and cell lines. To our best knowledge, this is the first article to encompass evidence regarding miRNAs and their respective antagomiRs in the lung, in order to provide readers a comprehensive review upon major lung disorders.","MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small molecules made of 21 nucleotides, which modulate several biological processes through post-transcriptional gene expression regulation [1] . In addition, many miRNA knockout strains have differential responses to models of several disorders such as neuronal, cardiac, pulmonary, vascular, renal, immunological, while some of them have altered susceptibility to fungal or bacterial infections, or altered propensity to develop tumors in cancer models [2] . In fact, miRNAs may control tumor development, both acting as tumor-promoting miRNAs (oncomiRNAs and metastamiRNAs) or as tumor suppressor miRNAs [3, 4] . Furthermore, it was demonstrated that several human miRNAs are located in specific genomic sites which are involved in cancer [5] . During the last decade, researchers investigated miRNAs functioning and regulation. More recently, they focused on miRNA stability and turnover. Indeed, it was established that miRNAs are very dynamic molecules, presenting with a rapid turnover, which depends on their activation. On these bases, researchers investigated miRNA-induced silencing complex (miRISC) and Argonaute (AGO) proteins, which directly interact with miRNAs and are key factors in the assembly and function of Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2019, 20, 3938 2 of 32 miRISCs [1] . In order to act on miRNAs turnover, antagomiRs have been developed. They are a novel class of chemically engineered oligonucleotides, which are specific silencers of endogenous miRNAs. Specifically, two major molecular changings have been developed in order to increase chemical stability. Thus, including switching of the phosphodiester support with a phosphorothioate linkage between nucleotides or including a 2 O-methyl group. Additionally, antagomiRs with a cholesterol moiety are thought to promote cellular uptake [6] . Considering the complex role of miRNAs, these new molecules can be powerful tools to silence specific miRNAs in vivo and may represent a therapeutic strategy for silencing miRNAs in disease. Indeed, Krützfeldt et al. [7] conducted a study on mice in order to study the biological significance of miR-122, which is abundant in the liver. Analysis of gene expression of messenger RNA from antagomiR-treated animals disclosed that the 3 untranslated areas of upregulated genes were extremely enriched with miR-122 recognition motives, while down-regulated genes were poor of these motives. Moreover, researchers found that cholesterol biosynthesis genes would have been modulated by miR-122; in fact, plasma cholesterol levels were reduced in antagomiR-122-treated mice. So far, evidence on antagomiR function has been collected on cellular, animal, and human models. Moreover, as described below, data in these three groups are often coherent. This in support of the hypothesis that miRNAs are molecular factors capable of influencing the expression of several disorders. To date, new studies regarding the use of miRNAs as therapeutic targets are ongoing, especially in the treatment of HCV infection, atherosclerosis, and oncologic diseases. As Gambari et al. [3] highlighted in their review, until now, several antagomiRs have been studied among oncologic diseases as therapeutic agents, both alone or in combination with standard drugs. The promising results explain the reason why these agents will improve the therapy of several tumors, such as gastric cancer, gliomas, and breast cancer [8] [9] [10] . Indeed, the role of miRNAs upon lung disorders has been extensively studied. MiRNAs have proven to play a crucial role among lung cancer, pulmonary fibrosis, tuberculosis (TBC) infection, and bronchial hypersensitivity, thus including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma. The oncogenic effect of several miRNAs has been recently ruled out. Herein, a study of our group recently identified for the first time new mechanisms, supporting the crucial role of cigarette smoke-induced miR-21 expression in the amplification of inflammatory responses and in tumorigenesis processes within the airways [11] . COPD is a complex disease with a high rate of morbidity and mortality, especially in Western countries. Disease exacerbations and the associated hospitalizations often represent a considerable expense at a socio-economic level. Reduced lung function predicts mortality and is key to the diagnosis of COPD. Shrine et al. [12] conducted a genome-wide associated study in order to highlight new genetic mechanisms in order to improve future preventive and therapeutic strategies for COPD. More recently, many authors investigated miRNAs expression in COPD, noticing that wide networks composed of miRNA and messenger RNA (mRNAs) cooperate in COPD pathogenesis [13] . Moreover, Faiz et al. [14] investigated whether miRNA expression was modulated by inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) treatment and identified miR-320d as a novel mediator of ICS, regulating the pro-inflammatory response of the airway epithelium. Nowadays, among chronic inflammatory lung diseases, asthma is one of the most prevalent. Pathological mechanisms rely on activation of mast cells and eosinophils and dysregulation of Th 2 response. Asthmatic patients often have a strong genetic background, however recent studies demonstrated the role of epigenetic factors such as miRNAs [15] . Gold standard therapies for asthma control include inhaled β-agonists, both short and long acting, and steroids. On this background, Yu at al. [16] recently demonstrated that a specific miRNA, miR-16, may be used as a predictive biomarker of therapeutic response in asthma, thus, suggesting the role of miRNAs not only upon disease physiopathology but also upon drug response. MiRNAs have shown to have an effect also upon pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). PAH is a complex disease with different clinical manifestations and high genetic variability. ESC/ERS Guidelines outlined some of the most frequently involved genetic factors such as nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT), hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α), and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) [17] . New research showed that miRNAs may play a crucial role in vascular remodeling, thus inhibiting or promoting pulmonary As shown in Table 1-Table 5 , the vast majority of them included research carried out on cell lines and on animals, whereas only a few (20, corresponding to 29.4%) investigated the selected topic on humans. As expected, the condition most widely investigated was lung cancer (21/68), followed by pulmonary hypertension (7/68). All of the selected papers took into account the efficacy of the antagomiR treatment on the various diseases, whereas safety was rarely investigated (only in two cases out of 68). Overall, the use of antagomiR was seen to be efficient in downregulating the specific miRNA they are conceived for, with quite similar results either in vivo and in vitro and independently from the disease and the cell line they are used for. Overall, the usefulness of antagomiRs was demonstrated in humans, as well as in animals and cell lines without particular differences between those three aggregated groups. According to our results, the miRNA most frequently retrieved in lung conditions, therefore considered as ""organ-specific,"" although not ""disease-specific,"" appears to be miR-21, which has been found to be somewhat involved in lung conditions according to six of the selected papers [8, [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] . However, miR-155 was also largely investigated and found to be involved in five works retrieved [29] [30] [31] [32] 72] . Further miRNAs frequently involved in lung conditions include miR-7 and miR-34, included in four articles, and miR-92 and miR-374, with three hits each. As evidenced, despite a handful miRNAs with multiple hits across the works included in our research, the only critical issue eventually identified for our approach concerns the right choice for the miRNA to be downregulated to achieve the expected result of the whole As shown in Tables 1-5, the vast majority of them included research carried out on cell lines and on animals, whereas only a few (20, corresponding to 29.4%) investigated the selected topic on humans.

As evidenced, despite a handful miRNAs with multiple hits across the works included in our research, the only critical issue eventually identified for our approach concerns the right choice for the miRNA to be downregulated to achieve the expected result of the whole process. Indeed, even taking into account a single disease (e.g., lung cancer) on a similar population (e.g., on humans), a plethora of miRNAs with different functions can be identified as associated with the pathological process, therefore the selection of the right process to be blocked or, conversely, enhanced, is critical for good outcome of the process. Taking into account some specific disease categories, the first one to be analyzed, due to its numerical prevalence, was lung cancer. Inhibition of elevated miR-570-3p in COPD small airway epithelial cells, using an antagomir, restores sirtuin-1, and suppresses markers of cellular senescence, restoring cellular growth (p < 0.05) Inhibition of elevated miR-570-3p in COPD small airway epithelial cells, using an antagomir, restores sirtuin-1 and suppresses markers of cellular senescence, restoring cellular growth (p < 0.05) Antagomirs for miR-323a-3p augment murine lung fibrosis after bleomycin injury (p < 0.05) 

All the works retrieved showed an excellent efficacy of antagomiRs in blocking the action of the respective miRNAs both in vivo (on both humans and animals) and in vitro. The studies, taken singularly, have shown a wide heterogeneity of the mechanisms investigated and challenged with a respective wide difference in terms of miRNAs studied and antagomiRs employed. This applies both analyzing separately single sub-groups of samples and investigating the whole amount of studies together, making it difficult to identify a ""principal"" microRNA to be challenged in this specific domain.

Eleven studies have specifically assessed the role of antagomiRs in human subjects with lung cancer, all of which demonstrating the usefulness of such compounds in blocking cancer-related cellular mechanisms, and even restraining the growth of tumors even in vivo (see, for example, He et al., 2019 [33] or Liu et al., 2011 [34] ). The extreme heterogeneity of the miRNAs (and, consequently, antagomiRs) taken into account reveals the complexity of biological and cellular patterns of the lung cancer in vivo, suggesting the specific role of each compound for a given mechanism to be studied and tailored.

Ten works investigating lung cancer in animals were retrieved, all of which used mice models for this assessment. AntagomiRs were demonstrated to be extremely efficient in modulating cancer growth, preventing it in most cases (see, for example, anti-miR135b, in Lin et al., 2013 [73] ; anti-miR19a, in Liu et al., 2011 [34] ; anti-miR494, in Mao et al., 2015 [74] ), or even promoting tumor growth when experimentally needed (see anti-miR30c, in McCann et al., 2019 [75] ).

As expected, studies investigating lung cancer in cell lines are the vast majority with respect to the other sub-groups (20 studies were retrieved). Such studies confirmed in vitro the evidence arising in vivo, with antagomiRs able to modulate cancer growth depending on the outcome desired. Even on cell lines, the heterogeneity in terms of miRNAs investigated and antagomiRs employed was present, as already seen in humans and animals.

Under this category, studies dealing with asthma, COPD, allergic airway disease, airway hyper-responsiveness were included. Overall, eight studies were found, the majority of which investigating COPD (four studies) or asthma (three articles). Despite the heterogeneity in terms of miRNAs investigated, in this case promoted by both the relatively low number of studies retrieved and by the slightly different kind of diseases included in this category, miR-21 was included in several studies and its activity successfully challenged by its corresponding antagomiR. In summary, despite the differences in terms of category of samples studied and antagomiRs used, these compounds have demonstrated their usefulness also in this class of clinical conditions.

Only four works investigated such diseases in humans, all of which dealing with COPD. Overall, the studies highlighted a positive contribution of antagomiRs in decreasing the clinical symptoms of the disease. In some cases, these molecules have even shown to improve clinical outcomes with the support of other compounds, like protein kinase R (see Hsu et al. 2016 [76] ).

Six studies were published on animal models, of which three investigated asthma, and one each COPD, airway disease, and airway hyper-responsiveness. All those studies took into account mice models, with miR-21 that was investigated in three out of the six works. Overall, the results were encouraging, with minor differences. Indeed, as observed by Collison et al. [24] , just the inhibition of miR-145, but not miR-21 or let-7b, inhibited eosinophilic inflammation, mucus hypersecretion, TH2 cytokine production, and airway hyper-responsiveness, and also Plank et al. [30] on asthma observed that the use of the respective antagomiR (anti-miR-155-5p) reduced miR-155-5p expression, but failed to alter the disease phenotype.

Just three studies, all concerning COPD, were published on cell lines. All the three took into account different miRNAs and corresponding antagomiRs, but the results were seen to be overall positive, except the above reported work by Hsu et al. [76] , which highlighted the pivotal importance of combining antagomiRs with protein kinase R to increase antiviral stress granules formation, induction of p300 and IFN-β in COPD primary bronchial epithelial cells.

Six studies investigated pulmonary hypertension in the literature retrieved, mostly dealing with animal models. Overall, the various antagomiRs used (as previously, the heterogeneity in terms of miRNAs studied was high) demonstrated a good efficacy in challenging the corresponding miRNA and in improving the biological outcome.

Only one work, published by Potus and colleagues [77] investigated the use of antagomiRs in pulmonary hypertension in humans, through biopsy specimens, with the surprising result that AntagomiR-126 in healthy CD31+ cells mimicked the PAH phenotype.

Six works, including that by Potus and colleagues [77] above reported, have used animal models to this aim. All of them used either mice or rat models, with complete heterogeneity on the miRNAs studied. Overall, the treatment with antagomiRs improved the outcome with respect to pulmonary hypertension, except in the study by Gubrij et al. [78] , where AntagomiR-223 was efficient in reducing levels of miR-223 in pulmonary artery and lungs of rats as compared to controls, but failed to attenuate pulmonary hypertension.

Three articles also took into account cell lines on this specific topic. Despite using different compounds, tailoring different miRNAs, all the three works highlighted the positive role of antagomiRs in improving the outcome related to pulmonary hypertension, overall confirming the results obtained in vivo.

In this category, acute lung injury and pulmonary inflammation were included. Overall, eight articles were included, four each for the two conditions above mentioned. No studies on human subjects were retrieved, while works dealing with animal models and cell lines were relatively numerous. As in other sub-groups and possibly due to the slight heterogeneity of the clinical conditions included in this category, just one miRNA was studied in more than one article even if taken into account in two studies by the same research team (miR-374a, investigated in Adyshev et al., [80, 81] ). Summarizing the results, even in this group of conditions, antagomiRs were extremely useful in improving the outcome both in vivo and in vitro, with no report of lack of efficacy in any of the studies retrieved.

Six studies were retrieved on animal models. As in most of the cases previously reported, all of them were performed on mice models. Three of them investigated miRNAs in lung injury, two of them in lung inflammation and one [79] in both.

As stated, all the antagomiRs employed successfully reduced the pathological changes, starting from cellular level, in vivo, without evidence of inefficacy on the samples studied.

Six studies were found also on cell lines. Three of them took into account lung inflammation, two lung injury and the one by Xie and colleagues [77] reported above both the conditions.

The results obtained confirmed the good reliability and efficacy of antagomiRs in improving the biomarkers of diseases in vitro, independently from the miRNA (and, therefore, the mechanism) tailored, with just one antagomiR, antagomiR-374a, that was used in more than one study [80, 81] , on lung injury and lung inflammation, respectively.

In this category, several conditions, not matched by the groups above explained, were included, each of them featuring a small number of studies, and displaying positive results, overall.

Four studies were performed on humans, one each about lung cell dysfunction, lung fibrosis, HIV infection and substance abuse, and tuberculosis. Given the different etiopathological processes of such conditions, also completely different mechanisms were investigated, and different miRNAs tailored. However, in all four cases, an improvement of the outcome was found in vivo, independently from the condition studied.

Sixteen studies on animals were found for this macro-category, with the condition more largely studied being influenza (four studies). All but two of these studies were carried out on mice or rats, whereas Asquith et al. [85] , studied chronic ethanol consumption in non-human primates, and Zhou et al. [88] assessed the effect of miRNAs and antagomiRs in influenza in one-month-old beagles.

Three studies [31, 72, 85] on chronic ethanol consumption, pneumonia, and systemic lupus erythematosus, investigated the role of miR-155, two [88, 89] respectively on tuberculosis and influenza, of miR-143 and the others showed complete heterogeneity in the miRNAs studied.

Overall, antagomiRs demonstrated their efficacy in tailoring such conditions in vivo also on animal models, as already seen on humans, despite a lack of complete efficacy noticed by Chiba et al. [83] for miR-133b and let-7a antagomiRs in abnormal bronchial smooth muscle contraction studied in BALB/c mice.

Nineteen studies were included in this category, most of which were already mentioned in the two previous (humans and animals) groups, as performed both in vivo and in vitro. Three of them were performed on influenza [86, 88, 90] and three others on lung fibrosis [26, 82, 84] . Other conditions were more rarely studied.

Concerning the miRNAs studied, as above, a slight prevalence (three studies: Bhattacharyya et al. [29] on cystic fibrosis, Podsiad et al. [31] on pneumonia, Zhou et al. [86] on systemic lupus erythematosus) included miR-155, with the positive results about the use of the respective antagomiR seen in vivo that were confirmed in vitro. miR-143 was successfully tailored in two studies (Tamgue et al. [89] on tuberculosis, Zhou et al., [88] on influenza) confirming the positive retrievals already seen in vivo.

Overall, the other antagomiRs were also seen to be efficient in positively tailoring the activity of the respective miRNAs, thus improving the biological outcome of the various conditions they were applied to, also in vitro, despite minor evidence of lack of (or reduced) efficacy seen in Chiba et al. [83] on abnormal bronchial smooth muscle contraction and in Morales et al. [87] on SARS-CoV.

It is well established that miRNAs are pleiotropic molecules involved in almost all major biological processes. This concept was particularly studied in the lung, where specific miRNAs demonstrated to cooperate with organ development and pulmonary diseases. During the last years, much data has been collected on this topic, with special regards to obstructive and restrictive lung diseases [91] [92] [93] . In fact, as Sessa and Hata [94] reported, a typical miRNAs expression profile was noticed and different miRNAs play an active role among different processes including hemostasis, viral infection, and inflammation. Lung-specific miRNAs can be used as novel biomarkers in lung disorders. To date, several pieces of research focused on specific lung disease miRNAs expression patterns. However, specific miRNAs expression profiles may be noticed also among different organs. Previously, Wang et al. [20] conducted a study on rats, demonstrating that two specific miRNAs (miR-195 and miR-200c) were peculiarly expressed in the lung, while eight miRNAs were co-expressed in the lung and heart and one miRNA was co-expressed in the lung and kidney. As interest increased on this topic, accessible databases as, for example, MiRmine were created in order to allow researchers to retrieve expression profiles of single or multiple miRNAs for a specific tissue or cell line, either normal or with disease information [95] . According to our results, miR-21 seems to be the most represented miRNA among lung conditions. MiR-21 is often up-regulated in lung carcinoma. This fact is believed to be a result of the capacity of miR-21 to inhibit tumor suppressor phosphatase and tensin-homolog [96] . Collison et al. [24] characterized miRNAs expression among house dust mite allergic mice. A group was treated with antagomiRs that inhibited the function of specific miRNAs in the lung, and the other group received standard steroid therapy with dexamethasone. Finally, inflammatory lesions and airway hyper-responsiveness were measured. Researchers found that, although miR-21 and let-7b were highly expressed during allergic inflammation, blockade of their function was ineffective at modulating the expression of disease. On the other hand, Kim et al. [27] conducted a study on BALB/c mice noticing that antagomiR-21 increased phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) levels (p < 0.05). Treatment with Ant-21 reduced phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) activity and restored histone deacetylase (HDAC2) levels (p < 0.05), leading to suppression of airway hyper-responsiveness and to restore of steroid sensitivity to allergic airway disease. Lee et al. [60] also investigated allergic inflammation among mouse models, reporting that MiR-21 expression was down-regulated in mice lungs treated with anti-miR-21. In fact, specific antagomiR reduced both eosinophil count (p < 0.01) and Th2 cytokines levels, including IL-5 and IL-13 in mice BAL fluid (p < 0.05). MiRNA21 demonstrated positive effects also upon lung ischemia. Ischemia/reperfusion injury (IRI) is the primary cause of acute lung injury (ALI) and primary graft dysfunction (PGD) after lung transplantation [97] . Li et al. [28] conducted a study on murine lung ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) and in vitro hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) models demonstrating that pre-treatment of mesenchymal stromal cells with miR-21-5p antagomiR ameliorated IRI in the lung. Regarding PAH, Pullamsetti et al. [25] conducted a study both on animal models and cell lines demonstrating that Ant-17 and Ant-21 reduced right ventricular systolic pressure and pulmonary arterial muscularization. Moreover, Ant-17 decreased hypoxia-induced right ventricular hypertrophy and improved pulmonary artery acceleration time. In mice, Ant-17 therapy reduced right ventricular systolic pressure and total pulmonary vascular resistance index, stabilized cardiac output and reduced pulmonary vascular remodeling. In human pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells, Ant-17 increased the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1A (p21). MiRNA 21 demonstrated to have a role also upon lung fibrosis. In fact, Shentu et al. [26] demonstrated that human mesenchymal stem cell-derived extracellular vesicles (mEVs) do contain several specific miRNAs including 21-5p and 630. MEVs suppress TGFβ1-induced myofibroblastic differentiation of normal and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) lung fibroblasts, thus mitigating tissue fibrotic response. Investigating the role of miRNA regarding the pathogenesis and progression of lung fibrosis, Liu et al. [98] found that miR-21 was up-regulated both in the lungs of mice presenting with bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis and IPF patients. In this setting, miR-21 was highly expressed by myofibroblasts in the fibrotic lungs. Furthermore, researchers noticed that miR-21 reduced bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis in rats' lungs.

Overall, a simple explanation of the mechanisms involving antagomiR-21 in lung conditions is provided in Figure 2 . and progression of lung fibrosis, Liu et al. [98] found that miR-21 was up-regulated both in the lungs of mice presenting with bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis and IPF patients. In this setting, miR-21 was highly expressed by myofibroblasts in the fibrotic lungs. Furthermore, researchers noticed that miR-21 reduced bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis in rats' lungs.

Overall, a simple explanation of the mechanisms involving antagomiR-21 in lung conditions is provided in Figure 2 . Another miRNA molecule, which is widely expressed in several lung conditions, is miR-155. Several studies demonstrated that this molecule is upregulated in activated immune cells, such as T and B lymphocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells (DCs). Indeed, miR-155 levels increase in response to inflammatory mediators. Moreover, miRNA-155 can regulate B-cell proliferation, malignancy, antibody production, and the differentiation and function of IL-17-producing helper T cells. Furthermore, miR-155 is induced by LPS, as well as other TLR ligands and proinflammatory Another miRNA molecule, which is widely expressed in several lung conditions, is miR-155.

Indeed, miR-155 levels increase in response to inflammatory mediators. Moreover, miRNA-155 can regulate B-cell proliferation, malignancy, antibody production, and the differentiation and function of IL-17-producing helper T cells. Furthermore, miR-155 is induced by LPS, as well as other TLR ligands and proinflammatory cytokines [99] [100] [101] . As miR-155 is involved in several processes, it is feasible to understand its role upon many lung disorders. Basing on the hypothesis that miR-155 upregulation could inhibit IL-17 expression and therefore increase susceptibility to secondary bacterial pneumonia, Podsiad et [31] al. conducted a study on wild-type C57BL/6 mice and human lung macrophages in order to investigate the role of miR-155 and the respective antagoMiR upon viral and bacterial pneumonia. They concluded that miR-155 antagomiR ameliorated lung bacterial clearance compared with controls. MiR-155 plays a crucial role also upon ARDS. Triggering receptors expressed on myeloid cells (TREM) proteins are a family of immunoglobulin cell surface receptors expressed on myeloid cells and they are considered as amplifiers of Toll-like receptor (TLR)-induced inflammation. Experiments with antagomiR-155 confirmed that TREM-1-mediated changes were dependent on miR-155. Yuan et al. [32] conducted a study on wild-type C57BL/6J mice and bone marrow-derived macrophages demonstrating that TREM-1 boosted inflammatory response by inducing the expression of miR-155 in macrophages. Therefore, researchers inhibited TREM-1 using a nanomicellar strategy. Neutrophilic inflammation was reduced, thus suggesting that TREM-1 inhibition is a potential therapeutic target for neutrophilic lung inflammation and ARDS. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a complex auto-immune disease which can involve several systems, including lungs. Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH) is a rare but severe complication of SLE and miR-155 showed to have a relevant role. In fact, Zhou et al. [86] found that miR-155 expression was up-regulated during the development of DAH, noticing that this molecule targets several pro-inflammatory mediators. The extent of lung inflammation was markedly reduced in miR-155-knockout (miR-1552/2) mice. Moreover, in vivo silencing of miR-155 using miR-155 antagomiR reduced the incidence of iatrogenic-induced DAH. MiR-155 cooperates with Th2 responses too. In fact, it is extensively expressed in the Th cell, DCs, and macrophages in the lung. MiR-155 was also found to be up-regulated in the nasal mucosa and airway smooth muscle cells of allergic asthmatic patients [27, 100, 101] . Recently, Plank et al. [30] conducted a study on murine asthmatic models noticing that MiR-155-5p is highly upregulated in mice. However, while targeting of miR-155-5p with a specific antagomiR resulted in specific inhibition in vivo, it was not able to alter the disease phenotype. Authors hypothesized that this could be due to the variation in antagomiR uptake, which demonstrated to be effective in myeloid cells and weak in lymphocytes. Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive disease, due to the occurrence of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene mutations and it is characterized by a variable cytokines pro-inflammatory milieu. Bhattacharyya et al. [29] demonstrated that antagomiR-155 down-regulates miR-155 expression suppressing IL-8 and other proinflammatory genes in CF cells.

The mechanisms involving antagomiR-155 in lung conditions are displayed in Figure 3 .

The mechanisms involving antagomiR-155 in lung conditions are displayed in Figure 3 . 

This systematic review provides numerous shreds of evidence regarding dysregulation in miRNAs expression in lung diseases. It remains to understand the sources of the various miRNAs, and whether they have mainly disease-or organ-specific effects. However, these findings may contribute to a better definition of the complex network of miRNAs involved in lung diseases. Thus, miRNAs have been proposed as diagnostic or prognostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets for future treatments. Notably, antagomiRs are chemically modified oligonucleotides that are used to silence microRNAs, having the property of bind specifically to particular microRNAs. These could represent a therapeutic opportunity to modulate miRNA-induced, post-transcriptional mRNA regulation. To our best knowledge, this is the first article describing evidence on the involvement of miRNAs and the efficacy of respective antagomiRs in different lung diseases, including studies conducted on humans, animals, and cells. In conclusion, these findings provide new knowledge on the network of miRNAs in lung diseases and suggest that antagomiRs may represent a target for a specific therapy for these diseases.

• Strong evidence confirmed that miRNAs play a crucial role in several pathologic mechanisms, therefore they have been proposed as diagnostic or prognostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets for future treatments. • AntagomiRs are chemically modified oligonucleotides able of silencing microRNAs and are now emerging as novel therapeutic agents in several conditions.

• It has been widely demonstrated that miRNAs have a fundamental role among several lung conditions, moreover, some of these molecules proved to have a lung-specific tropism, thus suggesting the idea of lung-specific miRNAs patterns.

To our best knowledge, this is the first article describing the evidence on the involvement of miRNAs and the efficacy of respective antagomiRs in different lung diseases, including studies conducted on humans, animals, and cells.

Coherence between these groups has been demonstrated, thus suggesting the importance of developing new studies on these agents as target therapies.

Genetic susceptibility to infectious diseases: Current status and future perspectives from genome-wide approaches,"Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have been widely applied to identify genetic factors that affect complex diseases or traits. Presently, the GWAS Catalog includes > 2800 human studies. Of these, only a minority have investigated the susceptibility to infectious diseases or the response to therapies for the treatment or prevention of infections. Despite their limited application in the field, GWASs have provided valuable insights by pinpointing associations to both innate and adaptive immune response loci, as well as novel unexpected risk factors for infection susceptibility. Herein, we discuss some issues and caveats of GWASs for infectious diseases, we review the most recent findings ensuing from these studies, and we provide a brief summary of selected GWASs for infections in non-human mammals. We conclude that, although the general trend in the field of complex traits is to shift from GWAS to next-generation sequencing, important knowledge on infectious diseaserelated traits can be still gained by GWASs, especially for those conditions that have never been investigated using this approach. We suggest that future studies will benefit from the leveraging of information from the host's and pathogen's genomes, as well as from the exploration of models that incorporate heterogeneity across populations and phenotypes. Interactions within HLA genes or among HLA variants and polymorphisms located outside the major histocompatibility complex may also play an important role in shaping the susceptibility and response to invading pathogens.","disease), and hematological measurements related to infectious agents (e.g., antibody levels for common infections, cytokine production during septic shock). We also defined categories for response to therapy, by classifying GWAS that analyzed the response to treatments for infectious diseases, non-communicable conditions, and vaccines. Overall, 4%, 0.66%, and 0.31% of all studies in the catalog were classified in the categories ""infectious disease"", ""response to treatment for infectious disease"", and ""response to vaccine"", respectively (Fig. 1) . In terms of unique variant-trait associations, percentages were as follows: 2.5% for ""infectious disease"", 0.18% for ""response to treatment for infectious disease"", and 0.66% for ""response to vaccine"" (Fig. 1) . Based on the relative number of studies and associations, it is clear that some traits/diseases have attracted huge efforts that provided consequent reward (e.g., inflammatory/autoimmune disorders, metabolic traits and phenotypes), whereas others have been deeply investigated with comparatively modest success (e.g., neurologic/neuropsychiatric/cognitive diseases and traits, cancers). The reasons for these differences are manifold and outside the scope of this Review, which focuses on infections and related traits. Based on the percentages given above and on the comparison with other traits, we conclude that, despite the huge burden that infections pose for human health, relatively few GWASs for infectious diseases have been performed and these have attained a moderate success. Apparently, the best performance was obtained by GWASs for response to vaccination, with 9 studies that reported 64 associations. However, most of these associations will require validation, as they derive from a relatively small-scale study with no replication .

Sheer numbers, though, are not the only indicator of success. Important results were obtained by GWASs, both by identifying or refining associations in genes that were a priori expected to modulate infection susceptibility and by pointing out unexpected genes and pathways. Herein we discuss some issues associated with GWASs for infectious diseases, we review the most recent findings ensuing from these studies, and we provide a brief summary of selected GWASs in non-human mammals. Table 1 summarizes the results of human studies that detected at least one associated variant at genome-wide significance, whereas a list of all studies is available as Supplementary Table S1.

GWASs rely on linkage disequilibrium between genotyped SNPs and causal variants (often ungenotyped). The number of variants on the SNP chips that are used for GWASs has increased sensibly since the development of this technology (from~500,000 in the initial studies to > 4,000,000 in the latest platforms). Moreover, the availability of an increasing number of fully sequenced genomes, together with the development of efficient imputation methods, has definitely expanded the power of GWASs to detect association with variants in the low range of the frequency spectrum (reviewed in (Visscher et al., 2017) ). However, the overall power of a GWAS is also critically dependent on the sample size (reviewed in (Visscher et al., 2017) and see below) and in most cases power remains low for variants with a frequency below 1% (reviewed in (Visscher et al., 2017) ).

Notably, though, important developments have been achieved in terms of imputation of variants within the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC), with clear relevance for the investigation of infectious (and immuno-mediated) diseases. As recently reviewed elsewhere (Matzaraki et al., 2017) , the development of large reference panels (at least for Europeans and Asian populations) and the use of advanced imputation methods allowed the fine mapping of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) variants as susceptibility factors for some infectious diseases (e.g., HIV-1, HCV, and HBV infection) and many more autoimmune conditions (Matzaraki et al., 2017) .

Recently, an imputation algorithm for typing KIR (Killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptor) gene copy number has also been developed and applied to data from European populations (Vukcevic et al., 2015) . However, KIR variability extends beyond copy number variation and next-generation sequencing technologies were proposed to allow highresolution genotyping of KIR loci (Maniangou et al., 2017; Norman et al., 2016) .

Finally, we mention that in 2009 a SNP chip (Immunochip) providing high coverage of immune-related genes, including HLA and KIR loci, came into use to fine-map and validate association signals for immune-mediated diseases (Cortes and Brown, 2011) . The application of the Immunochip in the field of infectious diseases has been very limited, with the notable exception of a study that investigated the genetic susceptibility to candidaemia and identified three risk variants (Kumar et al., 2014) .

Some considerations apply to GWASs, whether they investigate A. Mozzi et al. Infection, Genetics and Evolution 66 (2018) 

Tuberculosis susceptibility (continued on next page)

A. Mozzi et al. Infection, Genetics and Evolution 66 (2018) 286-307 Susceptibility to peripheral neuropathy related to d4T/ddIcontaining treatment (Leger et al., 2014) (continued on next page) A. Mozzi et al. Infection, Genetics and Evolution 66 (2018) 286-307 infectious diseases or other conditions/traits. Although the sample size that is necessary to achieve an adequate statistical power depends on the genetic architecture of the analyzed trait, GWASs typically require large samples of individuals. This is because thousands (millions) of variants are simultaneously analyzed, making it difficult to disentangle true associations from false positives. Ideally, GWASs should enroll subject of shared and homogeneous ethnical ancestry, to avoid issues of population stratification, which can in turn produce spurious associations if not properly corrected. Moreover, phenotype heterogeneity (Bennett et al., 2011) , environmental confounders (Pearson and Manolio, 2008) , as well as misclassification of cases and controls (Pearson and Manolio, 2008) have been shown to affect GWAS reliability and power. Some of these issues may be particularly relevant in the field of infectious diseases.

Large populations samples are often difficult to recruit in developing countries, due to limited resources, inadequate health facilities, and inefficient screening or diagnostic procedures. In these countries, however, the burden imposed by infectious diseases is highest (Jones et al., 2008; Mabey et al., 2004) . Also, some populations in developing areas have complex demographic histories. This is the case of African populations, that are genetically highly diverse and display a limited extension of linkage disequilibrium (LD) compared to non-Africans (International HapMap Consortium et al., 2007) . For instance, one of the first GWASs for infectious diseases genotyped individuals in West Africa to identify susceptibility variants for severe malaria (Jallow et al., 2009 ). The authors found considerable population stratification, which was corrected for using principal components analysis (PCA); signals of association at known malaria resistance loci (e.g. HBB) were difficult to retrieve due to weak LD between causal variants (e.g., HbS locus) and tag SNPs (Jallow et al., 2009) . Populations from South and Central America also display relevant population structure due to recent admixture (Bryc et al., 2010) . In a GWAS for visceral Leishmaniasis that included families from Brazil, ancestry differences and close relationships were efficiently corrected for using a linear mixed model (LeishGEN Consortium et al., 2013) . These models are an alternative to those based on PCA and rely on the incorporation of genetic relatedness between individuals directly in the statistical model (see (Eu-Ahsunthornwattana et al., 2014; Hayes, 2013; Yang et al., 2014 ) for reviews and comparison among different linear mixed model methods).

Another issue often related to population structure is that of environmental confounders (Vilhjalmsson and Nordborg, 2013) . A wellknown example in the field of non-communicable diseases relates to type 2 diabetes (T2D) susceptibility. Several studies for T2D indicated that the proportion of Native American genetic ancestry is associated with lower socioeconomic status in admixed Latino populations from North and South America (Chakraborty et al., 1986; Florez et al., 2009; Martinez-Marignac et al., 2007; Parra et al., 2004) . This effect is partially responsible for the generally higher incidence of T2D in Latinos. This exemplifies how the combined effect of genetic admixture and environmental factors has the potential to affect genetic associations. Indeed, poor socioeconomic conditions represent a risk factor for several infectious diseases (Baker et al., 2012; Braveman, 2011; Franco-Paredes et al., 2007; May, 2007; Semenza, 2010) . Thus, possible environmental confounders must be accounted for to avoid spurious associations or loss of statistical power. However, even in the presence of admixture and environmental confounders, associations can be retrieved with confidence. In a GWAS for tuberculosis (TB), Chimusa and coworkers analyzed admixed South African Coloured case-control cohorts (Chimusa et al., 2014) . After accounting for population stratification and hidden relatedness, they replicated a previously reported association at the WT1 gene and performed transethnic fine mapping of the association signals (Table 1 ). The authors also found a positive correlation between San (an African ethnic group) A. Mozzi et al. Infection, Genetics and Evolution 66 (2018) 286-307 ancestry proportion and TB status. Although complete information was available for a minority of individuals, no correlation was detected between socioeconomic status and ancestry components, leading the authors to suggest that the association between San ancestry and TB is not merely explained by differences in socioeconomic conditions (Chimusa et al., 2014) .

Perhaps, the two most important points that characterize GWAS for infectious diseases compared to studies of non-communicable conditions are phenotypic heterogeneity and case-control misclassification. An important source of heterogeneity in GWASs for infectious diseases derives from genetic variation in the pathogen. One of the best known examples of how the genotype of the infectious agent can interact with the host genome refers to hepatitis C virus. Among the most significant findings of GWASs for infectious diseases was the identification in 2009-2010 of variants at the IFNL3/IFNL4 loci (previously known as IL28B) that associate with spontaneous clearance of HCV infection and with response to interferon-α/ribavirin therapy Rauch et al., 2010; Suppiah et al., 2009; Tanaka et al., 2009) (Table 1) . This finding set the basis for a personalized treatment of HCV infection (Matsuura et al., 2014) . However, the effect of the IFNL3/IFNL4 variants on response to therapy is much stronger for patients infected with HCV genotypes 1 and 4 than for those infected with genotypes 2, 3, and 6 (Rauch et al., 2010; Akkarathamrongsin et al., 2014) . Interestingly, interferon-α/ribavirin therapy is less effective for patients infected with genotypes 1 and 4 compared to the other genotypes (European Association for the Study of the Liver, 2011). Thus, the prognostic value of the IFNL3/IFNL4 variants is particularly relevant for patients infected with HCV genotypes that are poorly responsive to this treatment (Rauch et al., 2010) . These observations well exemplify how important the interaction of the host and pathogen genomes can be. Very recently, a genome-to-genome GWAS for HCV infection was performed, shedding more light into the interaction between human IFNL4/IFNL3 variants and HCV genetic diversity (Ansari et al., 2017 ) (see Conclusions and perspectives section).

Another notable example of how pathogen heterogeneity can interact with the host genotype refers to TB susceptibility. The human Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC) consists of several major phylogenetic lineages whose names reflect their association with geographic areas (Brites and Gagneux, 2015) . Candidate gene approaches have shown that host genetic variants can modulate susceptibility to TB caused by specific MTBC strains (Herb et al., 2008; Caws et al., 2008; Intemann et al., 2009; van Crevel et al., 2009; Salie et al., 2014) . For instance, a variant in TLR2 was specifically associated with an increased risk of TB caused by the Beijing strain in a Vietnamese population, whereas two SLC11A1 polymorphisms were found to be significantly more common in patients having tuberculosis caused by M. tuberculosis Beijing genotype strains than in patients carrying other genotypes (Caws et al., 2008; van Crevel et al., 2009 ). In populations from Ghana, an IRGM polymorphism was found to protect against disease caused by the Euro-American lineage (Intemann et al., 2009) , and polymorphisms in ALOX5 were more strongly associated with TB caused by M. africanum West African 2 strain (Herb et al., 2008) . Furthermore, associations of specific HLA class I alleles and disease caused by the Beijing, LAM, LCC and Quebec strains, as well as by the Euro-American or East Asian lineages, were found in a South African population (Salie et al., 2014) .

Therefore, the genetic heterogeneity of MTBC may limit the reproducibility of GWASs, as different cohorts may indeed include patients with distinct TB epidemiologies and with TB caused by different M. tuberculosis strains.

Finally, misclassification of cases or controls is an issue for several association studies. In the case of infections, a major problem is the difficulty to assess exposure in the control population. For instance, it is sometimes impossible to determine whether individuals recruited as uninfected controls (e.g., based on serology) are seronegative because they were exposed but did not acquire the infection or because they were never or rarely exposed to the pathogen. Cases are also sometimes problematic to define. For instance, seropositivity can result from different routes of exposure, in turn associated with distinct probabilities of infection, and possibly modulated by diverse genetic factors. Moreover, the probability of infection may depend on several factors, including the genetic characteristics of the pathogen, the infectiousness of the transmitting individual, the general health status at the moment of exposure (this is clearly important for nosocomial infections, for instance).

Some of these issues are evident in a GWAS for susceptibility to HIV-1 infection. McLaren and coworkers combined information from multiple studies to obtain case-control cohorts of > 6300 HIV-1 positive cases and 7200 general population HIV-1 negative controls . Cases derived from different studies and were infected via diverse routes (i.e., parenteral and sexual). No information was available for controls on HIV-1 exposure (e.g., at risk behavior or possible parenteral exposure). The study failed to detect association with HIV infection susceptibility other than the known CCR5Δ32 variant. An association signal at the HLA-B/HLA-C genes was not confirmed after correcting for frailty (survival) bias . These results led to the conclusion that genetic variants that modulate HIV-1 acquisition are either rare or have small effects. However, as the authors note, the study design has a high potential for misclassification of both cases and controls . Indeed, cases may include subjects with low HIV-1 susceptibility who were infected due to very high exposure (e.g. via multiple blood transfusions), whereas controls may comprise subjects who never exposed themselves to the virus. Because studies on high-risk populations indicated that the proportion of subjects who are naturally resistant to HIV-1 is around 20% (Plummer et al., 1999; Fowke et al., 1996) , it can be hypothesized that as many as 80% of controls would seroconvert if exposed. McLaren and coworkers estimated that the sample size of their GWAS provided 80% power for variants with 0.1 allele frequency and genotype relative risk (GRR) of 1.3. Their calculations also show that if~30%,~60%, or 80% of cases were misclassified as controls, GRRs of 2, 3, or 4 would be respectively necessary to achieve the same power . In fact, the authors did detect association for the CCR5Δ32 variant, indicating that polymorphisms with strong effect could be identified.

Another situation that may potentially lead to classification biases is reinfection. For instance, HCV reinfection is relatively common in highrisk groups (e.g., drug users) (Grebely et al., 2009; Grebely et al., 2012; Midgard et al., 2016) . If individuals are classified as persistently infected (chronic hepatitis C, CHC) based on viral loads measurements with relatively long intervals between tests, cases of clearance and reinfection can potentially be classified as persistent infections (Grebely et al., 2009; Grebely et al., 2012) .

In 2007, Fellay and coworkers performed the first GWAS for an infectious disease by investigating viral set-point in HIV-1 infection (Fellay et al., 2007) . This pilot study paved the way for several other GWASs. Indeed, the two signals detected within the HLA class I gene region were since confirmed by several studies Limou et al., 2009 Fig. 2 ). Additional GWASs focused on HIV-1 viral load, progression to AIDS, and susceptibility to infection (Table 1) . Their results have been extensively reviewed elsewhere (van Manen et al., 2012) .

In recent years, GWASs for HIV-1 infection have also focused on understanding the host determinants of response to standard and experimental therapies, as well as on detecting variants responsible for susceptibility to treatment-related adverse effects (Table 1 and Supplementary Table S1 ) (Chantarangsu et al., 2011; Leger et al., 2014; Wanga et al., 2015) (Table 1 and Supplementary Table S1 ).

Susceptibility to Hepatitis B and Hepatitits C viruses (HBV and HCV) was also extensively investigated in GWASs. Worldwide, chronic HBV or HCV infections represent the major causes of progressive liver disease, including liver cirrhosis (LC) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (Shirvani-Dastgerdi et al., 2016) . HBV predominantly affects Southeast Asia and the East Pacific, where it reaches the highest prevalence in the world (Custer et al., 2004) . It is thus not surprising that most GWASs performed to date genotyped individuals of Asian ancestry (Table 1) .

Genetic variations in HLA class II loci (HLA-DP and HLA-DQ) were significantly associated with susceptibility to chronic HBV infection and with HBV-related HCC (Mbarek et al., 2011; Kamatani et al., 2009; Nishida et al., 2012; Jiang et al., 2013; Jiang et al., 2015; Li et al., 2012; Kim et al., 2013; Hu et al., 2013; Chang et al., 2014; Tan et al., 2017) ( Table 1 , Fig. 2) . Interestingly, host genetic variants in HLA class II genes were also found in association with hepatitis B vaccine response (Png et al., 2011; Pan et al., 2014) (Table 1) .

In 2015, Jiang et al. (2015) performed the largest GWAS on a Chinese population including about 18,400 among cases (chronicallyinfected) and controls (seronegative). The study confirmed most of the previously reported associations in HLA class II genes and detected a new variant, rs1883832 in CD40, strongly associated with HBV chronic infection (Table 1, Fig. 2 ). rs1883832 influences CD40 expression by affecting its translational efficiency (Jacobson et al., 2005) . This association was confirmed, although not at genome-wide significant level, by a recent GWAS that analyzed chronically HBV-infected and spontaneously recovered subjects . In this study, the authors also identified an intergenic variant at 8p21.3 which represents an expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) for the INTS10 (integrator complex subunit 10) gene (Table 1) . Interestingly, the authors demonstrated that INTS10 suppresses HBV replication in liver cells via IRF3, and confirmed decreased INTS10 protein levels in plasma samples of chronically HBV-infected patients compared to subjects who spontaneously cleared infection .

Although these studies have opened up new horizons of research, analyses in populations of different ancestries are strictly required.

As mentioned above, a landmark discovery of GWASs for HCV infection was the identification of the IFNL3/IFNL4 association. In addition to this locus, variants in HLA class II loci were also found to affect viral clearance and disease progression in chronic HCV infection (Table 1, Fig. 2 ). In addition, polymorphisms in apoptosis-related genes such as RNF7, TULP1, and MERTK were associated with liver fibrosis, whereas variants in DEPDC5 and MICA were described as modulators of HCV-related hepatocellular carcinoma risk (Table 1, Fig. 2 ).

The GWA strategy was also exploited to investigate other infections caused by viral pathogens with worldwide diffusion. These include Human Papillomavirus (HPV), Varicella Zooster virus (VZV), and Influenza A virus (IAV). Overall, these works unveiled a limited number of associations, sometimes as a consequence of small sample sizes and, consequently, modest statistical power.

In the case of HPV, most GWASs for susceptibility to infection and progression to cervical carcinoma confirmed associations to HLA class II genes (Table 1, Fig. 2 ). It should be noted, however, that some of these studies did not directly test HPV infection status, nor HPV type, making it difficult to determine which trait these associations refer to. An interesting observation is that polymorphisms in the EXCO1 and GSDMB genes were associated with progression to cervical carcinoma (Table 1) . EXOC1 encodes a subunit of the exocyst complex involved in host innate immune response against DNA antigens (Ishikawa et al., 2009) , whereas GSDMB codes for the cancer-associated gasdermin-like protein, which is highly expressed in cervical cancer cells (Sun et al., 2008) . These data suggest that both immunological and carcinogenic factors contribute to the risk of cervical cancer development.

With respect to VZV, a GWAS was performed to investigate risk factors for herpes zoster (Crosslin et al., 2015) . Although the study had limited power and potential for control misclassification (e.g., individuals who never suffered from primary infection with VZV are not at risk of virus reactivation), a significant association was detected in the MHC region where the non-coding HCP5 (HLA Complex P5) gene maps (Table 1) . Intriguingly, variants in this region were also associated with delayed progression to AIDS (Table 1, Fig. 2 ). HCP5 derives from an endogenous retroviral element with sequence homology to the HIV-1 pol gene (Kulski and Dawkins, 1999) and is primarily expressed in immune system cells (Liu et al., 2008) . The function of this noncoding gene and its role (if any) in restricting viral infection remain to be determined. In fact, a functional study showed that HCP5 does not restrict HIV-1 infection in vitro (Yoon et al., 2010) , and refinement of the association signals within the HLA region indicated that the HCP5 variant associated with HIV-1 control is indeed a marker for the HLA-B*5701 allele Trachtenberg et al., 2009) . Likewise, HCP5 variants that reached genome-wide significance in the VZV GWAS are in strong linkage disequilibrium with polymorphisms in the HLA-B gene region (Crosslin et al., 2015) . It is thus possible that HCP5 has no effect on viral infection per se, but its variants tag specific HLA class I alleles/haplotypes.

As for IAV, a single study analyzed susceptibility to H1N1 virus infection (Garcia-Etxebarria et al., 2015) . The authors found no genome-wide significant associations when severe influenza cases were compared to mild cases. Conversely, several SNPs reached the significance threshold when severe and mild cases were compared to the general population (Table 1 and Supplementary Table S1 ). However, these associations were obtained on very small samples of patients and controls, and no replication cohort was analyzed.

Finally, we draw attention to a recent GWAS that searched for genetic variants associated with diarrhoeal episodes in young children (1-2 years old) . All subjects were recruited in developed countries, where the majority of diarrhoeal episodes are caused by viral infections (Wiegering et al., 2011) . Despite the potential issues of phenotype heterogeneity, a significant association was found for variants in FUT2, a gene encoding an alpha (1,2)-fucosyltransferase which participates in the production of histo-blood group antigens (Table 1 ). In particular, the activity of FUT2 determines the expression of the ABO histo-blood group antigens on the gastrointestinal mucosa and in bodily secretions. Genetic diversity at the FUT2 gene is maintained in human populations by balancing selection (Koda et al., 2001; Fumagalli et al., 2009 ) and common FUT2 null alleles are present in many populations (Kelly et al., 1995; Koda et al., 1996; Liu et al., 1998) . In homozygotes, these alleles determine the ""non-secretor"" phenotype. In the GWAS for diarrhoeal episodes, non-secretors were found to be at lower risk compared to secretors, a result in line with candidate-gene studies that associated the non-secretor status with protection from Rotavirus and Norovirus infections (which represent the leading causes of diarrhoeal disease in developed regions) (Wiegering et al., 2011; Lindesmith et al., 2003; Carlsson et al., 2009; Imbert-Marcille et al., 2014; Thorven et al., 2005) . In line with the balancing selection scenario, however, candidate-gene studies associated the non-secretor status with higher risk for infection by different pathogens, including Neisseria meningitidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Candida spp. (Blackwell et al., 1986a; Blackwell et al., 1986b; Chaim et al., 1997) . More recently, non-secretors were also found to be at higher risk to develop Crohn's disease (Franke et al., 2010; McGovern et al., 2010) . The molecular mechanism underlying the different predisposition to infection (and to Crohn's disease) of secretors and non-secretors most likely stems from the fact that both pathogenic and commensal microorganisms exploit oligosaccharides on the gastrointestinal mucosa for cytoadherence.

Studies on the genetic susceptibility to bacterial infections have investigated a wide variety of conditions, either resulting from specific Black boxes show sub-pathway names and contributing genes (as derived from Reactome): only genes that carry genetic variants associated in GWASs are reported (see Table 1 ). Color codes are shown in the legend. B. Schematic view of HLA class I and II loci. SNPs reported are associated to different traits related to pathogen (see Table 1 ).

A. Mozzi et al. Infection, Genetics and Evolution 66 (2018) 286-307 infections (e.g., tuberculosis, pneumococcal bacteremia) or deriving from more heterogenous situations (e.g., periodontitis).

GWASs for infections caused by Neisseria meningitidis (Davila et al., 2010; Martinon-Torres et al., 2016) , Helicobacter pylori (Mayerle et al., 2013) , and Mycobacterium leprae , strongly pointed to a role for risk variants in genes of the innate immune system. For H. pylori, variants in TLR1, known to be essential for innate immunity against bacterial infection, were identified as strongly associated with seroprevalence (Table 1, Fig. 2 ). For N. meningitidis, two GWASs for meningitis and septicaemia identified variants in the CFH gene region (Davila et al., 2010; Martinon-Torres et al., 2016) (Table 1, Fig. 2) . CFH encodes complement factor H, a regulator of the complement system, which is bound by N. meningitidis to escape complement mediated killing (Schneider et al., 2009 ).

In the case of leprosy, a single GWAS identified candidate susceptibility genes encoding proteins involved in innate immune response (NOD2, TNFSF15, and RIPK2) (Table 1, Fig. 2) . Furthermore, in a GWAS for leprosy in the Chinese population, H. found an overlap between their hits and those for autoimmunity/inflammatory diseases. For example, association with CCDC88B, identified in the leprosy GWAS (Table 1) , was also reported for primary biliary cirrhosis, sarcoidosis, and inflammatory bowel disease. Likewise, SNPs in TNFSF15, LRRK2, IL18RAP/IL1RL1, and LACC1/CCDC122 represent susceptibility loci for both leprosy and Crohn's disease (Jostins et al., 2012; . This observation points to a shared immunological basis for infectious and inflammatory conditions (H. . However, the study also showed that, whereas some shared loci (RIPK2 and LACC1/CCDC122) had concordant effects on the risk for leprosy and for inflammatory/autoimmune diseases, some others (e.g., IL18RAP/IL1RL1) showed opposite or discordant risk effects. These findings suggest a complex scenario and a delicate balance between response to infection and autoimmunity/chronic inflammation (Sironi and Clerici, 2010) .

As expected, genes of the adaptive immune system also turned out to harbor polymorphisms associated with susceptibility to infections. Variants in the MHC region were identified as risk factors for leprosy , Staphylococcus aureus infection (DeLorenze et al., 2016) , enteric fever caused by Salmonella typhi (Dunstan et al., 2014) , and TB (Sveinbjornsson et al., 2016) (Table 1 , Fig. 2 ). For this latter infection, several GWASs have been performed (Table 1 and Supplementary Table 1 ). The WT1 association mentioned above was detected in two independent studies (Chimusa et al., 2014; Thye et al., 2012) and recently confirmed, although with a p value that did not reach genome-wide significance, in a family-based Moroccan discovery sample . The functional role played by WT1, a zinc-finger transcription factor, in TB susceptibility remains to be elucidated. An interesting possibility is that WT1 regulates cytokine expression or activation of the vitamin D receptor (Maurer et al., 2001) . Instead, the role played by ASAP1, a gene associated to TB in a Russian discovery cohort and replicated in African populations (Table 1) , is somehow clearer, as its protein product regulates dendritic cell migration (Curtis et al., 2015) . However, the signals in these genes showed very small effects (WT1) or failed to replicate (ASAP1) in a recent large TB study in the Icelandic population (Sveinbjornsson et al., 2016) . This GWAS is a nice example of the power of imputation to enormously extend the number of analyzed variants. In fact, the authors used whole-genome sequencing of 2636 Icelanders to impute 28.3 million SNPs and insertions/deletions for > 100,000 chip-typed individuals. These included subjects with pulmonary TB or infected with M. tuberculosis. This large-scale study detected association signals at MHC class II loci, which were validated in Russian and Croatian samples (Sveinbjornsson et al., 2016) . As discussed above, the low reproducibility of associations across studies and populations may in part reflect local differences in circulating M. tuberculosis strains (Sveinbjornsson et al., 2016) . Finally, we mention that variants nearby the IL12B gene, which encodes a subunit of interleukin 12, were recently associated to TB in African populations (from Tanzania and Uganda) (Sobota et al., 2016) . In this GWAS, the authors used an interesting approach by including in the study only HIV-1 positive individuals. The underlying rationale was that HIV-positive individuals who do not develop TB despite living in endemic areas should be genetically resistant and ideally suited to detect variants with strong effect. Indeed, the identified variant has a strong protective effect and may modulate IL12B expression (Sobota et al., 2016) . Although this signal has not been replicated yet, it is worth mentioning that loss-of-function mutations in IL12B cause mendelian susceptibility to mycobacterial disease, a rare condition characterized by the development of clinical symptoms following infection with weakly virulent mycobacteria (Picard et al., 2002) .

A nice example of the ability of GWASs to identify unexpected associations was provided by a recent study on bacteremia caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae (Kenyan Bacteraemia Study Group et al., 2016) . By investigating a population of Kenyan children, Rautanen and coworkers identified an association peak located in the introns of two separate intergenic long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) annotated as A-C011288.2 and AC006000.5 (Table 1) . Interestingly, the risk allele is relatively rare and restricted to populations of African ancestry, underscoring the relevance of population-specific variants in disease susceptibility. Assessing AC011288.2 RNA expression in leukocyte cell subsets, Rautanen and coworkers observed expression in neutrophils only. These cells are known to play a major role in pneumococcal clearance (Gingles et al., 2001; Brinkmann et al., 2004) and their count is an independent predictor of pneumococcal bacteremia in febrile children (Kuppermann et al., 1998) .

Thousands of lncRNA genes have been identified in the human genome (Atianand and Fitzgerald, 2014) and growing evidence suggests that these molecules are involved in gene regulation in different cell-types and tissues, including the immune system (Atianand and Fitzgerald, 2014) . In 2013, using inter-crosses of mouse strains, Gomez and coworkers provided the first direct demonstration that a lncRNA (termed NeST) can modulate the outcome of infection (Gomez et al., 2013) . In particular, NeST was shown to be responsible for the persistence of Theiler's virus in the central nervous system, as well as for the clearance of Salmonella infection (Gomez et al., 2013) . These data suggest that additional lncRNA await identification as important players in immune response and infectious disease susceptibility.

GWASs have also been applied to identify genetic determinants for very common human condition characterized by a strong interaction between environmental factors and the infecting/commensal bacteria. These include caries, which is caused by a wide array of carbohydratefermenting bacteria, (Larsen and Fiehn, 2017) , periodontitis, where an anaerobic bacterial biofilm participates in disease onset and progression (Larsen and Fiehn, 2017) , as well as acne, which is characterized by overgrowth of Propionibacterium acnes.

For dental caries a variety of loci were identified via GWASs. Studies in adults have yielded significant and ""suggestive"" associations within or near genes with roles in tooth development and host defense. Among these we mention LYZL2, encoding a bacteriolytic agent (Shaffer et al., 2013) , NAMPT, which is involved in periodontal healing (Morrison et al., 2016) , and BMP7, a tooth development gene (Morrison et al., 2016) (Table 1) . To date, none of the dental caries loci identified in GWASs in adults have been followed up in fine-mapping or replication studies. Importantly, given the complexity of caries etiology and the spectrum of contributing environmental factors, some authors speculated that the effects of some genetic variants may vary across different populations (Morrison et al., 2016) .

A. Mozzi et al. Infection, Genetics and Evolution 66 (2018) 286-307 Although several GWASs were conducted for periodontitis, only few of them successfully identified implicated loci (Table 1 and Supplementary Table S1 ). Among them, the first GWAS for periodontitis studied the aggressive type of disease and identified an association with a marker in the GLT6D1 gene (encoding a glycosyltransferase) (Table 1) . Functional experiments suggested that reduced GATA3 binding affinity to the GLT6D1 locus could be a component of the pathophysiology of periodontitis.

Subsequently, Offenbacher et al. (2016) used a promising approach that combined clinical phenotypes, biological intermediates of microbial burden, and measures of local inflammation to derive periodontal complex traits (PCTs). PCTs were carried forward to GWAS to identify PCT-associated loci among European American adult participants ( Table 1 ). The authors found several significant signals in loci that included genes involved in immune response and epithelial barrier function. However, candidate loci did not associate with current clinically determined periodontal disease categories upon replication.

Finally, GWASs were also used to find associations between genetic variants and severe acne susceptibility. The top signals identified in a Chinese population included a SNP within the promoter region of DDB2 (a novel androgen receptor-interacting protein), as well as variants in SELL/SELP/SELE gene cluster (Table 1 ). These selectins have important roles in regulating cutaneous inflammation (He et al., 2014) (Fig. 2) . Instead, a GWAS conducted in a UK population identified genes linked to the TGFβ cell signaling pathway and to skin homeostasis, namely OVOL1, FST and TGFB2 (Navarini et al., 2014) (Table 1) .

Parasitic infections, either caused by protozoa or by helminths, affect millions of people worldwide. For many parasitic diseases a heritable component has been demonstrated (Verra et al., 2009; Williams-Blangero et al., 2011; Dold and Holland, 2011; Choi et al., 2003) . However very few GWAS were conducted; their results are summarized in Table 1 and were reviewed elsewhere (Mangano and Modiano, 2014) . We add herein that a recent GWAS explored the genetic susceptibility to malaria (Malaria Genomic Epidemiology Network et al., 2015) . Beyond confirming loci previously associated with severe malaria (HBB, ABO, ATP2B4) (Jallow et al., 2009; Timmann et al., 2012; Band et al., 2013) , this study identified additional variants on chromosome 4, between FREM3 and a cluster of three glycophorin genes (GYPE, GYPB, and GYPA) ( Table 1) . Glycophorins are sialoglycoproteins abundantly expressed on the erythrocyte membrane, where they play a functional role in invasion by Plasmodium falciparum. In a recent follow-up study, the authors identified an array of large copy number variants (CNVs) affecting the GYPA and GYPB genes (Leffler et al., 2017) . One of the identified CNVs (DUP4) is associated with resistance to severe malaria and explains the GWAS association signal (Malaria Genomic Epidemiology Network et al., 2015) .

The most common form of human prion disease in humans is Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease (CJD), which is classified as sporadic, acquired (iatrogenic or variant) or familial (Iwasaki, 2017) . Variants in PRPN, encoding the prion protein (PrP), are the best known genetic factor for susceptibility to CJD (Owen et al., 1990; Mead et al., 2009) (Table 1) . Nevertheless, associations to other genomic loci (MTMR7 and NPAS2 for variant CJD (Sanchez-Juan et al., 2012) , GRM8 for sporadic CJD (Sanchez-Juan et al., 2015) ) were recently reported (Table 1) . MTMR7 is specifically expressed in the central nervous system (CNS) and is involved in the phosphatidylinositol pathway, whereas NPAS2 encodes a transcription factor implicated in neuronal function. Interestingly, the CJD susceptibility variant in NPAS2 is in strong linkage disequilibrium with an SNP that regulates PLCD3 in trans (Sanchez-Juan et al., 2012) . Because PLCD3 encodes a catabolic enzyme of the phosphatidylinositol pathway, these data implicate this pathway in the susceptibility to variant CJD. As for GRM8, it encodes a member of the metabotropic glutamate receptor family. Other members of this family are involved in cellular signal transduction triggered by PrP (Um et al., 2013) . Thus, these data highlight the ability of GWASs to pinpoint molecular disease pathways.

In comparison to human GWASs, association studies in domestic and laboratory animals offer advantages and disadvantages. Model animals, for instance, can be infected with a known dose of a genetically homogeneous pathogen, removing part of the variability associated to exposure routes and load in humans, as well as to the genetic heterogeneity of the infecting pathogen. Due to their peculiar demographic histories, both model and domestic animals often display extensive linkage disequilibrium and genetic homogeneity, at least within breeds or strains (Alhaddad et al., 2013; Badke et al., 2012; Boyko et al., 2010; Flint and Eskin, 2012; Lindblad-Toh et al., 2005) . This implies that GWASs can be carried out using much fewer markers and samples than required in human studies. The other side of the coin is that the often complex breeding strategies pose challenges related to population structure, cryptic relatedness, and extensive selective sweeps resulting from artificial selection. These factors need to be accurately corrected for, to avoid spurious associations and loss of statistical power. Popular methods to account for these effects include the use of PCA to explicitly model ancestry contributions (Price et al., 2006) and the application of mixed model association methods (see (Hayes, 2013; Yang et al., 2014; Flint and Eskin, 2012) for review).

In the field of mouse genetics, an important contribution to the mapping of complex traits came from the Collaborative Cross (CC), a collaborative effort aimed at providing the scientific community with a large panel of recombinant inbred mouse strains derived from genetically diverse founders (Churchill et al., 2004; Maurizio and Ferris, 2017) . As founders are both classic inbred strains and wild-derived strains, the resulting mouse panel has higher genetic diversity and less population structure than other mouse-based resources. Within the CC framework, an ancestry-based approach was shown to be superior to marker-based methods for mapping QTLs (Aylor et al., 2011) . The utility of this approach in the field of infectious diseases was initially demonstrated by a genome-wide scan of incipient CC lines for susceptibility to Aspergillus fumigatus, a pathogen that recapitulates in mice the signs of human aspergillosis . The authors found that CC lines were heterogenous in terms of susceptibility to A. fumigatus infection, measured as survival days after infection, and the broad-sense heritability of this phenotype was 0.78. The genome-wide scan identified several QTLs, including one on chromosome 8 that contained the Irf2 gene and another one on chromosome 10 covering cytokine (Il20ra, Il22ra) and interferon (Ifngr1) receptors . Incipient CC lines were then used to investigate the genetic susceptibility to IAV infection by recording several IAV-induced phenotypes, including virus replication, airway inflammation, weight loss, and pulmonary edema. Interestingly, a highly significant QTL on chromosome 16 (HrI1, Host response to Influenza), was identified (Ferris et al., 2013) . HrI1 explained a considerable proportion of variation in several phenotypes and encompassed a genomic region where the Mx1 gene maps. Because Mx1 is a well-known IAV resistance gene (Staeheli et al., 1988) , these findings provide a nice validation of the CC approach. Additional QTLs were mapped in the study and suggested that variants in Il16 and/or Nox4 (HrI2) modulate IAV-induced weight loss (Ferris et al., 2013) .

More recently, incipient CC lines were used to identify variants in Trim55 associated with vascular cuffing after infection with a mouse adapted SARS-CoV strain (Gralinski et al., 2015) and QTLs for survival to Klebsiella pneumoniae infection (Vered et al., 2014) . Importantly, CC mice have been used to create improved models of EBOV (Ebola virus) and WNV (West Nile virus) infection (Graham et al., 2016; Graham et al., 2015; Rasmussen et al., 2014) and mouse populations showing diverse susceptibility to M. tuberculosis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Lore et al., 2015; Smith et al., 2016) . These models await genome-wide scans to unveil the genetic determinants of infection susceptibility and severity.

Dogs have also proven useful models for the mapping of variants associated with infectious disease phenotypes. Dog breeds represent genetic isolates deriving from a few founder individuals and subject to strong artificial selection. Thus, breeds differ in several phenotypes. One of these is granulomatous colitis, which is caused by mucosally invasive Escherichia coli (Simpson et al., 2006) and is described in boxers and bulldogs only (Craven et al., 2011; Manchester et al., 2013) . Within a larger project that assessed several traits and diseases, Hayward and coworkers performed a within-breed GWAS for granulomatous colitis and identified a strong association signal within a genomic region where several members of the SLAM (signaling lymphocyte activation molecule) gene family map (Hayward et al., 2016) . Interestingly, variants in the corresponding human genomic region have been associated with the susceptibility to Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis (Franke et al., 2010; Barrett et al., 2008) . These data indicate that, both in dogs and in humans, genes within this region contribute to the maintenance of intestinal immune homeostasis in the presence of commensal or pathogenic bacteria.

In cows, GWASs have been widely applied to the field of infectious disease susceptibility. This is clearly motivated by the fact that infections cause a major economic burden in the cattle industry worldwide. In this context, GWASs and other genomic approaches are regarded as powerful strategies to develop breeding programs aimed at the generation of less susceptible livestock (Raszek et al., 2016) .

One of the most investigated traits was Johne's disease, a chronic gastrointestinal tract disease caused by Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis. Several GWASs have been performed, mostly on naturally infected Holsteins and Jerseys (common breeds of dairy cattle): associated variants with small effect were identified in several analyses, but reproducibility among studies was extremely low, resulting in no confidently associated marker (Alpay et al., 2014; Kirkpatrick et al., 2011; Minozzi et al., 2010; Neibergs et al., 2010; Pant et al., 2010; Settles et al., 2009; van Hulzen et al., 2012; Zare et al., 2014) . Although the reasons for low across-study consistency are likely manifold and include different criteria to classify phenotypes and different statistical procedures, these results suggest that loci with a major effect on Johne's disease do not exist, at least in these breeds. Likewise, GWASs for susceptibility to bovine tuberculosis (caused by Mycobacterium bovis) yielded inconsistent results (Bermingham et al., 2014; Finlay et al., 2012; Kassahun et al., 2015; Richardson et al., 2016) . Efforts to identify susceptibility alleles for other infectious diseases detected small-effect loci with poor replicability (reviewed in (Raszek et al., 2016) ). To date, the greatest success was obtained for mastitis, which is commonly caused by bacterial infections; regions spanning the DCK, SLC4A4, and EDN3 genes were detected in at least two studies (Kanazawa et al., 1989; Sahana et al., 2013; Sodeland et al., 2011; Wu et al., 2015) . The functional role of these genes in mastitis and response to invading bacteria remains to be evaluated.

As is the case for cattle, infections represent major economic problems for the swine industry, with one viral pathogen, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) accounting for substantial burden (Dekkers et al., 2017) . Several GWASs for PRRSV susceptibility converged to identify a major locus on chromosome 4 (reviewed in (Dekkers et al., 2017) ). Fine mapping of the QTL region and a further functional genomics work identified a variant in the GBP5 gene as likely causal (Dekkers et al., 2017) . GPB5 encodes an interferoninducible guanosine triphosphatase which plays central roles in cellintrinsic immunity. In humans, GBP5 acts as a restriction factor for HIV (Krapp et al., 2016) . For the purpose of swine breeding, this result is relevant as a variation at GBP5 can be used for marker-assisted selection (Dekkers et al., 2017) .

As detailed above, GWASs for infectious diseases have provided important biological insight and, in some cases, the results have opened the way to personalized therapy . Huge gaps however remain, with a number of infections still not addressed by GWAS or similar approaches. For instance, hundreds of millions of people are infected by helminths (Hotez et al., 2008) , but no GWAS has investigated the genetic susceptibility to these parasites even though linkage studies provided evidence for several QTLs (reviewed in (Mangano and Modiano, 2014) ). Diarrhoea and meningitis also account for a heavy health burden, especially among children in developing countries (World Health Organization, http://apps.who.int/gho/data/ node.home). Nonetheless, only two studies provided genome-wide scans for genetic associations to these conditions Davila et al., 2010) .

The general trend in the field of complex traits is to shift from GWAS to next-generation sequencing approaches (exome or genome sequencing). These latter provide several advantages over GWASs, which mainly derive from the possibility to identify rare or private risk variants. However, next-generation approaches require sample sizes even larger than GWASs (Auer et al., 2016; Zuk et al., 2014) and the amount of phenotypic variance that is explained by rare penetrant variants may largely differ among traits. We consider that important knowledge on infectious disease susceptibility (and related traits) can be still gained by GWASs, especially for those conditions that have never been investigated using this approach.

A promising strategy for future GWASs will be to leverage information from the host's and pathogen's genomes. An interesting step forward in this direction came from a study that generated human genome-wide genotyping data of antiretroviral naive patients and almost complete HIV-1 genome sequences to systematically search for associations between host and virus variants (genome-to-genome scan) (Bartha et al., 2013) . The authors found strong associations between SNPs that tag HLA class I alleles and viral mutations in CTL (cytotoxic T lymphocyte) epitopes. These results clearly highlight the selective pressure imposed by the host immune system on the viral genome. No signals were detected outside the HLA class I loci and, on the viral genome, most selected sites were located in Gag and Nef. However, the majority of host-associated HIV-1 mutations were found to have no or little effect on viral load, suggesting that the virus can compensate for selective pressure with little fitness cost ( Bartha et al., 2013) . More recently, Ansari et al. (2017) performed a genome-to-genome scans in patients chronically infected with HCV. As in the HIV-1 study, the authors found that the adaptive immune system exerts a selective pressure on the viral genome and drives the evolution of several positions across the HCV genome. Importantly, Ansari and coworkers also showed that the host genotype for a functional IFNL4 variant modulates viral load only when the individuals are infected by a virus that carries a specific amino acid residue (serine) at position 2414 in the NS5A protein. This result clearly indicates that the host and viral genomes interact to determine the control of infection (Ansari et al., 2017) . The majority of patients recruited in the study were infected with genotype 3 and HCV is genetically heterogeneous, suggesting that other and possibly different interactions exist in patients infected by distinct HCV genotypes.

The functional polymorphism in IFNL4 is a dinucleotide variant (ss469415590, TT/ΔG) and the effect of the ""favorable"" TT allele is recessive (Prokunina-Olsson et al., 2013 ). This finding highlights the possible relevance of non-additive models in genetic associations. In particular, overodominant models may be particularly worth exploring in the field of infectious diseases. Remarkable examples of heterozygote advantage include those described for HBB and G6PD in relation to malaria. Heterozygosity at HLA genes has also been shown to protect against different infections (reviewed in (Quintana-Murci, 2016)), and the same is true for a common variant in TIRAP, with heterozygotes protected from malaria, invasive pneumococcal disease, bacteremia, and TB (Khor et al., 2007) . Heterozygosity for a common polymorphism in PRNP also confers relative resistance to prion diseases (Mead et al., 2003) . Overdominance causes multiple alleles to be maintained at a locus via balancing selection (reviewed in (Quintana-Murci, 2016)). A well-known example of this phenomenon is described above for the FUT2 gene. The maintenance of multiple ABO histo-blood groups, which most likely resulted from the selective pressure exerted by different pathogens, is also due to balancing selection (reviewed in (Quintana-Murci, 2016) ). Several works have indicated that targets of balancing selection in primate genomes have often evolved in response to pathogen-driven selective pressures (Leffler et al., 2013; Ferrer-Admetlla et al., 2008; Azevedo et al., 2015; Fumagalli and Sironi, 2014) , making overdominance an appealing model to test for resistance against infection. It should however be noted that the action of balancing selection does not necessarily imply that heterozygotes are protected against a specific diseases. Epitomal in this respect is the case of FUT2 described above, as well as that of ABO: individuals with O histoblood group are protected against severe malaria and cerebral malaria, but at higher risk of developing highly symptomatic cholera infection (Malaria Genomic Epidemiology Network and Malaria Genomic Epidemiology Network, 2014; Cooling, 2015) . Interestingly, large-scale studies that focused on specific variants involved in resistance to malaria (Malaria Genomic Epidemiology Network and Malaria Genomic Epidemiology Network, 2014; Clarke et al., 2017) indicated that G6PD deficiency also results in different susceptibility phenotypes. Thus, the level of G6PD activity is associated with decreased risk of cerebral malaria, but with increased risk of severe malarial anaemia (Malaria Genomic Epidemiology Network and Malaria Genomic Epidemiology Network, 2014; Clarke et al., 2017) . Moreover, by using a Bayesian statistical framework that allows for heterogeneity of effects across populations and phenotypes, the authors showed that homozygotes for the derived allele of a variant in the 5′ upstream region of CD40LG have significantly reduced risk of severe malaria in The Gambia, but significantly increased risk in Kenya (Malaria Genomic Epidemiology Network and Malaria Genomic Epidemiology Network, 2014) . Finally, a significant epistatic interaction was noted between the HbC variant and an SNP in ATP2B4, this latter encoding a major erythrocyte calcium channel (Malaria Genomic Epidemiology Network and Malaria Genomic Epidemiology Network, 2014) . Overall, these results indicate that models of genetic resistance/susceptibility are often complex and that statistical methods that incorporate heterogeneity across populations and phenotypes may improve the power and reliability of GWASs.

For infectious diseases, a particular role may be played by interactions within HLA genes or among HLA variants and polymorphisms located outside the major histocompatibility complex. One example of this latter scenario relates to polymorphic variants in HLA-C and in the MIR148A gene (for microRNA-148a, mir-148a). Kulkarni et al. (2011) identified a polymorphism in the 3'UTR of HLA-C which affects a miR-148a binding site and associates with HLA-C expression levels, as well as with HIV-1 control. More recently, the same authors showed that an insertion/deletion polymorphism flanking MIR148A modulates the expression of this microRNA and the level of HIV-1 control only in individuals carrying HLA-C alleles with an intact miR-148a binding site. The MIR148A variant has no effect on HIV-1 control among subjects who carry HLA-C alleles that do not bind miR-148A (Kulkarni et al., 2013) . Situations similar to the one described by Kulkarni and coworkers may be common and may be particularly important for HLA class I and KIR loci, as they biologically interact as binding partners. For instance, epistatic interactions among specific KIR and HLA loci have been shown to modulate the progression to AIDS (Hancock et al., 2008; Gaudieri et al., 2005; Martin et al., 2007) , as well as the spontaneous (Thons et al., 2017; Khakoo et al., 2004) and therapy-induced clearance of HCV infection (Ahlenstiel et al., 2008) . Likewise, interactions within the MHC may be common and relevant in modulating infection-related phenotypes. Indeed, it was recently shown that non-additive and interaction effects within HLA loci are widespread and modulate the risk of different autoimmune diseases .

Taking these possibilities into account would certainly benefit the discovery of novel genetic effects modulating infection susceptibility or progression.

Finally, we note that, as recently highlighted, association studies have been dramatically skewed in terms of population inclusion: a 2016 survey of GWASs in the Catalog indicated that 81% of analyzed samples were of European ancestry and 14% of Asian ancestry (Popejoy and Fullerton, 2016) . All other populations remained severely underrepresented. This trend is somehow attenuated in the studies we reviewed herein, as populations of Asian origin were included in > 33% of studies (most of them on HBV, HCV, and mycobacterial infections), whereas 14% and 17% of GWASs analyzed at least one cohort of African or Hispanic/Latino ancestry, respectively. However, only two studies, both of them on prion diseases, included Pacific Islanders (from Papua New Guinea) and no GWAS recruited Australian aborigines or other native peoples. These percentages clearly highlight the need to extend GWASs analysis for infectious diseases to under-represented populations. This is required to ensure that the benefits of research are equally distributed, especially in light of the recent evidence of limited portability of GWAS results across populations (Martin et al., 2017) .

Evolutionary origins of epidemic potential among human RNA viruses,"To have epidemic potential, a pathogen must be able to spread in human populations, but of human-infective RNA viruses only a minority can do so. We investigated the evolution of human transmissibility through parallel analyses of 1755 virus genome sequences from 39 RNA virus genera. We identified 57 lineages containing human-transmissible species and estimated that at least 74% of these lineages have evolved directly from non-human viruses in other mammals or birds, a public health threat recently designated ""Disease X"". Humantransmissible viruses rarely evolve from virus lineages that can infect but not transmit between humans. This result cautions against focussing surveillance and mitigation efforts narrowly on currently known human-infective virus lineages and supports calls for a better understanding of RNA virus diversity in non-human hosts.","The relative frequencies of L1-L2, L1-L3/4 and L2-L3/4 transitions varied across genera, 101 families and genome types (Figures 3b-d, Table S2 ). The odds of L1-L3/4 relative to L1-L2 (Table   112 S3, Figure S4 ). There was no indication that L2 viruses tended to arise earlier in lineages than 113 L3/4 viruses. Nor was there a consistent trend towards evolutionary recent (as measured by 114 relative node depth) increases in the number of viruses entering human populations. We also 115 estimated the instantaneous transition rates between IT level (see Supplementary Materials). 116 The rates of L2-L3/4 transitions were not higher than the rates of L1-L3/4 transitions ( Figure   117 3g, Table S4 ). This implies that the distributions of values of parameters a and c in our (Table S4) .

In contrast to IT levels, host categories are not mutually exclusive traits of a virus 123 species/subtype, and for some genera (e.g. Ebolavirus) it is likely that we are missing sequences 124 from the reservoir host(s). Therefore, we did not attempt a discrete traits analysis for host range 125 but compared the known non-human hosts for L2 and L3/4 viruses at the species/subtype and 126 genus levels (see Supplementary Materials). At the species/subtype level human viruses also 127 found in non-human primates were most likely to be L3/4 rather than L2; those also found in 128 birds were least likely (Figure 4) . At the genus level the pattern was similar (Spearman's rank 129 correlation of coefficient estimates by host category = +0.89, P<0.01) but the confidence In keeping with earlier work 15 , we used RNA-dependent RNA polymerase protein-based 136 phylogenies in our main analysis. However, we tested the possibility that alternative 137 phylogenies would generate different numbers and distributions of transitions between traits 138 by constructing alternatives trees based on surface protein sequences ( Figure S8 ). We obtained 139 results that differed minimally from our main analysis, most importantly that an estimated 71% 140 of L3/4 lineages have L1 ancestors (see Data File 9) .

We recognise that there will be significant gaps in our knowledge of mammal/bird non-RT 143 RNA virus diversity: new species are routinely being identified 8 and virus genome sequences 144 are accumulating rapidly ( Figure S1 ). Our selection procedure resulted in a data set with only 145 28% of virus sequences from human hosts, but it is still likely that the phylogenetic diversity 146 of viruses from non-human hosts is greatly underestimated relative to that from humans 3,14 , 147 noting that for many mammal/bird taxa no RNA viruses at all have yet been reported. There 148 will also be gaps in our knowledge of IT level: some viruses originally classified as L1 have 149 been subsequently found to human infective; and some viruses originally classified as L2 have 150 been subsequently found to be human transmissible as epidemiological data accumulates 6 . As 151 new virus sequences are added and IT levels are assigned or (occasionally) re-assigned it is 152 entirely possible that the estimated ancestors of some L3/4 viruses will change. However, we 153 anticipate that the impact of such changes across the whole data set will be to strengthen our 154 main conclusions. This is because we anticipate that far more L1 viruses will be added than 155 L2, and more L2 than L3/4, continuing the current trend ( Figure S1 ). For this reason, we 156 consider our estimate that 74% of L3/4 viruses arose from L1 lineages to be conservative.

We did not include two important taxa in our main analysis. The Influenza A virus genus was 159 excluded a posteriori because of a very weak phylogenetic signal for IT level ( Figure S9 ). On 160 inspection of the HA gene phylogeny it is apparent that although human infectivity and 161 transmissibility have evolved in only a few lineages (HA types) there is considerable variability 162 in IT level within those lineages, which would generate inflated counts of IT level change 163 ( Figure S10 ). Nonetheless, the phylogeny is broadly consistent with the pattern that most L3/4 164 lineages evolve from L1 lineages. We excluded Retroviridae from our main analysis a priori 165 because they cause chronic infections that allow far more time for within-host evolution prior 166 to transmission 9 . Consistent with this, we find that transmissible human lentiviruses (lineages 167 author/funder. All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.

The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/771394 doi: bioRxiv preprint of HIV-1 and HIV-2) are most likely have evolved through L1-L2-L3/4 transitions rather than 168 L1-L3/4 ( Figure S11 ). 6 . We also estimate that diversification within L3/4 lineages has 177 contributed significantly to human RNA virus diversity, accounting for 30% of species ( Figure   178 1). However, a larger fraction, at least 51%, has been generated directly from L1 lineages. Table S3 ). We have previously suggested an alternative model where the L2 trait is easily 186 evolved and easily lost 3 , but this model is not supported by the analysis reported here.

Importantly, these findings do not preclude extant pools of L2 and L3/4 viruses that have yet 188 to be recognised and may not yet have had the opportunity to enter human populations 16 , but 189 they do imply that the drivers for the emergence of novel human viruses, with or without 190 epidemic potential, would be ecological rather than evolutionary. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/771394 doi: bioRxiv preprint transitions in this category. In addition, we found that L1 (-)ssRNA virus lineages are relatively 202 more likely to generate L2 than L3/4 viruses (Table 1 ) and, once this was accounted for, there 203 was no additional effect of a virus having an envelope, as has been suggested previously 5 . 204 Nonetheless, this is a large group and (-)ssRNA virus lineages are an important source of L3/4 205 viruses ( Figure 3d ).

The absence of a clear association between human infectivity and human transmissibility may 208 reflect the key role that cell receptors play in determining a virus's capacity to infect and be 209 transmitted by humans 16, 18 . Cell receptor usage varies between virus genera and sometimes Our study supports a recent proposal for a large-scale survey of viral diversity in non-human 217 reservoirs, the Global Virome Project (GVP) 11 . Though this idea is controversial and would be 218 costly to implement 19 , its relevance is underlined by our finding that most species of human-219 transmissible viruses (L3/4) evolve from mammal/bird RNA virus lineages not known to be 220 infective to humans (L1), coupled with the expectation that the great majority of mammal and 221 bird viruses are still unrecognised 12 . We note recent progress in using machine learning to 222 predict host range from sequence data 20 and the potential of this kind of approach to help 223 identify human-infective and human-transmissible viruses even in the absence of human cases.

Finally, our study also provides empirical support for, and underlines the public health 226 importance of, ""Disease X"", the scenario that a future serious international epidemic might be 227 caused by a pathogen taxon not currently known to affect humans 21 . We find that the ability of 228 RNA viruses to transmit between humans most frequently evolves in a manner consistent with 229 the ""Disease X"" model of emerging infections. author/funder.

Conceptual model of non-RT RNA virus emergence into human populations.

Virus lineages in the reservoir may acquire (thick grey arrows showing rates a, b and c) or lose (thin grey arrows) the capacities to infect and/or transmit in humans through genetic drift -these traits are not under direct selection in the non-human reservoir.

We compiled a data pool of 7488 polymerase (or functional equivalent) gene sequences from The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/771394 doi: bioRxiv preprint biology 3 . However, we carried out a separate analysis for the one genus -Lentivirus -with 52 sufficient pol protein sequences available. Phylogenetic analysis 64 We performed parallel phylogenetic analyses using the BEAST software package 4 (V1.8.2). 65 We were primarily interested in tree topology; branch lengths scale to numbers of amino acid We tested the associations between IT levels and polymerase trees per genus using Phylogeny-74 trait association test (BaTS) 8 , inspecting both the Association index (AI) and Parsimony score 75 (PS) between genera. We observed that the Influenza A virus genus showed evidence of a 76 uniquely weak phylogenetic signal (Fig. S9a ) so this genus was subsequently considered 77 separately from the main analysis. Similar results were obtained using phylogenies based on 78 surface proteins as described below (Fig. S9b) .

The We applied asymmetric discrete trait models using BEAST to estimate IT level over each The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/771394 doi: bioRxiv preprint

In addition, we applied parsimony reconstruction models to trace trait evolution, using 121 Mesquite V 3.5.1 (http://www.mesquiteproject.org), with the input phylogenies being generated 122 with the protein sequences of each virus genus via maximum likelihood method, using RaxML 123 V 8 (WAG+G, bootstraps n=1000) 12 . We obtained excellent agreement between mean 124 estimates of numbers of forward transitions using parsimony analysis and counts estimated 125 from our discrete traits analysis (Table S1, Fig. S12b) , noting that the parsimony approach does We calculated the depth of the node of each transition on the genus-level phylogenetic tree 151 relative to the ancestral node ( Fig. S4 and Data Files 2 and 3) . We used a beta distributed 152 GLMM (using the R package 'glmmTMB' 13 ) to compare node depth (response variable) across level transition types (explanatory variable) with genus as a random factor. We used a linear 154 mixed model (LMM) with a normal distribution to compare loge-transformed transition rates 155 (response variable) by level transition groups (explanatory variable) with genus as a random 156 factor.

"Newly emerged porcine enteric alphacoronavirus in southern China: Identification, origin and evolutionary history analysis","Coronaviruses have a wide host range and can cause a variety of diseases with varying severity in different animals. Several enteric coronaviruses have been identified that are associated with diarrhea in swine and that have caused substantial economic losses. In this study, a newly emerged porcine enteric alphacoronavirus (PEAV), PEAV-GD-CH/2017, was identified from suckling piglets with diarrhea in southern China, and a fulllength genome sequence of PEAV was obtained for systematic analysis. The novel PEAV sequence was most identical to that of bat-HKU2, and the differences between them were comprehensively compared, especially the uniform features of the S protein, which was shown to have a close relationship with betacoronaviruses and to perhaps represent unrecognized betacoronaviruses. In addition, Bayesian analysis was conducted to address the origin of PEAV, and the divergence time between PEAV and bat-HKU2 was estimated at 1926, which indicates that PEAV is not newly emerged and may have circulated in swine herds for several decades since the interspecies transmission of this coronavirus from bat to swine. The evolutionary rate of coronaviruses was estimated to be 1.93 × 10 −4 substitutions per site per year for the RdRp gene in our analysis. For the origin of PEAV, we suspect that it is the result of the interspecies transmission of bat-HKU2 from bat to swine. Our results provide valuable information about the uniform features, origin and evolution of the novel PEAV, which will facilitate further investigations of this newly emerged pathogen.","Coronaviruses (CoVs) are enveloped viruses with a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome, they belong to the family Coronaviridae, and they are found in a wide variety of animals in which they can cause respiratory, hepatic, enteric and neurological diseases of varying severity (Weiss and Navas-Martin, 2005; Woo et al., 2006) . CoVs are separated into four distinct genera based on genotypic and serological characterization: alpha-CoV, beta-CoV, gamma-CoV and delta-CoV (Su et al., 2016) . To date, several enteric CoVs that are attributed to diarrhea in swine have been identified and have caused substantial economic losses. Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) belong to alpha-CoV, and both of them cause life-threatening acute enteric disease in suckling piglets (Pensaert and de Bouck, 1978; Zhang et al., 2017) . Porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (PHEV) is a beta-CoV that primarily affects pigs under 3 weeks of age (Pensaert and Callebaut, 1974; Rho et al., 2011) .

Porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) is a newly identified enteric coronavirus in swine and belongs to delta-CoV (Wang et al., 2014a) . The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the identification of SARS-CoV-like viruses from wild animals in China have boosted interest in the discovery of novel CoVs in both humans and animals. For example, human coronaviruses NL63 and HKU1 were discovered in 2004 and 2005, respectively, and MERS-CoV emerged in 2012 (Fouchier et al., 2004; Woo et al., 2005; Zaki et al., 2012) . For animal CoVs, SARS-CoV-like viruses and bat-CoV-HKU2 were discovered in horseshoe bats; novel delta-CoVs, in birds and swine; and additional novel CoVs, in bats and other animals (Chu et al., 2008; Dong et al., 2007; Lau et al., 2005 Lau et al., , 2007 Wang et al., 2014b; Woo et al., 2012) . Recently, a novel bat-HKU2-like coronavirus that can cause diarrhea in suckling piglets was discovered in swine by two research groups in China (Gong et al., 2017; Pan et al., 2017) . This novel enteric coronavirus shares high nucleotide identities (approximately 95%) with the reported bat-HKU2 strains at the full genome level and is tentatively named porcine enteric alphacoronavirus (PEAV) (Gong et al., 2017) .

In this retrospective study, we report the identification of this newly emerged PEAV from a pig farm in Guangdong Province, China, which outbreaks of severe diarrhea in suckling piglets in March 2017. We analyzed and described the genome characteristic of this novel PEAV systematically and the phylogenetic relationship of this virus with other groups of CoVs. Bayesian analysis was also conducted to address the origin and evolutionary history of PEAV, and our results indicate that PEAV emerged approximately 91 years ago and may have circulated in swine herds for several decades.

In March 2017, an acute diarrheal outbreak of newborn-piglet diarrhea occurred in a commercial pig farm in Guangdong Province, China. The clinical manifestations included vomiting, acute watery diarrhea and dehydration in ill suckling piglets. Small intestinal and fecal samples were collected from ill pigs and submitted to the Animal Disease Detection Diagnosis Center of Southern China Agricultural University for pathogen detection. The small intestinal samples were homogenized with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; 0.1 M, pH 7.4) and subsequently centrifuged at 10,000 ×g for 10 min at 4°C. The fecal samples were resuspended with PBS and centrifuged as described above. Both supernatants were collected for RNA extraction using a TaKaRa MiniBEST Universal RNA Extraction Kit (TaKaRa, Dalian, China), and first-strand cDNA was synthesized using a PrimeScript™ 1st Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (TaKaRa, Dalian, China) following the manufacturer's instructions. PCR was used for the detection of common enteric viral pathogens as previously described, including PEDV, TGEV, PDCoV and porcine group A rotaviruses (RVAs) (Amimo et al., 2013; Kim et al., 2000; Liu and Wang, 2016; Song et al., 2015) . However, all samples were negative for PEDV, TGEV, PDCoV and RVAs. Subsequently, we suspected PEAV infection and conducted a retrospective study of these samples after the report of PEAV in Guangdong (Gong et al., 2017) .

A pair of primers (forward: 5′-TTTTGGTTCTTACGGGCTGTT-3′; reverse: 5′-CAAACTGTACGCTGGTCAACT-3′) based on RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene of a known bat-HKU2 strain (EF203065) was designed for PEAV detection. After PEAV was detected, 18 pairs of primers were designed based on the bat-HKU2 genome to amplify the full genome (these primer sequences are available on request), and the PCR-amplified products were analyzed by electrophoresis on 1.5% agarose gels and purified using a MiniBEST DNA Extraction Kit (TaKaRa, Dalian, China). The purified PCR product was cloned into the pMD18-T (TaKaRa, Dalian, China) vector for sequencing. Sequences of fragments were assembled using the DNAStar program to produce the final viral genome sequence and used for further analysis.

The complete genome sequence of PEAV and the deduced amino acid sequences of the open reading frames (ORFs) were compared to those of other known CoVs as previously reported (Woo et al., 2012) . Multiple sequence alignments were performed by MAFFT, and a phylogenetic tree based on the full-length genome nucleotide sequences of PEAV and of other representative CoVs was constructed using the neighbor-joining method with 1000 bootstrap replicates in MEGA 5.0 (Tamura et al., 2011) . Consideration the extensive divergence between the nucleotide sequences of different coronavirus genera, phylogenetic trees for the ORF1ab, RdRp, S, M, and N proteins were also constructed based on the corresponding amino acid sequences. Bootscan analysis was also performed to detect if a potential recombination event occurred for PEAV using Simplot 3.5.1 with the genome sequence of PEAV as the query. Prediction of transmembrane domains was performed using TMHMM (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TMHMM/).

The Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method was used to infer the divergence time of PEAV with other members of CoVs in BEAST 1.8.3 as described previously (Drummond and Rambaut, 2007; Fu et al., 2018; Woo et al., 2012) . Specifically, analyses were performed under the GTR + I + Г nucleotide substitution model for the RdRp gene (2781 bp) and using an unrelaxed lognormal distribution molecular clock with a constant size model. The MCMC algorithm was run for a 100 million step chain and sampled every 10,000 states, and 10% of the chain was removed as burn-in. The maximum clade credibility (MCC) tree was inferred by the Tree Annotator program included in the BEAST package. The mean time of the most recent common ancestor (TMRCA) and the highest posterior density (HPD) regions at 95% were calculated in Tracer 1.6, and posterior probability values provided an assessment of the degree of support for the key node of the tree. The nucleotide substitution rate (per site per year) for coronaviruses was also estimated in this analysis.

All samples were negative for RT-PCR detection of common enteric viruses, including PEDV, TGEV, PDCoV and RVAs. Subsequently, a newly emerged PEAV that can cause diarrhea in suckling piglets was reported in Guangdong, China (Gong et al., 2017) ; we suspected PEAV infection and conducted a retrospective study of these samples. Considering the high nucleotide identities (approximately 95%) of PEAV with reported bat-HKU2 strains (Gong et al., 2017) , we designed a pair of primers based on RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene of a known bat-HKU2 strain for PEAV detection. To our surprise, an expected 750 bp fragment was amplified from all samples, and the PCR products were further sequenced. The sequences of the PCR products were subjected to BLAST searches in the GenBank database, showed the highest identity to bat-HKU2 strains (approximately 97%), and corresponded to nucleotide positions 12,837-13,570 in the bat-HKU2 genome. The full-length genome of PEAV was finally obtained by segment amplification and named PEAV-GD-CH/2017 (MG742313).

The genomic structure of PEAV is organized with the same gene order as that of bat-HKU2, namely, 5′-ORF1a/1b (ORF1ab)-S-ORF3-E-M-N-NS7a-3′ (Fig. 1) , and the genome sequence length of PEAV-GD-CH/2017 is 27,155 nt, excluding the poly (A) tail, which is similar to previous reports (Gong et al., 2017; Pan et al., 2017) . The G + C content of PEAV ranges from 39.34% to 39.41% (Table 1) , and the genome nucleotide identities of PEAV-GD-CH/2017 with PEAV-GDS04 (MF167434) and PEAV-GD-01(MF370205) are 99.7% and 99.8%, respectively. All three known PEAV strains are most identical to bat-HKU2 and BtRF-AlphaCoV/YN2012, with approximately 95.0% and 87.5% nucleotide identities, respectively. In addition, comparison of the genomic features of PEAV and of other coronaviruses and the amino acid identities between the predicted ORF1ab, RdRp, S, E, M and N proteins of PEAV and the corresponding proteins of other coronaviruses are summarized in Table 1 . Notably, most of these PEAV proteins share higher identities to alpha-CoVs (group B) than the other three groups of coronaviruses, except the S protein, which shares only approximately 25% amino acid identity to that of alpha-CoVs (Table 1 ). The putative transcription regulatory sequence (TRS) motif, 5'-AACUAAA-3′, precedes each ORF of PEAV (Table 2 ) and has the same TRS sequence as bat-HKU2 and HCoV-NL63 (Lau et al., 2007; Pyrc et al., 2004) . The coding potential and putative TRS sequence for each ORF of PEAV are summarized in Table 2 . Similar to bat-HKU2, one ORF was observed between the S and E genes, which encodes a putative 229-amino acid nonstructural protein, NS3 (Lau et al., 2007) . The NS3 protein of PEAV shares 94% amino acid identity to that of bat-HKU2 but only 42% and 35% identities to those of HCoV-NL63 and PEDV, respectively.

The S protein is the main determinant during coronavirus infection, as it possesses both receptor-binding and fusion functions; it is also the crucial determinant of tissue tropism and host range (Millet and Whittaker, 2015) . However, the S protein of PEAV is very unique, similar to that of bat-HKU2; because the amino acid identities to the S proteins of all known coronaviruses are lower than 28%, we systematically analyzed the S protein of PEAV and compared it with those of other coronaviruses. The S protein of PEAV contains 1130 amino acid residues, and the insertion of two amino acid residues (serine and isoleucine) at positions 12 and 13 was observed compared to that of bat-HKU2. Two putative cleavage sites, S1/S2 (VRR↓MTFE) and S2′ (ESR↓ SAIEDLLF), were found at positions 546 and 673 in the S protein of PEAV, respectively (Fig. 1) . Interestingly, the arginine at cleavage site S2′ is conserved in the S proteins of almost all four genera of coronaviruses, and this cleavage site have a remarkably conserved motif, E-D-L-L-F; in contrast, the arginine (position 545) at cleavage sites S1/ S2 is conserved in S proteins from several beta-CoVs (Table S1 ). The PEAV S protein is predicted to have a transmembrane domain from positions 1069 to 1091, followed by a short cytoplasmic tail (endodomain), which contains conserved cysteine residues (Fig. 1) . Pairwise comparison of the amino acid sequences of S proteins of PEAV and bat-HKU2 revealed more mutations at the S1 subunit (122 mutations) than the S2 subunit (26 mutations), particularly in the NTD (aminoterminal domain), which may be related to tissue tropism and host range changes and may result in interspecies transmission from bat to swine. Fig. 1 . Diagram of the structural organization of the PEAV genome. The putative cleavage sites S1/S2 and S2′ in the S protein are shown by arrows, and the numbers indicate the amino acid positions in the S protein of PEAV. The S protein is composed of two subunits: the S1 receptor-binding subunit, and the S2 fusion subunit. NTD: N-terminal domain of S1; Cdomain: C-terminal domain of S1; FP: putative fusion peptide; TM: transmembrane domain; E: endodomain. Not drawn to scale. 

Phylogenetic analysis was conducted to address the evolutionary relationship and the potential recombination of PEAV with other coronaviruses based on the nucleotide sequences of the whole genome and the amino acid sequences of ORF1ab, RdRp, S, M and N proteins, respectively ( Figs. 2 and 3) . Obviously, all PEAV strains cluster with bat-HKU2 and BtRF-AlphaCoV/YN2012 and form a distinct lineage (defined as HKU2-like, not shown in the tree) closely related to other alpha-CoVs that belong to group 1b based on the whole genome level (Fig. 2) . The same result can also be observed from the phylogenetic tree that was constructed based on the amino acid sequences of ORF1ab, RdRp, M and N proteins (Fig. 3) . However, the evolutionary relationship of PEAV exhibited a uniform feature when phylogenetic analysis was conducted based on the S protein. All PEAV strains cluster with bat-HKU2 and BtRF-AlphaCoV/YN2012 along with a newly identified rat-CoV, LRNV. These strains form a distinct lineage and cluster with beta-CoV but are separate from all four known subgroups of beta-CoVs; we defined this distinct lineage as the beta-like group (Fig. 3) . These results are consistent with identical amino acid analysis and with those of a previous report (Pan et al., 2017) . We also conducted recombination analysis to evaluate if recombination has occurred in the PEAV genome, especially in the S gene, but no significant single recombination event was observed when the genome sequence of PEAV was used as the query (Fig. S1 ). Additionally, recombination was not observed in bat-HKU2 and LRNV genomes in previous studies (Lau et al., 2007; Wang et al., 2015) . Noteworthy, another large difference between PEAV and bat-HKU2 is in N protein, it shows distant phylogenetic relationship comparing with analysis of ORF1ab, RdRp, E and M protein (Fig. 3) , which is consistent with analysis of amino acid identity (Table 1) . 22 amino acid mutations were found during pairwise comparison of the amino acid sequences of N proteins of PEAV and bat-HKU2, and most mutations located in carboxyl terminal, however, N protein is highly conserved among different PEAV strains.

Because the RdRp gene is the most conserved gene between all coronaviruses, the RdRp gene was used for Bayesian analysis to address the divergence time and evolutionary history of PEAV in this study. The MCC tree constructed based on the RdRp gene has a topology similar to that of the phylogenetic tree that was constructed based on the whole genome and the RdRp protein, with high posterior probability values supporting each key node, and the mean TMRCA was estimated with 95% HPD values (Fig. 4) . Based on our analysis, the mean TMRCA of bovine-CoV and HCoV-OC43 was estimated at 1914 (95% HPD, 1841 to 1981), and the mean TMRCA of human and civet SARSr-CoV was estimated at 2001 (95% HPD, 1998 HPD, to 2003 . In addition, the divergence time between HKU15 and PDCoV was estimated at 1986 (95% HPD, 1970 to 1994). All of these results are highly consistent with those of previous studies ( and indicate that our Bayesian analysis is unbiased. The mean TMRCA of PEAV and bat-HKU2 was estimated at 1926 (95% HPD, 1864 to 1984), approximately 91 years ago, which indicates that PEAV is not newly emerged and may have circulated in swine herds for several decades since its interspecies transmission from bat to swine. PEAV clusters with bat-HKU2; these coronaviruses have a common ancestor with another bat-CoV, BtRf-AlphaCoV/YN2012, and the divergence time between them was estimated at 1783 (95% HPD, 1620 to 1943). All of these bat-HKU2-like coronaviruses are closely related to HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 and emerged at approximately 277 (95% HPD, 931 BC to 1434). In addition, the TMRCA for alpha-CoV, beta-CoV and gamma-CoV were also estimated in our analysis at approximately 827 BC (95% HPD, 2626 BC to 1042), 1419 BC (95% HPD, 3561 BC to 867) and 977 BC (95% HPD, 3313 BC to 1090), respectively. In addition, the TMRCA for all coronaviruses was estimated at 3914 BC (95% HPD, 8637 BC to 45 BC), approximately 6000 years ago, which indicates that coronaviruses have had a very long evolutionary history since their emergence. The mean evolutionary rate of CoVs was estimated to be 1.93 × 10 −4 (95% HPD, 1.27 × 10 −4 to 3.57 × 10 −4 ) nucleotide substitutions per site per year for the RdRp gene based on Bayesian analysis, which is consistent with the results of a previous report (Woo et al., 2012) .

For the origin of PEAV, we conjecture that the interspecies transmission of bat-HKU2 from bat to swine occurred approximately 90 years ago. As wild boars have been reported as reservoirs for various pathogens, and can transmit these pathogens into domestic swine, such as porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2), classical swine fever virus (CSFV) and Hepatitis E virus (HEV) (Adlhoch et al., 2009; Firth et al., 2009; Goller et al., 2016) , but whether wild boars plays an important role during the interspecies transmission of bat-HKU2 needs to further investigate.

Coronaviruses are important pathogens that have a wide host range and cause different kinds of diseases in a variety of animals; many novel coronaviruses have been identified in both humans and animals since the outbreak of SARS in 2003 (Fouchier et al., 2004; Lau et al., 2005 Lau et al., , 2007 Wang et al., 2014b; Woo et al., 2005 Woo et al., , 2012 Zaki et al., 2012) . Several enteric coronaviruses that can cause diarrhea in swine have been identified and have circulated in swine herds for a long time; PEDV, TGEV and PHEV are examples of these viruses (Pensaert and de Bouck, 1978; Rho et al., 2011; Zhang et al., 2017) . In particular, largescale outbreaks of PEDV in China and the USA, with high rates of illness and death in suckling piglets, caused substantial economic losses in late 2010 and 2013, respectively Wang et al., 2013) .

A newly enteric coronavirus, PDCoV, was identified in the USA in 2014, and this coronavirus caused clinical signs in swine similar to those of PEDV (Wang et al., 2014a) . In this study, a novel PEAV (PEAV-GD-CH/2017) strain was identified from suckling piglets with diarrhea, and this strain shares high identities with the other two PEAV strains that were previously reported (Gong et al., 2017; Pan et al., 2017) . These novel PEAVs are most identical to bat-HKU2, with 95% nucleotide identity, and have the same genome organization and TRS motif for each ORF. The greatest difference between PEAV and bat-HKU2 is their S proteins, which share 85% amino acid identity each other, a value much lower compared with those of other proteins (Table 1) . This difference is caused by amino acid mutations in the S protein, particularly in the NTD in the S1 subunit, which has been proven to be the key factor determining issue tropism and the host range of coronaviruses (Lu et al., 2015) . In addition to its low amino acid identity with the S protein of HKU2-like coronavirus, it shares low amino acid identity (lower than 28%) with S proteins of all known coronaviruses. Thus, clarifying the origin of the S proteins of PEAV and HKU2-like coronavirus is important for determining the origin and evolutionary history of these coronaviruses. A previous study showed that the extreme NTD in the S1 subunit of PEAV is structurally similar to that of NL63, while the rest of the S1 subunit is structurally similar to that of MHV (Pan et al., 2017) . In addition, a short peptide in the S protein of bat-HKU2 was found to be homologous to a corresponding peptide within the receptor-binding motif (RBM) in the S1 subunit of SARS-CoV (Lau et al., 2007) . We also analyzed the arginine (position 545) at cleavage sites S1/S2 of PEAV and found that it is conserved in several beta-CoVs in this study. Moreover, the phylogenetic tree based on the S protein presents a uniform evolutionary relationship; these bat-HKU2like coronaviruses cluster with a newly identified rat-CoV, LRNV, which represents a novel species of coronaviruses. All of these strains form a distinct lineage and cluster with beta-CoVs but are separate from all four known subgroups of beta-CoVs (Fig. 3) , which may indicate that these strains are part of a novel subgroup of beta-CoVs. These results suggest that PEAV and HKU2-like coronaviruses may have some relations with beta-CoVs and most likely resulted from recombination with the backbone of alpha-CoV and the S gene from an unrecognized beta-CoV. Another large difference between PEAV and bat-HKU2 is N protein, which share about 93.9% amino acid identity, as N protein is a multifunctional protein for coronaviruses, which is involving in virus replication, budding and pathogenesis et al. (McBride et al., 2014) . While the role of these mutations in N protein between PEAV and bat-HKU2 should further investigate. The origin and emergence time of a newly emerged pathogen are important issues to answer to determine the evolutionary history and plan methods of prevention for these new pathogens. For example, previous SARS research reported that the interspecies transfer of SARSlike coronaviruses from bats to the amplifying host (e.g., civet) occurred in 1998 and that interspecies transfer from civet to humans occurred in 2002 (Chinese, 2004; Hon et al., 2008; Lau et al., 2010; Song et al., 2005) . These results provide insight into the origin and evolutionary history of SARS coronavirus. The origin and divergence time of other coronaviruses have also been estimated previously; the divergence time of bovine-CoV and HCoV-OC43 could be dated back to the end of the 19th century to the beginning of the 20th century and was estimated at 1910 (Vijgen et al., 2006) . The TMRCA for all PDCoV strains was reported at 1991, approximately 24 years before PDCoV was identified (Woo et al., 2017) . In this study, we also addressed the emergence time and evolutionary history of PEAV and of the other coronaviruses based on the RdRp gene by Bayesian analysis. In anticipation, the mean divergence time of bovine-CoV and HCoV-OC43 was estimated at 1914, and the mean TMRCA of human and civet SARSr-CoV was estimated at 2001 in our analysis (Fig. 4) . These results are highly consistent with those of a previous report discussed above and further indicate that our analysis is unbiased. The emergence time of PEAV was estimated at 1926 (95% HPD, 1864 to 1984) based on our analysis, which indicates that PEAV is not newly emerged and may have circulated in swine herds for several decades since interspecies transmission from bat to swine occurred. In addition, these HKU2-like coronaviruses have a common ancestor with HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E, and the divergence time was estimated at 277, which indicates that these HKU2-like coronaviruses have a long evolutionary history. The mean TMRCA for alpha-CoV, beta-CoV, and gamma-CoV, as well as those of all coronaviruses estimated in this study, were later compared with those of a previous report (Woo et al., 2012) . Nevertheless, the mean TMRCA coincides with the regions with 95% HPD to each other. The evolutionary rate of different coronaviruses was estimated previously; 4.3 × 10 −4 substitutions per site per year was estimated for HCoV-OC43 (Vijgen et al., 2005) , and the mean evolutionary rate for group 1b coronaviruses was estimated to be 3 × 10 −4 substitutions per site per year (Pyrc et al., 2006) . In addition, the evolutionary rate for all coronaviruses was estimated to be 1.3 × 10 −4 substitutions per site per year (Woo et al., 2012) , which is estimated to be 1.93 × 10 −4 (95% HPD, 1.27 × 10 −4 to 3.57 × 10 −4 ) nucleotide substitutions per site per year for the RdRp gene in this study, and all of these results are comparable to each other.

Bats and birds are supposed to be the reservoir hosts for coronaviruses; in particular, bats are the reservoir hosts and gene pools of alpha-CoVs and beta-CoVs, while birds are the reservoir hosts and gene pools of gamma-CoVs and delta-CoVs (Woo et al., 2012) . However, whether the first coronaviruses occurred in bats or birds is still unknown. To date, the generally acknowledged evolutionary model for coronaviruses is as follows: the ancestor of bat-CoV was transmitted to another species of bat and generated alpha-CoV and beta-CoV. Interspecies transmission of these bat-CoVs to other bat species and other mammals then occurred, and these coronaviruses are circulating in these hosts. Similarly, the ancestor of bird-CoV was transmitted to another species of birds and generated gamma-CoV and delta-CoV. Interspecies transmission of these bird-CoVs to other bird species and accidentally to some mammalian species (e.g., pig and whale) then occurred (Woo et al., 2012) . Bat is also supposed to be the origin of other swine pathogens, such as porcine circovirus type 3 (PCV3), which was suspected to be generated from the interspecies transmission of batassociated circovirus from bat to swine (Fu et al., 2018) . Based on the evolutionary relationship and molecular features of PEAV and bat-HKU2-CoV, as well as the important role of bat in the ecology of coronaviruses, we conjecture that the origin of PEAV is the result of the interspecies transmission of bat-HKU2-CoV from bat to swine approximately 90 years ago.

In summary, the novel PEAV was identified from suckling piglets with diarrhea in southern China, and the full-length genome of PEAV-GD-CH/2017 was obtained in this study. The genome and S protein features of PEAV was systematic analyzed, as well as the evolutionary relationship of PEAV with other coronaviruses, which indicated PEAV may recombination with unrecognized beta-CoV. PEAV emerged approximately 90 years ago and origin from the interspecies transmission of bat-HKU2 from bat to swine, and wild boars may plays an important role in this process. Thus, epidemiological investigations of PEAV should be further conducted in both swine and wild boars to better understand and clarify the origin and evolutionary history of PEAV. Importantly, considering this infectious coronavirus and its serious clinical implications for suckling piglets (Pan et al., 2017) , the development of an effective vaccine for PEAV is urgently needed for the prevention of this disease.

The Origin and Evolution of Variable Number Tandem Repeat of CLEC4M Gene in the Global Human Population,"CLEC4M is a C-type lectin gene serving as cell adhesion receptor and pathogen recognition receptor. It recognizes several pathogens of important public health concern. In particular, a highly polymorphic variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) at the neck-region of CLEC4M had been associated with genetic predisposition to some infectious diseases. To gain insight into the origin and evolution of this VNTR in CLEC4M, we studied 21 Africans, 20 Middle Easterns, 35 Europeans, 38 Asians, 13 Oceania, and 18 Americans (a total of 290 chromosomes) from the (Human Genome Diversity Panel) HGDP-CEPH panel; these samples covered most of alleles of this VNTR locus present in human populations. We identified a limited number of haplotypes among the basic repeat subunits that is 69 base pairs in length. Only 8 haplotypes were found. Their sequence identities were determined in the 290 chromosomes. VNTR alleles of different repeat length (from 4 to 9 repeats) were analyzed for composition and orientation of these subunits. Our results showed that the subunit configuration of the same repeat number of VNTR locus from different populations were, in fact, virtually identical. It implies that most of the VNTR alleles existed before dispersion of modern humans outside Africa. Further analyses indicate that the present diversity profile of this locus in worldwide populations is generated from the effect of migration of different tribes and neutral evolution. Our findings do not support the hypothesis that the origin of the VNTR alleles were arisen by independent (separate) mutation events and caused by differential allele advantage and natural selection as suggested by previous report based on SNP data.","Dendritic cell-specific intracellular adhesion molecular-3grabbing nonintegrin (CLEC4L) and L-SIGN also called DC-SIGN related (CLEC4M) are C-type lectins involved in both innate and adaptive immunity. They are cell adhesion receptors and pathogen recognition receptors. However, CLEC4L (also called CD209) is expressed primarily on phagocytic cells, such as dendritic cells and macrophages, whereas CLEC4M (also called CD209L) expression is restricted to endothelial cells in liver and lymph nodes [1, 2] . Both lectins are known to bind multiple pathogens and function as cellular receptors for various viruses, such as HIV-1, Ebola virus, cytomegalovirus, hepatitis C virus, Dengue virus, and SARS-coronavirus [3] [4] [5] . With regards to CLEC4M, it serves as a receptor for a variety of viruses, including HIV-1, hepatitis C, Ebola, and SARS-coronavirus, as well as the parasite Schistosoma mansoni and bacteria Mycobacterium tuberculosis [6, 7] . These two lectins are coded by genes that are located within a lectin family genes cluster on chromosome 19p13.2-3. This 26-kb segment is believed to arise as a result of a duplication of an ancestral gene [8] . These two genes in the cluster share a high degree of homology [2] . Both proteins are organized into three domains: (1) an N-terminal cytoplasmic region with a di-leucine motif for internalization followed by a transmembrane domain, (2) a C-terminal extracellular domain with a C-type carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) involved in pathogen binding, and (3) a neckregion containing variable number of repeats of conserved subunit of 23-amino-acid sequence, that connects the CRD to the transmembrane region.

The neck-region is involved in assembling the lectin into a tetrameric protein conformation on the cell surface, which is believed to be required for efficient recognition of multivalent ligands. And the length variation of this neck-region had been proposed to affect the pathogen-binding properties of the CRD of these proteins [9, 10] . However, this property is controversial [9] . Genetic association studies also showed conflicting results about the associations of length variation of neck-region and several infectious diseases, such as HIV, HCV, and SARS [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] .

CLEC4M neck-region exhibits a higher level of heterozygosity due to presence of 4-to 9-repeats in substantial frequencies in the populations. On the other hand, the VNTR in CLEC4L is highly conserved (7 repeats is found in .90% in the population). Previous study showed that CLEC4L had been under a strong selective constraint, while CLEC4M had been shaped by the action of balancing selection, and the VNTR region of these two genes might be the target of such selective pressures [20] .

The VNTR repeat length polymorphism in CLEC4M has been suggested to be associated with genetic predisposition to infection. We investigated the origin and evolutionary history of this VNTR in human population by clonal sequencing. Samples from the Human Genome Diversity Panel (HGDP)-CEPH panel of different continents were studied. The HGDP-CEPH panel is a resource of 1064 cultured lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) from individuals in 52 different world populations. Information for each LCL is limited to sex, population, and geographic origin of the individual. The panel contains LCLs from populations living on all continents and is collected to provide unlimited supplies of DNA for studies of sequence diversity and history of modern human populations [21] .

The sequence identity of each repeat subunit of different VNTR alleles are identified by sequencing after cloning the PCR product and the haplotype structure including identity of each subunit and their orientation of each VNTR (from 4 to 9 repeats) is thus determined.

Our results showed that the haplotype of subunits of the same VNTR (from 4 to 9 repeats) sampled from subjects of different continents were virtually identical, which implied the different VNTR alleles in CLEC4M gene had existed for a long time, at least before the date of ''out-of-Africa'' event. Furthermore, by using the genotype data of VNTR in CLEC4M gene and dividing the subjects of the Human Genome Diversity Panel (HGDP)-CEPH panel into 26 populations, we analyzed the correlation between the 25 non-African populations geographic distance to the east Africa and their population genetic distance to the east Africa. We concluded that the present diversity profile of this VNTR in worldwide populations was consistent with demographic migrating of different tribes. No evidence was found to support the notion of independent mutation events due to natural selection.

Sequence identity of the subunits in VNTR of CLEC4M Gene Work by our team and others showed that the VNTR in CLEC4M gene varied in size from 4 to 9 repeats [18] . In this study, we analyzed the sequence identity of each subunit among VNTR of 4 to 9 repeats alleles of 145 samples from different continental populations by clonal sequencing. Figure 1 shows the various haplotypes of each subunit and the prevalent subunit orientation in each VNTR alleles. Only eight different haplotypes account for all sequence variations of all subunits. H2 is the most parsimony one and thus used as the consensus sequence. According to the sequence identity in the 69-bp repeat unit, seven other haplotypes are identified (denoted as H1-H8) ( Figure 1 ). Different numbers of these subunits assemble to form the VNTR alleles of different length. The most prevalent subunit structures of each VNTR are described in Figure 2 . The detailed haplotype configurations in VNTR locus for all studied samples are found in Table S1 .

In most VNTR, the N-terminal repeat unit (H1) and C-terminal repeat unit (H4 followed by H5) are highly conserved. Most alleles has H1 and H4 followed by H5 (or their transition variants) in these two locations ( Figure 2 ), which is supportive that these subunits are important for the formation of oligomer of CLEC4M [9] .

As the 7-repeat allele is the dominant allele in worldwide population, we used the sequencing result of this 7-repeat haplotype as an illustration. One hundred and thirteen alleles of the 7-repeat were sequenced, and 96.5% of them showed identical haplotype and arrangement of subunits. On the direction from the N-terminal to C-terminal, the 7-repeat allele is formed by one H1, three H2, one H3, one H4 and one H5. Thus, it is denoted as H1-H2-H2-H2-H3-H4-H5 in the table of supplementary data (Table  S1) , and this construction is defined as the common consensus configuration. The consensus configurations of other VNTR alleles are also shown in table 1. For 7-repeat allele, the remainder has one of the three variant configurations which accounted for less than 4%. These variants are due to replacement of one of the H2 subunit by H3 subunit or vice versa. As H2 subunit and H3 subunit differs by three base pairs, it is not caused by a single sporadic event. They represent a signal of independent origin in a small proportion of 7-repeat allele. Therefore, these variants of 7repeat are classified as major rearrangement in Table 1 .

When the longer repeat alleles were compared with the shorter one, it is apparent that the expansion of VNTR is due to insertion of H2 subunit (e.g. 8-repeat and 9-repeat). On the other hand, shorter repeat alleles were formed by deletion of H2 subunit. The 7-repeat was the dominant allele and was composed of five haplotype subunits in between the terminal subunits ( Figure 2 ). The 6-repeat, 8-repeat and 9-repeat, had the same haplotype subunit order as the 7-repeat, except for loss or duplication of the subunit H2 (Figure 2) .

A dominant consensus configuration can be found in most VNTR alleles. Table 1 shows that only less than 2.5% of the alleles have a major rearrangement. It is found that an independent Table 1 . The proportion of the common consensus configuration, minor variant and major rearrangement in VNTR. Note: minor variant: the difference between two subunits is due to a single base change which also represents a transition change. major rearrangement: change from one subunit haplotype to another with difference in multiple base pairs or a change in the order of subunits. It signifies that the rearrangement cannot be caused by a single sporadic mutation. It may represent an independent origin of the alleles and candidates for natural selection. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0030268.t001 origin as reflected by prevalence of major rearrangement in a repeat allele was more frequent (6.6%) in the longest allele (9repeat), suggesting that the longest allele may be found by separate mutagenesis events. On the other hand, all other alleles have only one dominant consensus configuration, together with minor variants of single base transition change which may be due to sporadic transition events. In general, the haplotype subunit and their configuration in each VNTR alleles are common in populations across different continents, and it suggests that they should be originated before the out-of-Africa event, and maintained for a long time.

Barreiro et al. have reported that using data of adjacent SNPs of the locus, the CLEC4M gene evolved under balancing selection in non-African populations and pointed out that the neck-region was the functional target of such selection [20] . However, we showed that a different mechanism, namely demographic migration might explain equally well the generation of the VNTR diversity based on the sequence subunits within the VNTR repeats.

We divided the individuals of the Human Genome Diversity Panel (HGDP)-CEPH panel into 26 populations according to Barreiro et al.[20] . We used the VNTR locus as a marker to calculate genetic distances between populations. Under the ''outof-Africa'' (OFA) model, all modern humans originated from East African [22] , it implies that the population from East Africa has the highest genetic diversity, and the genetic distance from non-African to East African declines monotonically with the geographical distance away from East Africa. By defining the northeastern Bantu of Kenya as the Human Original region population, we calculated the genetic distance between the other 25 non-African populations and the original population (East African population). Indeed, the VNTR genetic distances between the East Africa and the 25 different populations significantly correlated with their geographical distance to East Africa (R 2 = 0.51, P,0.0001 by linear regression) ( Figure 3 ). The data indicated that the present diversity distribution of the VNTR locus in CLEC4M gene could be explained by human migration in keeping with the OFA model of human settlement history. The patterns of population variation of VNTR in modern humans could be accounted by neutral evolution, that is, the evolution of VNTR in CLEC4M gene was influenced mostly by genetic drift.

In this work, by undertaking a comprehensive clonal sequencing study of the internal structure variation within the observed repeats among different populations at the worldwide scale, we gain insights into the evolutionary mechanism underlying the VNTR of CLEC4M gene. The CLEC4M gene plays an important role in innate immunity as pathogen receptor and had been studied as susceptibility gene to infectious and generated conflicting results [11] [12] [13] 15, 16, 18, 19] . As the VNTR is the focus at issue, the study about it is urgent. Understanding of the origin and evolution of the VNTR polymorphism will provide us better insight on whether the VNTR had been a target of natural selection, as an example of the evolution of other immunity related genes. In conclusion, we showed that various VNTR alleles in VNTR locus of CLEC4M gene were present before the time of human dispersion out of Africa. Further analysis showed that the present worldwide diversity profile of this VNTR locus could be resulted from demographic migrating of different tribes, and no evidence was found to support the notion of multiple independent mutation events at this VNTR due to natural selection. Future work based on much more comprehensive sequence information from more species, such as chimpanzee, gibbon, bonobo, could further our understanding of evolution of this gene and the effect of different pathogen pressures across the different species of the primates. ment of all the individuals met the criteria set by the HGDP Ethics Committee. The ethics of informed consent are specifically addressed by the HGDP's ''Model Ethical Protocol for Collecting DNA Samples'', which has been published as [23] . Our present study was performed according to the Declaration of Helsinki. This sample set covered all types of repeats (4-to 9-repeat) in VNTR locus in each continent, based on the data of the CLEC4M neck-region variation in the HGDP-CEPH panel including 1064 individuals from 52 worldwide populations (our unpublished data).

The VNTR polymorphism of the neck-region was genotyped as described in Li et al [18] . The genotype was determined by separating the PCR products in 3% agarose gel with ethidium bromide staining. To validate the genotyping results, 10% of the samples were re-genotyped by duplicated genotyping experiments.

Clonal sequencing of VNTR in CLEC4M gene was performed by directly sequencing of cloned PCR products. First, the fragment of exon 4 in CLEC4M gene was amplified by the primers, F-CCCTAA GTCAGGAACAATCCGA, R-TCACAGGGGAG-GAAACTGAG. PCR was performed in a 50 ml volume with 50 ng genomic DNA as template, 5 ml PCR 106 buffer, 4 ml dNTP mix (2.5 mM), 2 ml primers (10 pM), 1.25 unit of Taq DNA polymerase (Takara) and 38 ml D.W water. Thermal cycling in a Gene Amp 9700 (Perkin Elmer) thermal cycler was performed at 95uC for 5 min, followed by 40 cycles at 95uC for 20 s, 59uC for 30 s, 72uC for 60 s and extension at 72uC for 5 min. The PCR products were purified on spin columns (Watson BioTechnologies Inc., Shanghai) according to manufacturer's protocol. Then, the purified PCR products were cloned into PMD 18-T Vector (Takara, Japan) and transferred into an ultracompetent cell (Takara, Japan). Then, plasmids carrying a PCR fragment were extracted and sequenced in both directions directly by primers, SF-AGGAACAATCCGAGCAAGACG and SR-AGAGACCA-TCTCAGGCCCAAG, with an ABI 3730 automatic sequencer. For each PCR product, at least 5 clones were chosen at random and sequenced in order to reduce artifactual error leading to single nucleotide variants and artificial recombination due to PCR. The sequencing results were processed by DNASTAR software (DNASTAR) and manual rectification.

As the VNTR is composed of a variable number of a basic subunit of 69 base pairs, we analyzed all the sequence variants within each of the subunit. Then, all sequence reads of the 69-bp subunit of VNTR were aligned using the Clustal W program [24] . We only observed 8 different sequence haplotypes (Figure 1 ). According to the sequence variation in the 69-bp fragment, all the subunits could be unique named as one of the 8 different haplotypes.

The clonal sequence of the 290 chromosomes of the worldwide population sample then called according to the subunit haplotype (H1 to H8). For example, the common 7-repeat VNTR allele is formed by one H1, three H2, one each of H3, H4, and H5 in the order of H1-H2-H2-H2-H3-H4-H5 ( Figure 2 and Table 1 ).

The genotype data of VNTR locus in CLEC4M gene were used to calculate the genetic distance between populations. First, the samples of the Human Genome Diversity Panel (HGDP)-CEPH panel were divided into 26 populations as used in the study of Barreiro et al [20] . Then, the population from northeastern Bantu of Kenya was defined as the Human Original region population. Genetic distances between populations (Fst) (the other 25 non-African populations and the defined original region's population) were estimated using Arlequin package [25] . Correlation analysis between the graphical distance and genetic population distance was carried out using Pearson bivariate correction analysis (SPSS for Windows; 13.0).

Genetic drift of human coronavirus OC43 spike gene during adaptive evolution OPEN,"Coronaviruses (CoVs) continuously threaten human health. However, to date, the evolutionary mechanisms that govern CoV strain persistence in human populations have not been fully understood. In this study, we characterized the evolution of the major antigen-spike (S) gene in the most prevalent human coronavirus (HCoV) OC43 using phylogenetic and phylodynamic analysis. Among the five known HCoV-OC43 genotypes (A to E), higher substitution rates and dN/dS values as well as more positive selection sites were detected in the S gene of genotype D, corresponding to the most dominant HCoV epidemic in recent years. Further analysis showed that the majority of substitutions were located in the S1 subunit. Among them, seven positive selection sites were chronologically traced in the temporal evolution routes of genotype D, and six were located around the critical sugar binding region in the N-terminal domain (NTD) of S protein, an important sugar binding domain of CoV. These findings suggest that the genetic drift of the S gene may play an important role in genotype persistence in human populations, providing insights into the mechanisms of HCoV-OC43 adaptive evolution.","CoVs have a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA genome, with a length of ~27-31 Kbs 1 . The spike (S) protein of CoVs protruding on the surface of virions is the major antigenic protein for inducing neutralizing antibodies. However, it is in turn under the highest selection pressure among the viral proteins 1, 8 . S proteins are often cleaved into S1 and S2 subunits to achieve receptor binding and membrane fusion, respectively 1 . The S1 subunit is composed of two distinct domains, the N-terminal domain (NTD) and the C-terminal domain (CTD), which play important roles in receptor binding 1 . The NTD is responsible for sugar receptor binding in some CoVs, such as BCoV and HCoV-OC43, or for protein receptor binding in murine hepatitis virus 1, [9] [10] [11] . The CTD functions as the protein receptor binding domains (RBD) for most of the CoVs 1 . The S1 subunits of all CoV genera have similar topological structure, preserved sugar-binding functions, but different receptors-binding functions, which suggest that subtly adaptive mutations occur in functional domains during evolution of CoVs 12, 13 . Similar adaptive amino acids mutations around the receptor-binding region have also been found in norovirus, contributing to its epidemic in humans 14 . Investigation on the evolutionary insights of the S gene, particularly the functional domains, is imperative for understanding the evolution of CoVs and for tracing spillover events and ecological niches.

HCoV-OC43 is the most prevalent CoV in humans and the relatively abundant number of clinical cases and corresponding epidemiological data make it a good model for HCoV adaption evolution 1, 5, 9, [15] [16] [17] . Although five genotypes (A to E) have been identified, genotype D has been the dominant OC43 genotype from 2004 to 2012 15, 17 . Previous studies by our group and others have demonstrated that recombination contributes to the generation of new OC43 genotypes 15, 17 , but little is known about how HCoV-OC43 genotypes persist in human populations. It is assumed that the continuous adaption of viral antigenic gene is required for the persistence of OC43 genotypes 18 . However, this hypothesis has not been carefully examined by precise evolutionary pattern analysis. In the present study, we characterized HCoV-OC43 evolution based on the phylodynamic and phylogenetic analysis of full-length S genes to provide insights into its transmission and the adaption.

Relative effective population sizes of OC43 genotypes. To verify the epidemic history of OC43 genotypes over the study period, the relative effective viral population size over time was inferred by analyzing the genetic diversity of the S gene using the Bayesian skyline model. Only the strains obtained from clinical samples containing the full length S, RdRp, and N genes retrieved from PubMed (http:// www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) and GenBank (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) for the years 2003 to 2012 were used (see Supplementary Table S1 on line). A varying population size profile was observed (Fig. 1) . The overall plot of OC43 (including genotypes B, C, D and E) showed two large bottlenecks. The first was found between 2006 and 2007, showing a decrease in relative genetic diversity in 2006, followed by an increase in 2007. The second was found between 2008 and 2009, with a transient decrease before 2008, followed by an increase in relative genetic diversity coinciding with a temporal epidemic in population size. Genotype B exhibited a transient increase in 2004, then followed a steady but slowly increased relative genetic diversity, corresponding to global increases in its detection 17 . Genotype D showed a decreased genetic diversity before 2007, then an increase after 2009, consistent with its dominant epidemic from 2007 to 2012 17 . Genotype C and E both exhibited a short and steady relative genetic diversity during the study period. The history of the relative genetic diversity obtained here corresponds to global epidemic data, indicating that the relative genetic diversity measured by the S gene generally reflects the HCoV-OC43 dynamic in population size. The relative genetic diversity of genotype D corresponded to the two bottlenecks of OC43, indicating that genotype D accounts for much of the genetic diversity of OC43 and is the predominant genotype.

Evolutionary rate of OC43 genotypes. To explore why genotype D became dominant after 2007, we calculated the evolutionary rate of OC43 genotypes. Using the constant population size under a relaxed-clock method, the mean evolutionary rate of the S gene was estimated to be 8.48 × 10 −4 substitutions/site/year for OC43, consistent with previous reports 8 . For genotypes B, C, D and E, the mean evolutionary rate of S gene was 9.85, 4.85, 8.83 and 6.01 × 10 −4 substitutions/site/year, respectively (Table 1) . Similar results were obtained using the exponential growth model ( Table 1) . The highest evolutionary rates were observed in genotype B and D, suggesting that the two genotypes evolved faster than others.

To determine whether positive selection took place during the evolution of OC43, the dN/dS values and positive selection amino acids (aa) were calculated. The mean dN/dS ratio was observed in genotype D (0.31), followed by genotypes B (0.29), C (0.20) and E (0.15) ( Table 2) . Calculations for positive selection sites with a probability (Pr) of > 0.5 in the S gene identified 25 residues in genotype D, six sites in genotype B, one in genotype C, but none in genotype E ( Table 2) . Seven positive selection sites with Pr of > 0.9 were identified in genotype D. Further analysis showed that 12 of 16 positive selection sites of genotype D and 3 of 5 genotype B in S1 were located at the NTD (aa 15-312, reference strain 5240/07 KF572844), while four positive selection sites in genotype D and one site in genotype B were found in the predicted RBD (aa 339-549, reference strain 5240/07 KF572844) 15 .

The relatively long epidemic time and more available sequences of genotype D allowed us to analyze in detail the nonsynonymous changes throughout the evolutionary history of OC43. The ancestral (Fig. 2) .

To confirm whether aa substitutions exist in NTD of other genotypes over time, the aa sequences of S from the 12 genotype B and 17 genotype C strains were also aligned. Eleven aa site mutations were observed in genotype B relating to the strain's isolated over time, and seven sites were located in NTD (see Supplementary Fig. S1 online) . No aa mutations were found in genotype C over time.

Our analysis on the global epidemic of OC43 in recent years showed the temporal transition of genotypes 17 . It is striking that the evolution of genotype D of OC43 is epochal among the four epidemic genotypes. First identified in 2004, it was generated by recombination 15 ; after a stasis period in 2005 and 2006, a dominant epidemic was found over a longer timescale. As no new recombinant events were detected in the subsequently identified genotype D strains 17 , the mutations of the S gene− the major antigenic gene, likely plays an important role in driving viral epidemics 18 .

It is interesting that the positive selection sites calculated in S gene from different isolates over time are corresponding to the genetic variability of genotypes in this study. Genotypes B and D, which have high genetic variability contained more selections sites than that of C and E genotypes. The possible link between the positive selection sites and the genetic variability of genotypes should be evaluated in the future studies. The evaluation of relative genetic diversity, substitution rate, dN/dS value, and positive selection sites further showed that genotype D had a significant influence on the relative genetic diversity of OC43 and that its S gene evolved towards heterogeneity. More positive selection sites were also found in the S1 subunit of genotype D. Amino acid substitutions in the surface proteins are considered an important adaption strategy for the persistence of a virus to evade host immune pressure 8, 18 . Although the neutralizing epitopes have not been identified, the substitutions identified in the S1 subunit of OC43 in this study are predicted to be in the antigenicity region (data not shown), which may allow viruses to escape host neutralizing antibodies [19] [20] [21] [22] . Collectively, these findings suggest that genetic drift may play an important role in maintaining the spread of genotype D in the human population. Whether the genetic variations affect the related antigenic phenotype will need to be confirmed by antigen analysis using S genes with such mutants.

Most of the positive selection sites in S1 subunit are mapped in NTD. Molecular clock tree of genotype D also showed that 6/7 of the predicted substitution were located in NTD. The aa substitutions in NTD seem to be a common evolutionary strategy for CoVs, as the high variability in NTD has also been observed in BCoV and HCoV-NL63 21, 22 . However, this observation warrants further investigation.

BCoV shares a high nucleotide and antigenic similarity with OC43 23 . The conserved sugar-binding sites identified in BCoV_NTD were also conserved in that of OC43 (see Supplementary Fig. S2 online) , indicating the conservation of the core motif in NTD during the species-cross transmission and evolution in human hosts. It is interesting to point out that the evolutionary dynamic pattern of the conserved core and variable outer-region in NTD is similar to that of RBD observed in ß-CoV, suggesting that these functional domains retain some of the ancient records during viral evolution 12 .

The sugar moieties near the CoV receptor are considered critical co-factors to CoV infection. Antigenic analysis has predicted that there are some epitopes in this domain. Whether the aa mutations around the functional region of NTD are relevant to subtle remodeling of the binding process or antigenic evolution, like that observed in norovirus and influenza virus need to be investigated further 20, 24, 25 .

The RBD of OC43 has been predicted 15 . We found that the positive selection sites in RBD are less than those present in NTD. Notably, a Y521H substitution was found in the genotype D strains identified from 2008 to 2011. The significance of this mutation is unclear. It has been reported that a single aa substitution in RBD can cause marked antigenic differences and enable the virus to escape host immunity in influenza virus and norovirus 24, 25 . Whether this single aa mutation can influence the host receptor binding activity needs to be investigated further. It is interesting that after 2012, the genotype D strains contained less mutations than those identified before 2012. The impact of these changes on the viral prevalence needs continuous surveillance of the OC43 genotypes in the future.

In summary, we report a model for the persistence of OC43 genotypes in human populations based on the first intensive evolutionary analysis of the S gene. We infer that the genetic drift of the S gene is likely to be one of the mechanisms of the adaptation evolution of HCoV-OC43. These findings provide insights into the evolution of CoVs and may have implications in the surveillance of HCoV infections.

Sequences and phylogenetic analysis. The full length sequences of OC43 S gene available in GenBank (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) were retrieved on 30 May 2013, and analyzed together with the sequences identified previously by our group 17 . A total of 96 full-length S gene sequences obtained from clinical samples were used for analysis. The sequences were aligned using Clustal W program implement in MEGA 5.1 26 . The genotypes of these sequences were determined as reported 15, 17 , including 12 genotype B, 18 genotype C, five genotype E and 61 genotype D. The background information of the sequences including accession numbers, collection dates, isolation areas, and genotypes can be found as Supplementary Table S1 online. Evolutionary analysis. The demographic histories and evolution rates of different OC43 genotypes were determined based on S gene sequence data by the Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (Bayesian MCMC) method implemented in BEAST (v1.8.1), using a relaxed molecular clock (uncorrelated lognormal-distributed model) 27 . The best substitution models were selected using Modeltest (version3.7) according to Akaike information criterion (AIC) 28 . The constant size and exponential growth tree models were used for the inference. Each Bayesian MCMC analysis was run for 100 million states and sampled every 2,000 states. Posterior probabilities were calculated using Tracer (version 1.5). The trees were annotated by the Tree Annotator program implemented in the BEAST package and the MCC tree was visualized using Figtree software (version 1.3.1). Bayesian skyline plots for OC43 genotypes were estimated to depict the relative viral genetic diversity over time.

To infer the positive selection sites of S gene at aa level, the deduced aa sequence entropy was determined using BioEdit (version 7.2.5) 29 . The ratios of nonsynonymous (dN) to synonymous (dS) substitution were estimated to evaluate the selection pressures on the OC43 S genes, using the codon-based phylogenetic method in CODEML (distributed in PAML, version 4) 30 . Posterior probabilities of the inferred positive selection sites were calculated using the Bayes empirical Bayes (BEB) approach which accounts for sampling errors 31 . The chronological evolution of dN changes throughout the evolutionary history of OC43 genotype D was traced using HyPhy software (version 2.2) and dN substitution was estimated using the maximum clade credibility (MCC) tree generated from Bayesian MCMC molecular clock analysis 27, 32 . The aa sites were positioned according to the HCoV-OC43_D 5240/07 (KF572844).

Domestication and the Behavior-Genetic Analysis of Captive Populations,"Ricker, J.P., Skoog, L.A. and Hirsch, J., 1987. Domestication and the behavior-genetic analysis of captive populations. Appl. Anita. Behav. Sci., Captive environments are believed to produce behavioral changes in animal populations that may limit our ability to generalize back to natural populations. These behavioral changes are thought to be associated with one or both of the following: (a) changes in frequencies of genes or gene complexes due to the effects of inbreeding or to changes in selection pressure; (b) changes in development of the phenotype due to the effects of changes in environmental variables. Inbreeding leads to increase in homozygosity, that may result in developmental anomalies because of a breakdown in developmental homeostasis. Changes in selection pressure may disrupt coadapted gene complexes that have evolved in the wild. Often, domestication is believed to result in individuals that are ""degenerate""; i.e. inferior to individuals in the wild. However, this notion has received no empirical support. In fact, if phenotype changes do occur under domestication, these are usually quantitative, not qualitative, in nature. We suggest that the study of the domestication process may reveal evolutionary principles that would be difficult to discover in other ways, and the zoological parks may be ideal situations for such research.","In their discussion of the advantages of the zoological park for behavioral research, Moran and Sorensen (1984) drew a distinction between two approaches to the study of behavior: ""One of the many ways to conceptualize the study of behavior is according to two sources of influence --organismic and environmental. Traditionally, ""ethological"" study of animal behavior has focused on the organism and ""psychological"" research has concerned itself primarily with influences in the animal's environment."" (p. 143).

That is, ethology has concerned itself with the study of ""species-typical"" adaptive (i.e. evolved) behavioral patterns, whereas psychology, even though research has usually been interpreted in terms of averages, has studied behavioral patterns that vary in expression among individuals. This variability has been assumed to be the result of differences in environments among individuals (and with little or no consideration of the possible adaptiveness of behavior). Therefore, psychology has studied the importance of environmental differences for phenotypic differences within species, and ethology has studied the importance of genotypic differences for phenotypic differences between species. This is because the former has usually been concerned with the development of behavior (usually learned behavior), whereas the latter has been concerned with its evolution (in the form of instinctive behavior).

With a re-emphasis on evolutionary thinking in psychology (e.g. Hinde and Stevenson-Hinde, 1973) , a more useful distinction between the ethological and psychological approaches may now be between the study of non-variable versus variable behavior. However, even this distinction may no longer be valid. Alcock (1979) discussed the importance of the study of behavioral variability in modern ethology, and contrasted this newer approach with that of the past:

""Historically, ethologists have devoted their attention to the description of species-specific behavior patterns as an essential first step in understanding the adaptive significance of behavior. They have had little enthusiasm for variation in behavior patterns, which only seemed to muddy the picture. As a result, animals that failed to exhibit the ""typical"" behavior of their species were either ignored or treated as deviants destined for early removal from the population by natural selection."" (pp. 224-225) . Barlow (1977) emphasized the variability to be found in what have usually been considered stereotyped patterns of behavior. This had been shown previously for geotaxis in Drosophila melanogaster by Hirsch and Erlenmeyer-Kimling (1961; see also Hirsch, 1963; Hirsch and McGuire, 1982) . The concept of evolutionarily stable strategy (Maynard Smith, 1976 ) requires that there be differences among individuals, as does the notion of dominance. Because ethologists have often selected the more invariable patterns of behavior to study, variability has often not been recognized. Therefore, the present rapprochement between ethology and psychology has been two-fold; involving a greater emphasis on the importance of behavioral variability in ethology and of evolution in psychology.

We suggest that the study of differences among individuals in ""speciestypical"" patterns of behavior is a productive approach in the study of both function and development. Because most of the research into genetics and behavior in psychology has not dealt with the behavioral patterns so important for ethology, a behavior--genetic analysis within a species (Hirsch, 1967) using such patterns would be a unique contribution. The importance of genetic analysis for ethology has been emphasized by Gould (1982) . Although we disagree with the role in development that he gives to genes, we agree with the following sentiment:

""Ethologists rarely mention genetics or use genetic techniques --a strangely illogical phenomenon since the logical extension of Lorenz's ""dissect the parts"" argument must lead to that ultimate unmoved [?] mover, the gene itself."" (p. 297).

Although ethology depends upon the concept of the gene for its approach to behavior study, the notion of ""genetic"" in ethology has usually been synonymous with ""evolved"". Yet these are two distinct notions and each must be studied with different techniques.

However, the genetic analysis of captive animals in zoos may be impractical in many (but not in all) instances, because such research involves techniques that may change the genetic structure of the population. The goals of a zoological park involve more than the scientific study of animal species and their behavior. Deliberate changes in the population gene pool might compromise these other goals. (One possible solution to this problem may be to take sub-lines from the original population, that one would then be able to manipulate. However, this may not be a practical solution in some cases.)

Genetic changes that are not deliberate (such as inbreeding and genetic drift) might result from the management and breeding practices in zoos, and may introduce some problems for behavioral research. Also, the captive environment may introduce changes in selection pressures that, over generations, may change the behavioral patterns expressed by individuals. In addition to such evolutionary changes, there is the possibility of changes in individuals of a given generation due to the interaction of the developing organism with the captive environment. We shall discuss the effects of captivity on behavior, using both theoretical arguments and actual examples. In doing this, some inaccurate beliefs about the effects of domestication will be exposed and we shall argue for the importance of research into the domestication process. The zoological park may be an ideal situation for such research. However, it should become clear that the effects of domestication on the behavioral phenotypes of individuals require one to outline clearly the goals of research in captive environments.

Population size is important because, according to theory in population genetics, small population sizes should result in increases in homozygosity (Falconer, 1981) . Because population sizes in captive environments are often small, we shall examine whether an increase in homozygosity may occur in actuality. We shall do this by considering electrophoretic studies and behavior-genetic analyses of both domesticated and natural populations.

Because genetics is a science of differences, a genetic analysis often requires phenotypic variability that is correlated with genetic variability.

However, techniques are now available that allow one to assay directly the products of structural (polypeptide-producing) genes, thereby making allelic differences unnecessary. An example of the latter analysis is gel electrophoresis, which can detect enzymes and non-enzymatic proteins through their mobility in a charged electrophoretic (gel) medium. Differences in mobility indicate the presence of at least one amino acid difference between proteins associated with the same locus. Lack of a difference in mobility, however, does not necessarily indicate an identity of amino acid sequence because the genetic code is redundant and only four of the 20 amino acids in organisms are charged electrically (Lewontin and Hubby, 1966; Powell, 1975; Selander, 1976) . Electrophoretic studies are useful in estimating three different parameters (Powell, 1975) : (a) the amount of genetic variability in a population; (b) the effects of geographic and temporal variation on genetic variation among populations; (c) the amount of genetic divergence between species. We shall be concerned only with the amount of genetic variability in a population, because we wish to examine the effects of small population size on this parameter.

Two statistics often used in electrophoretic studies are the mean heterozygosity for one locus (h) and across all loci (H) in a given individual in a population (Selander, 1976) . The former statistic is calculated, at each locus, as 1 minus the frequency of homozygotes; and the latter as the mean of all h's. It has been found that populations contain large amounts of genetic variability. On average, individuals are estimated to be heterozygous at 5-15% of their loci (Selander, 1976) , although some estimates are larger (Powell, 1975) .

The effects of the small population sizes often occurring in domesticated populations usually result in a decrease in the amounts of heterozygosity within populations. For example, in a study of mostly domesticated (laboratory-reared for 75--120 generations) populations of D. pseudoobscura, Lewontin and Hubby (1966) found less genetic variability than in natural populations, although much still remained:

""Most remarkable of all, is the widespread occurrence of segregation in strains that have been in the laboratory for as many as seven years ....

[The results give] the impression of an effect of inbreeding ....

[The recently-caught] strains segregate far more frequently than any of the others, and, in general, more of the genetic variation in the other populations is between homozygous strains."" (p. 599). ""We can assume that most of the variation from nature has been preserved in the laboratory stocks but has been converted to variation between strains by the inbreeding attendant on laboratory culture."" (p. 602).

Therefore, if the effective population sizes (Falconer, 1981) are small, inbreeding will occur and increases in homozygosity are expected. Because genetic analysis usually involves the effects of genetic differences on the phenotype, increases in homozygosity may make a behavior-genetic analysis more difficult (unless, of course, one wishes to compare inbred populations).

However, even very small populations that have undergone severe ""bottlenecks"" will not necessarily result in complete homozygosis, as is illustrated above and in studies by Ricker and Hirsch (1985a, b) . These latter studies describe long-term divergent selection for geotaxis in domesticated populations of D. melanogaster and the resulting evolutionary changes. After more than 600 generations (28 years) of intermittent selection pressure and the occurrence of bottlenecks in population size, the lines nevertheless responded to changes in selection pressure {indicating the presence of genetic variation). In fact, in the mid-1960's, even when a deliberate attempt was made to make these lines homozygous (through continued brother × sister mating), genetic variance remained.

The amount of inbreeding is important for behavioral research in general because it may have drastic effects on individual development. For example, Wright (1980) discussed his early research on inbreeding in guinea pigs and stated that the ""primary effect [of inbreeding] was a profound differentiation among the strains relative to their common foundation."" (p. 831). Decreases in the average fitness of inbred strains were inferred from developmental anomalies in behavior and morphology, as well as from increases in mortality rates. Rails et al. (1979) discussed the effects of inbreeding in captive populations of ungulates and found that, in the majority of species studied, inbred animals suffered higher juvenile mortality than non-inbred animals. (Lewin (1985) restates the commonly held misconception that any population becomes homozygous with 20 generations of sibling mating. Hirsch (1967, pp. 423--425) explains that the calculation involved applies to only one locus, whereas inbreeding to homozygosity across all loci in the genotype would probably require over 60 generations.)

The enormous changes that may result from the effects of small population size in nature are well illustrated in the following two studies. Using electrophoresis, O'Brien et al. {1983) studied the variability at 47 loci in 55 cheetahs, 50 of which were recently caught or first generation captivebred, and 5 of which were from zoos. No electrophoretic variants were found at any of the 47 loci even though 18 were ""polymorphic cluster genes"" (i.e. highly variant in several species). O'Brien et al. {1985) surveyed five additional enzymes in the cheetah and all 52 in four closely related species of felids. They found no variability in the cheetah and moderate to high variability in the other species. Cheetahs were found to be highly susceptible to a coronavirus; this disease being often fatal even though it had little effect on more genetically variable domestic cats and lions. Semen samples of 18 cheetahs were compared to those from domestic cats and it was found that spermatozoan concentrations were 10 times less in cheetahs. Morphological abnormalities were found in 71% of cheetah and 29% of cat spermatozoa. O'Brien et al. (1985} concluded that ""the catastrophic sensitivity of this genetically uniform species does provide a graphic natural example of the protection afforded to biological species by genetic variability."" (p. 1434).

From these examples, it becomes apparent that genetic variability may have a role in Darwinian fitness. The mechanisms of this relationship have not been subjected to detailed analysis, but some hypotheses have been formulated.

Lerner {1970) discussed the effects of inbreeding on the development of domesticated animals. From many sources of evidence, Lerner proposed the concept of genetic homeostasis --defined as ""the property of the population to equilibrate its genetic composition and to resist sudden changes"" (p. 2) -and hypothesized that its mechanism is the ""superiority with respect to fitness of the heterozygous over the homozygous genotypes"" (p. 6). This superiority is manifested in an increased developmental homeostasis expressed by the more heterozygous individuals. Developmental homeostasis is defined as the self-regulation of the developing individual ""leading to a uniformity of phenotypic expression in individuals of a given population, in spite of the genetic variability between them "" (p. 6); i.e. the development of the so-called ""wild-type"" phenotype.

Mayr {1975) infers from these ideas that genes increasing fitness are brought together during evolution into ""complexes"" on chromosomes. These co-adapted gene complexes (Dobzhansky, 1970 ) allow for greater fitness because genes that ""work well together"" during ontogeny will be more likely to be inherited as a unit:

""the interaction of macromolecules at the cellular level produces individual phenotypes of different fitness, and natural selection will therefore tend to hold together those alleles at different loci that produce individuals of the greatest selective value."" (p. 380).

Such complexes may exist along with large amounts of genetic variability (Mayr, 1970) . Therefore, they may allow the development of phenotypes with little inter-individual variability in the presence of large amounts of genetic variation. These ideas are very similar to those developed by Sewall Wright in his ""shifting balance"" theory of evolutionary change (see Wright, 1980 , for a summary). Although such ideas are potentially of great importance, little research has been done to substantiate them. Yet, it appears very likely that some minimum amount of heterozygosity is important for the ""proper"" development of an individual. To the extent that this is true, the effects of small population size in captivity will influence the results of research.

We have been discussing the effects of small population sizes on the amount of genetic variability, and the possible importance of heterozygosity for individual development. The genetic systems that are the result of millions of years of evolution may become changed in captivity, not only through inbreeding but also through two other types of change: {a) the mating of organisms whose parents were from populations separated geographically (allopatric); (b) the possible changes in selective pressures that accompany the transfer of animals into captive environments. Furthermore, the behavior expressed may be altered not only because of changes in frequencies of genes and gene complexes, but also because of changes in environmental conditions important for the production of species-typical behavioral patterns. Both types of change will be discussed in the next section.

As discussed above, under natural selection, a behavioral pattern may evolve to such an extent that little inter-individual variability in development is observed. The evolution of the population with respect to the development of such a trait is associated with changes in a unique gene pool and set of environments. The environment has an effect of two types: (1) on evolution through its selective pressures for behavior; (2) on development through its interaction with the developing organism. A population evolves within particular environmental situations which have exerted selective pressures upon individuals and, at the same time, have affected the development of these same individuals through reciprocal (and extremely complex) interactions with the genotype. These two effects of the environment are not mutually exclusive because the developmental process evolves as well (for further discussion see Hogben, 1939; Schmalhausen, 1949; Lehrman, 1953; Spurway, 1955; Dobzhansky, 1970; Waddington, 1975; Oyama, 1982) .

Domestication of a population is a process involving the removal of organisms fxom nature to a captive environment in which their breeding and care are controlled by man. Price (1984) has defined domestication as ""that process by which a population of animals becomes adapted to man and to the captive environment by some combination of genetic changes occurring over generations and environmentally induced developmental events recurring during each generation."" (p. 3).

Changes in natural selection because of a move to captivity may result in changes in behavior. The changes incurred may be small if the animals are ""pre-adapted"" for domestication; i.e. if they have a constellation of behavioral characteristics that are not disrupted by human control of living space, breeding, feeding, social environment, etc. (Hale, 1969) . Usually, this will require that there be many physical similarities between the captive and natural environments. Price (1984) states that, although this may be true in many cases, it is not true necessarily:

""The degree to which a wild population of animals is preadapted for domestication largely depends on the degree of developmental plasticity of the species and the extent to which the captive environment allows for the development and expression of species-typical behavioral patterns."" {p. 7).

If individuals in a population are not very sensitive to changes in their environment (i.e. if they show developmental homeostasis), the move to a captive environment may result in few changes in behavior. However, Price notes that if there are few pre-adaptations, there will be strong selective pressures on the individuals ""in terms of (1) the number of traits affected, (2) the direction of selection, and (3} the intensity.., of selection"" (p. 7).

Phenotypic changes brought about by a move to a captive environment have been supposed by some to result in degeneration. For example, Spurway {1955) asserted:

""In all human cultures breeds are named after places from which they are supposed to have been brought. Such transplantation removes the ecotype from the habitat to which it has evolved an adapted developmental homoeostasis, 'degeneration' occurs, and artificial selection becomes necessary if breed characters are to be preserved."" (p. 340).

By breeding a group of animals in an environment different from the one in which their ancestors had evolved, one might expect changes in development because environmental factors important for development of the ""normal"" phenotype may have been altered or lost. Spurway states that such changes in captivity are ubiquitous and result in a large amount of quantitative variation among individuals:

""Zoo-keepers consider that high variation reveals 'bad' culture conditions and conversely .... In a changed environment fewer genotypes are completely developmentally homoeostatic than in the environment for which this property was evolved, and this homoeostasis may break down completely .... This implies that the phenotypic variation observed in captivity is... highly correlated with genotypic differences."" {pp. 334-335).

A species-typical behavioral pattern is one for which genotypic differences have little correlation with phenotypic differences {because there is little phenotypic variation). However, a move to a captive environment may disrupt developmental homeostasis. This might result in genotypic differences becoming expressed phenotypically. Obviously, this would limit the ability to generalize research back to nature.

In addition to a breakdown in developmental homeostasis due to inbreeding and changes in the environment, crosses between individuals from populations separated geographically (and, therefore, possibly subjected to differing selection pressures in their evolutionary histories} may result in a similar breakdown (see Dobzhansky (1970) for a summary of such work with D. pseudoobscura). Spurway {1955) used Lerner's term ""phenodeviants ..... grossly deformed phenotypes [that] often segregate in cultures"" (p. 336) --and extended its use to such hybrids: ""These products of inadequate developmental homoeostasis.., are called examples of hybrid inviability and hybrid breakdown, and interpreted as evidence that the parent populations had diverged genetically."" (p. 337).

However, one might expect that less severe anomalies in behavior and morphology might be common in the progeny of crosses between animals of different geographic origin. These less severe breakdowns in development may limit the generalizability of behavioral research in captivity. That is, breeding in captivity may require a balance between inbreeding and outbreeding if one wishes to generalize back to nature.

There is evidence that, in nature, animals tend to avoid close inbreeding. A feral population of Camargue horses showed less inbreeding than would have been expected under random mating (Duncan et al., 1984) . Natural habitat studies also report inbreeding avoidance (Koenig and Pitelka, 1979; Packer, 1979) . See Bateson (1978 Bateson ( , 1979 for a discussion of behavioral mechanisms in nature that may have evolved to achieve a balance between inbreeding and outbreeding.

So far, we have discussed concepts and theory concerning the domestication process. In this last section, we shall briefly discuss some examples of behavioral changes in captivity and some hypotheses regarding these changes.

Lorenz asserted that the domestication process in man and other animals results in ""domestication-induced degeneracy"" (Lorenz, 1940 , translated in Eisenberg, 1972 ). This viewpoint is made explicit in Lorenz's title .... Domestication -caused Disturbances in Species-specific Behavior"" (translated in Kalikow, 1978, p. 176 ) --and elaborated in the text of his article published in Germany under the Nazi regime. The notion that domestication results in degeneracy was once common among ethologists, yet it was unsubstantiated. Boice (1973) stated: ""This notion, contrasted with that of adaptiveness, does not lend itself to objectivity but its rationale is well founded in two beliefs: Wild creatures are hardier and wilier, and man's selfish goals in domesticating an animal will necessarily produce its degrading and disfiguring .... The belief that mental deterioration accompanies domestication seems so commonsensical that contemporary articles.., assert the intellectual idiocy, vegetalization, and degeneracy of domestic rodents although no published data support their claims."" (p. 218). Assumptions about degeneracy are not usually subjected to thorough investigation. When subjected to more detailed analysis, it is often observed that the effects of domestication are not nearly as drastic or as ubiquitous as some have suggested.

The frequency of performance of behavioral patterns sometimes changes in captivity although the patterns themselves do not. Thus, certain aspects of sexual behavior may increase in frequency in captive individuals (Hale, 1969) . For example, in domestic dogs, estrous cycles occur about every 6 months and in all seasons, whereas in wolves (the presumed ancestors of dogs}, these occur only once a year and only during winter. In addition, dogs show greater promiscuity than wolves (Price, 1984, and references therein}. Scott (1969) suggested that these behavioral changes are the result of evolution because hypersexuality may increase the reproductive success of captive individuals (and, therefore, be selected for naturally). However, Price postulated that hypersexuality in dogs may be the result of ""constant exposure to a sexually stimulating environment"" (p. 21) and, therefore, may be developmental in origin. Because they are not mutually exclusive, both hypotheses may be correct.

Lockard (1968} asserted that learning ability in domestic (laboratory) rats is inferior to that of wild rats. Boice (1973) opposed that conclusion:

""most writers on rat domestication have favored the notion that wild rats are more intelligent than domestics. Lockard (1968) promotes two misconceptions in this regard. First, he argues that learning, as a collection of processes, almost necessarily degenerates in domestication, and second, he implies that degeneration in learning has 'been found in a wide variety of learning situations'."" (p. 225}.

Boice argued that this belief, held by many psychologists, is without substance because experimental evidence usually indicates the opposite: domestic rats perform better than wild rats in most learning tasks. However, this difference may be due to the wild rat becoming relatively more ""disturbed"" in the experimental situation. Yet, even ""when performance problems are minimized, the learning rate of wild and domestic rats may be more similar than.., expected"" under an hypothesis of degeneracy (p. 225). That is, there is little evidence that domestication results in a decrease in learning ability. Boreman and Price (1972) studied dominance hierarchies in domestic and wild Norway rats and in their F 1 progeny. They observed two types of social interaction in obtaining their measure of dominance: {1} spontaneous interaction was defined as social behavior not involving competition for a ""tangible commodity"" (water, food, nest-box, etc.}; (2} competitive interaction was defined as social behavior involving competition for such commodities. It was found that ""Domestic rats were most dominant in both spontaneous and competitive cross-strain interactions. Assuming that a positive correlation exists between aggressive potential and dominance.., this does not support the hypothesis.., that the laboratory rat is more 'docile' and less aggressive than its wild ancestors."" (p. 540).

However, it may not be correct to assume that there is a non-zero correlation between rank in the dominance hierarchy and the amount of aggressiveness:

""The fact that all subjects were placed in the experimental room at the same time could have inhibited any expression of the territorial behavior. This same stock of wild rats was found to be extremely aggressive toward domestic rats when the latter were introduced into an area familiar to the former.., whereas 'established' domestic rats showed little or no aggression toward intruders."" (p. 541).

This latter observation suggests that an evolutionary change may have occurred in the domestic rat. In the crowded conditions in which domestic rats are usually kept, a social organization based on a dominance hierarchy may have evolved, whereas in nature, an organization based on territoriality may result in greater reproductive success on average.

The discussion in the preceding section suggests that large changes in behavior are not to be expected in captivity a priori. Price (1984) concluded that most changes in captivity are the result of quantitative changes in thresholds for performing the patterns and not qualitative changes in the patterns themselves. However, this conclusion should not be accepted too readily. There is a paucity of detailed studies on the domestication process and little interest among behavioral scientists in performing such studies. This attitude is surprising, because captive animals are often used in behavioral research. This is one area where the study of animals in zoological parks may result in important contributions.

It should be kept in mind that the captive environment is not a degenerate version of the natural environment and that, depending upon the goals of the research, the study of behavior in captive environments is legitimate even if captivity has resulted in behavioral change. Similarly, the population that has evolved (become domesticated} in a captive environment is not a degenerate version of the ancestral population; but it is different. Boice (1973) argued: ""Domestic animals show morphological and behavioral adaptations to the particular demands of their unnatural environment .... It is illogical to judge the domestic animal as unfit or degenerate because he is not adapted to live in a wild environment."" (p. 226).

Therefore, it is no more or no less legitimate to study behavior in either captive or wild animals. However, it is important to state the goals of research clearly beforehand. If one wishes to study behavioral patterns occurring in nature, the use of captive animals is not justified unless one determines whether captivity has resulted in changes. If it has, then these must be taken into account. It may turn out that the study of changes associated with the domestication process may reveal principles that have much relevance for evolutionary processes in nature. Therefore, it may behoove researchers in zoological parks to study the effects of domestication in captivity in addition to the study of behavioral patterns as they occur in the wild.

Fecal Viral Diversity of Captive and Wild Tasmanian Devils Characterized Using Virion-Enriched Metagenomics and Metatranscriptomics GENETIC DIVERSITY AND EVOLUTION crossm,"The Tasmanian devil is an endangered carnivorous marsupial threatened by devil facial tumor disease (DFTD). While research on DFTD has been extensive, little is known about viruses in devils and whether any are of potential conservation relevance for this endangered species. Using both metagenomics based on virion enrichment and sequence-independent amplification (virion-enriched metagenomics) and metatranscriptomics based on bulk RNA sequencing, we characterized and compared the fecal viromes of captive and wild devils. A total of 54 fecal samples collected from two captive and four wild populations were processed for virome characterization using both approaches. In total, 24 novel marsupial-related viruses, comprising a sapelovirus, astroviruses, rotaviruses, picobirnaviruses, parvoviruses, papillomaviruses, polyomaviruses, and a gammaherpesvirus, were identified, as well as known mammalian pathogens such as rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus 2. Captive devils showed significantly lower viral diversity than wild devils. Comparison of the two virus discovery approaches revealed substantial differences in the number and types of viruses detected, with metatranscriptomics better suited for RNA viruses and virion-enriched metagenomics largely identifying more DNA viruses. Thus, the viral communities revealed by virion-enriched metagenomics and metatranscriptomics were not interchangeable and neither approach was able to detect all viruses present. An integrated approach using both virion-enriched metagenomics and metatranscriptomics constitutes a powerful tool for obtaining a complete overview of both the taxonomic and functional profiles of viral communities within a sample. IMPORTANCE The Tasmanian devil is an iconic Australian marsupial that has suffered an 80% population decline due to a contagious cancer, devil facial tumor disease, along with other threats. Until now, viral discovery in this species has been confined to one gammaherpesvirus (dasyurid herpesvirus 2 [DaHV-2]), for which captivity was identified as a significant risk factor. Our discovery of 24 novel marsupial-associated RNA and DNA viruses, and that viral diversity is lower in captive than in wild devils, has greatly expanded our knowledge of gut-associated viruses in devils and provides important baseline information that will contribute to the conservation and captive management of this endangered species. Our results also revealed that a combination of virion-enriched metagenomics and metatranscriptomics may be a more comprehensive approach for virome characterization than either method alone. Our results thus provide a springboard for continuous improvements in the way we study complex viral communities.","from 14.69 to 60.02%, while the proportions of reads mapped to nonviral components were 17 to 49.46% for Bacteria, 0.17 to 2.42% for Eukarya, 1.29 to 18.67% for the host, and less than 0.01% for Archaea (Fig. 2a) . For both approaches, a substantial proportion of reads had no significant similarity to other sequences in the databases in GenBank (10.22 to 29.20%). Overall, virion-enriched metagenomics and metatranscriptomics differed in the viruses detected as well as the expected counts (transcript abundance) as measured by RSEM analysis (Fig. 2c and d) . Viruses from a wide range of viral groups were detected with metatranscriptomics, of which 49.87 to 97.51% had the closest hits to RNA viruses and 2.49 to 50.13% to DNA viruses. Conversely, for virion-enriched metagenomics, Ͼ95.54% of the virus-related sequences had the closest hits to DNA viruses, and Ͻ5% were identified as RNA viruses (Fig. 2b) . Metatranscriptomics revealed high levels of viral diversity across all libraries, the most abundant viral groups detected being Caudovirales, Luteo-Sobemo, Narna-Levi, Partiti-Picobirna, Picorna-Calici, and Tombus-Noda (Fig. 2c) . Conversely, virionenriched metagenomics revealed relatively lower viral diversity across the same libraries; Caudovirales dominated the viral reads (69.89 to 99.49%), while viral groups identified at much lower abundances included Microviridae, Circoviridae, Genomoviridae, Parvoviridae, Herpesviridae, Polyomaviridae, and Papillomaviridae (Fig. 2c) .

Vertebrate viruses detected by metatranscriptomics comprised 0 to 9.41% of the total viral reads. A large proportion of the viral reads belonged to either nonvertebrate eukaryotic viruses (45.08 to 97.51%), including plant viruses, insect viruses, and mycoviruses, or bacteriophage (2.48 to 48.91%) from the families Siphoviridae, Podoviridae, Myoviridae, and Microviridae. In the virion-enriched metagenomics data set, the percentage of vertebrate virus reads was also small (0.04 to 0.84%), while bacteriophage and other eukaryotic virus reads ranged between 79.17 and 99.91% and between 0.04 and 19.99%, respectively. Detailed information on all vertebrate viruses identified is presented in Table S1 in the supplemental material. (22) . RHDV is used as a biocontrol for rabbits in Australia and causes fatal hepatitis in European rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) and some hare species (22) . Using metatranscriptomics, we detected genomes with high nucleotide and amino acid similarity (Ͼ98%) to RHDV in one of the wild devil metatranscriptomic libraries (Buckbys Road [BR]), with genome coverage of 98.1%. Phylogenetic analysis based on the nucleotide sequences of the major capsid and nonstructural protein genes revealed that the RHDV detected in this study clustered with RHDV variant GI.2 (also called RHDV2) ( Fig. 3a and b) , which was first detected in Australia in May 2015 and has since become the dominant circulating variant nationwide. RHDVspecific reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) and sequencing confirmed the presence of RHDV2 in four of the nine devil fecal samples from the BR metatranscriptomics pool. In addition, no rabbit-associated genes were detected during the initial sequence analysis. Additional PCR targeting a short fragment of rabbit mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) (Ͻ300 bp) also did not detect any rabbit DNA in the original fecal samples from BR. Further RT-PCR and sequencing performed on the fecal RNA extractions from the remaining pools confirmed the presence of RHDV in 1 of 10 devils from wukalina/Mt William National Park (wMW), two of nine devils from zoo A, and one of nine from zoo B. One of the four additional RHDV-positive samples, from zoo A, contained rabbit mtDNA as confirmed by PCR.

We also identified the complete viral genome (28, (23) . Based on the phylogenetic analysis of the spike protein amino acid sequence (4,762 amino acids [aa]), clustering of the novel torovirus variant with other toroviruses isolated from cattle in the United States, Japan, and Europe tentatively suggested a bovine origin, although this will need to be confirmed with wider sampling (Fig. 3c) .

Detection and characterization of novel marsupial-associated viruses. (i) Picornaviruses. The complete genome (8,015 bp) of a novel virus in Picornaviridae was identified in one metatranscriptomic library (wMW). According to the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV), members of a Picornavirus genus should share at least 40% amino acid sequence identity in the polyprotein region (23) . The encoded 2,396-aa polyprotein of the virus detected in this study exhibited 45.5% amino acid similarity to simian sapelovirus, placing it in the genus Sapelovirus. We have provisionally named this newly identified virus Tasmanian devil-associated sapelovirus. Phylogenetic analysis based on the amino acid sequence of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) domain showed that Tasmanian devil-associated sapelovirus formed a sister lineage to sapeloviruses identified from eutherian mammals (i.e., porcine and simian sapeloviruses) (Fig. 4a) .

(ii) Astroviruses. Astrovirus-related sequences were detected in five of the six metatranscriptomic libraries. We identified one complete and one near-complete genome sequence with 81.4% pairwise nucleotide identity, involving two separate variants of a single astrovirus species, tentatively named Tasmanian devil-associated astrovirus 1 (24) . The novel astrovirus identified here has a genome structure typical of other astroviruses, with three putative open reading frames (ORF 1a, ORF 1b, and ORF 2) encoding the protease, RdRp, and capsid, respectively. In addition, we found a ribosomal frameshift motif (AAAAAAC) within the ORF 1a/1b overlap region. Phylogenetic analysis based on the conserved RdRp domain showed that Tasmanian devilassociated astrovirus 1 formed a distinct cluster that is more closely related to astroviruses of mammalian hosts (mamastroviruses) than those of avian hosts (avastroviruses) (Fig. 4b) .

(iii) Rotaviruses. Rotavirus sequences were identified in three metatranscriptomic libraries (Stony Head [SH], BR, and wMW). Among them, we identified two segments (3,481 bp and 3,479 bp) encoding rotavirus VP1 (i.e., RdRp). The two RdRp sequences shared Ͼ90% nucleotide identity with each other, indicative of two different variants from the same species. In addition, a contig encoding a partial rotavirus VP1 of 282 aa sharing 51% sequence similarity with rotavirus H was also detected in one library (wMW). We named the two viruses Tasmanian devil-associated rotavirus 1 and Tasmanian devil-associated rotavirus 2. The VP1 of Tasmanian devil-associated rotavirus 1 shared the highest amino acid similarity, ϳ51%, with rotavirus G, while Tasmanian devil-associated rotavirus 2 shared the highest amino acid similarity, 44%, with rotavirus H. Phylogenetic analysis with other rotavirus species based on VP1 suggested that the two Tasmanian devil-associated rotaviruses form a distinct cluster most closely related to rotaviruses from avian and mammalian hosts (Fig. 4c) .

(iv) Picobirnaviruses. We detected picobirnavirus sequences that encoded complete and partial viral RdRp (330 to 557 aa) in all four of the six metatranscriptomics libraries from wild devils. However, the picobirnavirus sequences detected in one library (Maria Island [MI]) were too short to be phylogenetically informative and were discarded in the phylogenetic analysis. The novel picobirnaviruses detected in this study are provisionally named Tasmanian devil-associated picobirnaviruses 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, with two separate variants in Tasmanian devil-associated picobirnaviruses 1 and 5. Phylogenetic analysis based on the RdRp domain of these novel picobirnaviruses showed that they are highly diverse and widely distributed across the phylogeny of this family (Fig. 4d) .

(v) Parvoviruses. We identified eight new members of the vertebrate-associated subfamily Parvovirinae, including two from the genus Bocaparvovirus and six from the recently determined genus Chapparvovirus. We recovered partial and near-complete protein sequences sharing ϳ50% identity to California sea lion bocavirus and porcine bocavirus, respectively. Two bocavirus-related sequences detected in this study shared Ͼ97% amino acid sequence similarity, indicating two separate variants of the same species, provisionally named Tasmanian devil-associated bocavirus 1. A third bocavirusrelated sequence was also identified in virion-enriched metagenomics library BR, sharing 71.13% amino acid similarity with Tasmanian devil-associated bocavirus 1 and provisionally named Tasmanian devil-associated bocavirus 2. The six new chapparvoviruses identified in this study have been provisionally named Tasmanian devilassociated chapparvoviruses 1 to 6, which shared less than 70% amino acid identity among themselves. Phylogenetic analysis with representative viruses from the Parvoviridae family confirmed the clustering of the Tasmanian devil-associated bocaviruses within the diversity of mammalian bocaviruses, although the branching order involving them and other bocaviruses remains unresolved. The chapparvoviruses identified in this study clustered closely with other chapparvoviruses, including a recently described parvovirus associated with kidney diseases in mice (25) (Fig. 5a ).

(vi) Papillomaviruses. Fragmented genomes of two novel species of papillomavirus were identified in one virion-enriched metagenomics library (MI), among which we retrieved two longer fragments (1,225 and 1,335 bp), both of which encode partial E1 protein, an ATP-dependent DNA helicase required for viral replication (26) . The fragments share 64% similarity, suggesting two distinct papillomavirus species, tentatively named Tasmanian devil-associated papillomaviruses 1 and 2. Phylogenetic analysis based on the E1 protein showed that they form a distinct cluster with Bettongia penicillata papillomavirus type 1 (BpPV1) isolated from the woylie, a small marsupial species ( Fig. 5b and Fig. S3 ). While the marsupial papillomaviruses viruses are clustered together in the phylogenetic tree, their relationship with viruses identified from eutherian mammals remains unresolved.

(vii) Polyomaviruses. Two novel polyomaviruses were detected in three virionenriched metagenomics libraries (MI, wMW, and zoo B). We recovered the complete circular genome of 4,894 bp of the tentatively named Tasmanian devil-associated polyomavirus 1 and a partial gene sequence (2,251 bp) of the large T antigen (LTAg) protein for the second polyoma-like virus, tentatively named Tasmanian devilassociated polyoma-like virus 2 (Fig. 5c ). Phylogenetic analyses revealed strikingly different evolutionary histories for the structural and nonstructural parts of the genome ( Fig. 5c and Fig. S4 and S5), indicative of recombination (27) . In the LTAg phylogeny, Tasmanian devil-associated polyomavirus 1 and Tasmanian devil-associated polyomalike virus 2 formed a distinct lineage with another marsupial virus, bandicoot papillomatosis carcinomatosis virus type 2 (BPCV-2), which, in turn, clustered with polyomaviruses of avian hosts ( Fig. 5c and Fig. S5 ). In contrast, in the VP1 phylogeny (Fig. S4 ), the marsupial virus showed no close relationship with the avian viruses. Interestingly, the bandicoot papillomatosis carcinomatosis viruses (BPCV-1 and -2) showed a close relationship to Tasmanian devil-associated polyomavirus 1 only in the LTAg region and not the VP1 region.

(viii) Herpesviruses. In one captive virion-enriched metagenomics library (zoo A), we identified 70 contigs matching different regions of a novel herpesvirus genome, provisionally named dasyurid herpesvirus 3 (DaHV-3), which totaled 62,821 bp in length and included partial gene sequences of the DNA polymerase (575 aa), major DNA binding protein (465 aa), helicase (396 aa), glycoproteins M (378 aa) and H (427 aa), and major capsid protein (358 aa), among others. On phylogenetic analysis based on these nonstructural and structural proteins, DaHV-3 clustered with other gammaherpesviruses (Gammaherpesvirinae) (Fig. S1 and S2 ). Further phylogenetic analysis based on the DNA polymerase showed that DaHV-3 forms a distinct lineage most closely related to bovine gammaherpesvirus 6 and ovine gammaherpesvirus 2 (Fig. 5d) . The previously characterized dasyurid herpesvirus 2 (DaHV-2) isolated from devils (12) could not be included in the phylogenetic analysis because no sequences were available from the same genomic regions. A BLASTx search of the DNA polymerase showed that DaHV-3 exhibited the greatest amino acid similarity (93.3%) with macropodid herpesvirus 3 (MaHV-3) isolated previously from an Eastern gray Kangaroo (12), whose DNA poly- merase amino acid sequence was also too short (Ͻ50% of the other representative herpesviruses) to be included in the phylogenetic analysis.

(ix) Circoviruses. We identified circovirus-related sequences and recovered the partial replicase gene sequences (899 bp) in one of the wild devil virion-enriched metagenomes (SH) and tentatively named it Tasmanian devil-associated circovirus. Phylogenetic analysis based on the Rep proteins with representative strains in the Circovirus genus suggested that Tasmanian devil-associated circovirus is clustered with circoviruses previously isolated from bats and pigs, sharing the highest sequence identity (62%) with a bat circovirus (GenBank accession number AIF76281) (Fig. 5e) .

Other viruses: plant and insect viruses and bacteriophage. In both the virionenriched metagenomics and metatranscriptomics analyses, large proportions of viral reads could be attributed to viruses that infect plants, insects, and bacteria, indicating ingestion of arthropods and/or environmental contamination of feces. Bacteriophage sequences from Caudovirales were detected in all libraries, comprising Ͼ90% of all virion-enriched metagenomic viral reads and up to 48.91% of the metatranscriptomic viral reads. Sequences related to newly identified arthropod viruses, such as Wuhan fly virus and Wuhan mosquito virus, were also detected. Most of the insect viruses detected belong to the Bunyavirales, the Mononegavirales, and the Chuviridae, as well as the DNA virus subfamily Densovirinae (Parvoviridae). Sequences related to plant and fungal viruses were observed in all libraries, including sobemoviruses, tombusviruses, and mitoviruses.

Comparison between devil populations. Within-library viral diversity as characterized by our metatranscriptomics approach was significantly different between captive and wild populations (P Ͻ 0.05). In general, captive populations had lower diversity in their fecal viromes than wild populations.

Metatranscriptomics analysis of MI devils displayed a level of overall viral diversity similar to those of both captive populations (zoo A and zoo B) and lower than that found in the other wild populations (Fig. 6a) . Conversely, alpha diversity determined from virion-enriched metagenomics data did not differ significantly between libraries (Fig. 6b) . Cluster analysis indicated that in metatranscriptomics, the wild and captive devils fell into two distinct clusters, while in virion-enriched metagenomics, BR formed its own cluster and the remaining populations formed a second cluster (Fig. 6 ).

Both virion-enriched metagenomics and metatranscriptomics identified a wide diversity of viruses in the feces of Tasmanian devils, including vertebrate viruses, bacteriophages, and other eukaryotic viruses. Overall, we detected sequences related to 26 vertebrate viruses, including 24 novel marsupial-related viruses, including a sapelovirus, an astrovirus, rotaviruses, picobirnaviruses, bocaviruses, chapparvoviruses, papillomaviruses, polyomaviruses, and a gammaherpesvirus, as well as two known mammalian viruses, RHDV2 and torovirus.

However, there were also marked differences between the virion-enriched metagenomics and metatranscriptomics approaches. In general, virion-enriched metagenomics largely detected DNA viruses, while metatranscriptomics detected both DNA and RNA viruses, although the DNA viruses detected were limited to those with relatively high abundance (Fig. 2d) . A high abundance level is often indicative of an active viral infection, during which DNA viruses are transcribed into RNA intermediates detected readily by RNA sequencing (28) . Conversely, RNA viruses identified in metatranscrip- tomics were rarely detected in virion-enriched metagenomics, even if they were highly abundant based on the RSEM estimated counts. The use of virion enrichment and sequence-independent amplification in our metagenomics approach increased the number of viral reads in each library. However, the viral compositions of all six virion-enriched metagenomes were highly skewed toward DNA viruses, particularly bacteriophage from the order Caudovirales. Similarly, in a previous study comparing various enrichment methods, bacteriophage accounted for Ͼ80% of all reads in all of the enrichment methods tested but Ͻ5% when no enrichment steps were incorporated (29) . Despite being able to substantially increase the total number of viral reads in the metagenomes, sequence-independent amplification is bias prone, resulting in fewer viruses detected and lower genome coverage due to preferential amplification of certain sequences (30) (31) (32) . However, the overrepresentation of bacteriophage here may partly be attributed to the fact that they make up the bulk of the gut virobiota, which is dominated by bacteria (33, 34) . Regardless of its known bias (29, 30) , virion-enriched metagenomics still holds merit for use in virome characterization due to its ability to identify low-abundance DNA viruses, which is especially relevant for dormant or nonactive viruses.

In contrast to virion-enriched metagenomics, metatranscriptomics is nonvirus specific and reveals the entire transcriptome within a sample (20, 35) . Since there is no virion enrichment and less sample processing, the likelihood of biased detection is plausibly reduced in metatranscriptomics. In this study, the proportion of viral reads sequenced by metatranscriptomics was Ͻ2% per library, but the numbers of viral groups detected were significantly higher than those detected in virion-enriched metagenomics, which included both RNA and DNA viruses. Importantly, then, our results show that the taxonomic compositions of viral communities as revealed by virion-enriched metagenomics and metatranscriptomics were not interchangeable and neither approach was able to detect all viruses present. However, these two approaches were complementary, and an integrated approach using both virion-enriched metagenomics and metatranscriptomics will be a powerful tool for obtaining a complete overview of both the taxonomic and functional profiles of viral communities in a sample.

Ecological analysis of virome composition and diversity revealed significant differences between captive and wild devil populations, especially using metatranscriptomics. Both captive populations displayed lower levels of viral diversity than the wild populations. This loss of diversity is consistent with changes previously observed in the gut bacteriome, where captive devils also exhibited lower bacterial diversity compared to wild devils (11) . Changes in lifestyle and diet that occur in captivity likely impact the virome, which is similarly dynamic. Interestingly, Maria Island devils had viromes more similar to those of the captive populations. Maria Island, a 115-km 2 island off the east coast of Tasmania (Fig. 1) , is home to approximately 100 free-ranging devils. Two factors may have contributed to the lower viral diversity observed on Maria Island. First, due to its isolation from mainland Tasmania, animal movements or immigrations are limited to only marine or bird species, and nonendemic species diversity is lower. Thus, there may be limited introduction of viruses to the island. Second, captive-born devils may be more likely to have a ""captive-type"" virome, that is, lower viral diversity than wild devils. Indeed, some devils included in this study are captive-born animals recently translocated to Maria Island. As samples were pooled prior to sequencing, it was not possible to distinguish between viromes of captive-born and wild-born devils.

While some of the viruses identified in this study come from families that include important pathogens, their pathogenic potential in devils is unclear. It is also important to note that some of these viruses may in fact be dietary viruses, with no active replication in devils, or may occur naturally as part of the normal gut flora of Tasmanian devils. For example, in some areas of Tasmania, rabbits are common and likely ingested by wild devils, which might explain the presence of RHDV2 in wild devils. They are also regularly fed to devils in captivity. Feeding records provided by the two zoos in this study confirmed the feeding of rabbits to some of the sampled devils around the time of fecal collection. While we did not detect rabbit genes by metatranscriptomics, virion-enriched metagenomics, or PCR in any of the wild devil samples that tested positive for RHDV, we did detect rabbit mtDNA in the feces of one captive devil from zoo A that tested positive for RHDV by PCR. Targeted investigations such as PCR of blood or internal tissues (i.e., liver), in situ hybridization, and serological assays are required to determine whether these viruses can actively replicate and cause disease in devils or are simply gut contaminants. Nevertheless, exposure to host-adapted viruses could pose significant health threats, especially for devils that are immunocompromised due to old age, DFTD, or other concurrent diseases (36, 37) . Furthermore, even commensal or latent viral infections can be exacerbated or reactivated in immunocompromised hosts (38, 39) .

Characterization of the gut virome in healthy devils in this study provides a fundamental baseline for future investigations of diseased animals. Tasmanian devils have low genetic diversity across their genomes and at functionally important loci such as the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) (40) (41) (42) . This renders them particularly vulnerable to environmental changes, including the emergence of new pathogens, as seen in other species with low genetic diversity (43) . For instance, in cheetahs, a coronavirus-associated feline infectious peritonitis outbreak causing mass mortality in a captive breeding colony was linked to the species' extreme genetic monomorphism, particularly at the MHC (44) .

Phylogenetic analyses of the newly identified viruses, including divergent members of their respective viral families, has provided insights into the evolutionary history of marsupial-associated viruses relative to viruses of eutherian mammals and other host taxa. Generally, long-term relationships between viruses and hosts are expected for mammalian viruses (13) . Strong evidence for this lies in the observation that devil viruses are usually clustered with other marsupial viruses, as a marsupial-specific lineage that is distinct from the eutherian viruses, as observed in herpesvirus, papillomavirus (45, 46) , and polyomavirus ( Fig. S1 to S5) . Furthermore, in several cases the branching order of viruses broadly reflects that of their hosts such that a general codivergence can be inferred. For instance, in the phylogenies of Picornaviridae and Astroviridae, the Tasmanian devil-associated (marsupial) viruses formed a sister clade to eutherian viruses, which, in turn, are sister to avian viruses, consistent with the evolutionary history of the host. Although such a relationship is not observed in every virus phylogeny, a deep divergence between eutherian and marsupial viruses is typical of our data set. This observation indicates that the timescale of virus evolution is very likely to reflect that of the hosts (13) .

The gut virome is increasingly recognized as an integral component of the gut microbiome, and studies of the devil virome will continue to shine light on the biology and health of this iconic endangered species. For example, bacteriophage, which appear to dominate the devil's fecal virome, can contribute to host health by maintaining the diversity and structure of the gut bacteriome through direct interactions with the bacterial communities. While the functions of bacteriophage on devil health remain to be determined, future studies will be able to exploit the extensive microbiomic data that are now available to answer important questions about host-microbe relationship between devils and their microbiome (11) .

In sum, our identification of a broad array of vertebrate-and marsupial-specific viruses in devils provides potential candidate viruses for future disease surveillance as part of the broader conservation management of devils once the pathogenic potential of these viruses has been elucidated.

Sample collection. Fecal samples were collected from healthy wild Tasmanian devils between September 2016 and June 2017 from four locations in Tasmania (Fig. 1 )-Stony Head (SH), Buckbys Road (BR), Maria Island (MI), and wukalina/Mt William National Park (wMW)-and from captive devils at two Australian mainland zoos in June and July 2017 (zoo A and zoo B). Devils were trapped overnight during routine monitoring by Save the Tasmanian Devil Program staff (47) . Fresh fecal samples were collected directly from either the animal or the traps or restraint bags during processing of animals. All samples were stored in liquid nitrogen or a portable Ϫ80°C freezer (Stirling Ultracold, Global Cooling Inc.) immediately after collection. After arriving at the laboratory, samples were separated into two aliquots to be used in the extraction of total RNA for metatranscriptomics and enrichment of virions for virion-enriched metagenomics.

Metatranscriptomics: total RNA extraction, library preparation, and sequencing. Samples were disrupted and homogenized in 600 l of lysis buffer with 1.44-mm ceramic beads using a Bead Ruptor homogenizer (Omni International) at 5 m·s Ϫ1 for 5 min. Total RNA was isolated using the Qiagen RNeasy Plus minikit following the manufacturer's instructions. Extracted RNAs were pooled based on their source locations at equal mass amounts, with each pool containing 6 to 10 samples. Prior to library preparation, RNA pools were depleted of host and bacteria rRNA using a Ribo-Zero-Gold (epidemiology) kit (Illumina). Use of rRNA depletion instead of poly(A) enrichment ensures the retention of RNA with and without poly(A) tails. Sequencing libraries were constructed using a TruSeq total RNA library preparation kit (Illumina), and paired-end (75 bp) sequencing of each library was performed on a NextSeq500 HO platform (Illumina) at the Ramaciotti Centre for Genomics (Sydney, Australia).

Virion-enriched metagenomics. (i) Virion enrichment and nucleic acid extraction. A second aliquot from each fecal sample was processed for the virion-enriched metagenomics approach, as described previously, with minor modifications (17) .

Fecal suspensions (10%) were homogenized for 1 min using the Bead Ruptor homogenizer (Omni International) at 5 m·s Ϫ1 and centrifuged at 15,000 ϫ g for 3 min (Hitachi centrifuge, type CT15E; T15A62 fixed-angle rotor). Resulting supernatants were filtered through 0.45-m membrane filters (Corning), and filtrates were treated with a cocktail of nucleases at 37°C for 2 h. Viral DNA and RNA were then simultaneously extracted using the QIAamp viral RNA minikit (Qiagen) (17) .

(ii) Random amplification. Extracted viral nucleic acids were pooled as for the total RNA preparations for metatranscriptomics described above. Pooled extractions were subjected to first-and secondstrand synthesis and random PCR amplification for 22 cycles using a complete whole-transcriptome amplification (WTA2) kit (Sigma-Aldrich) (17) . WTA2 PCR products were then purified using Agencourt AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter) prior to library preparation and sequencing.

(iii) Library preparation and Illumina sequencing. Sequencing libraries were constructed using the Nextera XT DNA library preparation kit (Illumina) according to the manufacturer's instructions, with modifications as described in reference 17. Paired-end (100 bp) sequencing of each library was performed on a Hiseq2500 platform (Illumina) at the Ramaciotti Centre for Genomics.

Assembly and annotation. Sequencing reads were demultiplexed and quality trimmed with Trimmomatic (48) and assembled de novo using Trinity (49) . Resulting contigs were compared against the nonredundant nucleotide and protein databases on GenBank using BLASTN and BLASTX, respectively, with an E value cutoff at 1EϪ5. BLASTX searching was also conducted against a bespoke database containing all viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) protein reference sequences downloaded from GenBank. Taxonomic information at the domain level (i.e., Eukarya, Bacteria, or Archaea), as well as for viruses, was assigned based first on the BLASTN results and then on the BLASTX results. Potential virus-related sequences were further categorized into families and orders based on their genetic similarity to their closest relatives and/or their phylogenetic positions. Similarly, assignment of viruses to the broader groups of their hosts (i.e., Eukarya, Bacteria, or Archaea) was based on their phylogenetic relationship to viruses with reliable host information obtained either using experimental or phylogenetic approaches. The genetic identity cutoff for host assignment was 40% based on the most conserved proteins, such as RdRp or DNA polymerases (50) . The threshold was set based on the intrafamily diversity of most vertebrate-specific virus families/genera (13) . The assignment of vertebrate host was based on phylogenetic analyses, in which a potential devil-associated virus is expected to either cluster within, or form a sister group to, an existing mammalian virus group.

To compare the abundances of transcripts/contigs, we calculated the percentage of total reads in each library. The abundance of host transcripts/contigs was estimated by mapping reads against the Tasmanian devil genome using Bowtie2 (51) , whereas those of other organisms, namely, viruses, bacteria, archaea, and nonhost eukaryotes, were estimated using the RSEM approach (52) implemented in Trinity.

For each virus, the genome sequence was further extended by merging related contigs from the same or different pools. Gaps in the genome were filled either by aligning reads to contigs using Bowtie2 (51) or by RT-PCR and Sanger sequencing. Putative ORFs in viral genomes were predicted by the Geneious 8.1 software (53) and annotated based on similarity to previous published virus genomes.

Phylogenetic analysis. Nucleotide sequences of complete or partial genomes and amino acid sequences from the conserved domain (e.g., RdRp) of the newly characterized viral sequences were aligned with those of reference viruses representative of the diversity of the corresponding virus family or species. Alignment was performed using the E-INS-I algorithm implemented in MAFFT (version 7) (54). The quality of the alignments was subsequently assessed, and all ambiguously aligned regions were removed using TrimAl (version 1.2) (55). Phylogenetic trees of aligned amino acid (all data sets with the exception of RHDV) or nucleotide (RHDV) sequences were then inferred using the maximum likelihood method implemented in PhyML (version 3.0) (56), utilizing the best-fit substitution model and the Subtree Pruning and Regrafting (SPR) branch-swapping algorithm.

Analyses of virome ecology. Viral-abundance tables (Table S2 and Table S3 ) were generated based on complete or near-complete viral contigs and the percentage of reads mapped to them using Bowtie 2 (51) in each library. QIIME (version 1.9) (57) was used to perform ecological and statistical analysis to compare viromes of different populations. Within-library virotype richness (alpha diversity measured using the Chao1 metric) and dissimilarity between libraries (beta diversity measured using the Euclidean metric) for both virion-enriched metagenomics and metatranscriptomics were calculated based on levels of viral abundance. Statistical significance of differences in alpha diversity was evaluated by the Monte Carlo method (999 permutations), with a null hypothesis that diversity is equal in all libraries with a significance threshold of ␣ ϭ 0.05. Levels of viral abundance were also used to produce heatmaps and dendrograms from hierarchical clustering. Principal-coordinate analysis (PCoA) was performed on the Euclidean distance matrix as calculated in QIIME, and additional cluster analysis was conducted using K-Means clustering in R (58) .

PCR confirmation and Sanger sequencing of RHDV. Contigs with high similarity (Ͼ97%) to RHDV were detected in one of the metatranscriptomics libraries. To confirm the detection of RHDV, RT-PCR was performed on individual fecal RNA extractions using the Qiagen OneStep Ahead RT-PCR kit (Qiagen) and primers from a previously validated Australian RHDV strain-specific PCR (59) as well as two additional primer sets manually designed based on the current metatranscriptomics assembled contigs (Table 2) . PCR products were separated on 1.5% agarose gels (Bio-Rad Laboratories) in 1ϫ Tris-acetate EDTA and visualized using the SYBR Safe DNA gel stain (Life Technologies). Sanger sequencing of positive PCR products was performed at the Australian Genome Research Facility (Sydney, Australia). In addition, DNA was extracted from fecal samples using the Isolate fecal DNA kit (Bioline, London, UK), and the presence of rabbit DNA was tested using primers targeting a 110-bp region of the Oryctolagus cuniculus 12S mitochondrial rRNA gene (60) . Rabbit DNA extracted from rabbit liver using the Bioline Isolate II genomic DNA kit (Bioline) was used as a positive control. Cleanup, primer trimming, and sequence analysis of Sanger data were performed using Geneious (53

Insights into the genetic and host adaptability of emerging porcine circovirus 3,"Porcine circovirus 3 (PCV3) was found to be associated with reproductive disease in pigs, and since its first identification in the United States, it subsequently spread worldwide, especially in China, where it might pose a potential threat to the porcine industry. However, no exhaustive analysis was performed to understand its evolution in the prospect of codon usage pattern. Here, we performed a deep codon usage analysis of PCV3. PCV3 sequences were classified into two clades: PCV3a and PCV3b, confirmed by principal component analysis. Additionally, the degree of codon usage bias of PCV3 was slightly low as inferred from the analysis of the effective number of codons. The codon usage pattern was mainly affected by natural selection, but there was a coeffect of mutation pressure and dinucleotide frequency. Moreover, based on similarity index analysis, codon adaptation index analysis and relative codon deoptimization index analysis, we found that PCV3 might pose a potential risk to public health though with unknow pathogenicity. In conclusion, this work reinforces the systematic understanding of the evolution of PCV3, which was reflected by the codon usage patterns and fitness of this novel emergent virus.","Circovirus belongs to the Circoviridae. It is a small monomeric single-stranded circular DNA virus with a genome size of approximately 2 kb. Circoviruses can transmit among birds, pigs, dogs, fish, mink, bats and foxes [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] . Only two circovirus species, porcine circovirus type 1 and 2 (PCV1 and PCV2), were reported in pigs before 2015. PCV1 does not appear to cause clinical disease in pigs. However, PCV2 infection is known to cause multiple clinical signs and poses a serious threat to the pig industry worldwide [1, 7] .

In 2015, a novel porcine circovirus 3 (PCV3) was first reported in the USA by metagenomic analysis. It is a genetically divergent circovirus associated with porcine dermatitis and nephropathy syndrome (PDNS). Similar to PCV2, the PCV3 genome harbours two major open reading frames (ORFs). ORF1 encodes the replication-associated protein (Rep) and ORF2 encodes the capsid (Cap) protein [8] . It is noteworthy that in less than two years there were extensive reports on the detection of PCV3 in many countries including the USA, China, Brazil, Italy, Korea, Thailand, Spain, Denmark, Germany, Sweden and Poland [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] .

Though the evolution of PCV3 has been reported in previous studies [12, 18, 19] , the standard methods in exploring the genotyping identification still controversial and the pathogenicity of PCV3 was unclear [13, 20] , which needs further research.

Phylogenetic analysis is known to be a powerful tool to investigate virus evolution [21] . However, codon usage bias analysis provides a different perspective regarding virus evolution. Several studies have documented the species-specific phenomenon of codon usage bias [22] [23] [24] [25] , which refers to the preferential use of certain synonymous codons [26] . Studies on codon usage have identified several factors that can influence codon usage patterns. These include mutation pressure, natural or translational selection, secondary protein structure, replication, selective transcription, hydrophobicity and hydrophilicity of the protein and the external environment [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] . When the size of the viral genome and other viral features, such as its dependence on the host machinery for key processes (including replication, protein synthesis and transmission) are compared to those of prokaryotic and eukaryotic genomes, the interplay between the codon usage of the virus and that of its host is expected to affect the overall viral survival, fitness, evasion of the host immune system and evolution [29, 32] . Previous studies showed that the codon usage bias of PCV was low, while mutation pressure plays a key role in shaping the codon usage bias of PCV1, mutation pressure and natural selection contribute equally to the codon usage bias of PCV2 [33] .

Here, we performed a detailed study of the evolutionary processes reflected by codon usage pattern of emerging PCV3. The combination of codon usage bias and traditional phylogenetic analyses of PCV3 coding sequences provides a novel perspective of the genetic divergence of emerging PCV3 and possibly supports the idea of an ongoing genotype shift.

Recombination events can mislead evolution analysis [34] as well as codon usage analysis [35] . Therefore, we looked for potential recombination events. No recombination events were observed. However, the China/ GD2016 (KY418606) strain was excluded from the analysis because of low quality. Therefore, a total of 51 strains were analysed.

Before the codon usage analysis of different clades of PCV3, PCV3 NJ trees using 51 strains were inferred. Phylogenetic tree ( Figure S1 ) revealed that two stable clusters, 3a and 3b, were identified, which was named by our previous study [36] . Furthermore, 3a clade could be divided into two stable individual subclades, 3a-1 and 3a-2, and immediate clade (IM), due to the instable distribution. The observed result have also been very similar general topologies in our previous study focus on researching the genotype identification of PCV3 [36] .

PCA analysis (axis1 plotted against axis2) is a widely used multivariate statistical approach [36] to identify the major trends in codon usage variation among genes. It involves the distribution of 59 synonymous codons in 59 dimensions. The values of the first four axes were 29.29%, 16.03%, 8.4% and 7.5% (Figure 1 (a)) revealing that axis1 was the major factor affecting codon usage. Next, axis 1 was plotted against axis 2. We found that points were divided into two groups (3a, 3b) (Figure 1(b) ). In addition, PCV3a-1 and PCV3a-2 clustered separately and PCV3a-IM among them. The PCV3a-1, PCV3a-2 and PCV3a-IM clades were all part of group 3a, while PCV3b all grouped together, consistent with the phylogenetic clustering.

Next, we explored if the nucleotide composition has an influence on codon usage bias. The average ± standard deviation (SD) values of nucleotides A and G were 28.31% ± 0.11 and 26.09% ± 0.12, respectively, and more abundant than C (22.47% ± 0.11) and T (23.13% ± 0.10). However, the nucleotide composition at the third position of synonymous codons (A 3 , C 3 , G 3 and T 3 ) were significantly different from the nucleotide composition. The most frequent nucleotide was T 3 (34.36% ± 0.003), followed by G 3 (32.70% ± 0.004), C 3 (29.06% ± 0.003) and A 3 (28.53% ± 0.004). Additionally, the percentage of AT (51.4% ± 0.002) was higher than GC (48.6% ± 0.002) revealing that PCV3 strains are AT rich. The average values of GC at the first, second and third positions (GC 12s , GC 3s ) were 48.55% ± 0.001, 48.57% ± 0.004, respectively. In addition, the nucleotide compositions of the different genotypes (PCV3a-1, PCV3a-2, PCV3a-IM and PCV3b) were similar to the combined strains (Table S2) .

The ENC value was estimated to evaluate the extent of codon usage bias of PCV3 in relation to all the strains and individual genotypes. The ENC value of all the strains ranged from 54.89 to 56.3 with mean of 55.52 (SD ± 0.26), indicating low codon usage bias. Additionally, the mean values of the different genotypes were 55.469 (SD ± 0.24), 56.159 (SD ± 0.15), 55.585 (SD ± 0.28) and 55.513 (SD ± 0.28) for PCV3a-1, PCV3a-2, PCV3a-IM and PCV3b, respectively ( Figure 2 ) suggesting low codon usage bias.

The RSCU was calculated for whole sequences, different PCV3 genotypes and potential hosts. Among the 18 frequently used synonymous codons, 11 were A/Tended codons, 7 were T-ended, followed by A-, Cand G-ended codons (Table 1 ). This indicates that PCV3 has a preference for A/T-ended compared to G/C-ended codons. Regarding over-and under-represented synonymous codons of optimal synonymous codons, 5, including His (CAC), Ile (ATT), Ser (AGC), Val (GTT) and Arg (AGA), had RSCU values > 1.6 and none of them was under-represented (RSCU value < 0.6). However, there were no significant differences among the different PCV3 genotypes, except that 2 preferred synonymous codons of PCV3b encoding for Ala and Arg were GCT and AGG, respectively, differing from other genotypes which used GCG for Ala and AGA for Arg. Furthermore, to determine the influence of the host species on the synonymous codon usage pattern of PCV3, the RSCU values of Sus scrofa, Homo sapiens, Canis familiaris and Rhinolophus ferrumequinum were determined. We found that only 5 of 18 abundant codons, including His (CAC), Asn (AAC), Glu (GAG), Ser (AGC) and Thr (ACC), were identical when analysed as a whole or as each genotype.

To investigate the forces influencing the codon usage bias of PCV3, ENC-plot analysis of the different genotypes was carried out (Figure 3 ). We found that all strains sat below the standard curve regardless of genotype. Additionally, there was also a clear separation of different genotypes except for PCV3a-IM, showing that both mutation pressure and natural selection affect the codon usage bias of different genotypes. Moreover, we carried out correlation analysis of nucleotide composition, ENC, axis1, axis2, Aroma and Gravy (Table 2) . A significant correlation was found between Gravy and ENC and GC 3s (r = −0.851, p < 0.01; r = 0.417, p < 0.01, respectively). Most of the parameters in the correlation analysis were related with each other, while Aroma only correlated with Gravy. In addition, PR2 analysis revealed that GC was used more frequently than AT ( Figure 4 ). Overall, we found that both mutation pressure and natural selection influence the codon usage bias of PCV3.

To understand which force between mutation pressure and natural selection had a bigger role driving codon usage bias, we performed neutrality analysis of all the sequences and grouped by genotype ( Figure 5 ). The slope of the linear regression was −0.1217 for all the sequences, illustrating that mutation pressure accounted for 12.17% of the selection force while natural selection accounted for 87.83%. Additionally, the slopes of the linear regression among different genotypes were 8.78%, 0%, 32.75% and 4.2% for PCV3a-1, PCV3a-2, PCV3a-IM and PCV3b, respectively. Interestingly, mutation pressure had no effect on the codon usage bias of PCV3a-2. In summary, natural selection was the dominant role driving the codon usage bias of PCV3.

Given that a recent analysis reported PCV3 in dogs [37] , additionally, Wu et al. [38] and our previous study [36] discovered that PCV3 was found to be closely related to bat circovirus in China, we chose Canis familiaris and Rhinolophus ferrumequinum for analysis, especially since Rhinolophus spp. acts as a major reservoir for diverse mammalian viruses in China [39] . We used CAI and RCDI analysis to evaluate host suitability to PCV3. There were significant differences in CAI values among different host species (Sus scrofa, Homo sapiens, Canis familiaris, Rhinolophus ferrumequinum) ( Figure 6 (a)). In particular, Homo sapiens had the CAI value similar to Sus scrofa, and Canis familiaris, with a mean value of 0.7358 ± 0.002, while Rhinolophus ferrumequinum had the lowest with a mean value of 0.5296 ± 0.002 in the analysis of both, all the sequences and different genotypes. On the other hand, the mean RCDI values were 1.34 ± 0.01, 1.25 ± 0.01, 1.31 ± 0.01 and 1.59 ± 0.02 for Sus scrofa, Homo sapiens, Canis familiaris and Rhinolophus ferrumequinum, respectively, regardless of genotypes ( Fig S2) . This indicates that the highest codon deoptimization of PCV3 was towards Rhinolophus ferrumequinum. A similar trend was identified in the analysis of different genotypes. Interestingly, except for the high RCDI value of Rhinolophus ferrumequinumin in relation to PCV3a-2, the other host species exhibited low codon usage deoptimization. On the other hand, PCV3a-1 had the highest codon usage deoptimization compared to the other genotypes among all hosts apart from PCV3a-2 towards Rhinolophus ferrumequinum. Using SiD analysis, we found that Rhinolophus ferrumequinum had a significantly deeper effect on PCV3 coding sequences, followed by Sus scrofa, Canis familiaris and Homo sapiens ( Figure 6 (b)).

To detect the influence of dinucleotides in the codon usage pattern, the relative abundance of 16 dinucleotides was calculated (Fig S3) . There were no under-represented dinucleotides (P xy < 0.78), while 3 dinucleotides, including CpC, GpG and TpT, were over-represented (P xy > 1.23). The RSCU value of these 3 dinucleotides CpC (GCC, CCA, CCC, CCG, CCT, TCC, ACC), GpG (GGA, GGC, GGG, GGT, AGG, CGG) and TpT (TTC, TTT, ATT, CTT, TTA, TTG, GTT) had 10 optimal synonymous codons among 18 optimal codons. Therefore, we can conclude that dinucleotides have an influence on the codon usage bias of PCV3.

PCV3, a novel emerging infectious virus, was firstly identified in the USA in 2015 [6, 8] then mainly prevailing in China [38, [40] [41] [42] [43] , South Korea [16] , Brazil [17] , Thailand [10] and European countries, such as Italy, Germany, Denmark, Spain, Sweden, Poland [9, [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] . Until now, there has been no systematic codon analysis to understand its evolutionary history and codon usage patterns. In this study, we performed a codon usage analysis according to different genotypes and potential host species. As a newly evolved virus, PVC3 detection and epidemiological monitoring are not complete. Therefore, epidemiological investigation, real-time disease monitoring and other measures to prevent PCV3 from spreading among pigs worldwide and to other mammals, is strongly recommended. To date, the most effective method to inhibit transmission is via vaccination. The understanding of codon usage patterns may provide important clues to develop new and appropriate vaccines, therefore, the importance of this kind of studies [44] .

Among the 52 strains, the China/GD2016 (KY418606) strain was not included in this study due to low quality and possibly misleading of the tree topology. Two stable clades: PCV3a and PCV3b were observed which was supported by phylogenetic and PCA analysis, reinforcing the fact that PCA can reflect genotypic classification based on evolutionary analysis [45] . Here, we found that A/G were abundant in coding sequences. Optimal synonymous codons ending in A/T were more abundant than G/C-ended codons. Altogether, this could indicate the existence of codon bias. However, we detected a high ENC value [47] . PCV3 had a lower codon bias than the other two porcine circoviruses. This might be due to the need of the virus to accommodate to the host replication system to replicate efficiency [48] . In this case, the low codon usage bias observed in PCV3 might be necessary to adapt to the natural host, pig, to prevail globally. However, this needs to be confirmed.

Although ENC values indicate the degree of codon preference, they do not provide insight into the factors contributing to codon usage bias. ENC-plots and correlation analysis revealed that both mutation pressure and natural selection, among other possible factors, contribute to the codon usage pattern of PCV3. Using neutrality analysis, we found that natural selection constrained the codon usage bias by 87.83% compared to mutation pressure (12.17%) using all PCV3 sequences. When the analysis was performed according to genotype, we found that the influence of natural selection on PCV3a-IM (67.25%) was slightly lower than the other genotypes. The reason for this is not clear, however we hypothesize that it could be due to the instable distribution of PCV3a-IM within the phylogeny. Overall, we found that natural selection was the dominant force driving the codon usage of PCV3.

We also found that dinucleotides influence the evolution of PCV3. There were no under-represented dinucleotides in PCV3 while the relative abundance of CpC, GpG and TpT deviated from the normal data and were over-represented. Based on RSCU analysis, synonymous codons harbouring these three dinucleotides occupied most of the prefer used codons, which means dinucleotide compositions played an important role in determining the patterns of codon usage of PCV3, apart from mutation pressure and natural selection. Although CpG was not under-represented, its content was low, which could be associated with the immunostimulatory nature of unmethylated CpGs. The recognition of unmethylated CpG by Toll-like receptor 9 leads to the activation of immune responses and thus, a low CpG content could be beneficial for virus replication [49] . For many viruses, the AT and GC contents are mostly related to the RSCU. We found that T-ended codons were more abundant compared to A/G/C-ended codons. Additionally, there was no difference in the usage of the 18 optimal codons among the different genotypes. However, A was the most abundant nucleotide. It has been suggested that the choice of optimal codons in viruses largely depends on the host [50] . PCV3 exhibited coincident and antagonistic codon usage patterns relative to its host when we contrasted the RSCU pattern of PCV3 to the host species, in agreement with other viruses such as hepatitis A virus [51] . This observed mixed codon usage pattern could be explained by the fact that coincident codons between virus and host are beneficial due to efficient protein translation, while antagonistic codons proper viral protein folding [52] . However, this speculation needs to be further confirmed.

To understand the relationship between virus and hosts further, we performed CAI, RCDI and SiD analysis. PCV3 was reported to close related with Chinese bat CVs by Wu et al . [38] . and our previous study [36] . Thus, we hypothesized that PCV3 may have evolved from bats and then gradually adapted to both pigs and dogs. CAI analysis revealed that, in comparison with other potential hosts, PCV3 displayed lowest CAI value in Rhinolophus ferrumequinum, while similar in Sus scrofa, Homo sapiens and Canis familiars, which was consistent with RCDI analysis. whereas, in contract to SiD analysis, indicating PCV3 developed strong tie with Rhinolophus ferrumequinum (as a origin), additionally, given previously reported that PCV3 has been detected in dogs [37] , as well as the natural host swine, and PCVs related to the xenotransplants and vaccine contaminations [53, 54] , we hypothesized that potential cross-species transmission of PCV3, and might be risky to public health. Though, the infection of PCVs in human cells and pathogenicity of PCVs to public health was unclear [55] , which still need further experimental research.

In conclusion, this study showed that the codon usage pattern of PCV3 coding sequences was affected by the interplay of different factors, such as mutation pressure, natural selection and dinucleotide compositions. The degree of codon usage preference was low and dominated mainly by natural selection. We also found evidence supporting the idea that PCV3 might be a potential threat to public health. Importantly, it has been reported that PCV3 infects dogs [37] , increasing the potential risk of cross interspecies transmission and adding exposure of humans, though, currently, with unclear pathogenicity in human host. The findings of this study help us understand the underlying factors associated with PCV3 evolution and host adaption which will greatly serve future PCV3 research.

A total of 52 completed genomes of PCV3 available until the 9 th of November 2017 were retrieved from the GenBank database (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gen bank/) and considering the opposite direction of ORF2, the individual ORF1 and ORF2 gene were concatenated for the analysis. The detailed information of each strain including the accession number, strain name, country and collection-date are listed in Table S1 .

Before the analysis, potential recombination events were examined by the recombination detection program (RDP4, version 4.39) [56] . Except for the method of LARD [57] , other methods, including RDP [58] , GENECONV [59] , Chimaera [60] , MaxChi [61] , BootScan [62] , SiSican [63] and 3Seq [64] were implemented to detect recombination events. The p value was set to 0.05. If at least four of the six methods detected recombination, the signal was considered to be recombination. Additionally, Bonferroni correction was applied to the analysis. Then in the phylogenetic analysis, sequences were aligned using ClustalW [65] . A pairwise distance matrix was calculated and clustered by the neighbor joining (NJ) method and that the statistical support of NJ tree was calculated by 1,000 bootstrap replicates which was reconstructed using MEGA 7.0 [65] .

Nucleotide composition Five nonsynonymous codons, including ATG, TGG and termination codons were excluded from the analysis. The frequencies of each nucleotide (A%, T%, C%, G%) and the total content of AT and GC were calculated using BioEdit (v7.0.9) [66] . The GC contents at the first, second and third positions (GC 1s , GC 2s , GC 3s ) were computed using EMBOSS: cusp (http://emboss.toulouse.inra.fr/cgi-bin/ emboss/cusp). Additionally, the nucleotides at the third position of synonymous codons (A 3 %, T 3 %, C 3 % and G 3 %) were calculated using CodonW (v1.4.2) (http:// codonw.sourceforge.net/culong.html#CodonW).

The ENC value is used to detect the degree of codon usage bias. The value ranges from 20 to 61 [67] . The larger the value of ENC indicates a lower degree of preference. A value less than 35 indicates that the bias is significant and vice versa [68] . The ENC value was calculated by CodonW (v1.4.2) as follows:

where F i (i = 2,3,4,6) is the mean of F i for i-fold degenerate codon families. The F i value was calculated as follows:

where n is the total number of occurrences of the codons for that amino acid and n j is the total number of occurrences of the j th codon for that amino acid.

As a multivariate statistical method, PCA is normally applied to study the relationship among variables and samples, which transform relative indices into small number of uncorrelated indices, thus, the so called principal components. In this study, each dimension represents a sense codon relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) value [69] . PCA analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism 5.0.

The RSCU represents the usage frequencies of synonymous codons in amino acids excluding the effect of nucleotide composition and sequence length [70] . The RSCU value was calculated as follows:

where X ij is the number of occurrence of the i th codon for the j th amino acid and n i is the number of synonymous codons that encode the j th amino acid [71] which was implemented in CodonW (v1.4.2). RSCU values > 1.0 and < 1.0 represent positive codon usage bias and negative codon usage bias, respectively [72] . In addition, a value < 0.6 indicates 'underrepresented' while > 1.6 indicates 'over-represented' [73] .

Enc-plot analysis ENC-plots (ENC value against GC 3s value) are used to reveal the factors driving codon usage bias. If mutation pressure is the only factor, the point will lie on the standard curve. Expected ENC values were calculated using the following formula:

where 's' refer to the frequency of G + C at the third codon position of synonymous codons.

Parity rule 2 (PR2) analysis PR2 analysis was used to measure the effect of natural selection and mutation pressure. The [A 3 /(A 3 + T 3 )] value is plotted in the ordinate while the [G 3 /(G 3 + C 3 )] value in the abscissa. The origin is (x = 0.5 and y = 0.5), which indicates that there is no deviation between nucleotides A and G. Points sitting in the centre of the plot indicate equal roles of mutation pressure and natural selection [74, 75] .

Neutrality analysis (GC 12s against GC 3s ) is used to determine which is the dominant factor affecting codon usage bias, and the neutrality plot was completed in GraphPad Prism 5.0. If the correlation line is close to the diagonal (high correlation) it indicates that external factors have little impact on codon usage bias, for example mutation pressure [50] . Similarity, if the correlation coefficient is towards the X or Y axis, natural selection is the dominant force [76] .

The CAI values can estimate the degree of preference for codon usage of a gene based on the sequence of a known highly expressed gene. CAI values were calculated by the CAIcal SERVER (http://genomes.urv.cat/ CAIcal/RCDI/) [77] . The reference database of the synonymous codon usage patterns (Sus scrofa, Homo sapiens, Canis familiaris, Rhinolophus ferrumequinum) was obtained from the Codon Usage Database (CUD) (http://www.kazusa.or.jp/codon/) [78] . CAI values range from 0 to 1. The higher the CAI value is indicative of stronger adaptability to the host [79] .

The RCDI of the different genotypes of PCV3 was calculated by the RCDI/eRCDI SERVER [80] (http://genomes. urv.cat/CAIcal/RCDI/) to show the codon usage deoptimization trend. A RCDI value of 1 indicates that the virus is predominantly adapted to the host, while a value higher than 1 indicates less adaptability [81] . The reference database was the same used for CAI analysis.

SiD was used to measure the effect of the host codon usage bias on PCV3. SiD was calculated as follows:

where a i means the RSCU value of 59 synonymous codons of the PCV3 coding sequences, b i means the RSCU value of the identical codons of the potential host. The SiD value ranges from 0 to 1 [82] . The higher value indicates that the host has a dominant effect on the usage of codons.

The dinucleotide frequencies were calculated using the DAMBE (v5.3.19) (http://dambe.bio.uottawa.ca/ DAMBE/dambe.aspx) [83] software. The abundance and absence of dinucleotides in 16 dinucleotides with P xy > 1.23, P xy < 0.78 were analysed [84] . In addition, to understand if the dinucleotide composition plays a role in determining the codon usage pattern, the relationship between CpG and RSCU was analysed. The ratio value was calculated as follows: P xy ¼ r xy r x r y where r x means the frequency of nucleotide X, r y and r xy are similar.

The Gravy value is the mean of the sum of the hydropathic indices of each amino acid [85] which indicates the effect of protein hydrophobicity on codon usage bias calculated by CodonW (v1.4.2). The value ranges from −2 to 2. The Aroma value measures the effect of aromatic hydrocarbon proteins on codon usage bias.

The correlations among the A%, T%, G%, C%, A 3s, T 3s , G 3s , C 3s , GC 3s , ENC, Aroma and Gravy were calculated using Graphpad Prism 5.0, with an extremely significant relationship (**) of p < 0.01 and a significant relationship (*) of 0.01 < p < 0.05.

natural selection supports escape from concerted evolution of a recently duplicated CEACAM1 paralog in the ruminant ceA gene family,"Concerted evolution is often observed in multigene families such as the CEA gene family. As a result, sequence similarity of paralogous genes is significantly higher than expected from their evolutionary distance. Gene conversion, a ""copy paste"" DNA repair mechanism that transfers sequences from one gene to another and homologous recombination are drivers of concerted evolution. Nevertheless, some gene family members escape concerted evolution and acquire sufficient sequence differences that orthologous genes can be assigned in descendant species. Reasons why some gene family members can escape while others are captured by concerted evolution are poorly understood. By analyzing the entire ceA gene family in cattle (Bos taurus) we identified a member (CEACAM32) that was created by gene duplication and cooption of a unique transmembrane domain exon in the most recent ancestor of ruminants. CEACAM32 shows a unique, testis-specific expression pattern. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that CEACAM32 is not involved in concerted evolution of CEACAM1 paralogs in ruminants. However, analysis of gene conversion events revealed that CEACAM32 is subject to gene conversion but remarkably, these events are found in the leader exon and intron sequences but not in exons coding for the Ig-like domains. These findings suggest that natural selection hinders gene conversion affecting protein sequences of the mature protein and thereby support escape of CEACAM32 from concerted evolution.","the bovine ceA gene family. In order to identify bovine CEACAMs we performed similarity searches using three different bovine genomic sequence databases (Bos taurus, Bos indicus and Bos grunniens) using Blast and Blat algorithms as described previously 8 . By comparing data from these genomes, we predicted the coding sequence (CDS) of eight CEACAM genes and two pseudo genes. We identified orthologous genes to human CEACAM1, CEACAM16, CEACAM18, CEACAM19, CEACAM20 and three putatively functional CEACAM1 paralogs, CEACAM32, CEACAM33, and CEACAM35. The two putative pseudogenes have stop codons in multiple exons, indicating that they do not encode functional proteins. According to the current genome assembly in Ensembl (Cow (UMD3.1)) the chromosomal location of the CEA gene family is syntenic to the CEA gene family in other mammals located in the extended leucocyte receptor complex on chromosome 18 (Fig. 1A) . CEACAM1 is the only member of the CEA gene family located between TGFB1 and LIPE. All CEACAM1 paralogs including one pseudogene are positioned in one cluster flanked by the CD79A and XRCC1 genes (Fig. 1B) . The second pseudogene is a CEACAM18 paralog located next to the CEACAM18 gene within the SIGLEC cluster (Fig. 1B) . The location of the orthologous genes CEACAM16, CEACAM19 and CEACAM20 is similar as in other mammals 7, 8 .

The orthologous CEACAM genes CEACAM16, CEACAM18, CEACAM19 and CEACAM20 have the same exon arrangement as previously described in other mammals 8 (Fig. S1 ). In contrast, CEACAM1 in cattle does not contain a B domain exon (255 bp) commonly found in other mammalian CEACAM1 genes as previously described 23 . The CEACAM1 paralog CEACAM32 has a unique transmembrane domain which significantly differs from the transmembrane domains found in CEA gene family members with immune receptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs (ITIM) or immune receptor tyrosine-based activation-like motifs (ITAM-like). CEACAM33 and CEACAM35 contain a transmembrane domain, which is very similar to that of human CEACAM3, CEACAM4, and CEACAM21. Human CEACAM3 and CEACAM4 have a cytoplasmic tail with an ITAM-like motif encoded by four exons. Similar exons could be identified in the CEACAM33 and CEACAM35 genes. CEACAM35 is the only CEACAM1 paralog which contains a B domain exon in cattle (Fig. S1 ). CEACAM34 described in a previous paper 8 is no longer in the Whole-genome shotgun contigs (wgs) database at NCBI which is in accordance with our inability to amplify any fragment with CEACAM34-specific primers from cDNA of different tissues or genomic DNA from different cattle. These results suggest that CEACAM34 does not exist as a separate gene in the cattle genome or that the sequence information previously available was incomplete. A detailed depiction of the exon arrangement of all CEACAM genes is shown in Figs. 1C and S1A. Differential expression of bovine CEACAM1 paralogs. First, we designed primers for the bovine housekeeping gene GAPDH. The primer pair was designed to amplify a specific fragment of GAPDH mRNA-derived cDNA and a fragment of genomic DNA from the GAPDH gene but not from a processed pseudogene. Both fragments differ in size and therefore could be used to detect and quantify genomic DNA contamination in the cDNA preparations (Table 1 , Fig. 2A ).

Next, we designed CEACAM-specific primers (Table 1) complementary to individual leader exon and N domain exon sequences. Using these primers we screened the expression of bovine CEACAMs in different candidate tissues, including liver, lung, skin, kidney, rumen, small intestine, large intestine, spleen, udder, tonsils, lymph nodes, granulocytes and lymphocytes. CEACAM32 mRNA was detected in testis but not in any other tissue tested (Fig. 2B) . Expression of CEACAM33 and CEACAM35 was detected in bovine granulocytes isolated from peripheral blood (Fig. 2C) and at low level in other tissues (data not shown).

To substantiate our prediction of the exon composition of the CEACAM32 gene we performed 3′ RACE experiments starting from the N domain exon to identify the 3′ end of CEACAM32 cDNA. Sequencing of the cDNA obtained by 3′ RACE, revealed that the CEACAM32 mRNA encodes a unique transmembrane domain, which contains a stop codon and a poly A signal, resulting in a very short 3′ untranslated region. Based on the 3′ sequence of CEACAM32 cDNA we designed primers for the amplification of full length CEACAM32 cDNA which was then cloned and sequenced ( Table 1 ). The CEACAM32 mRNA (GenBank accession no. MH684294) codes for a single isoform (Fig. 2D ) composed of a leader sequence, an IgV-like domain (N domain), an IgC-like domain (A2 type domain), a transmembrane domain and an extremely short cytoplasmic domain consisting of four amino acids.

Amplification and sequencing of the full length CEACAM33 cDNA indicated that four different splice isoforms exists (Fig. 2D ). However, we could only confirm two of these isoforms by cDNA cloning. One CEACAM33 splice variant contains the ITAM-like motif (GenBank accession no. MH684295), while another isoform (GenBank accession no. MH684296) lacks the transmembrane domain indicating that it encodes a secreted protein (Fig. 2E) .

CEACAM35 (GenBank accession no. MH684297) exist as one isoform (Fig. 2D ) composed of a leader exon, an N domain exon, one IgC-like domain (A1 type) exon, a transmembrane domain exon and four cytoplasmic domain exons. The four cytoplasmic domain exons code for a ITAM-like motif slightly different from the ones found in CEACAM33 cDNA. The B domain exon of the CEACAM35 gene identified as a putatively spliceable exon in the genome (Fig. 1C ) was found to be not included in analyzed mRNAs. The putative proteins encoded by bovine CEACAM1 and its paralogous genes are depicted in Fig. 2E. phylogenetic relationship of bovine ceAcAMs. We compared the IgV-like (N domain) exon nucleotide sequences of all bovine CEACAMs (Fig. 3A) . The CEACAM N domains of CEACAM1 paralogs cluster together with those of the CEACAM1a and b alleles while the N domain exon sequences of conserved CEACAMs are more distantly related. The N domain exon sequence of the inhibitory receptor CEACAM1 was most closely related to that of the activating receptor CEACAM33 followed by the second activating receptor CEACAM35. The N domain exon sequence of CEACAM32 showed the greatest difference to that of the N domain exon of CEACAM1 and of all CEACAM1 paralogs (Fig. 3A) . We further determined the relationship of IgC-like domain exons of bovine CEACAMs (Fig. S3 ). CEACAM1 and CEACAM33 contain two IgC-like domains of the A1 and A2 type. CEACAM35 is composed of an A1 and a B domain. The IgC-like domains of CEACAM32 and the CEACAMps are of the A2 type (Figs. 1C; S3). Next, we analyzed the relationship of the transmembrane exon nucleotide sequences of bovine CEACAM1 paralogs with that of other species (Fig. 3B ). As previously observed, two main forms of transmembrane domain exons can be discerned: one cluster is composed of TM domain exon sequences present in genes encoding ITIM motifs and the other containing the transmembrane domain exons associated with exons which encode a ITAM-like signaling motif. The transmembrane domain exon sequence of CEACAM32 is more closely related to the CEACAM1-related transmembrane domain exon sequence but is clearly separated from the CEACAM1 transmembrane exon cluster (Fig. 3B ). When we compared all identified N domain exons of CEACAM32 with N domain exons from CEACAM1 and closely related CEACAM1 paralogs of selected mammalian species we found that all CEACAM32 N domain exons cluster together while N domain exons of CEACAM1 and other bovine CEACAM1 paralogs formed a separated cluster (Fig. 3C ).

phylogenetic history of the bovine ceA gene family. We used the composition of mobile elements within the different bovine CEACAM genes to analyze the phylogenetic history of bovine CEACAMs (Figs. S4, S5). CEACAM33 contains most of the elements at the same positions as in CEACAM35 indicating that CEACAM33 and CEACAM35 are the result of a duplication event. Interestingly further modifications of CEACAM33 seem to have taken place, since the B domain exon is replaced by an A2 domain exon, which is most closely related to the A2 domain exon of CEACAM1 and/or CEACAMps (Fig. S3 ). The mobile elements around the N domain exons (i.e. in introns 1 and 2) suggest a close relationship between CEACAM1 and CEACAM32.

On the other hand, a similar origin of the transmembrane domain exon of these two genes is not supported by the surrounding mobile elements (Fig. S4 ). Based on the mobile elements found in the CEACAM1-related pseudogene it is closer related with the ITAM containing CEACAMs, CEACAM33 and CEACAM35 than with CEACAM1 and CEACAM32 (Fig. S4 ). Mobile elements of conserved CEACAMs indicate that the duplication of CEACAM18 was a rather recent event and that the other conserved CEACAMs evolved separately for quite a while (Fig. S5 ).

The loss of the B domain exon in bovine CEACAM1, the integration of different artiodactyl-specific mobile elements (Fig. 4) , and the cooption of the transmembrane domain exon of CEACAM32 into the ruminant CEA gene family are additional genetic markers which allowed further analysis of the evolutionary history of the bovine CEA gene family. Previously we have speculated that B domain exon loss is due to the insertion of mobile elements 23 (Fig. 4) . However, when we analyzed CEACAM1 from other artiodactyls, i.e. pig (Sus scrofa), alpaca (Vicugna pacos), and the Wild Bactrian (Camelus ferus) and Arabian camel (Camelus dromedarus), two old world camelids, we also did not find B domain exons in the CEACAM1 genes ( Fig. 5A; www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ years ago (mya). On the other hand, similar mobile elements as found in the A1-A2 intron of bovine CEACAM1 were detected in CEACAM1 of goats (Capra hircus), sheep (Ovis aries) and giraffe (Giraffa Camelopardalis tippelskirchi) but not in CEACAM1 of pigs and camelids (Fig. 5A ). This suggests that the B domain exon loss occurred before mobile elements were integrated into the A1-A2 intron of the common ancestor of ruminant CEACAM1.

Furthermore, in the data base CEACAM35 has a complete B domain exon while CEACAM33 contains only part of the B domain exon from the 5′ region (Fig. 5B ). This indicates that the duplication event which created CEACAM35 took place before the CEACAM1-like ancestor lost its B domain. CEACAM33 seems to be younger than CEACAM35 and may have been evolved by duplication of a CEACAM35 ancestor followed by further modifications. www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ A close relative of the transmembrane domain exon of bovine CEACAM32 was found in bovidae, cervidae and in some giraffidae i.e. in okapi but not in giraffe and not in suidae and camelidae. This data suggests that the birth of CEACAM32 took place in the most recent ancestor of ruminants.

Two different CEACAM1 alleles exist in cattle, CEACAM1a (GenBank accession no. AY345127) and CEACAM1b (GenBank accession no. AY487416). The alleles differ mainly in their N exon sequences by a number of non-synonymous mutations and most remarkably by an in frame 9-nucleotide deletion in the CEACAM1a allele. Interestingly, the CEACAM1a allele was found in the wgs database for Bos taurus and Bos indicus but not for Bos grunniens, Bison bison, and Bubalus bubalis. In contrast, the CEACAM1b allele was found in the database of all five bovine species. Taken together, this indicates that the CEACAM1b allele is the original bovine CEACAM1 allele and that the CEACAM1a allele appeared first in the ancestor of domestic cattle 0.2-1 mya 4 ago.

Concerted evolution and gene conversion between CEACAM1 paralogs. The phylogenetic analysis of the N domains of bovine CEACAM1 paralogs indicates that the N domains of CEACAM1, CEACAM33 and CEACAM35 exhibit concerted evolution while the N domain of CEACAM32 evolved independently. To better understand the mechanism that allows the independent evolution of CEACAM32 we analyzed recombination and gene conversion events that may have taken place between bovine CEACAM1 paralogs. First, we searched the protein-coding region of bovine CEACAM1 paralogs using GARD. Three breakpoints were identified one was in the leader sequence one in the N domain and one in the A1 domain exon. When we compared the www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ sequences between these breakpoints, we observed that CEACAM32 differs from CEACAM1, CEACAM33 and CEACAM35 in particular in the N and in the first IgC-like domain exons (Fig. 6A ). Next, we used the PipMaker software to compare the whole sequences of the CEACAM1 paralogous genes. As shown in Fig. 6B CEACAM32 Human tRNA GLU TCCCTGGTGGTCTAGTGGTTAGGATTCGGCGCTCTCACCGCCGCGGGCCCGGGTTCGATTCCCGGTCAGGGAACCA ******* **** *********** ** ***** **** **** ************ ** ** **** ****** * CHR-1 consensus (type I) www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ and CEACAM1 N exon sequences differ strongly. However, high similarity between CEACAM1 and CEACAM32 was found in the intron sequences particular around the N domain exon (Fig. 6B upper panel) . In contrast, sequence similarities between CEACAM1 and CEACAM33 and CEACAM35 were most pronounced in the exon sequences ( Fig. 6C middle and lower panels) . Finally, we used GENCONV to detect putative gene conversion events between CEACAM1, CEACAM32, CEACAM33, CEACAM35 and CEACAMps1. 23 gene conversion events were detected by GENECONV in the region starting at the leader exon and ending after ~1000 nucleotides of the intron following the N domain exon (Fig. 7 and Table 2) ). Gene conversion events were detected for all CEACAM1 paralogs at the N domain exon except for CEACAM32 (Fig. 7) . Remarkably, gene conversion between CEACAM32 and other CEACAM1 paralogs were detected, but they were restricted to the leader exon and the intron sequence following the N domain exon (Fig. 7) . We used only the region of the CEACAM1 paralogs for the analysis of gene conversion where the sequence similarity was high enough to guarantee a high quality alignment. All gene conversion events located around the N domain exon have a high statistical support Table 2 . These results demonstrate that CEACAM32 is still involved in gene conversion and, therefore, in concerted evolution of CEACAM1 paralogs, however, since gene conversion only affects noncoding regions and the leader exon of CEACAM32, the mature CEACAM32 protein has escaped concerted evolution. The nucleotide sequence of CEACAM1 starting -2000 bp upstream of exon 1 including exons encoding the extracellular part was compared with that of the corresponding region of CEACAM1 paralogs. For contiguous stretches of nucleotides conserved between the gene pairs using a sliding window, the degree of identity was calculated and displayed as horizontal lines. The location of CEACAM1 exons is indicated by numbered boxes and highlighted by red lines. Note, that the sequence similarity between CEACAM1 and CEACAM32 is highest in intron sequences, while the similarity of CEACAM1 sequences with that of CEACAM33 and CEACAM35 is highest for the exon sequences. The different repeat sequences are indicated by differently shaped forms. Figure 7 . Gene conversion of bovine CEACAM1 paralogs. Gene conversion was analyzed using GENECONV. Sequences of all bovine CEACAM1 paralogs starting from the leader exon (exon 1) to the first ~1000 nucleotides from the intron between the N domain (exon 2) and A domain (exon 3) exon were aligned using muscle. Gene conversion was detected by GENECONV. 23 gene conversion events were detected using default parameters. Events were numbered from 1 to 23. Gene conversions between two CEACAM genes are depicted. The direction of gene conversion is not shown. Statistical support can be found in www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ substitutions was observed (Fig. 8A ). In addition, the MEME application was used to analyze the sequence alignment of CEACAM32 sequences to search for episodic positive selection. Only one codon (codon 27) was found to be under episodic positive selection i.e. selection for diversification at a significance level of 0.1 (Fig. 8B) . Additional sites were identified, which were indicated to be under positive selection by the LRT (p-value > 0.1), four of them (sites 39, 40, 41, 42) are located in the region between position 36 to 52 (Fig. 8B) . Modeling the structure of the CEACAM32 N domain revealed that most the codons putatively selected for diversification are placed in or near to the CFG face (Fig. 8C) . The CFG face is known to be the major ligand interaction area of CEACAM N domains. Together these data suggest that natural selection has favored differentiation of the putative ligand-binding face of CEACAM32 from other bovine CEACAMs.

In the present study, we performed a comprehensive analysis of the bovine CEA gene family and tried to reconstruct its evolutionary history. In contrast to the equine CEA gene family where we could not identify two of the conserved CEACAMs e.g. CEACAM18 and CEACAM20 11, 19 , in cattle all conserved CEACAMs i.e. CEACAM1, CEACAM16, CEACAM18, CEACAM19 and CEACAM20 could be identified in the NCBI genome database. Interestingly we also identified a CEACAM18 paralog in cattle, however this paralog is most likely a pseudogene, since several stop codons were found in the coding sequence. Thus, the gene duplication of CEACAM18 had let to pseudogenization of one paralog, putatively due to an unfavorable consequence of the enhanced gene dosage and/or the lack of a novel function upon gene duplication 2 . In cattle, CEACAM1 paralogs have not undergone a substantial expansion as seen in other species 8, 24, 25 . Only four CEACAM1 paralogs were detected and one of them www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ seems to be a pseudogene. Two of the expressible paralogs contain an ITAM-like signaling motif in their cytoplasmic tails. Thus, they may form paired receptors with CEACAM1 as described before in other species 17, [26] [27] [28] . These paired receptors are thought to be a counter measure to the use of CEACAM1 as cellular receptors by various bacterial pathogens 8, 17, 27 . Interestingly, CEACAM1 paralogs with ITAM-like signaling motifs in cattle show a preferential expression in granulocytes, as does human CEACAM3, which was found to be an innate pathogen receptor, which mediates uptake and destruction of bacterial pathogens 17, 27 . This is in contrast to the finding in dogs were CEACAMs with ITAM-like signaling motifs were more broadly expressed 26 . Thus, bovine CEACAM33 and CEACAM35 may also be innate immune receptors for yet unknown pathogens.

Why do two different ITAM-bearing bovine CEACAMs exist? The maintenance of two ITAM-bearing CEACAMs with a very similar expression pattern may imply that two different pathogens exist that use CEACAM1 as a receptor or that both activating CEACAMs bind to different epitopes of the same pathogen. In addition, the presence of two activating CEACAMs may allow the development of more than one inhibitory receptor without losing the ""protection"" by the activating receptor 8, 17, 27 . Indeed, we had previously identified two different CEACAM1 alleles in cattle. We assumed that this is due to usurpation of bovine CEACAM1 by a virus as its cellular receptor. However, such a virus has not yet been identified 23, 29 . Here we show, that the CEACAM1a and CEACAM1b alleles are found in certain Bos taurus and Bos indicus breeds, but CEACAM1a is absent from the genomes of Bos grunniens, Bison bison, and Bubalus bubalis. This finding strongly indicates that the three amino acid deletion in the CEACAM1a allele occurred in the common ancestor of Bos taurus and Bos indicus after separation from the ancestor of Bos grunniens and Bison bison about 150-400 kya 30 . At that time, both ITAM-containing CEACAMs already existed, since their descendants could be found in the genome of both Bos grunniens and Bison bison. Thus it may be speculated that the presence of two ITAM-bearing receptors with different ligand-binding domains favor the evolution of distinct CEACAM1 alleles.

From an evolutionary point of view, it is remarkable that CEACAM35 is the only CEACAM1 paralog in cattle which contains a functional B domain exon. Since the B domain exon of CEACAM1 is replaced by a LINE/ L1_Art and a CHR1 family SINE interspersed repeat element, duplication of CEACAM1 leading to CEACAM35 may have occurred before this event. Thus, CEACAM1 and CEACAM35 seem to be the original paired receptors of the CEA gene family in artiodactyls. In contrast, CEACAM33 does not have a B domain exon indicating, that CEACAM33 either evolved by duplication of CEACAM1 after the loss of the B domain exon or by duplication of CEACAM35 followed by an independent loss of the B domain exon. The later possibility is supported since CEACAM33 contains a region that exhibits sequence similarity to the sequence comprising the end of the intron between the A1 and B domain exon and the first part of the B domain exon of CEACAM35. In addition, the presence of similar mobile elements in CEACAM35 and CEACAM33 suggests that the CEACAM35 ancestor gave rise to CEACAM33. However, the presence of an A2 domain in CEACAM33 implies the presence of an A2 exon in the CEACAM35 ancestor or requires further modifications of an A2 exon-less CEACAM33 ancestor after gene duplication possibly by recombination or gene conversion.

There is one member of the bovine CEA gene family which is of particular interest since it has a unique transmembrane domain which was not found previously in other species. Further searches in the NCBI database suggest that CEACAM32 is specific for ruminants. Thus CEACAM32 is an example of a new CEACAM born in the most recent ancestor of all ruminants about 35-50 mya 31 . Although the origin of the transmembrane domain of CEACAM32 is unknown, the novelty of this domain within the CEA gene family indicates that CEACAM32 is the result of a gene duplication and/or exon shuffling event together with the cooption of a novel transmembrane exon. This novel gene encoding a transmembrane anchored cell surface glycoprotein has gained a unique expression pattern within the bovine CEA gene family. An exclusive expression in testis was previously also observed for CEACAM17, which is a muroid-specific CEACAM 7 . Taken into consideration that CEACAMs could interact with a variety of ligands we speculate that the expression in testis provides a new very specific environment for these testis-specific CEACAMs with a unique repertoire of putative ligands that may favor adaptation of the putative ligand binding domain of CEACAM to bind to a testis-specific ligand. Indeed, the relaxed or even positive selection at the CFG face fits well to the view that the ligand binding face did undergo affinity maturation to this putative new ligand or that adaptation to species-specific ligands took place. Nevertheless, we want to point out that it is well known that transcription is very permissive in testis and, therefore, duplicated genes are often transcribed in this organ 32, 33 . Thus, further analysis of the role of CEACAM32 is needed to support the view that CEACAM32 plays a role in testis.

Comparison of the N domains of bovine CEACAM1 paralogs showed that CEACAM1 and the two ITAM-like signaling motif containing CEACAMs (CEACAM33 and CEACAM35) underwent concerted evolution. A similar finding was recently reported for human CEACAM1 paralogs 5 . Furthermore, concerted evolution of the protein coding sequence of CEACAM1, CEACAM33 and CEACAM35 seems to be due to gene conversion events that affect the exon sequences and only to a minor extend the intron sequences. In contrast gene conversion events of CEACAM32 affecting non-protein coding intron sequences are preferentially maintained during evolution. This indicates that natural selection favors maintenance of the protein sequence of the extracellular part of CEACAM1 and the ITAM-containing CEACAMs while it prevents homogenization of the extracellular part of CEACAM32 and CEACAM1. Gene conversion is supported by both small distance of genes and sequence similarity. Thus, gene conversion at certain places of the intron sequence between CEACAM1 and CEACAM32 may be preferred compared to CEACAM33, CEACAM35 or CEACAMps1. On the other hand, we have noted inversions of the non-CEACAM gene locus present between CEACAM1 and members with ITAM-like motif-encoding exons in cattle and mouse when compared with the human CEACAM gene locus 8 . This intrachromosomal inversion can be explained by a recombination event between e.g. CEACAM1 and a ITAM-like motif-encoding CEACAM1-like gene with an transcriptionally inverse orientation (which indeed all CEACAM1-like genes exhibit; see Fig. 1B ) possibly using a lopping-out mechanism comprising the non-CEACAM gene region. This mechanism could engage even genes with large physical distances, suggesting that the different distance between CEACAM1 and the individual CEACAM1 paralog is probably of minor importance for the frequency of gene conversion events.

It is of particular importance that concerted evolution within bovine CEACAM1 paralogs is only relevant for the extracellular, ligand-binding part. Due to the contrary signaling capacity of bovine CEACAM1 and its paralogs, functional diversification of the duplicated genes already had taken place 1 . Thus their transmembrane and cytoplasmic parts are not under concerted evolution due to prominent nucleotide sequence differences. We hypothesize that the ligand-binding domain of inhibitory CEACAM1 and activating CEACAMs evolve in a concerted way in order to maintain the counter measure function of activating CEACAMs against the use of the inhibitory CEACAMs by pathogens. Since the evolution of these CEACAMs is most likely driven by pathogens which evolve very rapidly the ligand binding domains also evolve rather fast. To keep the ligand (probably pathogen adhesins) binding domains similar, these paired receptors evolve by concerted evolution mediated by gene conversion and homologous recombination. On the other hand, duplicated genes that have gained a novel expression pattern face a novel environment and may interact with novel putative ligands. Once they interact to a certain extend with these ligands further optimization by natural selection may exclude concerted evolution with the original parental gene 34 . According to the Red-Queen-Hypothesis 35 this means not moving in concert with its paralogs means separation from them without prominent selection for diversification, as it was observed in the current investigation for CEACAM32.

Taking together analysis of the CEA gene family of cattle and other artiodactyls, provided evidence, that members of the CEA gene family can escape from concerted evolution by excluding protein coding regions of the gene from gene conversion most likely through natural selection. Thus, conserved CEA gene family members are expected to have ligands distinct from their founder gene CEACAM1 ligands.

Datasets and nomenclature of genes. Sequence similarity searches were performed using the NCBI BLAST tools blastn http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi and Ensembl BLAST/BLAT search programs http:// www.ensembl.org/Multi/Tools/Blast?db=core using default parameters. For identification of bovine CEACAM exons, exon and cDNA sequences from known CEACAM and PSG genes were used to search whole-genome shotgun contigs (wgs) databases limited to organisms Bovidae. Hits were considered to be significant if the E-value was <e-10 and the query cover was >50%. Once a wgs contig was identified that contained CEACAMrelated sequences we confirmed manually the presence of the complete exon by the number of nucleotides and identification of CEACAM-typical splice site sequences. Only sequences which were considered to be complete exons were used for further analyses. In a second step we used the identified exon sequences to search the database again in order to identify all existing paralogous CEACAM genes. Once we had identified individual exons we predicted the gene structure based on the organization of known CEACAM genes. The location of different exons on the same contig was a prerequisite for considering that these exons belong to the same gene. Gene predictions were further supported by the identification of expressed sequence tags (est) and/or predictions in genome builds at NCBI and Ensemble, if available. Short exons, like exons coding for cytoplasmic tails, were identified by alignments of downstream sequences of identified transmembrane exons with cytoplasmic exon sequences of human CEACAMs. Sequence alignments for exon identification were performed using clustalw . The CEA gene family in cattle is not well annotated; therefore, we adopted the nomenclature according to the one previously used for the CEA gene family of other mammals i.e. bovine CEACAM1 paralogs were numbered CEACAM32-CEACAM35 following the canine CEACAM numbers 8 . Gene names and corresponding sequences are summarized in (Additional File 1). The following databases were used for gene loci analyses: UMD3.1 assembly and Btau_5.0.1.

Bovine peripheral blood lymphocytes and granulocytes were isolated from blood of healthy cattle by centrifugation through a Ficoll-Paque gradient 1.077 g/l (GE Healthcare, Chalfont St Giles, UK). Lymphocytes were taken from the interphase of the gradient and separated from monocytes by plastic adherence for one hour. Granulocytes were collected from the top of the red blood cell (RBC) pellet and further purified by RBC lysis with ammonium chloride. Different bovine tissue samples were collected from freshly slaughtered healthy cattle and stored in the RNA stabilization reagent RNAlater ® (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, US) at 4 °C for 24 h or at −80 °C for long term storage.

Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis. Total RNA was isolated with the RNeasy ® Mini Kit (Qiagen, Langen, Germany) or using the TRIzol ® reagent (Life Technologies, Karlsruhe, Germany). One µg of total RNA was used for cDNA syntheses by reverse transcription (RT) using the Reverse Transcription (2020) 10:3404 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-60425-4 www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ System ® (Promega, Mannheim, Germany). The RT product was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with DreamTaq polymerase (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Waltham, USA) and gene-specific primers (Metabion, Planegg-Martinsried, Germany) using standard conditions. Primers used are summarized in Table 1 . Eight µl of each PCR were analyzed by electrophoresis on a 1.8% agarose gel and visualized by ethidium bromide staining.

Bovine ceAcAM cDnA cloning and sequencing. Primers used for amplification of full length cDNAs are shown in Table 1 . For cDNA cloning the RT product was amplified by PCR with Easy-A High-Fidelity PCR Cloning Enzyme (Agilent) and analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. Specific bands were extracted from the agarose gel using QIAEX II Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen). The PCR products were cloned using the StrataClone PCR Cloning Kit (Agilent). Plasmid DNA isolated from various clones were analyzed by PCR and sequencing. Nucleotide sequencing was performed with the BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit (PE Applied Biosystems, Weiterstadt, Germany).

For the amplification of the 3′ end of CEACAM32 mRNA we used the 3´ RACE System for Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends from Invitrogen according to the standard protocol. The amplicons were isolated from an agarose gel using the QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit from Qiagen and sequenced using the BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit (PE Applied Biosystems). This sequence was used to design specific primers to amplify full-length CEACAM32 cDNA. The sequences of the PCR products were determined by direct nucleotide sequencing. phylogenetic analysis and bioinformatics. Phylogenetic analyses based on nucleotide and amino acid sequences were conducted using MEGA6 or MEGA7 36, 37 . Sequence alignments were performed using Muscle implemented in MEGA7. Phylogenetic trees were constructed using the maximum likelihood (ML) method with bootstrap testing (500 replicates) and the Tamura-Nei substitution model. For comparing sequences by the diagonal plot method we used Dotlet (https://myhits.isb-sib.ch/cgi-bin/dotlet) 38 . The program PipMaker (http://bio. cse.psu.edu/) was used to identify conserved contiguous stretches of nucleotides between gene pairs and to calculate the degree of identity which is summarized as a 'percent identity plot' 39 . For identification of mobile DNA elements we used RepeatMasker (http://www.repeatmasker.org/). Recombination between bovine CEACAM1 and its paralogs was detected using the genetic algorithm for recombination detection (GARD) software 40 . Gene conversion was analyzed using the GENECONV program (version 1.81a) 41 . In order to determine the selective pressure on the maintenance of the nucleotide sequences, the number of nonsynonymous nucleotide substitution per nonsynonymous site (dN) and the number of synonymous substitutions per synonymous site (dS) were determined for N domain exons. The dN/dS ratios as well as the cumulative synonymous and nonsynonymous substitutions along coding regions of N domain exons from orthologous genes were calculated after manual editing of sequence gaps or insertions guided by the amino acid sequences applying the SNAP program (Synonymous Nonsynonymous Analysis Program; http://www.hiv.lanl.gov/content/sequence/SNAP/SNAP.html), which uses the modified Nei-Gojobori model with Jukes-Cantor correction. We verified the results using the JCoDa software (http://www.tcnj.edu/nayaklab/jcoda). For the detection of individual sites under positive selection we used the mixed effects model of evolution software (MEME) 42 . 3D modeling was performed with geno3D-release 2 homology modeling software 43 and visualized by the PyMOL software (Schrödinger Inc., New York, US). The N domain of CEACAM32 was modeled using pdb2qsqA-0 and pdp116zA-0 as templates. ethics approval and consent to participate.

Host shifts result in parallel genetic changes when viruses evolve in closely related species,"Host shifts, where a pathogen invades and establishes in a new host species, are a major source of emerging infectious diseases. They frequently occur between related host species and often rely on the pathogen evolving adaptations that increase their fitness in the novel host species. To investigate genetic changes in novel hosts, we experimentally evolved replicate lineages of an RNA virus (Drosophila C Virus) in 19 different species of Drosophilidae and deep sequenced the viral genomes. We found a strong pattern of parallel evolution, where viral lineages from the same host were genetically more similar to each other than to lineages from other host species. When we compared viruses that had evolved in different host species, we found that parallel genetic changes were more likely to occur if the two host species were closely related. This suggests that when a virus adapts to one host it might also become better adapted to closely related host species. This may explain in part why host shifts tend to occur between related species, and may mean that when a new pathogen appears in a given species, closely related species may become vulnerable to the new disease.","a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111

Host shifts-where a pathogen jumps into and establishes in a new host species-are a major source of emerging infectious diseases. RNA viruses seem particularly prone to host shift [1] [2] [3] [4] , with HIV, Ebola virus and SARS coronavirus all having been acquired by humans from other host species [5] [6] [7] . Whilst some pathogens may be pre-adapted to a novel host, there are increasing numbers of examples demonstrating that adaptation to the new host occurs following a host shift [8, 9] . These adaptations may allow a pathogen to enter host cells, increase replication rates, avoid or suppress the host immune response, or optimise virulence or transmission [10, 11] . For example, in the 2013-2016 Ebola virus epidemic in West Africa, a mutation in the viral glycoprotein gene that arose early in the outbreak and rose to high frequency was found to increase infectivity in human cells and decrease infectivity in bats, which are thought to be the source of Ebola virus [12, 13] . Likewise, a switch of a parvovirus from cats to dogs resulted in mutations in the virus capsid that allowed the virus to bind to cell receptors in dogs, but resulted in the virus losing its ability to infect cats [14, 15] .

In some instances adaptation to a novel host relies on specific mutations that arise repeatedly whenever a pathogen switches to a given host. For example, in the jump of HIV-1 from chimps to humans, codon 30 of the gag gene has undergone a change that increases virus replication in humans, and this has occurred independently in all three HIV-1 lineages [5, 16] . Similarly, five parallel mutations have been observed in the two independent epidemics of SARS coronavirus following its jump from palm civets into humans [17] . Similar patterns have been seen in experimental evolution studies, where parallel genetic changes occur repeatedly when replicate viral lineages adapt to a new host species in the lab. For example, when Vesicular Stomatitis Virus was passaged in human or dog cells, the virus evolved parallel mutations when evolved on the same cell type [18] . Likewise, a study passaging Tobacco Etch Potyvirus on four plant species found parallel mutations occurred only when the virus infected the same host species [19] . These parallel mutations provide compelling evidence that these genetic changes are adaptive, with the same mutations evolving independently in response to natural selection [20] . These studies have only used a limited number of hosts, and so do not provide information on how viral evolution occurs across a wide phylogenetic breadth of host species.

The host phylogeny is important for determining a pathogens ability to infect a novel host, with pathogens tending to replicate most efficiently when they infect a novel host that is closely related to their original host [2, [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] . Here, we asked whether viruses acquire the same genetic changes when evolving in the same and closely related host species. We experimentally evolved replicate lineages of an RNA virus called Drosophila C Virus (DCV; Discistroviridae) in 19 species of Drosophilidae that vary in their relatedness and shared a common ancestor approximately 40 million years ago [35, 36] . We then sequenced the genomes of the evolved viral lineages and tested whether the same genetic changes arose when the virus was evolved in closely related host species.

To examine how viruses evolve in different host species we serially passaged DCV in 19 species of Drosophilidae. In total we infected 22,095 adult flies and generated 173 independent replicate lineages (6-10 per host species). We deep sequenced the evolved virus genomes to generate over 740,000 300bp sequence reads from each viral lineage. Out of 8989 sites, 584 contained a SNP with a derived allele frequency >0.05 in at least one viral lineage, and 84 of these were triallelic. None of these variants were found at an appreciable frequency in five sequencing libraries produced from the ancestral virus, indicating that they had spread though populations during the experiment (Fig 1) . In multiple cases these variants had nearly reached fixation (Fig 1) .

We next examined whether the same genetic changes occur in parallel when different populations encounter the same host species. Of the 584 SNPs, 102 had derived allele frequencies >0.05 in at least two viral lineages, and some had risen to high frequencies in multiple lineages (Fig 1) . We estimated the genetic differentiation between viral lineages by calculating F ST . We found that viral lineages that had evolved within the same host were genetically more similar to each other than to lineages from other host species (Fig 2; P<0.001 ). Furthermore, we Each row represents an independent viral lineage. Viruses that evolved in different host species are separated by black horizontal lines. Each column represents a polymorphic site in the DCV genome, and only sites where the derived allele frequency >0.05 in at least two lineages are shown. The intensity of shading represents the derived allele frequency. Sites where there are three alleles have the two derived allele frequencies pooled for illustrative purposes. Sites with SNP frequencies that are significantly correlated among lineages from the same host species are shown by red stars at the bottom the column (permutation test; p<0.05). Open reading frames (ORFs) and viral proteins based on predicted polyprotein cleavage sites [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] are below the x axis. Information on the distribution of mutations across the genome and whether they are synonymous or non-synonymous can be found in the supplementary results. Sites with missing data are shown in white. The phylogeny was inferred under a relaxed molecular clock [33, 43] and the scale axis represents the approximate age since divergence in millions of years (my) based on estimates from: [35, 36] . found no evidence of differences in substitution biases in the different host species (Fisher Exact Test: p = 0.14; see methods), suggesting that this pattern is not driven by changes in the types of mutations in different host species.

To examine the genetic basis of parallel evolution, we individually tested whether each SNP in the DCV genome showed a signature of parallel evolution among viral lineages passaged in the same host species (i.e. we repeated the analysis in Fig 2 for each SNP). We identified 56 polymorphic sites with a significant signal of parallel evolution within the same host species (P<0.05; significantly parallel sites are shown with a red asterisk in Fig 1; the false discovery rate is estimated to be 17% [37] ).

We investigated if viruses passaged through closely related hosts showed evidence of parallel genetic changes. We calculated F ST between all possible pairs of viral lineages that had evolved in different host species. We found that viral lineages from closely related hosts were more similar to each other than viral lineages from more distantly related hosts ( Fig 3A) . This is reflected in a significant positive relationship between virus F ST and host genetic distance viruses that had evolved in these two species were removed from the dataset (within species parallelism: P<0.001; between species parallelism: P = 0.013).

When a pathogen infects a novel host species, it finds itself in a new environment to which it must adapt [4, 8, 10, 44] . When DCV was passaged through different species of Drosophilidae, we found the same genetic changes arose repeatedly in replicate viral lineages in the same host species. Such repeatable parallel genetic changes to the same host environment are compelling evidence that these changes are adaptive [20] . We then examined whether these same genetic changes might occur in closely related host species, as these are likely to present a similar environment for the virus. We found that viruses evolved in closely related hosts were more similar to each other than viruses that evolved in more distantly related species. Therefore, mutations that evolve in one host species frequently arise when the virus infects closely related hosts. This finding of parallel genetic changes in closely related host species suggests that when a virus adapts to one host it might also become better adapted to closely related host species.

Phylogenetic patterns of host adaptation may in part explain why pathogens tend to be more likely to jump between closely related host species. This pattern is seen in nature, where host shifts tend to occur most frequently between closely related hosts, and in laboratory cross-infection studies, where viruses tend to replicate more rapidly when the new host is related to the pathogens natural host [2, [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] . For example, in a large cross-infection experiment involving Drosophila sigma viruses (Rhabdoviridae) isolated from different species of Drosophila, the viruses tended to replicate most efficiently in species closely related to their natural hosts [34] . This suggests that these viruses had acquired adaptations to their host species that benefitted them when they infected closely related species. Our results demonstrate that this pattern is apparent at the level of specific nucleotides, and can arise very shortly after a host shift. While the susceptibility of a novel host is correlated to its relatedness to the pathogens' original host, it is also common to find exceptions to this pattern. This is seen both in nature when pathogens shift between very distant hosts [45, 46] , and in laboratory cross-infection experiments [33, 34] . This pattern is also seen in our data where we also observe parallel genetic changes occurring between more distantly related hosts. For example, a mutation at position 8072 was not only near fixation in most of the lineages infecting two closely related species, but also occurred at a high frequency in replicate lineages in a phylogenetically distant host (Fig 1) .

The function of these mutations is unknown, but in other systems adaptations after host shifts have been found to enhance the ability of the virus to bind to host receptors [11] , increase replication rates [16] or avoid the host immune response [8, 10, 47] . Of the high frequency significant SNPs (shown in Fig 1 with red asterisk) nine occur in the non-structural proteins (ORF1: RNA dependant RNA polymerase, the putative protease and helicase proteins), and eleven occur in the capsid proteins (ORF2). Interestingly, none were in DCV-1A, which suppresses the host antiviral RNAi defences [48] . It will be of interest to examine the functions of the parallel mutations we detected, and characterise phenotypically how they affect viral infectivity and replication.

One mutation rose to a high frequency across all the host species (Fig 1, position 214 in the 3' un-translated region). This is unlikely to be an error in the genome sequencing, as it did not occur when we sequenced the ancestral virus. This may have been due to natural selection favouring this change in all species, perhaps because there was a strongly deleterious mutation at this site in the virus we cloned or due to the virus going from cell culture to being passaged in vivo.

Previous studies have elegantly demonstrated parallel evolution following host shifts (eg [18] ). However, these are often in cell culture, and so do not reflect the heterogeneity of tissue and cell types in whole animals that occur in studies in vivo (although see [49] that suggests otherwise). The complex nature of different tissue types in vivo coupled with a limited number of generations may explain why some parallel SNPs have remained at a low frequency in this study. Following a host shift, viruses must sometimes acquire specific mutations that allow them to be transmitted in their new host [9, 10] . As we artificially inoculated the virus, this aspect of adaptation to a new host is missing from our study.

In conclusion, we have found that host relatedness can be important in determining how viruses evolve when they find themselves in a new host. This study suggests that while some genetic changes will be found only in specific hosts, we frequently see the same changes occurring in closely related host species. These phylogenetic patterns suggest that mutations that adapt a virus to one host may also adapt it to closely related host species. Therefore, there may be a knock-on effect, where a host shift leaves closely related species vulnerable to the new disease.

DCV is a positive sense RNA virus in the family Discistroviridae that was isolated from D. melanogaster, which it naturally infects in the wild [50, 51] . To minimise the amount of genetic variation in the DCV isolate we used to initiate the experimental evolution study, we aimed to isolate single infectious clones of DCV using a serial dilution procedure. DCV was produced in Schneider's Drosophila line 2 (DL2) cells [52] as described in [53] . Cells were cultured at 25˚C in Schneider's Drosophila Medium with 10% Fetal Bovine Serum, 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (all Invitrogen, UK). The DCV strain used was isolated from D. melanogaster collected in Charolles, France [54] . DL2 cells were seeded into two 96-well tissue culture plates at approximately 10 4 cells in 100 μl of media per well. Cells were allowed to adhere to the plates by incubating at 25˚C for five hours or over-night. Serial 1:1 dilutions of DCV were made in complete Schneider's media, giving a range of final dilutions from 1:10 8 -1:4x10 14 . 100 μl of these dilutions were then added to the cells and incubated for 7 days, 8 replicates were made for each DCV dilution. Each well was then examined for DCV infection of the DL2 cells, and a well was scored as positive for DCV infection if clear cytopathic effects were present in the majority of the cells. The media was taken from the wells with the greatest dilution factor that were scored as infected with DCV and stored at -80˚C. This processes was then repeated using the DCV samples from the first dilution series. One clone, B6A, was selected for amplification and grown in cell culture as described above. Media containing DCV was removed and centrifuged at 3000 x g for 5 minutes at 4˚C to pellet any remaining cell debris, before being aliquoted and stored at -80˚C. The Tissue Culture Infective Dose 50 (TCID 50 ) of the DCV was 6.32 x 10 9 infectious particles per ml using the Reed-Muench endpoint method [55] .

We passaged the virus through 19 species of Drosophilidae, with 6-10 independent replicate passages for each species. We selected species from across the phylogeny (that shared a common ancestor approximately 40 million years ago [35, 36] ), but included clades of closely related species that recently shared common ancestors less than 5 million years ago (Fig 1) . All fly stocks were reared at 22˚C. Stocks of each fly species were kept in 250ml bottles at staggered ages. Flies were collected and sexed, and males were placed on cornmeal medium for 4 days before inoculation. Details of the fly stocks used can be found in the supplementary materials.

4-11 day old males were infected with DCV using a 0.0125 mm diameter stainless steel needle (26002-10, Fine Science Tools, CA, USA) dipped in DCV solution. For the first passage this was the cloned DCV isolate in cell culture supernatant (described above), and then subsequently was the virus extracted from the previous passage (described below). The needle was pricked into the pleural suture on the thorax of flies, towards the midcoxa. Each replicate was infected using a new needle and strict general cleaning procedures were used to minimise any risk of cross-contamination between replicates. Species were collected and inoculated in a randomised order each passage. Flies were then placed into vials of cornmeal medium and kept at 22˚C and 70% relative humidity. Flies were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen 3 days post-infection, homogenised in Ringer's solution (2.5μl per fly) and then centrifuged at 12,000g for 10 mins at 4˚C. The resulting supernatant was removed and frozen at -80˚C to be used for infecting flies in the subsequent passage. The remaining homogenate was preserved in Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) and stored at -80˚C for RNA extraction. The 3 day viral incubation period was chosen based on time course and pilot data showing that viral load reaches a maximum at approximately 3 days post-infection. This process was repeated for 10 passages for all species, except D. montana where only 8 passages were carried out due to the fly stocks failing to reproduce. Each lineage was injected into a mean of 11 flies at each passage (range 4-18). Experimental evolution studies in different tissue types have seen clear signals of adaptation in 100 virus generations [18] . Based on log 2 change in RNA viral load we estimate that we have passaged DCV for approximately 100-200 generations.

After passaging the virus, we sequenced evolved viral lineages from 19 host species, with a mean of 9 independent replicate lineages of the virus per species (range 6-10 replicates). cDNA was synthesised using Invitrogen Superscript III reverse-transcriptase with random hexamer primers (25˚C 5mins, 50˚C 50mins, 70˚C 15mins). The genome of the evolved viruses, along with the initial DCV ancestor (x5) were then amplified using Q5 high fidelity polymerase (NEB) in nine overlapping PCR reactions (see supplementary Table S2 for PCR primers and cycle conditions). Primers covered position 62-9050bp (8989bp) of the Genbank refseq (NC_001834.1) giving 97% coverage of the genome. PCRs of individual genomes were pooled and purified with Ampure XP beads (Agencourt). Individual Nextera XT libraries (Illumina) were prepared for each viral lineage. In total we sequenced 173 DCV pooled amplicon libraries on an Illumina MiSeq (Cambridge Genomic Service) v3 for 600 cycles to give 300bp paired-end reads.

FastQC, version 0.11.2 [56] was used to assess read quality and primer contamination. Trimmomatic, version 0.32 [57] was used to removed low quality bases and adaptor sequences, using the To generate a reference ancestral Drosophila C Virus sequence we amplified the ancestral starting virus by PCR as above. PCR products were treated with exonuclease 1 and Antarctic phosphatase to remove unused PCR primers and dNTPs and then sequenced directly using BigDye reagents (ABI) on an ABI 3730 capillary sequencer in both directions (Source Bioscience, Cambridge, UK). Sequences were edited in Sequencher (version 4.8; Gene Codes), and were manually checked for errors. Fastq reads were independently aligned to this reference sequence (Genbank accession: MG570143) using BWA-MEM, version 0.7.10 {Li, 2009 #1605} with default options with exception of the parameter-M, which marks shorter split hits as secondary. 99.5% of reads had mapping phred quality scores of >60. The generated SAM files were converted to their binary format (BAM) and sorted by their leftmost coordinates with SAMtools, version 0.1.19 (website: http://samtools.sourceforge.net/) [58] . Read Group information (RG) was added to the BAM files using the module AddOrReplaceReadGroups from Picard Tools, version 1.126 (https://broadinstitute.github.io/picard).

The variant calling was then performed for each individual BAM using UnifiedGenotyper tool from GATK, version 3.3.0. As we were interested in calling low frequency variants in our viruses, we assumed a ploidy level of 100 (-sample_ploidy:100). The other parameters were set to their defaults except-stand_call_conf:30 (minimum phred-scaled confidence threshold at which variants should be called) and-downsample_to_coverage:1000 (down-sample each sample to 1000X coverage)

We used a trimmed version of a phylogeny produced previously [33] . This time-based tree (where the distance from the root to the tip is equal for all taxa) was inferred using seven genes with a relaxed molecular clock model in BEAST (v1.8.0) [43, 59] . The tree was pruned to the 19 species used using the Ape package in R [60, 61] .

We examined the frequency of alternate alleles (single nucleotide polymorphisms: SNPs) in five ancestral virus replicates (aliquots of the same virus stock that was used to found the evolved lineages). SNPs in these ancestral viruses may represent pre-standing genetic variation, or may be sequencing errors. We found the mean SNP frequency was 0.000923 and the highest frequency of any SNP was 0.043 across the ancestral viruses. We therefore included a SNP in our analyses if its frequency was >0.05 in any of the evolved viral lineages. For all analyses we included all three alleles at triallelic sites.

As a measure of genetic differentiation we estimated F ST between all the virus lineages based on the heterozygosity (H) of the SNPs we called [62] :

where H b is the mean number of differences between pairs of sequence reads sampled from the two different lineages. H w is mean number of differences between sequence reads sampled from within each lineage. H b and H w were calculated separately for each polymorphic site, and the mean across sites used in Eq (1). H w was calculated separately for the two lineages being compared, and the unweighted mean used in Eq (1). To examine whether there had been parallel evolution among viral lineages that had evolved within the same fly species, we calculated the mean F ST between lineages that had evolved in the same fly species, and compared this to the mean F ST between lineages that had evolved in different fly species. We tested whether this difference was statistically significant using a permutation test. The fly species labels were randomly reassigned to the viral lineages, and we calculated the mean F ST between lineages that had evolved in the same fly species. This was repeated 1000 times to generate a null distribution of the test statistic, and this was then compared to the observed value.

To identify individual SNPs with a signature of parallel evolution within species, we repeated this procedure separately for each SNP.

We next examined whether viral lineages that had evolved in different fly species tended to be more similar if the fly species were more closely related. Considering all pairs of viral lineages from different host species, we correlated pairwise F ST with the genetic distance between the fly species. To test the significance of this correlation, we permuted the fly species over the Drosophila phylogeny and recalculated the Pearson correlation coefficient. This was repeated 1000 times to generate a null distribution of the test statistic, and this was then compared to the observed value. To identify individual SNPs whose frequencies were correlated with the genetic distance between hosts we repeated this procedure separately for each SNP.

We confirmed there was no relationship between rates of molecular evolution (SNP frequency) and either genetic distance from the host DCV was isolated from (D. melanogaster) or estimated viral population size (see supplementary S1 and S2 Figs) using generalised linear mixed models that include the phylogeny as a random effect in the MCMCglmm package in R [63] as described previously [34] . We also examined the distribution of SNPs and whether they were synonymous or non-synonymous (see supplementary results).

To test whether there were systematic differences in the types of mutations occurring in the different host species, we classified all the SNPs into the six possible types (A/G, A/T, A/C, G/T, G/C and C/T). We then counted the number of times each type of SNP arose in each host species at a frequency above 5% and in at least one biological replicate (SNPs in multiple biological replicates were only counted once). This resulted in a contingency table with 6 columns and 19 rows. We tested for differences between the species in the relative frequency of the 6 SNP types by simulation [64] .

Sequence data (fastq files) are available in the NCBI SRA (Accession: SRP119720). BAM files, data and R scripts for analysis in the main text are available from the NERC data repository (https://doi.org/10.5285/4434a27d-5288-4f2e-88ac-4b1372e4d073).

A Systems Biology Approach to Infectious Disease Research: Innovating the Pathogen-Host Research Paradigm,"The twentieth century was marked by extraordinary advances in our understanding of microbes and infectious disease, but pandemics remain, food and waterborne illnesses are frequent, multidrug-resistant microbes are on the rise, and the needed drugs and vaccines have not been developed. The scientific approaches of the past-including the intense focus on individual genes and proteins typical of molecular biology-have not been sufficient to address these challenges. The first decade of the twenty-first century has seen remarkable innovations in technology and computational methods. These new tools provide nearly comprehensive views of complex biological systems and can provide a correspondingly deeper understanding of pathogen-host interactions. To take full advantage of these innovations, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases recently initiated the Systems Biology Program for Infectious Disease Research. As participants of the Systems Biology Program, we think that the time is at hand to redefine the pathogen-host research paradigm.","I nfectious diseases continue to be major health concerns worldwide: hepatitis C, AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis (TB) are ongoing pandemics. A third of the world population is currently infected with the TB bacillus; millions of people are infected by influenza virus annually; and even though therapeutic drugs have slowed the threat of HIV-1, there is still no definitive cure or viable vaccine in sight. Although influenza virus vaccines provide protection, they must be reformulated annually, and the time lag from the spread of a pandemic virus to the availability of a vaccine is far too long. A universal vaccine against influenza virus is needed to limit high levels of morbidity and mortality. Newly emerging infectious diseases, such as swine H1N1 influenza, avian H5N1 influenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and dengue fever are a constant threat; and bacterial infections, such as the recurrent Salmonella outbreaks in the food industry, are costly to society.

New research strategies and tactics must be employed to minimize these threats and improve global health. In response to this need, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) has sponsored the Systems Biology Program for Infectious Disease Research. This program consists of four centers, each with its own unique focus on a variety of viral and bacterial pathogens (Fig. 1) . In this perspective, we discuss why the time is right for applying a systems biology approach to infectious disease research and how we are implementing this approach to overcome specific obstacles. This venture requires a new way of thinking about how best to address the challenges of infectious disease research.

Intrinsic to systems biology is the notion that biological systems have ""emergent properties"": that is, their sum is greater than their individual parts, and the biological outcomes of a system cannot be predicted by traditional reductionist methods that study only the individual components (1) . Instead, an understanding of bio-logical systems requires the integration of high-throughput multiomics data (transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, lipidomics, etc.), which are used to construct predictive models of the networks and dynamic interactions between the biological components of the complex pathogen-host system (2) . Through iterative rounds of model development, testing, and filling in the gaps with experimental data, models are refined to provide predictions that can ultimately be used to help identify therapeutic targets and improve clinical outcomes. This iterative cycle of perturbation biology is key to the systems biology approach (Fig. 2 ) and requires the establishment of efficient interdisciplinary collaborations, the building of integrated computational infrastructures, and the generation of self-consistent, comprehensive, and modelspecific experimental data (3) .

The technologies, computational methods, and genome information needed to successfully implement this approach now exist. Technologies such as next-generation sequencing have opened the door to sequencing total transcriptomes, encompassing mi-croRNAs, long noncoding RNAs, and mRNAs. This has raised the possibility that a previously unappreciated class of RNAs-the long noncoding RNAs-may play important roles in the host response to virus infection (4) . Proteomic technologies and accompanying informatics pipelines are evolving rapidly, with throughput and sensitivity approaching that of microarrays. Metabolomics, glycomics, lipidomics, and phosphoproteomics are young and comparatively undeveloped, but the promise is unlimited and the potential unprecedented. Moreover, the appropriate in vitro and in vivo experimental systems to generate useful pathogen-host interaction models are now available. Each of the four NIAID Systems Biology Centers has taken a unique approach to implementing this new research paradigm as outlined below.

The TB Systems Biology Center (http://www.broadinstitute.org /annotation/tbsysbio) at Stanford is using cell culture models, together with a combination of biochemical and transcriptional profiling methods, to characterize the state of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacillus and the host at each stage of its infectious cycle and during transitions between stages. Each of the three stages is orchestrated by a distinct genetic program that directs the expression of stage-specific antigens and the activation of stage-specific metabolic and biosynthetic pathways. There is an unusually close interaction between the pathogen and the host immune system, which depending on the outcome of this interaction, can lead to a stable, inactive, and asymptomatic infection that is compatible with a normal life span (latency) or to rapid destruction of lung tissue and death (reactivation disease). Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-Seq) is one of the key technologies used to identify the regulatory networks that govern these transitions. Incorporation of these data with results from multidimensional assays that interrogate the status of DNA, RNA, proteins, lipids, and metabolites will lead to the construction of predictive models useful in the development of stage-specific therapeutics (8) .

The Systems Virology Center (http://www.systemsvirology .org) at the University of Washington is comprehensively analyzing and modeling the molecular and cellular events, pathogenhost interactions, and cellular response networks induced or altered during the course of respiratory virus infection. This research focuses on highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza virus and severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV). For each virus, the host response to highly pathogenic wild-type viruses and to engineered viruses with reduced levels of pathogenicity is being analyzed and modeled. These studies use cell culture infection systems, which are the most amenable systems for computation modeling, as well as mouse and macaque infection models. Animal models enable the incorporation of disease-relevant complexity and the validation, extension, and refinement of findings obtained from cell culture systems. Designing and performing experiments so that comparisons can be made across the model systems are an integral but labor-intensive part of the process. The direct communication between biologists and modelers-constant within all of the Systems Biology Centersensures that the experimental designs are suitable in terms of biological sample size, reproducibility, and consistency from highthroughput assays to construction of predictive models and the resulting biological interpretations. The question remains as to whether current computational and modeling techniques are robust enough to generate relevant models given the complexities of these systems. However, only by attempting these types of studies will the required methodologies be developed. 

The Center for Systems Influenza (http://www .systemsinfluenza.org) at the Institute for Systems Biology is using multi-omics approaches to compare the responses of both in vitro and in vivo systems to infection with influenza virus strains of various pathogenicities. The devastating mortality of the 1918 influenza pandemic was characterized by both a dysregulated innate immune response and a high susceptibility to secondary bacterial pneumonias. Computational integration of the transcriptomic, proteomic, and lipidomic data into an appropriate network model will illuminate the detailed signatures of extreme virulence and identify the molecular mechanisms underlying these responses. These studies are being extended to identify and model those hostvirus interactions that predispose an infected lung to secondary bacterial invasion by Staphylococcus aureus. A comprehensive model of the influenza virus-host interaction, aided significantly by recent advances in sequencing technologies and advances in viral genetic manipulation, will serve to calibrate the global public health response to a newly emergent strain as well as uncover novel targets for therapeutic intervention.

The Center for Systems Biology for EnteroPathogens (http: //www.sysbep.org/) at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory is using regulatory and metabolic modeling, empowered by multiomics data, to characterize the interactions between the host and distantly related bacterial pathogens Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium and Yersinia species. Salmonella is a leading cause of acute gastroenteritis worldwide, and Yersinia pestis is the causative agent of plague. As general models of infection, Salmonella and Yersinia pestis are among the best characterized with in vitro and in vivo animal models. These bacterial pathogens must use a well-orchestrated series of regulatory and metabolic changes to replicate and persist in the inhospitable host environment. Among these highly regulated processes is the process of secreting bacterial proteins into the host that modulate the host's response network. Early efforts have focused on developing methods to investigate and model the coordinated regulatory and metabolic changes occurring in the pathogen during infection and to identify and characterize the secreted bacterial proteins responsible for manipulating the host networks (5, 6) . Understanding the regulatory and metabolic programs required for infection will enable the development of effective therapeutic treatments in the future.

Criticism of systems biology includes the following: ""it's too slow; it's too expensive; it's a fishing expedition."" We readily admit that systems approaches are currently driven more by technology and computing than by a clear understanding of the data. Indeed, a major challenge is to thoroughly mine the existing data before accumulating even more information. However, critics must be cognizant of the immense challenges involved with this approach. For example, we need to create a new interdisciplinary culture along with a new vocabulary. We need to break down the traditional silos of information present in most scientific research endeavors. We need to merge the experimental with the clinical with FIG 2 Iterative cycles of perturbation biology. The infectious disease questions, the first step in the cycle, determine the appropriate biological models and technologies utilized to generate multidimensional data. Data analysis and integration identify key components, pathways, and networks which allow for the construction of a predictive model. Model-predicted biological bottlenecks or key network nodes are validated by performing additional targeted experiments and data integration, resulting in a refined model. Importantly, several rounds of biological perturbations (i.e., use of mutant pathogens, cellular small interfering RNA [siRNA] knockdowns or knockout mice) are required to produce a predictive model that could be effectively utilized by the general infectious disease community. In addition to a more comprehensive understanding of the host-pathogen response and testable models, this type of perturbation biology will produce publicly disseminated multidimensional data sets and potentially both diagnostic signatures and drug targets. the computational and mathematical. We need to build bridges between diverse members of the scientific community who otherwise do not communicate with each other. The iterative cycle of experimental design, sample preparation, high-throughput assays, and data integration and analysis that is an absolute requirement for an effective systems approach is a lengthy, repetitious, and unglamorous process. But without this iterative progression, predictive and revealing models are not achievable.

We acknowledge that the best response to this criticism is to provide fundamental knowledge directly relevant to human health that could not otherwise be achieved through traditional scientific approaches: better cures and vaccines and better drugs and diagnostics. But just as systems biology differs in many aspects from more traditional basic research approaches, the methods for measuring success also differ. Although publications are one important measurement, an additional measure of success is the utilization of the generated resources by the scientific community, including experimental data sets, software tools, computational models, and research protocols, all made available to the scientific community through the four Centers' and NIAID websites (http: //www.niaid.nih.gov/labsandresources/resources/sb/Pages /default.aspx). We call upon researchers outside the Centers to utilize the vast data sets and other resources being generated to further the knowledge and understanding of pathogen-host interactions.

As highlighted in a recent review, systems biology is already making important contributions to cancer research (7) . The approach has been used to identify network motifs that can accurately predict the development of distant metastases in breast cancer patients-tumors that may develop years after the primary tumor and which frequently prove fatal. A network-centric approach has also identified specific oncogenes in certain types of B-cell lymphomas, and a multiscale mathematical model has been developed to test the efficacy of different radiation protocols, which has led to improvements in radiation therapies for colorectal cancer. The cancer field was one of the first research communities to aggressively embrace (and fund) the use of systems biology. We believe that the infectious disease community will build on the resulting substantial systems biology methodologies and insights to claim similar successes in the near future. We invite your thoughts and comments on this perspective.
