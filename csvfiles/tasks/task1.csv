Environmental Conditions Affect Exhalation of H3N2 Seasonal and Variant Influenza Viruses and Respiratory Droplet Transmission in Ferrets,"The seasonality of influenza virus infections in temperate climates and the role of environmental conditions like temperature and humidity in the transmission of influenza virus through the air are not well understood. Using ferrets housed at four different environmental conditions, we evaluated the respiratory droplet transmission of two influenza viruses (a seasonal H3N2 virus and an H3N2 variant virus, the etiologic virus of a swine to human summertime infection) and concurrently characterized the aerosol shedding profiles of infected animals. Comparisons were made among the different temperature and humidity conditions and between the two viruses to determine if the H3N2 variant virus exhibited enhanced capabilities that may have contributed to the infections occurring in the summer. We report here that although increased levels of H3N2 variant virus were found in ferret nasal wash and exhaled aerosol samples compared to the seasonal H3N2 virus, enhanced respiratory droplet transmission was not observed under any of the environmental settings. However, overall environmental conditions were shown to modulate the frequency of influenza virus transmission through the air. Transmission occurred most frequently at 23°C/30%RH, while the levels of infectious virus in aerosols exhaled by infected ferrets agree with these results. Improving our understanding of how environmental conditions affect influenza virus infectivity and transmission may reveal ways to better protect the public against influenza virus infections.","Influenza viruses display distinct seasonal patterns in temperate climates with peak infection rates occurring in the winter months and little to no influenza virus activity detected at other times of the year [1] . However, it is not completely understood why we have ""flu seasons"". The same seasonal trends do not necessarily apply to regions in tropic and subtropic climates where influenza virus activity can be detected year round. Social and health factors such as indoor crowding and seasonal fluctuations in host immunity have been offered as explanations for influenza seasonality, but the lack of direct evidence supporting these theories suggests that the environment may be the most relevant contributor and potential driving force of seasonality [1, 2] . Although seasonal influenza viruses display predictable infection patterns, the four most recent influenza virus pandemics began with newly emerged viruses appearing outside the usual influenza season (1918 Spanish Influenza A H1N1, 1957 -1958 Asian Influenza A H2N2, 1968 Hong Kong Influenza A H3N2, 2009 H1N1) [3, 4] . Emergence of the most recent pandemic virus was preceded by reports of sporadic infections of a swine-origin H1N1 virus in young individuals [4, 5] . During the summers of 2010-2014, reports have emerged in the Midwest region of the U.S. of H3N2 variant influenza virus infections in children with a recent history of exposure to swine [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] . These events highlight the importance of closely monitoring emerging strains of influenza viruses throughout the year and the need for our improved understanding of the effects of environmental conditions like temperature and humidity on influenza virus transmission.

There are three generally accepted modes of influenza virus transmission [11] . Aerosol transmission occurs via respirable particles (<5 μm) that may remain suspended in the air for prolonged periods of time thus increasing the opportunity for them to be inhaled. Droplet transmission occurs when larger droplets (>5 μm), typically expelled during coughing or sneezing, encounter the upper respiratory tract or ocular mucosa of a susceptible individual. Lastly, contact transmission involves directly touching an infected host or contaminated surface. The relative contribution of these modes of transmission to the overall spread of influenza viruses and the role of environmental conditions is not completely understood. However, recent studies in human volunteers support a role for aerosols in influenza virus transmission [12, 13] .

Temperature and humidity are inextricably linked when considering their effects on evaporation rates and on infectious particle dynamics [14] . Although the majority of reports of increased virus viability in low humidity have been focused on relative humidity (RH), it has been demonstrated that there is also a relationship between influenza virus seasonality and absolute humidity (AH) [15] . RH is the ratio of water vapor in the air to the maximum amount the air can hold at a particular temperature. AH represents the mass of water vapor present within a unit of air [1, 15] . Previous in vitro studies have demonstrated that influenza viruses in droplets and aerosols maintain viability better at low humidity [16, 17] . Animal models have also been used to address the role of environmental conditions on influenza virus transmission and have shown that low temperature and RH environments support transmission among guinea pigs [18] . The ferret model has become an invaluable tool for evaluating virulence and transmissibility of influenza viruses and is a critical component of risk assessments performed on emerging influenza viruses that pose a risk to public health [19] . To more clearly understand the influence of temperature and humidity on influenza virus in exhaled aerosols and on transmission, we housed ferrets under four distinct environmental conditions and evaluated the respiratory droplet (RD) transmission of two highly transmissible H3N2 influenza viruses: A/Panama/2007/1999 (PN99), a seasonal H3N2 virus, and A/Indiana/8/2011 (IN11), an H3N2 variant (H3N2v), triple-reassortant swine influenza virus containing the 2009 pandemic H1N1 M gene that was isolated from a human in the summer of 2011 [7] . During these transmission experiments, the aerosol particle size distribution and the levels of infectious virus exhaled from infected ferrets were also assessed. Here, we demonstrate that the amount of influenza virus exhaled by infected ferrets and, ultimately, RD transmission are influenced by the temperature and humidity in which the animals are housed. These findings draw attention to the importance of climatic effects on influenza virus transmission and the potential for temperature and humidity to play a role in the emergence of influenza viruses that pose a risk to public health.

All ferret procedures were approved by Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and in an Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International-accredited facility. Animal studies were performed in accordance with the IACUC guidelines under protocol #2234MAI-FERC: ""Transmissibility of influenza viruses with pandemic potential"".

Virus stocks of A/Panama/2007/1999 (H3N2) were propagated in the allantoic cavity of 10 day old embryonated hens' eggs while A/Indiana/8/2011 (H3N2v) was grown in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells (MDCK) as previously described [20] . Titers of virus stocks were determined by standard plaque assay using MDCK cells and are reported as plaque-forming units (pfu)/mL.

Male Fitch ferrets 5-11 months of age (Triple F Farms), serologically negative by hemagglutination-inhibition (HI) assay for currently circulating influenza viruses, were housed during each experiment in cages placed inside a custom environmental chamber (Bahnson Environmental Specialties, Raleigh, NC) with HEPA filtration operating at 20 air changes per hour. Experiments were conducted at four environmental settings with consideration for the comfort of the animals: 5°C/70%RH (4.8 g/m 3 AH); 23°C/30%RH (6.2 g/m 3 AH); 23°C/50%RH (10.3 g/ m 3 AH) and 23°C/70%RH (14.4 g/m 3 AH). Prior to inoculation, ferrets were allowed to acclimatize inside the chamber for at least four days. Baseline temperatures were measured using an implantable subcutaneous temperature transponder (BioMedic Data Systems, Seaford, DE) and baseline serum, weight and minute volume (MV) of respiration measurements were collected as described [20, 21] .

For each virus and each condition, three ferrets were sedated with a ketamine/zylazine/atropine hydrochloride cocktail injection and were presented with 10 3.8 to 10 5.5 pfu of aerosolized virus as described [21] using an aerosol exposure system with an AeroMP management platform (Biaera Technologies, Hagerstown, MD). Inoculations were performed at ambient laboratory temperatures (21±1°C) and at the corresponding experimental RH. Aerosol presented dose (PD) refers to the amount of virus inhaled by the animal, not necessarily the amount that is deposited within the respiratory tract. PD is based on the time of exposure, baseline MV of respiration of the animal and the aerosolized virus concentrations achieved during the exposure session.

RD transmission was assessed for each virus at each of four environmental conditions. Experiments were conducted using animal cages modified with perforated side walls which allow transmission of virus through the air while preventing direct or indirect contact between inoculated and naïve ferrets. Airflow velocity was measured inside the cages housed within the chamber using a hot wire anemometer with a telescopic probe (General Tools, New York, NY) and was found to be negligible (<0.05 m/s) for all of the cages. One day post inoculation (dpi) a naïve ferret was placed in a cage adjacent to each inoculated animal. Nasal washes (NW) were collected every other day for up to 11 dpi or days post contact (dpc) [22] for virus titration by standard plaque assay in MDCK cells [23] . Clinical signs of infection including weight loss, fever and activity levels [22] were recorded daily for inoculated and contact animals. Sneezing frequency in animals was not audible from inside the chamber and therefore was not recorded. MV of respiration was measured on 2, 4 and 6 dpi using whole-body plethysmography (Buxco) in inoculated animals. At the experimental endpoint, ferrets were sedated and euthanatized by injection of a euthanasia agent containing pentobarbital. Transmission was confirmed by seroconversion via hemagglutination inhibition assay using sera collected from animals at least 18 days after exposure.

Three inoculated ferrets from each experiment were anesthetized and exhaled aerosol samples were collected and analyzed for size distribution using an aerodynamic particle sizer (APS; TSI Inc, Shoreview, MN). Aerosol samples were collected from ferrets immediately after exhalation on 2, 4 and 6 dpi for 15 minutes of closed-mouth, normal breathing and for 5 minutes of induced sneezing as described [24] . Size distribution data represent the total particle counts or volumes collected for aerosols with aerodynamic diameters in the range of 0.5-20 μm. Volume data were derived using the DistFit software package (Chimera Technologies).

Exhaled aerosols from inoculated animals were analyzed for infectious virus using a viable two-stage cascade impactor (Tisch Environmental, Cleves, OH) on 1, 3, and 5 dpi as described with modifications [24] . Aerosols were collected from ferrets immediately after exhalation for 15 minutes of normal breathing and 5 minutes of sneezing and separated onto two stages by size (>4.7 μm or 0.65-4.7 μm). Aerosol samples were immediately processed by plaque assay without dilution and RNA extraction for real-time RT-PCR as described [24] . Influenza virus M gene RNA copy numbers were extrapolated using a standard curve based on samples of known virus titer (pfu/mL).

The effects of the aerosol collection procedure on influenza virus recovery was evaluated in duplicate by applying a known amount of virus (10 2 -10 3 pfu) directly on prepared impactor plates and placing the impactor assembly inside the environmental chamber at one of the four environmental conditions [24] . Using a vacuum, air was then pulled through the impactor for 15 minutes or 5 minutes to reflect the collection times for normal breathing or sneezing, respectively. The aerosol collection media was harvested and processed as described for ferret sample collection to determine the percentage of RNA and infectious virus recovered. These recovery rates were used to estimate the amount of virus exhaled by ferrets at all of the time points in which infectious virus was detected.

Linear mixed models were used to estimate the means and differences in means for weight loss and aerosol volume data. Square root transformation of the aerosol volume data was needed to normalize the values. Further, because the weight loss data at any given time point was dependent on the previous time point data collection, a repeated measures model was utilized to estimate the respective means. To best determine the relationship between mean weight loss and ferret housing condition, the following independent variables were included in the model: ferret housing condition and day of weight measurement. For models associated with the aerosol volume data, the independent parameters included were: virus, ferret housing condition, and exhaled aerosol sample size. An interaction term was also included in the model to evaluate whether aerosol volume data varied based on virus, ferret housing condition, and exhaled aerosol sample size. Lastly, a Poisson regression model was used to estimate the means and differences in means for aerosol virus count data. The independent variables in the Poisson models included: virus, ferret housing condition, exhaled aerosol sample size and interaction terms. The interaction terms between independent variables were developed so as to allow for the testing of mean differences between groups or conditions. A p-value of <0.05 was considered significant. Analyses were performed using SAS software version 9.3 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC).

During RD transmission experiments, six ferrets were housed in an environmental chamber set to one of four experimental conditions (5°C/70%RH, 23°C/30%RH, 23°C/50%RH, or 23°C/ 70%RH) ( Table 1 ) and allowed to acclimatize for at least four days prior to each experiment. The temperature and humidity settings were chosen to represent a range of conditions with consideration for the functional limitations of the chamber and the tolerance level of the animals. For each condition, three ferrets were inoculated by aerosol inhalation with 10 3.8 -10 5.5 pfu of PN99 or IN11 virus (Table 1) . One dpi, a naïve ferret was placed in an adjacent cage to an inoculated ferret, each cage with a perforated side wall, allowing for the transfer of Data shown represent infected, contact animals only. c NW, Nasal wash titer (log 10 pfu/mL) ± SD is shown. respiratory droplets through the air while preventing any direct or indirect contact between the animal pairs. Inoculated and contact animals were monitored for clinical signs of infection for up to 11 dpi or dpc to establish differences in morbidity in ferrets housed under each environmental condition.

Regardless of the inoculum, changes in activity levels in infected animals were minor (relative inactivity indexes ranged from 1.0-1.2) while anorexia and nasal discharge were the most common clinical signs observed in ferrets housed at any of the controlled environmental settings. Peak temperatures were detected 2-3 dpi in inoculated animals and ranged from 1.2-2.4°C above baseline for PN99 virus and 1.9-3.3°C above baseline for IN11 virus ( Table 1) . MV of respiration was measured by plethysmography at 0, 2, 4 and 6 dpi for each inoculated animal ( Fig 1A) . Respiration patterns were generally similar for PN99 and IN11 virus-inoculated ferrets housed at any of the environmental conditions with MV peaking 2 dpi for most of the animals and the largest change in respiration of ferrets in the IN11 virus group housed at 23°C/ 30%RH. Mean maximum weight loss in PN99 virus-inoculated ferrets was greatest (15.3-16.5%), although not significantly (p = 0.489), at the lower AH settings. Mean maximum weight loss was more similar across the environmental conditions for animals in the IN11 virus group, ranging from 10.7-13.4% (Table 1 , Fig 1B) . Weight loss observed in animals infected after exposure to inoculated animals (i.e. infected contacts) was not as severe, with mean maximum values 8.7% for all groups ( Table 1 , Fig 1C) , presumably due to differences in dose received by these animals compared to inoculated ferrets. Furthermore, uninfected animals from the transmission experiments exhibited minimal weight loss regardless of housing condition ( Fig 1D) . Together these data show that while the housing conditions alone did not result in considerable weight loss in any of the animals, morbidity in inoculated animals may have been enhanced under certain conditions compared to those animals that were infected from exposure to inoculated ferrets.

RD transmission experiments were performed at each environmental setting to assess the ability of PN99 and IN11 viruses to transmit through the air among ferrets housed under different environmental conditions. Successful transmission was noted when virus was detected in nasal wash samples within 11 dpc and hemagglutination inhibition antibody titers against homologous virus were detected in convalescent serum collected after 18 dpc. Mean peak NW titers ranged from 10 4.2 to 10 4.8 pfu/mL in ferrets inoculated with PN99 virus and were 3-24 times higher (10 5.2 to 10 5.7 pfu/mL) in ferrets inoculated with IN11 virus housed under the respective environmental condition; the greatest difference was observed at the 23°C/70%RH condition ( Table 1, Fig 2) . Virus was first detected in NW samples from all inoculated animals by 1-3 dpi and was cleared by 7 dpi in all PN99 virus-inoculated animals, except for one ferret housed at 23°C/30%RH, and by 9 dpi in all but one ferret in the IN11 virus group housed at 23°C/70% RH (Fig 2) . Overall, levels of virus shedding in NW samples were higher in the IN11 virus-inoculated animals compared to PN99 virus. Linear regression models using area under the curve values were used to determine if any of the environmental conditions served as a significant driving force for the observed differences in NW virus titers between the two viruses. Comparisons made between the virus groups was significant (p = 0.0004) but differences between the conditions was not (p = 0.4243) indicating that any observed differences between NW virus titers at any of the environmental conditions was related more to the virus than to the environmental condition itself. Fig 2) . At 5°C/70% RH, transmission occurred in 1 of 3 ferrets exposed to PN99 virus-infected animals by 3 dpc and no transmission was observed in the IN11 virus contact group. Trace levels of IN11 virus were detected among some animals late in the course of infection but without seroconversion. The frequency of transmission events at 23°C/30%RH was greatest with 2 of 3 ferrets for PN99 virus by 3-5 dpc and 3 of 3 ferrets for IN11 virus by 3 dpc. One of the animals in the pair that One day later, a naïve, contact ferret was placed in a cage adjacent to each inoculated animal. Nasal washes were collected from ferrets every two days for up to 11 days and virus titers were assessed by plaque assay. Solid bars represent data from inoculated ferrets, n = 3, and hatched bars represent contact ferret data. The mean ± SD is shown and the limit of virus detection is 100pfu/mL. Frequency of transmission events is shown as an inset on each panel and represents the number of contact animals that shed virus and seroconverted. did not transmit PN99 virus had an unknown underlying condition that required euthanasia at 7 dpi which may have affected transmission between this pair. At 23°C/50%RH, 1 of 3 PN99 virus-infected animals transmitted virus to a contact animal after 5 dpc while no transmission occurred in the IN11 virus group despite detection of baseline levels of virus 1-3 dpc but without seroconversion. It is not clear why productive infections did not occur in these animals. Transmission was detected by 3 dpc in 2 of 3 ferret pairs at 23°C/70%RH in both the PN99 and IN11 virus groups. Virus was cleared in all contact animals by 11 dpc except for a single ferret housed at 23°C/70%RH that had >10 5 pfu/mL of IN11 virus in the NW sample for that day. Collectively, the frequency of RD transmission events was similar between the two viruses at any of the environmental conditions and transmission occurred least often among ferrets housed at 5°C/70%RH and 23°C/50%RH at 17%, while transmission frequency was highest at 83% under the 23°C/30%RH environmental conditions and was 67% at 23°C/70%RH.

Respiratory secretions exhaled into the air serve as the vehicle for influenza viruses to transmit between hosts in the absence of direct or indirect contact. To assess the effects of temperature and humidity on the size distribution of aerosols exhaled from ferrets infected by PN99 or IN11 virus, an APS was used to measure the aerodynamic diameter of particles present in aerosol samples collected on 2, 4 and 6 dpi from ferrets housed at each controlled environmental condition. Aerosol particle counts in exhaled breath were highly variable among ferrets but, for all animals, peaked in the respirable size range (Fig 3) . During 15 minutes of normal breathing, aerosol particle counts were highest 4 dpi; significance at this time point was found among all ferret groups (p<0.0001) except PN99 virus at 5°C/70%RH and IN11 virus at 23°C/30%RH (Fig 3A) . Overall, particle counts were lowest at the lowest RH condition (23°C/30%RH) (p<0.0001) which is probably because a greater proportion of the aerosol particles are <0.5 μm, below the detection limit of the APS, due to evaporation. During 5 minutes of sneezing stimulation, much more variability was observed between ferrets and between conditions (Fig 3B) . Because aerosols were collected for size distribution analysis on days 2, 4 and 6 postinoculation and nasal wash samples were collected on days 1, 3 and 5 post-inoculation, the kinetics of increased aerosol shedding cannot be linked to the time point at which transmission was observed for each animal. In fact, the highest numbers of aerosol particle counts were measured during normal breathing on 4 dpi in the IN11 virus group housed at 5C/70%RH ( Fig 3A) and no transmission was observed in these animals ( Fig 2B, Table 1 ). Particle counts in sneezing samples were highest at 23C/70%RH for both virus groups but transmission occurred among 67% of ferret pairs at this setting.

To further compare aerosol shedding among environmental conditions, the volume of aerosols <5 μm and 5 μm exhaled by naïve animals was measured and, in general, increased with AH ( Fig 4A) . Volume data from inoculated animals at all time-points after inoculation were normalized to the respective ferret's naïve level of aerosol shedding at each environmental setting and were compared between viruses (Fig 4B and 4C ). Normal breathing sampling showed similar volumes of exhaled aerosols between PN99 and IN11 viruses with the exception of IN11 virus-inoculated ferrets housed at 5°C/70%RH for both aerosol particle size ranges (<5 μm and 5 μm) (Fig 4B) . This increase was primarily represented in the sample collected at 4 dpi (Fig 3A) . Sneezing samples were more variable but still followed a similar trend between virus groups (Fig 4C) . These data indicate that the size distribution of aerosols exhaled by inoculated ferrets did not differ consistently between the PN99 and IN11 virus groups and that the volume of aerosols exhaled by naïve animals generally increased with increasing AH. The overall volume of aerosols collected from ferrets did not appear to be associated with the frequency of transmission events among ferrets housed at the respective environmental settings.

Any successful aerosol transmission event requires that infectious virus pass through the air from a contagious host to a susceptible one. Using methods designed to maintain the viability of infectious virus in aerosols, sampling of the exhaled breath of ferrets was performed and comparisons were made among the amounts of infectious virus exhaled by influenza virus infected ferrets housed under the controlled environmental conditions. Aerosols were collected for 15 minutes of normal breathing and 5 minutes of sneezing and separated into two size ranges (>4.7 μm and 0.65-4.7 μm) on 1, 3 and 5 dpi and then quantified for influenza virus by plaque assay as well as real-time RT-PCR. Infectious virus detected at any time point and in either size range in normal breathing samples was 10 pfu (Fig 5A) and in sneezing samples was 34 pfu (Fig 5B) . The overall normal breathing grand mean values were lowest at 23°C/50% RH (Fig 5A) while other conditions were similar but slightly higher, and little difference was observed between the two size ranges (<4.7 μm and 4.7 μm). With few exceptions, the levels of IN11 virus measured were higher compared to PN99 virus at the respective housing conditions, similar to NW titer comparison results (Fig 2) . Likewise, in most cases, IN11 virus RNA Environmental Conditions Affect Influenza Transmission in Ferrets levels were higher in these samples compared to PN99 virus. This was most evident in the higher humidity conditions during normal breathing ( Fig 6A) and nearly all of the sneezing samples (Fig 6B) .

The impact of the aerosol collection procedure on virus recovery was tested for each controlled environmental condition by spiking the collection medium on each impactor stage with known quantities of virus. After air was pulled through the impactor for 15 or 5 minutes, to represent normal breathing and sneezing sampling times, respectively, the collection medium was harvested and processed as described for the ferret samples. PN99 virus RNA recovery from either stage and for the 15 and 5 minute collection times ranged from 54 to 79%, similar to IN11 virus RNA recovery which was 47 to 81% (Fig 7) . Infectious virus recovery was somewhat more variable at 15 to 62% for PN99 virus and 11 to 37% for IN11 virus. While the recovery rates of RNA illustrate the physical loss of material due to the collection procedure, the loss of infectious virus account for the additional loss due to the inactivation of virus during the collection procedure. However, because virus was applied directly to the gelatin medium, these Environmental Conditions Affect Influenza Transmission in Ferrets recovery rates do not necessarily reflect virus susceptibility to the environmental conditions while in an aerosol state but do serve as a means to more accurately estimate the levels of infectious virus exhaled by ferrets during the sampling sessions. Based on these recovery rates, the total amounts (<4.7 μm and 4.7 μm combined) of infectious virus exhaled by individual animals during 15 minutes of normal breathing peaked between 7 and 42 pfu for PN99 virus and between 50 and 73 pfu for IN11 virus for all of the environmental conditions tested (Fig 8A) . Comparison of mean values between PN99 and IN11 viruses revealed that during normal breathing, regardless of the environmental condition, IN11 yielded greater levels of infectious virus (p = 0.001). Overall, the levels of infectious influenza virus were significantly lower at 23°C/50%RH compared to all other groups (p<0.0001) and 23°C/30%RH was significantly higher than all other groups (p<0.01). As expected, sneezing samples were much more variable, but IN11 virus levels were again higher (Fig 8B) . These findings support those derived from NW titer comparisons and confirm that, although the overall amount of IN11 virus being exhaled was greater than PN99 virus, no single environmental condition we chose for housing animals had a significant influence on virus shedding and ultimately on transmission for one virus compared to the other. However, collectively, influenza virus was exhaled during normal breathing in the greatest amount at the 23°C/30%RH condition and the lowest amount at the 23°C/50%RH condition, the same environmental settings at which RD transmission was most and least frequent, respectively.

The influence that temperature and humidity have on aerosolized influenza virus and the consequence for transmission remain poorly understood despite the potential impact on the seasonality of influenza epidemics in the temperate regions of the world. Climatic conditions in tropical regions of the world represent a different set of parameters affecting transmission, and furthermore, routes of transmission not involving airborne virus (e.g. direct or indirect contact) demonstrate the complexity of global influenza virus transmission and the multitude of potential mechanisms at play each impacted differently by environmental conditions. Here, we Environmental Conditions Affect Influenza Transmission in Ferrets evaluated the transmissibility of two H3N2 influenza viruses (PN99 and IN11) using ferrets housed under diverse environmental conditions and concurrently evaluated the aerosol shedding profiles of infected animals. We compared the two virus groups to each other and then combined them to identify common differences at each environmental condition. Higher levels Environmental Conditions Affect Influenza Transmission in Ferrets of IN11 virus were measured in ferret nasal washes and in exhaled aerosol samples compared to PN99 virus but overall, we found little difference in the transmission capabilities of the two viruses at any of the environmental conditions with transmission most frequently observed at 23°C/30%RH (83%) and least frequently observed at 23°C/50%RH and 5°C/70%RH (17%).

The viruses chosen for this study were selected because one represents a seasonal H3N2 strain (PN99 virus), the other one is a swine-origin H3N2 variant strain (IN11 virus) responsible for a summertime infection [7, 25] and both were previously shown to be highly transmissible in the ferret model under normal laboratory conditions [26] [27] [28] . Since 2011, H3N2v viruses that possess the M gene segment from the A/(H1N1)pdm09 virus have been isolated from humans and have resulted in over 300 cases in the U.S., primarily in the summer months and in children <10 years of age with a recent history of exposure to pigs [9] . In the years preceding the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, swine-origin H1N1 viruses also caused sporadic infections in young individuals at different times of the year, including the summer [4, 5] . This prophetic prelude to the 2009 pandemic stresses the importance of improving our understanding of the transmissibility of H3N2v viruses under different environmental conditions. Epidemiological data suggest that the summertime pattern of H3N2v virus infections is associated with the opportunistic occasion of agricultural fairs that often bring people and pigs together [9] . Individuals 10 years of age and older generally possess some cross-protective immunity to H3N2 viruses providing an explanation for why most of the cases were reported in children under this age [29, 30] . However, because the H3N2v human infections were mainly reported during the summer months, comparisons were made in the current study between PN99 and IN11 viruses to explore the potential for enhanced H3N2v virus transmission in a warm, humid environment compared to a virus known to exhibit typical seasonal infection patterns. Although higher levels of H3N2v virus were detected in nasal washes and aerosols exhaled by ferrets housed at the 23°C/70%RH setting compared to the seasonal H3N2 virus (PN99), no difference in the frequency of transmission was observed for the virus pair, indicating that this H3N2v virus has no enhanced ability to transmit under these conditions. In a previous study using the guinea pig model, transmission of PN99 influenza virus through the air was eliminated when animals were housed at 30°C [31] but it is unclear whether a difference between IN11 and PN99 virus transmissibility would reveal itself under warmer housing conditions in the ferret model. Ferrets are naturally cold weather animals and do not tolerate exposure to extremely warm conditions (26°C) for prolonged periods of time; they are optimally housed at temperatures of 4-18°C and 40-65% RH [32] . Therefore, we chose housing conditions with this in mind and found that none of our conditions (5°C/70%RH, 23°C/30%RH, 23°C/50%RH, 23°C/ 70%RH) resulted in substantial morbidity in uninfected ferrets.

Any successful transmission event through the air requires that virus pass from an infected host to a susceptible one while maintaining infectivity. As this occurs, aerosols are released from the warm, humid environment of a respiratory tract, through the ambient conditions outside of the host and eventually reach the warm, humid environment of a recipient's respiratory tract. Depending on the ambient conditions and the solute composition of the aerosol, evaporation and condensation processes may have deleterious effects on any virus present in the aerosols [16] . Using coughing and breathing simulators in a recreated examination room, researchers demonstrated that influenza virus infectivity is markedly reduced at 43%RH [17] . Similarly, the infectivity of influenza virus aerosolized at 40%RH was significantly impacted [33] . Transmission studies using guinea pigs revealed reduced RD transmission capabilities of influenza virus at 50%RH [18] . In the current study using the ferret model, reduced RD transmission was also observed (down to 17% with both virus groups combined) at 50%RH. Further, we observed lower levels of infectious virus present in aerosols exhaled by infected animals but not in nasal wash samples collected from ferrets housed at 23°C/50%RH demonstrating the added advantage of including the analysis of aerosol samples as a parameter in influenza transmission studies. At 70%RH (with a consistent 23°C setting), RD transmission frequency was somewhat improved to 67% but was most efficient at the low humidity, 30%RH, setting. Under cold conditions (5°C) and 70%RH, RD transmission was rare, occurring between 17% of ferret pairs. However, the levels of infectious virus measured in aerosols exhaled by ferrets at 5°C/70%RH were not reduced, unlike our observations of animals housed at 23°C/ 50%RH. This disparity may be explained by the fact that water vapor released into a cold, humid environment can quickly convert to a liquid [34] . In other words, we can speculate that as the animal exhales air from the warm, humid environment of their respiratory tract, it encounters the colder ambient air (5°C/70%RH), which may cause some of the exhaled aerosol particles to essentially ""grow"" by condensation, thereby increasing the settling velocity of those exhaled droplets [34] . Thus, the frequency of transmission events occurring through the air at 5°C/70%RH is reduced but aerosols collected immediately after being exhaled by the animal do not show any reduction in the levels of infectious virus. Experiments conducted in guinea pigs housed at 5°C and 65%RH or 80%RH displayed successful RD transmission 50% of the time but directional airflow used during those experiments may have assisted the transport of virusladen aerosols from infected animals to their uninfected counterparts [18] . However, both guinea pig and ferret studies concur that RD transmission is most efficient in low RH environments. Mechanisms have been proposed to explain the loss of infectivity of influenza virus aerosolized at mid-range RH settings (reviewed in [14] ). As water evaporates from aerosol particles, the solute components become more concentrated which can have damaging effects on influenza virus being carried within those aerosols. At high humidity environments, evaporation is minimal, but at low humidity environments, below the efflorescence RH (~50%RH), the solute components crystallize rendering the virus intact and viable [16] . This may be the reason why we observed reduced exhaled infectious influenza virus and ultimately reduced frequency of RD transmission in ferrets housed at 23°C/50%RH. Detection of influenza virus in exhaled aerosols has been largely limited to the detection of viral genetic material via RT-PCR with few reporting infectious virus detection in humans [12, 13] or laboratory animals [35, 36] . We previously developed a method to collect size-segregated, exhaled aerosols from ferrets using a cascade impactor and measure the total amount of infectious influenza virus present [24] . Those experiments were conducted under normal laboratory conditions (21°C/30%RH) without the use of an environmental chamber, and we found similar results as reported here for ferrets housed at the 23°C/30%RH setting, including efficient RD transmission of PN99 and IN11 viruses [26] [27] [28] . Because there is unavoidable loss of viral material during our aerosol collection and processing procedure, recovery rates were derived to provide improved estimations of the amounts of virus in the exhaled breath of infected ferrets. Comparison of these estimated levels of virus were as follows: 23°C/30%RH > 23°C/ 70%RH > 5°C/70%RH > 23°C/50%RH, similar to the overall frequency of RD transmission (83%, 67%, 17%, 17%, respectively). Unlike normal breathing samples, the levels of influenza virus measured at each condition during sneezing sessions was not consistent with the frequency of transmission events (i.e. the greatest amount was measured at 23°C/50%RH), suggesting that the virus released during normal breathing may be more instrumental in influenza transmission through the air. It has been suggested that although sneezing and coughing events send more aerosols into the air per maneuver compared to normal breathing, over the course of an entire day, significantly more aerosols will be released during normal breathing because breathing is continuous [37] . Furthermore, the substantial heterogeneity in aerosols generated by ferrets during sneezing usually confounds analysis of data obtained from these highly variable samples. Despite these challenges, increased sneezing is routinely reported in ferrets infected by influenza viruses [26, 38, 39] so the contribution of virus-laden aerosols expelled by ferrets during sneezing to transmission cannot be ruled out for this animal model.

In the temperate regions of the world, people spend the vast majority of their time indoors, especially during the winter months where the environment is typically maintained at a warm temperature and low RH [1] . This scenario sets the stage for influenza virus transmission through the air by providing favorable conditions for maintaining virus viability in aerosols while, due to high evaporation rates, creating a large fraction of respirable particles capable of prolonged suspension in the air [1] . Improving our understanding of how environmental conditions modulate influenza virus infectivity and transmission could help reveal mechanisms that can be exploited to develop novel prevention strategies that better protect people from influenza virus infection. There are inherent limitations in the techniques used to evaluate the role of bioaerosols in influenza virus transmission. Most notably, we are challenged with isolating infectious influenza virus from aerosol samples collected from the exhaled breath of infected hosts at levels high enough for meaningful evaluation. Collection times typically represent brief snapshots within the overall kinetics of virus shedding. Unfortunately, increasing collection times often compromise aerosol collection efficiency and the preservation of virus infectivity. Innovative strategies in multiple laboratories are being pursued to improve these techniques [12, 35, 40, 41] . Additionally, even the most suitable animal model will not always accurately represent the presentation of influenza virus infection in humans and ethical responsibilities necessitate the use of a minimum number of animals. Nevertheless, knowledge gained through controlled animal studies using both virological and aerobiological techniques will ultimately further our understanding of influenza virus infection and transmission in the diverse environmental conditions experienced throughout the year and around the world.

Host genetics determine susceptibility to avian influenza infection and transmission dynamics,"antibody. Genetic resistance to a novel H9N2 virus was less robust, though significant differences between host genotypes were still clearly evident. The existence of host-genetic determination of the outcome of influenza infection offers tools for the further dissection of this regulation and also for understanding the mechanisms of influenza transmission within and between birds.","immunological reagents 4 . Mice have been widely employed to study host-genetic determinants and have helped to identify many candidates of the genetic host regions involved 9, 12 , including the influence of Mx gene in susceptibility to influenza 10 . However, it is a poor model for virus transmission 13 . The chicken is a natural host of AIV and obviates the need to use model species.

In humans an association has been broadly described between MHC haplotypes and the outcome of infectious diseases 14 . Similarly in chickens, strong associations have been reported between the MHC haplotype (or B haplotype) and resistance and susceptibility to viral, bacterial and parasitic pathogens 15, 16 . Although a heritable association to susceptibility to influenza in humans has been described there are no definitive reports of individual genetic variability in relation to influenza disease and its outcomes 17 . The few studies addressing this question in birds have yielded disparate results, the analysis of field infection with H5N1 HPAI suggesting a hierarchy of survival based on the B haplotype, with B21 giving complete protection from mortality 18 , whilst experimental infection of congenic lines suggested that B21 conferred only partial protection of between 60% and 30% and that non-MHC genes might also be important 19 . In the earlier study B12 appeared to be associated with high susceptibility. The discovery of the existence and mechanism of robust genetic resistance to AIV would be of substantial value in protecting birds from infection and being the source of mutated human pandemic virus. On the basis of these putative resistance and susceptibility associations we studied the infection of Line 0 birds (B21) compared with Line C-B12 (B12) 20 . Genetic resistance to infection, viral transmission, route of infection and regulation by immune responses were all subject to investigation. As the majority of incursions of avian influenza in Europe have been of H7N7 we used a virus of this serotype for the detailed analysis of genetic resistance and made comparison with two strains of H9N2 viruses that are endemic in Asia.

We observed clear differences in the shedding trajectories, measured by qRT-PCR, of an H7N7 LPAI virus, (A/Turkey/England/647/77) between two inbred lines of bird experimentally infected through the nares. In the case of Line 0 birds, viral shedding from the oropharynx decreased steadily from the second day post infection (DPI) and stopped one week later. Oropharyngeal shedding in Line C-B12 birds was significantly higher from day 5 post-infection (p < 0.001) and continued throughout the 3 weeks experiment (Fig. 1A ). There was a complete absence of the virus in cloacal swabs from Line 0 birds, while C-B12 birds showed a clear shedding of virus from this route for the entire three week period of the experiment (Fig. 1B) . These effects were independent of the viral dose, as a lower dose of infection produced similar differences in oropharyngeal and cloacal swabs ( Supplementary Fig. S1 ).

We further confirmed the observed qRT-PCR results by analysis of infective virus by plaque assay (Supplementary Fig. S2 ). Virus was detected in oropharyngeal swabs in both lines, and the shedding decreased over time; the viral load and the number of positive samples in oropharyngeal swabs was significantly higher in Line C-B12 birds. The cloacal shedding of Line C-B12 birds was detected beyond two weeks after infection and not at all in Line 0.

We also detected differences in transmission of virus between lines ( Fig. 1C -F): Naïve Line 0 sentinel birds co-housed with infected syngeneic birds did not shed virus (Fig. 1C ,D) nor seroconvert ( Supplementary Fig. S3A ). However, Line C-B12 sentinel birds shed virus from the oropharynx and cloaca from 1 day after exposure to syngeneic infected birds ( Directly infected birds of both lines seroconverted, with Line C-B12 birds tending to exhibit higher antibody titers ( Supplementary Fig. S3 ). On this basis we designated Line 0 resistant and Line C-B12 susceptible to sustaining chains of infection within syngeneic populations.

A subsequent experiment was performed to determine whether the virus shed from the oropharynx of the resistant Line 0 birds was capable of infecting the susceptible Line C-B12 and whether the resistant Line 0 birds were able to be infected when exposed to sustained challenge by virus shed from experimentally infected Line C-B12. Mixed populations of the two lines were housed in two isolators. In one isolator the resistant Line 0 birds were infected by the nasal route ( Fig. 2A) whilst in the other the susceptible Line C-B12 birds were infected (Fig. 2C ), in each case leaving the alternate line birds as uninfected sentinels (Fig. 2B,D) . Infected Line 0 birds showed the characteristic oropharyngeal shedding profile, with no virus seen in cloacal swabs ( Fig. 2A) . None of the C-B12 sentinels produced positive swabs (Fig. 2B ). In the second isolator, Line C-B12 birds shed virus by oropharyngeal and cloacal routes with the time-course previously described (Fig. 2C) . All of the resistant contact Line 0 birds shed virus from the oropharynx followed, in 6/10 birds, by cloacal shedding, although this was always significantly lower than with infected C-B12 birds and over a shorter duration (Fig. 2D ). 4/10 contact Line 0 birds failed to shed from the cloaca (data not shown). Seroconversion was correlated with cloacal shedding (Supplementary Fig. S3B ).

We found similar results when the same susceptible Line C-B12 birds were infected via the cloacal route (Fig. 2E,F) , although in this case all sentinels birds showed clear cloacal shedding.

The magnitude of adaptive immune responses does not explain differences in susceptibility to infection. We analysed the adaptive response for a possible correlation with the different susceptibilities to infection. Splenocytes of infected birds were compared by ELISpot for detection of both antigen-specific IFNγ and antibody secreting cells (Fig. 3 ). Using either AIV infected syngeneic Antigen Presenting Cells ( from Line C-B12 birds showed higher IFN responses at syngeneic stimulation (398.7 ± 82.8 vs. 104.5 ± 38.6 SFU/10 6 splenocytes, p = 0.0079) or against whole virus (368.3 ± 49.9 vs. 135.8 ± 62.5 SFU/10 6 splenocytes, p = 0.0317). We also detected influenza specific antibody IgM and IgY secreting B cells (Fig. 3C ,D) in birds of both lines after infection. As with IFN, we found that responses in C-B12 birds tended to be higher than observed in Line 0 at day 7 for IgM (109.4 ± 20.6 vs. 58.0 ± 14.2 SFU/10 6 ) and day 14 (95.9 ± 33.1 vs. 32.3 ± 6.4 SFU/10 6 ). The number of IgY producing cells also tended to be higher at 7 DPI (131.8 ± 35.9 vs. 77.8 ± 16.0 SFU/10 6 ) and 14 DPI (113.2 ± 39.2 vs. 101.0 ± 21.0 SFU/10 6 ). Overall, a stronger adaptive response was consistently observed in the susceptible C-B12 birds than in resistant Line 0 birds.

capability of the H7N7 strain in Chicken Embryo Fibroblast (CEF) cultures from birds of Line C-B12, Line 0 and also an outbred Line of birds (Rhode Island Red, RIR). Supernatants of these infected cultures were harvested and measurement of infectious virus made by plaque assay. CEF cultures were infected at different MOI; Multiplicities of Infection ( Fig. 4 : MOI of 0.1, 1). Assuming that virus particles were released about 4 hours after virus absorption 21 , we took samples before one cycle of infection-replication (1 hour), after 1 cycle of infection-replication (6 hours) and several cycles of infection-replication (24 hours).

As expected, we observed that the longer the harvesting time after infection or the higher the initial multiplicity of infection, the higher the yield of infective particles. The dynamics of virus production from CEF of the three lines of bird were similar, except at 24 hours postinfection, where at the lowest dilution (MOI of 0.01) the number of infective particles produced by cells from birds of Line C-B12 (80.0 ± 13.4 pfu /ml supernatant) was higher than birds of other lines (21.0 ± 1.0 and 23.2 ± 10.0 pfu/ml supernatant in Line 0 and RIR respectively, significant at (p < 0.05)). This single time point and MOI was the only significant difference (we also tested higher MOI: 1,5 and 10, data not shown), suggesting that cell-autonomous factors were unlikely to explain the main characteristics of the resistance of Line 0 birds, the absence of cloacal shedding. Host factors control viral transmission within the bird. We hypothesised that the restricted shedding profile seen in Line 0 birds was due to a restriction in the transmission of virus from the experimentally-infected respiratory tract to the gastrointestinal tract. To test this we infected Line 0 birds by the cloacal route, in the presence of sentinel birds. Directly infected birds showed significant cloacal shedding (Fig. 5A) with a profile similar to those Line 0 birds previously infected by contact with shedding susceptible birds (Fig. 2D,F) . Particularly, shedding had started to decline sharply by 4 DPI and by 6 DPI no cloacal shedding could be detected. However, viral shedding did not extend to higher respiratory tissues as no shedding was detected in oropharyngeal swabs (Fig. 5B) . The serological responses of these cloacal infected birds were similar to those infected by the intra-nasal route (data not shown). Contact Line 0 birds did not show infection. By contrast, in Line C-B12 birds, transmission to sentinels was detected (Fig. 5C,D) and viral shedding extended to higher respiratory tissues (Fig. 5D ).

The ability to sustain a chain of infection of LPAI among resistant Line 0 birds correlates with cloacal shedding and is dependent on viral strain. We compared the profile of viral shedding of directly infected and close-contact sentinel birds with H7N7 (A/Turkey//England/647/77) and two H9N2 LPAI strains ((A/chicken/Pakistan/UDL-02/2008 (H9N2-UDL) and A/Turkey/Wisconsin/1/66 (H9N2-Wis), Fig. 6 ). H7N7-infected birds showed the characteristic pattern of viral shedding, transmission of infection and serological responses previously described (Fig.6 A,D and G).

H9N2 infected birds showed significantly higher oropharyngeal shedding values (p < 0.0001) than H7N7 infected birds at any time point after infection (Fig. 6B,C) , with higher values during the first day that steadily decreased, with few positives beyond day 8 post-infection. However, the two H9N2 strains were highly divergent in other aspects. Whilst H9N2/wis did not shed from the cloaca (Fig. 6E) , infection with H9N2-UDL resulted in viral shedding (Fig. 6F) , resolving by 10 days post-infection. Contact sentinels of the H9N2-UDL infected birds shed virus from the oropharynx and cloaca (Fig. 6C and F) , with cloacal shedding almost equivalent to that of the directly infected birds. The peak of cloacal shedding was at day 5, decreasing steadily thereafter. Serological results mirrored shedding data, with all directly infected birds seroconverting but only sentinels of the H9N2/ UDL infected group (Fig. 6G-I ).

Our initial observations revealed profound differences in host-genetic control of experimental H7N7 influenza infection in chickens, including the total absence of cloacal shedding in resistant birds and a restricted time course of oropharyngeal shedding. This phenotype was maintained following infection with an historic H9N2 virus but broke down after challenge with a novel H9N2 virus. The Pakistan group of viruses to which this belongs have higher infectivity, virulence and transmission than many LPAI due to polymerases (PB2, PB1 and PA) and non-structural (NS) gene segments identical to highly pathogenic H7N3 viruses 22, 23 . The mechanisms responsible for this increased virulence were clearly able to overcome the genetic resistance seen in Line 0 birds.

Notwithstanding reports of a degree of genetic resistance to HPAI in congenic lines of chicken 19 and epidemiologic studies carried out in humans 17 , our finding is the most striking example so far reported of the variation of in vivo host-genetic control of influenza within a reservoir species that threatens the human population. Furthermore, resistant birds were completely unable to initiate or sustain a chain of infection of LPAI, with sentinel birds of either susceptible or resistant genotype showing neither infection nor seroconversion. Our consistent finding was that cloacal shedding of the directly infected birds is the main contributor to sustain a chain of transmission (Figs 1-2 and 6) . Indeed, this is the first experimental evidence of the irrelevance of oropharyngeal shedding to transmission of a particular influenza strain in intimately co-housed birds, with previous literature mostly reporting studies relying on a physical separation between infected and sentinel groups 24 . Housing resistant Line 0 birds with directly infected and shedding C-B12 birds changed their previously observed phenotype by producing a transient low level shedding of virus from the cloaca (Fig. 2D,F) . Host factors were clearly still relevant as, unlike with susceptible C-B12 sentinels, not all individuals succumbed to cloacal shedding, and in those birds that were infected this stopped after 5-8 days, as compared with over two weeks for the C-B12 sentinels. Although it is possible that the change in phenotype of the resistant birds was due to persistent challenge with a high level of virus from the susceptible birds, an alternate explanation is that this was the result of an alternative route of infection. We demonstrated the possibility that infection can be achieved through the cloaca (Fig. 5) , in which case the Line 0 birds reversed the phenotype seen with intra-nasel infection and shed from the cloaca and not the oropharynx, suggesting that the limited shedding trajectories seen in Line 0 birds may be due to a restriction of within-animal transmission of virus. This may be relevant to the natural situation where the virus is known to persist in water 25 , giving rise to the possibility of infection by cloacal sampling due to the Shaffner reflex 26 . Infection by an environmental route that selectively allowed cloacal shedding and onward transmission would have a profound effect on the transmission dynamics and persistence of avian influenza viruses in the wild 27 . Though the methodology of the present study does not allow for the identification of particular genes or genomic regions that may be responsible for the observed resistance and susceptibility profiles we can infer what elements of immune regulation may be relevant. Firstly, differences in resistance and susceptibility were observed within 2-3 days postinfection, too early for an adaptive immune response and indicative of innate factors including innate immune mechanisms. However, although we cannot rule out some degree of cell-autonomous immunity there were no profound differences in viral production in in vitro assays (Fig. 4) , suggesting that this early-acting factor, evidenced in vivo, was either present in cells other than the CEF used for our in vitro assays or was mainly exerted by a more complex level of interaction of cellular and soluble-factors. The correlation of cytokine and chemokine gene expression with viral load in influenza infected poultry has previously been described 28 . We also cannot discard the involvement of other elements triggering the immune response, such as IFN stimulated genes, TLR pathways 29 or other genes activated in response to infection 30 . As differences in development are reflected in gene expression and the strength of host responses at transcriptional level, these factors have been linked with age-dependent susceptibility to infection in birds 28 . In the present study we also compared infection of 1 week and 3 week old Line 0 birds. However, we found the same viral dynamics and adaptive responses (data not shown) indicating that the expression of relevant host factors are independent of the host development, at least in perinatal birds.

MHC mediated adaptive immune responses have been shown to determine the resistance or susceptibility of the Compton lines of inbred chicken to a variety of pathogens 31, 32 , including those that, like with the present study, have a very early, presumably MHC-independent, innate component of resistance 33 . Since Line 0 and C-B12 differ in their MHC haplotype, being B21 and B12 respectively, we hypothesised that adaptive responses might also be important with respect to susceptibility to infection with LPAI. However, our observations that the magnitude of adaptive response (given by IFNγ secreting cells, antibody specific clones or total influenza antibody in serum) correlates with the amount of, rather than resistance to, infection would indicate that adaptive responses may not play a significant role in the shedding/non-shedding phenotype. We cannot entirely exclude the possibility that qualitative differences in, for example, the binding capacity of MHC for specific protective viral-derived peptides may be relevant. There are also other, non-adaptive, immune mechanisms encoded within the avian MHC, including a number of chicken NK receptor genes. Polymorphic and diverse, these genes are involved in the activation or inhibition of chicken NK cells [34] [35] [36] . Since these cells have been considered a factor involved in avian influenza pathogenicity 37 , and that a principal activating natural killer cell receptor has been described as critical in the in vivo eradication of the influenza virus 38 , the importance of the B-region haplotype in relation with the NK function could be crucial. It is also possible that a hierarchy of interaction exists between the haplotype-specific NK receptors, with some haplotypes being better than others for resistance to pathogens because of increased activity of NK cells 15, 39 . It will be important to investigate resistance and susceptibility to influenza in relation the NK activity of different haplotypes.

The present study indicates other priority areas for further investigation. The identification of the precise mechanisms and host-genetic control of resistance and non-transmissibility would offer the prospect of breeding or engineering resistant birds. Although ultimately rewarding this will be a complex undertaking as studies of genetic predisposition in mice have indicated that the host response is not only influenced by simple Mendelian inheritance of a single gene but also by complex, incompletely understood, interactions of genes and their associated variants 40 that catalogue the global host responses to infection 9 .

Though birds resistant to influenza transmission have recently been engineered by the incorporation of interfering RNA into the avian genome 41 , there is considerable consumer resistance to this approach, while conventional selective breeding for many traits has existed since the domestication of poultry. Furthermore, as human genetic determinants for influenza are comparatively unknown 42 , a better understanding of the genes and mechanisms involved in susceptibilities identified as a result of animal models could lead to improved therapeutic options in humans 10 .

Further work will be crucial for refining understanding of host-pathogen interaction, pathogenesis and transmission of influenza in poultry, overcoming the limitation of the analysis of the human model 10 . Our work has narrowed the task of identifying and determining the host genetic factors governing influenza infection and emphasizes the importance of the host for the control of viral replication and transmission. The prospect of breeding birds with natural immunity to influenza virus would widen the scope of existing control measures and limit the risk to the human population of the emergence of pandemic viruses. 

Chicken cell lines were produced and maintained at the Pirbright Institute (Compton, UK). Chicken Embryo Fibroblasts (CEFs) of 3 different birds each of Lines C-B12 and 0 were harvested from 10-day old embryos, washed and grown in T25 flasks (Nunc) in a culture media containing Medium 199 supplemented with TPB Glutamine (Sigma), 100 U/ml Penicillin, 100 μ g/ml streptomycin and 10% heat inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS), equilibrated to neutral pH with sodium bicarbonate and maintained in 5% CO 2 at 41 °C. Confluent monolayers of cells were washed with warm PBS and infected with a solution of culture media (without FBS) 0.5 μ g/ml TPCK trypsin (Sigma) containing H7N7 strain at different Multiplicity of Infection (MOI) of 0.1 and 0.01. After 1 hour incubation at 41 °C, cells were washed again and culture media solution was added to the monolayers. After incubation at 1, 6 and 24 hours at 41 °C, supernatant of infected cells were harvested, centrifuged at 300 × g for 10 min to remove dead cells and frozen at − 80 °C.

Determination of viral titers. Determination of viral load was performed by detection of viral matrix mRNA transcript by qRT-PCR of swabs as previously described 44, 45 , or by plaque assay plaque assay on Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells by standard methods 46 . MDCKs were supplied by the microbiological services unit at the Pirbright Institute (Compton, UK).

Determination of adaptive response. Determination of haemagglutination titres and IFNγ ELISpot assays of splenocytes cocultured with influenza infected haplotype-matched CKC or influenza inactivated virus was carried out as previously described 45 . For antigen-specific B Cell ELISpots, MultiScreen ™ -HA ELISPOT plates (Millipore, UK) were coated for 2 h at 37 °C with 2 μ g /mL of anti-H7 and anti-N7 antibodies (2B scientific) in carbonate buffer (Sigma). Plates were washed with PBS and subsequently incubated for another 2 h at 37 °C with 100 μ L per well of blocking buffer (PBS containing 4% dried skimmed milk). After the PBS wash, a suspension in PBS of 2 × 10 6 PFU per well of the viral strain employed for challenge was added and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C After a PBS wash 5 × 10 5 splenocytes were added per well and cultured overnight at 37 °C with 5% CO 2 atmosphere. Cells were washed off the plates using PBS containing 0.05% Tween20, and 100 μ L of biotinylated goat anti-chicken IgM (antibodies-online.com) or biotinylated goat anti-chicken IgY (Vector Laboratories) diluted in PBS at 2 μ g/ml added per well. After a 3 h incubation at room temperature plates were washed with PBS including 0.05% Tween20 and 100 μ L per well of avidin/biotinylated enzyme complex (Vectastain Elite ABC kit, Vector Laboratories) added.

Environmental Factors Affecting the Transmission of Respiratory Viruses,"Many viruses are capable of infecting the human respiratory tract to cause disease. These viruses display various transmission patterns among humans; however, they all share the ability to transmit from person to person, and their human transmissibility is influenced by the environment in which pathogen and host meet. This review aims to summarize recent and significant observations regarding the impact of environmental factors such as weather and climate, humidity, temperature, and airflow on the transmission of human respiratory viruses. Where possible, knowledge gaps that require further scientific study will be identified.","Viral respiratory tract infections are both ubiquitous and burdensome, accounting for many millions of lost school-and workdays and millions more physician visits each year [1] . Although there are similarities in the clinical syndromes caused by the many viruses capable of infecting and causing disease in the human respiratory tract, they possess varying transmission patterns among humans. The mode or modes by which a virus transmits from person to person are critical to understanding how the environment in which they transmit impacts person-to-person spread. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) consensus definition for the modes of transmission of influenza virus is broadly applicable to other respiratory (i.e., non-vector-borne) viruses as well (Box 1). In this review, for consistency, we will adhere to the CDC terminology; thus, ""contact transmission"" encompasses both direct and indirect transmission, while ""airborne transmission,"" comprising both droplet spray and aerosol modes, describes the direct inoculation of virus particles from the air into the respiratory tract without an intermediate.

In both modes of contract transmission (direct and indirect), contaminated hands play an important role in carrying virus to mucous membranes.

Virus is transferred by contact from an infected person to another person without a contaminated intermediate object (fomite).

Virus is transferred by contact with a contaminated intermediate object (fomite).

Virus transmits through the air by droplet sprays (such as those produced by coughing or sneezing); a key feature is deposition of droplets by impaction on exposed mucous membranes.

Virus transmits through the air by aerosols in the inspirable size range or smaller; aerosol particles are small enough to be inhaled into the oronasopharynx and distally into the trachea and lung.

http://www.cdc.gov/influenzatransmissionworkshop2010/ Respiratory viruses display a great deal of variety not only in their virion structure and genome composition but also in their modes of transmission among humans (Table 1) . For instance, evidence supports a primary role for direct and indirect contact in respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and adenovirus transmission, while airborne routes (droplet spray and aerosol) seemed to be more important in SARS coronavirus spread. With other viruses, evidence is either contradictory or incomplete, and mode(s) of transmission are yet to be fully resolved.

Here we will review the effects of certain environmental factors on respiratory virus transmission, with an emphasis on influenza and respiratory syncytial viruses. We have referenced several large-scale surveillance studies, as well as experimentally generated data in small animal models. We will also discuss remaining uncertainties as to the relative importance of these factors, as well the possible contributions of non-environmental factors on the infectiousness and transmissibility of respiratory viruses.

Multiple hypotheses have been advanced to explain the specific effect of humidity and temperature on the pronounced seasonality of influenza and, to a lesser extent, disease caused by RSV and other respiratory viruses [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] . These include changes in host behavior (for instance, more time spent indoors, in closed environments, during cold or rainy weather), changes in host defense mechanisms (such as impairment of mucociliary clearance with inhalation of cold, dry air) and changes in the virus infectivity and stability in different climactic conditions ( Figure 1 ).

Animal models have elucidated potential mechanisms by which humidity and temperature influence human influenza virus transmission. In the early 1960s, Schulman and Kilbourne developed an influenza virus transmission model in mice. Although mouse-to-mouse transmission is relatively inefficient, they still observed a significant decrease in transmission efficiency with increasing relative humidity (RH) [23] and during summer months, even when laboratory temperature and RH were controlled during experiments [24] . Lowen et al. expanded upon these experiments in the guinea pig transmission model. At 20°C, transmission efficiency of an influenza A/H3N2 isolate displayed a bimodal dependence on RH, with airborne (i.e., droplet or aerosol) transmission being maximal at 20-35% RH, poor at 50% RH, moderate at 65% RH, and absent at 80% RH. At 5°C, transmission was overall more efficient than at 20°C, and the relationship between RH and transmission efficiency was montonic, with efficiency decreasing with increasing RH [25] .

Transmission was abolished at high temperature (30°C), regardless of RH [26] .

Transmission of viruses via airborne routes may be affected by ambient humidity, which affects not only the virus' stability but also respiratory droplet size, as water content evaporates. In turn, droplet size influences whether the particle will quickly settle to the ground or remain airborne long enough to be inhaled into the respiratory tract of a susceptible host. For influenza virus, mathematical modeling suggests that RH is an important variable in airborne transmission of influenza virus; high RH favors removal of infectious particles both by increasing the settling of large, water-laden droplets and by hastening virus inactivation [27] . In aerosol viability experiments, adenovirus [28, 29] and rhinovirus [30] were more stable at high RH; in contrast, a bovine parainfluenza virus was more stable at low RH [31] , while RSV demonstrated bimodal peak stability at 20% or 40-60% RH with relative instability at 30% [32] . Influenza viruses are also generally more stable at lower RH; some studies have observed a bimodal stability similar to that seen by Lowen et al., while others have not [20] . However, these data should not be overinterpreted, as aerosol generation protocols and thus particle size and composition were not necessarily uniform across experiments.

RH is a ratio that describes the actual water vapor pressure of air, relative to its vapor pressure at saturation. Because saturation vapor pressure is exponentially related to temperature, RH varies both with the temperature and with the water vapor content of air. Absolute humidity (AH), on the other hand, describes the actual water vapor content of air, without respect to temperature. Thus, at equivalent RH, warm air contains more water vapor (i.e., has higher AH) than cold air [33] . A reanalysis of the data of Lowen et al. showed that, although RH and temperature were both weakly correlated with influenza virus transmission efficiency, AH was strongly associated with transmission efficiency, with efficiency decreasing as vapor content of air increases [33] . Subsequent analyses of epidemiological and meteorological data in temperate areas in the United States [34] and Japan [35] suggest that low AH correlates strongly with the onset of influenza epidemic activity, more so than RH.

However, as Tamerius and colleagues observe [20] , hypotheses correlating AH and influenza epidemics are best suited to explain the seasonality of influenza virus transmission in temperate climates. While influenza virus transmission has been thought not to display marked seasonality in the tropics, accumulating data suggest that equatorial regions can experience not only year-round transmission (such as Colombia; 4°N) [36] but also distinct annual epidemics that are unimodal (Fortaleza, Brazil; 3°S) or bimodal (Singapore; 1°N) [20] . In other tropical areas, influenza epidemics correlate with the rainy season, when AH is highest (such as Dakar, Senegal; 14°N [37] , or Belem, Brazil; 1°S [38] ). The question remains to what extent the seasonality (or lack thereof) of influenza epidemics is attributable to seasonal factors like humidity and temperature, what other environmental or seasonal variables matter, and which variables are causative and which are merely correlated or even confounding [20] .

Another environmental factor that may influence viral transmissibility is precipitation. Several large-scale studies have been conducted in tropical and equatorial countries in order to determine the relationship between rainfall and respiratory disease, particularly that associated with RSV and, to a lesser extent, influenza virus. A 3-year study of RSV infections in Lombok, Indonesia (8°S) found an association between rainfall and RSV hospitalizations; interestingly, total monthly precipitation was less important than the number of days on which it rained [39] . In a study from 1982 to 1997 in Malaysia (4°N) involving over 5,000 children, Chan et al. also documented a significant correlation between number of rainy days and RSV infection [40] . An association between rain and RSV infection has also been seen in several other studies [41] [42] [43] [44] . In contrast, a large, 3378children study in Northern Taiwan (23°N) did not find any association between rainfall and RSV infection [45] , nor did a 2002 study in Santiago, Chile (33°S). Of note, however, the Chilean study focused on cases in just one public pediatric hospital [46] ; it is possible that a limited sampling of cases in only one hospital would hinder the ability to draw statistically significant conclusions. However, studies in other locations have found the relationship between RSV disease and rainfall to be inversely related. In a 24-month study of over 1000 symptomatic children in India (22°N), RSV infection rates were negatively correlated with millimeters of rainfall; these findings were statistically significant [47] .

Inconsistencies in the role that rain plays in infection rates is not altogether surprising; discrepancies can even be reported within a given country. Following a 43-month study in Fortaleza (3°S), in the northeast of Brazil, an association between rainfall and RSV infection was documented [48] ; Nasciemento-Carvalho et al. reported a similar correlation in Salvadore (12°N) [49] . However, RSV infection did not correlate with the rainy season in Sao Paolo (23°N) [50] . While these studies employed varying techniques and collected samples over different time periods, it is possible that rain plays a unique role in RSV infection depending on a variety of factors, including geographic location. In addition, weather-dependent behavioral factors such as crowding following rainfall, could also influence RSV infection rates [51] , as RSV is thought to transmit through direct or indirect contact [7] . Indeed, family structure, living conditions and person-to-person contact are risk factors for RSV infection [51, 52] .

Epidemiological data appear generally to support a relationship between influenza virus infection and rainfall. In a two-year study, a significant association was found between rainfall and influenza A virus infection in India (22°N), with little to no reported infections during the dry season [47] . These findings are in agreement with earlier studies by Rao and Banerjee, who reported a statistically significant association between rainfall and influenza virus infection, though the relative contribution to influenza A or B virus infection was not determined [53] . While it has been noted that peak influenza virus activity coincided with the first rainfall in Chennai, India (13°N) [54] , the study lacked sufficient statistical rigor to determine if a relationship in fact exists. In a fairly limited study of pediatric influenza virus infections in an urban slum in Bangladesh (23°N) in 2007, 77% of the influenza B cases occurred during the monsoon season (July to September); conversely, 70% of the influenza A cases occurred during the pre-monsoon period (April to June) [55] . This study also did not determine statistical significance, and has several limitations in the study design, including the retrospective collection of samples from children who displayed clinical symptoms.

Like RSV, influenza virus transmission may be more affected by rainfall in one geographic location than another. When comparing incident influenza and weather trends in Singapore These results were not statistically significant, likely due to the small number of human cases during the study period. In the same study, Murray et al. did not find any association between H5N1 infection and rainfall in Indonesia, though the authors attributed this result to variation in climate across the country, societal differences that may affect how poultry is handled, or differences in susceptibility of the inhabitants and/or poultry due to previous exposures [57] .

Much less work has been done to assess the relationship between precipitation and infection with other respiratory viruses. In a study that investigated the seasonal patterns of viral and bacterial infections among hospitalized children with radiologically diagnosed pneumonia in Salvadore, Brazil (12°N), adenovirus infection was significantly correlated with total precipitation. However, parainfluenza virus infection was inversely correlated in the same study [49] . Indeed, there are substantial knowledge gaps as to how rainfall affects transmission of respiratory viruses. The effects of rain would be difficult to examine experimentally, such as in a small animal model, and it is possible that weather-or climaterelated factors other than precipitation affect seasonal infection rates.

Though relatively few data exist, airflow (the speed of air currents flowing through indoor spaces) and ventilation (the degree of mixing between indoor and outdoor air) seem play a role in respiratory virus infectivity and transmission. Schulman and Kilbourne again made prescient early observations of the effect of airflow on the transmissibility of influenza viruses in the mouse model, demonstrating that the rate of transmission decreased with increasing ventilation of a closed chamber in which mice were housed [23] . A similar phenomenon was observed with rhinovirus; the probability of detecting airborne picornavirus RNA in office buildings was directly correlated with the carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) content of the air, which is in turn inversely related to ventilation with fresh outside air [58] ; however, there were too few positive nasal samples to correlate CO 2 content with actual human infection.

Although inadequate ventilation has been implicated in the airborne transmission of respiratory viruses [59, 60] , the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) coronavirus outbreak in 2002-2003 provides an interesting case study for the outdoor airborne transmission of a viral respiratory pathogen. More than 300 residents of the Amoy Gardens high-rise apartment complex in Hong Kong were infected with the virus, in a dispersion pattern consistent with a single index patient, a visitor to the complex. The index patient was found to have extremely high viral loads in fecal and urine samples; computational fluiddynamics modeling of the dispersion plume was most consistent with transit of virus aerosols through improperly sealed plumbing U-traps, up an airshaft in the index building, and then along prevailing winds into neighboring buildings up to 60 meters away [61, 62] . In the largest nosocomial SARS outbreak in Hong Kong, 17 of the 30 infected patients were housed in different multi-bed wards from the index patient. A recent reanalysis of this outbreak found that, even though the patient wards were designed to be at positive pressure relative to the hospital corridor (thus preventing bioaerosols from entering the wards), small differences in temperature -as little as 0.5°C -between corridor and wards was sufficient to allow two-way airflow at ward entrances, thus permitting SARS coronavirus entry into patient wards [63] .

Viral infections of the respiratory tract are common acute illnesses among humans, and virus transmission, by either direct or indirect routes, occurs in disparate regions around the globe. A more detailed understanding of how these viruses transmit can have broad public health implications. Indeed, a variety of meteorological factors have at times been associated with rates of virus infection as well as transmission among individuals. As presented in this review, precipitation, humidity, temperature, and airflow can be determinants of virus infection and transmission; however, despite robust investigation of the effects of these environmental factors, inconsistencies and uncertainties in the data remain. It is possible that meteorological determinants play greater roles in some geographic regions than others, or simply that differences in experimental design affect outcomes and data interpretation. Nonenvironmental effects, including but not limited to seasonal changes in behavior, family and social structures, and pre-existing immunity, could also be playing a role in respiratory virus transmissibility and rates of infection. Discrepancies in collected data suggest that more vigilant surveillance over large geographic regions and further controlled experiments in animal models and perhaps in humans will likely be necessary to determine with increased certainty the role that environmental factors play on the transmission of viral pathogens.

• Respiratory viruses are spread from person to person via various modes of transmission, including direct and indirect contact, droplet spray, and aerosol.

• Virus transmission is affected by a number of factors, including environmental determinants, host behavior, host defense mechanisms, and virus infectivity.

• Uncertainties remain with respect to the relative importance of these factors and the roles that they play. A more complete understanding of environmental factors impacting respiratory virus transmission will require enhanced epidemiological and surveillance data, as well as controlled experiments in small animal models.

The ecology and adaptive evolution of influenza A interspecies transmission,"This is an open access article under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits use, distribution and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited. Since 2013, there have been several alarming influenza-related events; the spread of highly pathogenic avian influenza H5 viruses into North America, the detection of H10N8 and H5N6 zoonotic infections, the ongoing H7N9 infections in China and the continued zoonosis of H5N1 viruses in parts of Asia and the Middle East. The risk of a new influenza pandemic increases with the repeated interspecies transmission events that facilitate reassortment between animal influenza strains; thus, it is of utmost importance to understand the factors involved that promote or become a barrier to cross-species transmission of Influenza A viruses (IAVs). Here, we provide an overview of the ecology and evolutionary adaptations of IAVs, with a focus on a review of the molecular factors that enable interspecies transmission of the various virus gene segments.","Influenza A virus (IAV) has caused significant morbidity and mortality globally in humans, with an estimated 14 pandemics that have occurred since the 1500s. 1 Wild aquatic birds are well known to be the natural reservoirs for IAV subtypes harbouring H1-H16 subtypes, 2-4 with the exception of H17 and H18 subtypes that were recently discovered in bats. 5, 6 The phylogenetic relationships of all IAV subtypes are displayed in Fig. 1 . In addition to its natural reservoir species, influenza viruses infect a wide range of hosts including canids, equids, humans and swine. 2 IAVs' ability to generate novel gene constellations through reassortment between subtypes poses a risk for immune escape in these new hosts. 7 Furthermore, IAV undergoes rapid genetic and antigenic evolution, which makes vaccination control difficult in humans and other domestic species.

In addition to human pandemics that have emerged from avian and swine hosts, there are also repeated spillover events from domesticated animals, primarily poultry and swine, that pose a significant threat to human health. [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] Direct transmission of IAV from a wild avian source to humans is rare, as there has only been a single report of laboratoryconfirmed human infection with H5N1 contracted through close contact with dead and infected wild swan in Azerbaijan. 15 However, there is serological evidence of H5N1 infection among Alaskan hunters who handled dead wild avian species, 16 indicating that exposure to IAVs from wild birds through close contact can potentially cause infection.

More notably, viral genes that are similar to the 1918-like H1N1 avian virus were recently detected in the influenza gene pools of wild birds, raising the potential for the re-emergence of a 1918-like pandemic virus. 17 Furthermore, due to increasing human encroachment of wildlife habitats, the potential of a wild-source threat becomes more relevant, as is seen with the emergence of other pathogens such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and the more recent Zaire-variant Ebola virus in Western Africa. [18] [19] [20] [21] In this review, we discuss the current knowledge of ecological and molecular determinants responsible for interspecies transmission of IAV, with specific focus on avian-derived influenza subtypes involved in zoonotic and epizootic transmission to other hosts (see Fig. 2 ).

Wild birds of the orders Anseriformes (such as ducks and geese) and

Charadriiformes (such as shorebirds and gulls) are the primary reservoir of avian influenza viruses. 2 The maintenance of this diverse pool of viruses globally is in part due to the migratory nature of the bird species, a mechanism in which the viruses are shed in bird faeces and later acquired by other birds that share the same habitat along migratory flyways. 2, [22] [23] [24] Transmission of IAV in wild bird populations is dependent on several factors including virus shedding, virus stability in the environment and the degree of close contact/mixing with other host species. 3, 25 Virus shedding by bird species in the environment mainly occurs in fresh water, from where viable viruses of most known subtypes currently circulating in wild birds have been isolated. 24 The persistence of infectivity of IAV shed by aquatic birds is dependent on the temperature and pH of the freshwater, where it has been found that shed viruses can remain infectious for 4 days in temperatures of 28°C and >30 days in temperatures below 0°C, with greatest viral recovery noted at a slightly basic pH (7.4-8.2) and temperatures lower than 17°C. [26] [27] [28] [29] Prolonged virus shedding, which can be attributed to the development of the avian immune system, facilitates the efficient transmissions of IAVs in their natural hosts. 27 In the avian cellular immune response, the maturation of T lymphocytes occurs in the thymus glands that are distributed around the neck and inside the thoracic cavity of most birds. Unlike humans, these thymus glands only fully develop in late juvenile birds and persist throughout adult life. 30 F I G U R E 1 Diversity and host distribution of influenza A viruses (IAVs). Maximum-likelihood (ML) estimation of the haemagglutinin (HA) gene sequences of all subtypes of IAVs downloaded from the NCBI GenBank database. Overall data set randomly subsampled to include 200 isolates per subtype per host for the tree reconstruction. External branches of tree coloured by the major host groups from which the virus has been isolated from: avian (blue), canine (purple), chiropteran (pink), equine (brown), human (red), swine (amber) and other incidental hosts (black). Scale for branch length represents number of nucleotide substitution per site (subs/site) in the HA alignment In contrast, the plasmacytoid B cells essential for antibody-mediated response mature in a specialized organ called the bursa of Fabricius (BF), located in the cloaca, but the BF involutes or disappears early in the juvenile bird stage, that is at the onset of feather growth. 27, 30 The transition from the loss of the BF to the full functionality of the thymus results in a period of a weakened immunity in these avian species; thus migrating juvenile birds with a high viral load become an infection source of different pathogens. 27, 31 The stability of the haemagglutinin (HA) protein, both in the intracellular and extracellular environment, is a key determinant of the influenza virus stability and infectivity in the environment. 32 Stability of the HA in low intracellular pH of the early endosome is essential for the intracellular entry of the virus, after which point a threshold pH is reached in the late endosome causing the fusion of the protein to the lipid membrane, enabling the viral genome to escape the late endosome and successfully infect the cell. 7 Conversely, the virus must also maintain its stability in variable extracellular pH environments in its transmission between hosts. Thus, it has been observed that the pH stability of IAV subtypes evolves differently depending on host type and the route of transmission. 33 As most transmission of avian IAV in aquatic birds is through the oral-faecal route and the replication occurs mostly in the GI tract and cloaca of the birds, these viruses have evolved for stability at higher extracellular pH to accommodate these sites of replication and also maintain viability in the aquatic environment. [33] [34] [35] [36] More recently, the incorporation of environmental durability data into a phylogenetic study of avian IAV demonstrated that environmental transmission is correlated with the increase in virus genetic diversity in short-lived avian hosts, suggesting an environmental reservoir can act as a source of annual outbreaks. 37

AIV can cause low pathogenic infections (LPAI) in domestic birds with an asymptomatic or mild disease, with HA subtypes H1, H3, H5, H6, H7 and H9 most commonly isolated. 38, 39 In contrast, certain AIV lineages in subtypes H5 and H7 cause severe disease and rapid mortality in domestic birds and are referred to as highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI). While HPAI is phenotypically defined by a viruses lethality for susceptible chickens under strict experimental criteria, 40 genetically, the key distinguishing structure of HPAI is the presence of a multibasic F I G U R E 2 Significant interspecies transmission of influenza A viruses (IAVs). Representative diagram of interspecies transmission events of IAVs and the subtypes involved in these events. Solid arrows represent direct transmission events that have since been established in the host species. Dashed arrows represent sporadic or limited infection of subtypes where sustained transmission in the new host has not been detected cleavage site (MBCS), which contains two to several basic residues (e.g. PQRERRRKR/G) in the HA gene, as opposed to a single basic residue (PQRETR/G) in LPAI strains. [41] [42] [43] Furin-like peptidases, which are expressed ubiquitously in all tissue types of both avian and mammalian species, are responsible for the cleavage of HA at the MBCS site. 41, 44 Additionally, HPAI strains have also emerged through non-homologous recombination with a non-HA protein nucleotide sequence, introducing a non-native sequence into the HA gene. 45, 46 Although this can enhance the pathogenicity of the virus, systemic replication does not necessarily occur in all species: experimental infection of ferrets and mice with HPAI H5N1 showed systemic virus replication, 47, 48 but replication was only observed in the respiratory tract of non-human primates, 49 suggesting that pathogenicity of HPAI viruses is possibly host specific and multifactorial. 43 It has been recently understood that domestic birds such as chicken lack the retinoic acid-inducible gene-I (RIG-I), which is essential for signalling in the innate immune response, 50,51 as opposed to presence of RIG-I in other avian species and mammals as an important sensor of viral RNA leading to activation of type I interferons. 52 In experimental infection of chickens and ducks with H7N1 virus, increased viral pathogenesis with clinical signs of disease and death is observed in chickens, but infected ducks do not exhibit clinical signs, highlighting the evolutionary adaption of ducks being a natural host of the influenza virus. 53, 54 There has also been back-transmission of HPAI viruses from domestic poultry to wild bird populations that are implicated in bird die-offs 55 and intercontinental spread. [56] [57] [58] [59] Most IAV spillover events to humans have occurred through close contact with domestic poultry. 2 

In a large-scale analysis of sequence data of IAVs from various hosts, several mutations were reported to be indicative of adaptation of IAVs from avian to other host species. 83 However, in the surveillance of swine populations in southern China, many of these sites retain their avian-like residues despite over 30 years of circulation in these mammalian hosts, 84 suggesting these residues are likely founder effects rather than true adaptive mutations. Here, we highlight a few mutations that have been validated experimentally as critical in the adaptation of avian IAVs to humans and other mammalian hosts. 94, 98, 99 Finally, mutations outside the RBS, specifically in glycosylation sites near the RBS, have also been determinants of receptor binding specificity, as these sites, when glycosylated, cause stearic hindrance to the optimal binding of respective SA linkage to the RBS, thereby restricting binding. [100] [101] [102] [103] [104] [105] As mentioned earlier, the stability of the HA protein at various pH is associated with transmission in different hosts, with mammalian viruses having a lower optimum pH of conformational stability than avian viruses. 35,106-108 However, it was recently discovered that, in the adaptation from avian H1N1 to establishment of the European avianlike (EA) swine virus lineage, this mammalian virus possessed a higher optimum pH of conformational stability than its avian counterpart, which is hypothesized to be mediated by changes in HA2 residues 72, 75, and 113. 109 These findings certainly warrant the increased need to differentially characterize this trait between all susceptible species that can harbour IAVs for pandemic and panzootic preparedness as previously understood host-specific optimum pH for HA stability may vary between subtypes and hosts.

The primary function of the NA protein is to cleave sialic acid receptors of host cells from where the virion has budded, thereby preventing reinfection into the same cell and promoting viral spread within the host. 7 An optimal balance between the HA and NA protein function is required for effective infection and transmission of IAV: excess NA proteins can hinder the binding of HA to host cell receptors, whereas insufficient NA protein results in limited virus spread. 110, 111 Avian NA proteins preferentially cleave α-2,3-SA residues, whereas mammalian NA proteins can cleave both α-2,3-SA and α-2,6-SA residues, indicating host-specific adaptations of the protein. 112 In avian IAV subtypes (e.g. H2N2, H7N1 and H9N2), deletions in the NA stalk are crucial for adaptation in chickens and other Galliformes poultry species. 113, 114 While the significance of this deletion is yet to be elucidated, the naturally selected deletion serves as a barrier in interspecies transmission, as viruses containing the stalk region deletion were shown to have compromised transmission between ferrets. 115 

The most widely cited mutation in polymerase PB2 subunit is Glu-627-Lys substitution, which is responsible for adaptation from avian to mammalian hosts. This mutation has been shown to mediate replication at a lower temperature (33°C) in the human upper respiratory tract, thereby facilitating efficient aerosol transmission, as opposed to a higher temperature (40°C) in avian intestinal tract. [116] [117] [118] Additionally, this PB2 Glu-627-Lys mutation enhances the assembly of the viral ribonuclear protein (vRNP) complex in mammalian cells by stabilizing the binding of nucleoprotein (NP) and PB2 proteins during viral replication, [119] [120] [121] and this stabilization further contributes in resistance to host RIG-I sensing. 122 Exceptions are found in H5N1 avian viruses as they are able to replicate in mammals successfully even with the absence of PB2 Glu-627-Lys mutation; however, a compensatory Asp-701-Asn mutation in the PB2 gene is present and has been found to facilitate adaptation to mammalian replication. 123 This mutation promotes the transport of the RNA polymerase subunits into the nucleus through NP and PB2 interaction with importin-α in mammalian cells, thereby promoting transmission in mammalian systems. 123, 124 

The NP segment plays a key role in interspecies transmission of IAV, particularly the switch from avian to mammalian hosts. The viral NP is associated with the sensitivity of the IAV to host myxovirus resistance A (MxA) proteins-an important intrinsic antiviral factor of mammals known to inhibit IAV as well as other RNA and DNA viral infections. [125] [126] [127] It has been experimentally shown that an avian H5N1 virus with a reverse engineered human H1N1 NP protein can restrict the MxA sensitivity to eliminate species barrier and enhance viral replication 10-fold, 125, 126 indicating IAV can overcome the species barrier from an avian host to replicate successfully in the mammalian system through variation in the NP protein. For instance, the avian H7N9 virus has a crucial Asn52 mutation in the NP gene, causing a reduction in MxA sensitivity within human hosts. 128 This also suggests that pre-adaptive Asn-52 mutation (i.e. resistance to MxA proteins) has been initiated in avian hosts prior to adaptation in mammalian hosts. This was demonstrated experimentally in squirrel monkeys, where the addition of an avian NP segment into a human H3N2 backbone attenuated virus growth. [129] [130] [131] 

The non-structural protein 1 (NS1) protein has been implicated in variable virulence and pathogenicity within different hosts through its interactions of PDZ-binding motif at the C terminus of the protein. 83, [132] [133] [134] In a large-scale comparative genomic approach of all IAV, a specific 11 amino acid long sequence feature variant type (SFVT) located between residues 137-147 of the NS1 protein was statistically associated with a host restriction phenotype, 135 although this has yet to be tested experimentally. Nonetheless, discovery of this SFVT emphasizes the importance of further studying this protein and its potential role in interspecies species transmission.

Mutations in the non-structural protein 2 (NS2)/nuclear export protein (NEP) gene has of late received more attention as an important factor in mammalian adaptation of avian IAV, due to its role as a regulator of transcription and replication of influenza virus genome within the host cell. [136] [137] [138] Importantly, it was shown that substitution Met-16-Ile in the NEP conferred H5N1 avian polymerases the ability to efficiently replicate in mammalian cells by stabilizing the vRNP complex and by enhancing vRNA synthesis. 138

The complete role of PB1-F2 in the virus lifecycle still remains to be elucidated, as it has been shown to both aid and disrupt viral virulence. It is generally understood that PB1-F2's role is subtype and host dependent.

It has been demonstrated that within the 1918-like H1N1 viruses, PB1-F2 interacts with the PB1 protein to increase replication by retaining the polymerase complex in the nucleus longer. 139 In HPAI H5N1, the wildtype PB1-F2 protein was found to have no effect on the severity of infection in mice beyond replication in the lung, but replication was detected systemically in multiple organs of experimentally infected ducks, further supporting the existence of a host-specific function for the protein. 140, 141 

Mutations in the non-coding region of IAV have been shown to mediate cross-species transmission. These non-coding adaptations are due in part to constraints on host mechanisms that restrict the probability of mutational fixation, and consequently, a non-random pattern of mutation is seen across the virus genome in different host species. 142 For instance, many RNA viruses evolve to mimic the CpG dinucleotide frequencies of their hosts. 143, 144 Mammalian DNA sequences contain unmethylated CpG motifs responsible for inducing innate immune responses through interactions with Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) 144, 145 ; however, most mammals protect themselves against autoimmunity by maintaining CpG dinucleotides that are methylated and at low frequency. 145 To accommodate this, IAV has been observed to evolve lower dinucleotide CpG content following interspecies transmission. 143, 146 This phenomenon has also been experimentally confirmed, where the infection with modified human A/WSN/33 influenza virions expressing avian-like increased CpG content was shown to increase ssRNA recognition and immune activation by human plasmacytic dendritic cells. 144 This low CpG preference has been reported in human IAV subtypes such as the H1N1 and H3N2 in comparison with avian IAVs. 143 However, this trend was not observed in H2N2 isolates from the 1957 pandemic, likely due to the short duration in which this subtype circulated in humans. 147 Another parameter of codon usage bias is relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU), which is commonly applied to IAV genomes as a metric of comparison between different host species. 142 in antigenic escape within human hosts. 154 The 2009 pandemic H1N1 (pH1N1) viruses did not contain the Lys-627 or Asn-701 substitutions that were considered indicative of mammalian adaptation, 43, 155, 156 and it now appears these substitutions are not required for swine to human transmission. Indeed, when the mammalian-like Lys-627 and Asn-701 residues were introduced, a significant increase in polymerase activity and viral pathogenesis was observed, 155, 156 but this replicative advantage of the mutation was not necessary for the initial establishment of the avian polymerase in TRS lineage and subsequently human pH1N1 viruses. 157 Instead, partial compensatory mutations Gly590Ser and Glu591Arg were observed to aid polymerase activity of in the lack of the mammalian 627 and 701 residues, providing a possible explanation for the successful transmission of the avian-like residues in mammals. 43, [155] [156] [157] Additionally, the H1N1/2009 virus has reduced sensitivity to host MxA proteins though the interaction with the NP gene, as a result of the TRS-origin NP reassortment. 120, 121, 158 There have been several spillover infections of swine IAVs into humans [159] [160] [161] ; however, increasing evidence suggests reintroduction of the human virus into swine populations is more common. 162, 163 The susceptibility of swine infection by human virus can be attributed to, among many options, the dynamics of host immune development and farming practices. The immune response to IAV infection in swine is similar to that of the human antiviral responses, with experimental evidence showing similar activation and secretion of cytokines is triggered in response to infection with the same virus. 164, 165 Unlike humans, swine are unable to transfer maternal immunoglobulins to porcine embryos due to the existence of a thick placenta comprising six tightly connected tissue layers. 166 The first 24 hours after birth of the newborn pigs is exceptionally crucial for the transfer and intestinal absorption of maternal IgG from colostrum. [166] [167] [168] Although maternal antibodies through suckling can protect newborn piglets to some extent, the piglets are still highly susceptible to new infections. Highdensity commercial farming practices, where piglets are typically sent to market at 6 months of age, can therefore have profound effects on the transmission and diversity of IAVs in various swine populations. 162, 163 

Two equine IAV subtypes, H7N7 and H3N8, were first detected in the 1950s, although the host origin of the former subtype is not known. 169 However, as the H7N7 equine lineage has not been detected in over three decades, it is possible the H7N7 has become extinct in equine hosts. [170] [171] [172] Despite its disappearance, the lineage has been studied extensively to elucidate the factors involved in its emergence and potential virulence in mammalian species. [173] [174] [175] Of note, it has been observed that the equine H7N7 contains an MBCS in the H7 HA protein, 176 which in avian H7 lineages have been implicated in HPAI infections in poultry and have infected humans. 177 The equine lineage virus was also found to be highly pathogenic and neurovirulent in mice without prior adaptation. 173 However, the intracellular cleavage of the equine H7N7 lineage was found to be due to an 11 amino acid motif adjacent to the MBCS that, when inserted into an LPAI H7N3 virus, increased the pathogenicity of infection. 175 In contrast, the H3N8 equine lineage may have originated wholly from an avian IAV source, and these viruses have been shown to undergo frequent intersubtype and intrasubtype reassortments. [178] [179] [180] Interestingly, the H3N8 virus in equine hosts preferentially binds to avian-like α-2,3-SA, where the receptors are abundantly present in the upper respiratory tract of horses. 181, 182 As such, horses are always considered as dead-end hosts, but the interspecies transmission of H3N8 virus from horses to dogs and camels raises the question of whether horses can act as mixing vessels for IAV. 169, 182 

IAV has been detected in canine species since the early 2000s, and there are currently two stably transmitting lineages of IAVs that circulate in dogs: the equine-derived H3N8 and the avian-derived H3N2 strains. 169 The transmission of the equine H3N8 subtype to dogs seems to have occurred en bloc through close contact with infected horses 183 and this virus continues to circulate in dogs with no evidence of reassortment with other subtypes to date. 169 This is further supported by recent findings that despite phylogenetic divergence and genetic change from the equine lineage, canine H3N8 was not observed to be phenotypically different from equine H3N8 strains. 184 The avian-derived H3N2 canine IAV has a much broader host range, and unlike the H3N8 lineage, reassortment with other subtypes, such as with H5N1 and H1N1, has been detected. 185, 186 Recently, an isolated case of an H6N1 virus was detected a dog in Taiwan, likely through contact with infected chicken, and represents the potential for other avian IAV subtypes to emerge in canid hosts. 187 Lineage-specific mutations have been detected in the canine IAVs that suggest adaptive mutations in various segments towards the new canine hosts, 188, 189 but only the role of a leucine residue at position 222 (H3 numbering) has been confirmed as a host-specific adaptation thus far. 190, 191 

There is a need to understand adaptations in IAV that confer interspecies transmission capabilities to drive active surveillance for these mutations in nature and prevent an impending outbreak. Thus, the continued evolution of influenza viruses in its myriad of hosts necessitates further studies that characterize the risk of human transmission in these viruses, to provide a meaningful assessment of pandemic potential. Furthermore, the benefits of such efforts have been seen in the identification and rapid response to recent H7N9 outbreaks in China, 12, 73 while other studies that have characterized mutations that may enable sustained human-to-human transmission or describe pathogenesis have been useful for risk assessment of contemporarily circulating IAVs. 104, 107, 108 However, as there is continued mixing of viruses normally resident in different species, there is value in the continued experimental characterization of circulating viruses, particularly from subtypes known to have caused pandemics and those viruses present in animals to which humans have high exposure.

Ionizing air affects influenza virus infectivity and prevents airborne- transmission OPEN,"Active ionizer prevented 100% (4/4) of guinea pigs from infection. Moreover, the device effectively captured airborne transmitted calicivirus, rotavirus and influenza virus, with recovery rates up to 21% after 40 min in a 19 m 3 room. The ionizer generates negative ions, rendering airborne particles/ aerosol droplets negatively charged and electrostatically attracts them to a positively charged collector plate. Trapped viruses are then identified by reverse transcription quantitative real-time PCR. The device enables unique possibilities for rapid and simple removal of virus from air and offers possibilities to simultaneously identify and prevent airborne transmission of viruses.","Visualization and efficiency of aerosol sampling as determined by electron microscopy. To develop and validate the ionizing technique for collection and identification of viral pathogens, we used several viruses of clinical importance; calicivirus, rotavirus and influenza virus (H3N2, strain Salomon Island) as well as latex particles. Canine calicivirus (CaCV, strain 48) was used as a surrogate 27 for human norovirus, the aetiological agent behind the ""winter vomiting disease"", causing outbreaks of great clinical and economic importance 28 . Rhesus rotavirus was used as a surrogate marker for human rotavirus 29 .

The device (Fig. 1a) consists of a small portable 12 volt operated ionizer, with a collector plate of positive charge attached to the ionizer, attracting negative particles from the air by electrostatic attraction. To determine optimal time collection parameters, latex particles with sizes ranging from < 1 to > 10 μ m were nebulized into a room of 19 m 3 . Testing revealed that 40-60 min was required to eliminate > 90% of free latex particles in the air as determined by real-time particle counting (PortaCount Plus). The particle counter can detect particles with size greater than 0.02 μM. Visualization by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) on grids from active-and inactive ionizer collector plates showed that accumulation of latex particles was dramatically enhanced on active ionizer collector plates compared to the inactive (Fig. 1b,c) . Next, high numbers of rotavirus and formalin-inactivated influenza virus were aerosolized under the same conditions. While, after 40 min the inactive collector plates contained few (< 5) rotavirus and influenza virus, the active collector contained > 50 virus particles, as determined by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), (Fig. 1d,e) .

RT-qPCR. We next determined the capacity of RT-qPCR technology to quantitate the capacity of the ionizer technique to collect and concentrate viruses. Three independent experiments with each of the three viruses were carried out using the same virus concentrations in each experiment (Fig. 2a-c) . Although several steps are involved from collection to detection the system was robust as to reproducibility. The RT-qPCR data shows that the active collector is concentrating and collecting virus 1500-3000 times more efficient as compared to the inactive collector (Table 1) . When different dilutions of virus was used for aerosol production the proportion of aerosolized virus collected on the active collector was normally in the range of 0.1-0.6% for CaCV, rotavirus and influenza virus. A reproducible finding with regard to CaCV was a significant increase in relative recovery at the lowest concentrations increasing to 10-20% of the total amount of virus aerosolized (Table 1) .

Next we determined if collected viruses retained their infectivity after being exposed to negative ions and/or after being exposed to the positively charged collector plate. Five mL of cell culture medium (Eagles Minimal Essential Media (Eagles MEM)) containing 1 × 10 6 peroxidase forming units of rotavirus respectively of CaCV were aerosolized and collected during 40 min to an active collector plate, containing 1 mL of Eagles MEM. CaCV in cell culture medium was also directly exposed to an active and inactive collector plate, without being aerosolized. Viral infectivity was determined essentially as described 30 and the ratio between viral genome copy numbers versus infectivity was compared between aerosolized virus, virus exposed to active-and inactive collector plates and the viral stocks. CaCV exposed to an active collector plate, without being aerosolized, showed a slight reduction in infectivity (~40%) in comparison to virus that have been trapped on an inactive collector plate (Table 2 ). In contrast, the infectivity of aerosolized viruses was greatly reduced by > 97%, indicating that ionization of the aerosol accounts for the vast majority of infectivity reduction, and not the exposure to the charged collector plate.

Further support that ionizing was the mechanism by which viruses lost infectivity comes from experiments were rotavirus was nebulized without ionizing and allowed to be trapped to an inactive collector plate. Collectors were located at 30 cm from the nebulizer. The result concluded that the genome copy versus infectivity ratio was unchanged from that of the viral stock, thus suggesting that inactivation of virus is associated with ionized air.

Ionizing air and electrostatic attraction prevents airborne-transmitted influenza A/Panama virus infection between guinea pigs. Next we took advantage of an established influenza guinea pig model [31] [32] [33] to study if ionizing air and electrostatic attraction could prevent airborne aerosol and droplet transmitted influenza A/Panama (Pan/99) virus infection between guinea pigs. The airborne/ droplet transmission model was established essentially as described 31 using two separate cages with the ionizer placed between the cages (Fig. 3) . Four guinea pigs were infected by intranasal route as described with 5 × 10 3 pfu of Pan/99 31 and placed in cage ""A"" (Fig. 3) . At 30 hours post infection (h p.i.) 4 uninfected guinea pigs were placed in cage ""B"" 15 cm from the cage with infected animals as illustrated in Fig. 3 , with no physical contact. The ionizer was placed between cages ""A"" and ""B"". Two identical experiments were performed, one with active ionizer placed between the cages and one with an inactive ionizer. Uninfected animals in cage ""B"" were exposed for 24 hours with airflow from cage ""A"" hosting the 4 infected guinea pigs and then placed in individually ventilated cages for the next 21 days, to ensure that the only time-point for being infected was the 24 hours when they were exposed to air from infected animals in cage ""A"". RT-qPCR of lung-and trachea biopsies examined at 54 h p.i. from the nasally experimentally infected animals, revealed that 3 out of 4 guinea pigs in both experiments were positive for influenza.

We assessed transmission of infection from animals in cage ""A"" to exposed uninfected animals in cage ""B"" by development of an immune response 21 days post exposure. The results shown in Fig. 4 illustrate that when the ionizer was inactive, 3 of the 4 uninfected but exposed animals developed a serum IgG influenza-specific immune responses. In contrast, none of the 4 animals in cage ""B"" developed an immune response to influenza virus when the ionizer was active (Fig. 4) . Furthermore, influenza virus RNA could be detected by RT-qPCR, albeit at low concentration, on the collector plate from the active ionizer but not with the inactive ionizer, showing that the ionizing device indeed collected virus excreted from the infected animals in cage ""A"".

We describe a simple ionizing device operating at 12 volt that can prevent spread of airborne transmitted viral infections between animals in a controlled setting, whilst simultaneously collecting virus from air for rapid identification. Coupled with sensitive RT-qPCR assays, this sampling method enabled fast detection and highly sensitive quantification of several human clinically important viruses such as influenza virus, rotavirus and calicivirus. The device consists of a small portable ionizer, where a sampling cup of positive charge is attached to the ionizer attracting negative particles from the air. Important advantages with this novel ionizing device is the simple handling, high robustness as well as the wide applicability to airborne pathogens.

The observation that significantly higher numbers of rotavirus and CaCV particles were detected on the active ionizer compared to the inactive ionizer (~1500-3000 times), led to the conclusion that this technique can actively and efficiently collect viral particles from air. Similarly, visualization of latex particles by SEM revealed that latex particles of all sizes investigated were concentrated on the active collector. It is interesting to note that a broad range of particles sizes, from 35 nm to 10 μ m was concentrated, suggesting a wide application range of the technology. However, too large particles may decrease the recovery since these are proposed to remain for less time in the air 33, 34 .

Interestingly, when we aerosolized low amounts of CaCV, (1.56 × 10 4 gene copies and 1.87 × 10 3 gene copies), we observed collection recoveries of 10.6 and 21%, respectively. This markedly increased While the active ionizer prevented 4 of 4 exposed guinea pigs from developing an immune response to influenza virus, 3 of 4 animals were infected when the inactive ionizer was used. Graph shows antibody titers by ELISA before infection (pre-serum 1, 2, 3 and 4) and at day 21 post-exposure to influenza virus (post-serum 1, 2, 3 and 4). Briefly, influenza virus H1N1; (SBL Influenza Vaccine, Sanofi Pasteur, Lyon, France) were coated on ELISA plates and incubated with two-fold dilutions of pre-and post-guinea pig sera, followed by biotinylated rabbit-anti-guinea pig antibody, HRP conjugated streptavidin and TMB substrate as described in Methods. Cut off (dashed line) value (0.284 OD) was the mean of the negative controls + 2SD.

Scientific RepoRts | 5:11431 | DOi: 10.1038/srep11431 efficiency, with smaller amounts of virus distribution in air, could be due to less aggregation of virus-virus or virus-cell debris particles more long lasting airborne, and thus leads to stronger electrostatic attraction by the collector. Furthermore, it is likely that much particles end up at the walls of the collector plate or on areas adjacent to the collector plate on the ionizer; and are subsequently not quantified by real-time PCR; thus underestimating the electrostatic effect. When aerolizing higher virus concentrations, this effect can thus lead to lower estimates of recovery. Using CaCV, rotavirus and influenza virus, we performed three independent experiments for each concentration of aerosolized virus in order to assess the robustness of the assay throughout all steps (collection with active ionizer, RNA extraction, cDNA synthesis and real-time PCR). Although several steps are involved from collection to detection we found the assay to be highly robust since the minimum and maximum quantity of virus from each independent measurement was always within a range of 1 log (Fig. 2) .

Inactivation of viruses by electrostatic attraction has only been briefly investigated 35 . In the present study, rotavirus and CaCV lost significant (> 97%) infectivity (ratio; CaCV from 3.0 × 10 −2 to < 7.8 × 10 −4 and rotavirus from 4.9 × 10 −1 to < 7.6 × 10 −3 ) in ionized air as determined by a ratio of infectivity versus gene copies. The mechanism of inactivation was not explicitly investigated in this study, but inactivation mechanisms may include reactive species and/or increased protein charge levels, which could inactivate virus as previously described 36, 37 . Reduced infectivity has been proposed to be due to reactive oxygen species and ozone, through lipid-and protein peroxidation reactions that may cause damage and destruction to the viral lipid envelope and protein capsid 36 . In particular, protein peroxidation may play a key role in the inactivation of non-enveloped viruses, such as adenovirus, poliovirus and other enteroviruses such as rota-and caliciviruses. Enveloped viruses are suggested to lose infectivity due to lipid peroxidation. However, the cytotoxity of ozone creates a major obstacle for the clinical application of ozone. It has been shown hat increasing the ion concentration of the air efficiently protect chickens from air-born transmission of lethal Newcastle disease virus infection 23 . The exact mechanism of negative ion inactivation of viruses has not been shown and needs to be further investigated. However, in a study using generation of negative and positive ions, influenza virus was inactivated although ozone level was negligible (0.005 ppm or less) 37 .

Our device released a steady-state ozone concentration below the detection limit (0.002 ppm) as tested by VTT (Technical Research Center of Finland, Tampere, Finland) and by Air Resources Board in the US, thus ozone cannot in this case be a contributor of viral inactivation. However, reactive radicals such as •O 2 may be generated, which may contribute to inactivation through damage to either the protein or the nucleic acid structure of the viruses 37 . As infectivity was not lost when virus was nebulized into the air of the room without ionization and only slightly reduced when applied directly on the positively charged collector plate, it is suggested that most reduction of infectivity may be due to increased negative charged levels, presumably resulting in changes in isoelectric point and thus structural changes of the capsid. As the two viruses investigated are non-enveloped, lipid modification can be ruled out.

Most interesting, and of great clinical significance of this study was the novel finding that the ionizing device could detect and prevent influenza virus infection in a controlled setting, mimicking ""authentic"" conditions. Our intranasal infection protocol was essentially as previously described 31, 33 using Harley guinea pigs and 5 × 10 3 plaque forming units (pfu) of Pan/99 influenza virus. As guinea pigs of the Hartley strain are highly susceptible to human influenza A virus strain Pan/99 (H3N2), with an infectious dose (ID 50 ) of 5 pfu 31 , this makes the viral strain most appropriate for these studies. Moreover, Lowen and co-workers have shown 100% transmission of Pan/99 by aerosol to guinea pigs 38, 39 . Previous studies have also shown that the used infectious dose results in a viral growth peak around day 3 p.i. in both lungs and nasal passages in this animal model 31 , a time point when naïve animals in our study was exposed to air from the infected animals.

We found, by assessing development of the immune response, that 3 of 4 uninfected guinea pigs became infected after exposure to animals inoculated with 5 × 10 3 pfu of Pan/99. These susceptibility figures are similar to those of Mubareka and co-workers 33 who found that 2 of 3 guinea pigs became infected following short-range aerosol transmission with a dose of 10 3 pfu whereas 3 of 3 animals became infected with a infectious dose of 10 6 pfu. We examined the immune response at 21 days p.i., a time point when Lowen and co-workers 40 previously have found that naturally Pan/99 infected guinea pigs had developed a significant immune response.

The mode of influenza virus transmission includes direct contact with individuals, exposure to virus-contaminated objects (fomites) and inhalation of infectious aerosols. Previous studies using the guinea pig animal model have indicated that aerosol and not fomites is the principal route of Pan/99 transmission between guinea pigs 33 . Aerosol released virus from inoculated animals could be detected on the active collector plate by RT-qPCR, albeit at very low gene copy numbers. Using the guinea pig as a host model, Lowen et al. 38 showed that aerosol spread of influenza virus between animals is dependent upon both the relative humidity and temperature. They found that low relative humidity of 20-30% and temperature of 5 °C was most favourable, with no transmission detected at 30 °C. In our set-up system, the temperature was between 20-21 °C and relative humidity between 35-36.2%.

The described ionizing device coupled with RT-qPCR assays has a clear diagnostic potential. The easy handling, low cost, free of ozone production, robustness, high efficiency and low-voltage (12 volt) operation enables large-scale use. Locations critical for infectious spread, such as airplanes, hospitals, day-care centres, school environments and other public places could thus be monitored and controlled by the collection and analysis of airborne viruses and other pathogens on the collector plate. The device also show potential for transmission prevention, although the potency needs to be further investigated in real-life settings. We conclude that this innovative technology hold great potential to collect and identify viruses in environmental air.

Study design. The experimental room has grounded metal walls, with a volume of 19 m 3 (B250*L330*H235cm). One active and one inactive ionizer device, designed for collection and analysis of particles in the air, were placed in the room at equal distance (215 cm) from the nebulizer (Aiolos Albatross, Aiolos, Sweden), with a distance of 64 cm between the ionizers. A particle counter (PortaCount Plus, TSI Incorporated, USA) was used before and during the experiment. Before the start of aerosol experiments, the room was emptied on particles by the active ionizer and the collector plate was discarded before the experiments begun and replaced with a new collector plate. The experiments were continued until the particle counts were back to basal level, usually reached within 40 min. Humidity and temperature conditions were measured initial to each aerosol experiments.

Ionizer technology and device. The ionizing device used in this study was developed on the basis of the ion-flow ionizing technology from LightAir AB, Solna, Sweden (www.lightair.com) and was modified for this work by the Department of Microbiology, Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden. The device (size of 13 × 35 cm) was modified by installing a plastic-cup with a conductive surface of 47 mm in diameter (GP plastindustri, Gislaved, Sweden) as the collector plate (Fig. 1) . The collector plate has for safety reasons a very low current, less than 80 μ A, however the ionizer accelerates an extremely high voltage of more than 200,000 eV. The ionizer creates electrons, which will render surface molecules of particles in air negatively charged thus attracting them to the positively charged collector plate. This device generates approximately 35 000 billion electrons per second (www.lightair.com) with a steady-state ozone concentration below the detection limit (0,002 ppm) as tested by VTT Technical Research Center of Finland, Tampere, Finland. It has also been ozone tested and certified by ARB (Air Resources Board) in the US. After the end of the sampling period, the ionizer was turned off, and the collector plate was covered with a lid and stored at − 20 °C until analysis. Viruses captured on the collector plates were analyzed by a RT-qPCR for rotavirus, CaCV and influenza virus, and the results from the active-and inactive ionizers were compared. Scanning-and transmission electron microscopy were used for visualization of collected viruses and latex-particles. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Carbon/Formvar-coated 400 mesh copper grids were placed on the collector during aerosol experiment with influenza-and rotavirus. Grids were then rehydrated in Eagles MEM containing 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) before being negatively stained with 2% phosphotungstic acid and analyzed by TEM. Ten grid squares were analyzed per specimen and the number of virus particles per unit area was calculated.

Collected samples were added on the surface of a polycarbonate 0.6 μ m filter (Nucleopore, Inc) which was fitted to an airtight gadget (GP Plastindustri AB, Gislaved, Sweden). The filter was dried in room temperature, coated with 40 Å thick layer of ionized gold and analyzed by SEM (Philips High Resolution SEM 515). The method has previously been used and reported in studies of cytomegalovirus as well as cerebrospinal fluid 41-43 . Extraction of viral RNA from collector plates. The attached viral particles on the collector plates were lyzed with 1 mL of viral lysis buffer (buffer AVL, QIAamp viral RNA mini kit) added directly into the collector plate and immediately proceeded for extraction of viral RNA using QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Cat.no: 52906 Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Each sample was eluted with 60 μ L of RNase-free water containing 0.04% sodium azide (AVE buffer; Qiagen, Hilden, Germany).

Reversed transcription of extracted viral RNA. 28 μ L of the extracted viral RNA was mixed with 50 pmol of Pd(N) 6 random hexamer primer (GE-Healthcare, Uppsala, Sweden) and quickly chilled on ice for 2 min, followed by the addition of one Illustra Ready-To-Go reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) bead (GE-Healthcare, Uppsala, Sweden) and RNase-free water to a final volume of 50 μ L. For rotavirus, an initially denaturation step at 97 °C for 5 min was performed to denature the dsRNA. The reverse Scientific RepoRts | 5:11431 | DOi: 10.1038/srep11431 transcription (RT) reaction was carried out for 40 min at 42 °C to produce the cDNA later used for real-time PCR.

Quantitative real-time PCR for rotavirus. Rhesus rotavirus was detected and quantified using a LUX real-time PCR assay as described previously 7 . This real-time PCR uses labeled primers with different fluorophores for each VP6 subgroup and external plasmid standards for semi-quantification 44 . Quantitative real-time PCR for CaCV. CaCV was detected and quantified using a SYBR green assay on a ABI prism 7500 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) with primers; (final concentration 200 nM) CaCV-3 (5-ACCAACGGAGGATTGCCATC-3´ (nucleotides 393 to 410 according to GenBank accession no. AF053720) and CaCV-4 (5´-TAGCCGATCCCACAAGAAGACA-3´ (nucleotides 452 to 474), specific for CaCV strain 48. The reaction was performed with 2 μ L cDNA in 10 μ L 2X SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) and water to a final volume of 20 μ L. The following cycling program was used: 95 °C for 10 min followed by 45 cycles of 95 °C for 15 seconds and 60 °C for 1 min. Melting curve analysis was performed immediately after PCR completion, by heating at 95 °C for 15 seconds, followed by cooling to 60 °C for 1 min and subsequent heating to 95 °C at 0.8 °C min −1 with continuous fluorescence recording. Melting temperatures were determined on all samples using the Sequence Detection Software version 1.3.1 (Applied Biosystems) and visualized by plotting the negative derivatives against temperature.

Sampling for infectivity studies with rotavirus and CaCV. To determine whether the ionizing technology has any influence on virus infectivity, rhesus rotavirus and CaCV was aerosolized and collected on active ionizer collector plates, covered with 1 mL of Eagles MEM. Rotavirus (1 × 10 6 peroxidase forming units) and CaCV (1 × 10 6 peroxidase forming units) was aerosolized, each in a total volume of 5 mL and collected for 40 min followed by determination of viral infectivity and number of genome copies.

To determine if ionized air per se had an effect on viral infectivity, rhesus rotavirus was aerosolized and captured on a collector plate containing 1 mL of Eagles MEM, without ionization, placed at a distance of 30 cm from the nebulizer.

To determine if electrostatic attraction of the collector plate affected viral infectivity, rotavirus (2 × 10 5 peroxidase forming units) and CaCV (2 × 10 5 peroxidase forming units) in 1 ml of Eagles MEM, were added to inactive and active collector plates for 40 min. The plates were subsequently stored at − 20 °C until determination of viral infectivity and number of genome copies.

Rotavirus stock and samples were diluted 1:10 in Eagles MEM and subsequently diluted in two-fold dilutions. Determination of viral infectivity was performed as previously described on confluent Green monkey kidney cells (MA104) in 96-well plates 30 . CaCV infectivity was determined essentially as for rotavirus with the modification that samples were added to confluent Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cells in 48-well plates and infectivity determined as previously described 45 and confirmed by RT-qPCR. To determine the reduction of infectivity, the ratio of viral genome copy numbers versus infectivity was compared between aerosolized virus, virus exposed to active-and inactive collector plates and the viral stock.

Animals. Guinea 

We use a guinea pig animal model to investigate whether the ionizing technique could prevent transmission of influenza virus infection, since this model have successfully been used as a model of aerosol transmission studies of influenza virus 31, 33 . Human influenza A virus, strain Pan/99 (kindly provided by Peter Palese, New York, USA) was used since this strain has been shown to effectively replicates in the upper respiratory airways and effectively transmit by aerosols but not by fomites in guinea pigs. Female guinea pigs, 300-350 g, strain Hartley, were housed at Astrid Fagreaus Laboratorium, Solna, Stockholm (Ethical permission N177/11). Four animals were anesthetized by an intra peritoneal injection of ketamin (Ketalar el Ketaminol) 50 mg/kg and xylazin (Rompun) 5 mg/ kg and infected intranasally with 5 × 10 3 pfu of Pan/99 virus in 100 uL (50 uL in each nostril). All four infected animals were placed into the experimental cage (Fig. 3, cage ""A"") . At 30 h p.i., four naïve uninfected guinea pigs were placed next to the transmission cage (Fig. 3, cage "" B"") at a distance of 15 cm. Air flowed freely between cages, but direct contact between inoculated and exposed animals was prohibited.

The four naïve guinea pigs were exposed for 24 hours and then put into separately individually ventilated cages, to ensure that no aerosol transmission occurred between the animals. Two identical experiments were performed, with an active and inactive ionizer. The nasally infected animals were removed after the exposure time and lung and trachea biopsies were collected (54 h p.i.) and investigated for influenza virus by RT-qPCR. At 21 days post exposure, serum was collected from the uninfected exposed guinea pigs and the prevalence of antibodies against influenza A virus was determined by ELISA. Sera Scientific RepoRts | 5:11431 | DOi: 10.1038/srep11431 taken before exposure to the infected guinea pigs (pre-sera), and 21 days days after exposure (post-sera) were analyzed from each animal.

Briefly, 96-well plates (Nunc, 96 F MAXISORP, Roskilde, Denmark) where coated with formalin-inactivated Influenza A virus H1N1 (SBL Influenza Vaccine, Sanoil Pasteur, Lyon, France) diluted in coating buffer (0.05 M sodium carbonate buffer, pH 9.5-9.7) at 5 μg/mL and incubated at + 4 °C over night. Wells were washed x3 (0.9% NaCl and 0.05% Tween-20) and blocked with 3% BSA in PBS buffer for 1 hour at 37 °C. Serum samples were diluted 1:100 and further in two-fold dilutions in dilution buffer (PBS containing 0.5% BSA and 0.05% Tween-20), and incubated for 90 min at 37 °C. Plates were then washed x5 and incubated for 60 min at 37 °C with secondary biotinylated goat-anti guinea pig antibody (Vector, BA-7000) and horseradish-peroxidase (HRP) conjugated Streptavidin (DAKO, Denmark, P0397), both at a dilution of 1:3000. Plates were then washed x5 and 100 μL of tetramethyl benzidine (TMB) substrate (Sigma Aldrich, T-0440-16) was added to each well, the reaction developed for 10 min and stopped by addition of 100 μL of 2 M H 2 SO 4 . Absorbance was measured at 450 nm in an ELISA reader (VersaMax, Molecular Devices). Cut off values were calculated as the average value of negative controls OD and 2 times the SD.

Extraction of influenza RNA from guniea pig tissue. RNA was extracted from trachea and lung tissue of infected guinea pig. Briefly, 100-250 mg of tissue were homogenized with a tissue homogenizer and total RNA extracted with RNAeasy Midi Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions.

To detect and quantify influenza A virus on the collector plates as well as in guinea pig tissue samples, we used a One-Step Taq Man real-time RT-PCR assay 46 with primers F1-mxA (150 nM) (5´-AAGACCAATYCTGTCACCTCTGA-3´), F3-mxA (150 nM) (5´-CAAGACCAATCTTGTCACCTCT GAC-3´) and R1-mxA (900 nM) (5´-TCCTCGCTCACTGGGCA -3´) and probes P1-Mx (110 nM) (5´-FAM-TTGTGTTCACGCTCACC-MGB-3´) and P2-Mx (110 nM) (5´-FAM-TTTGTATTCACGCTCACCG-MGB -3´), with the Rotor-Gene Probe RT-PCR Kit (Qiagen). The real-time PCR reaction was performed in a Corbett Rotor-Gene 6000 (Qiagen) with the following cycling protocol: 50 °C for 10 min, followed by 45 cycles of 95 °C for 5 seconds and 57 °C for 15 seconds.

HVAC filtration for controlling infectious airborne disease transmission in indoor environments: Predicting risk reductions and operational costs,"This work describes and applies a methodology for estimating the impact of recirculating heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning (HVAC) particle filters on the control of size-resolved infectious aerosols in indoor environments using a modified version of the Wells-Riley model for predicting risks of infectious disease transmission. Estimates of risk reductions and associated operational costs of both HVAC filtration and equivalent outdoor air ventilation are modeled and compared using a case study of airborne transmission of influenza in a hypothetical office space. Overall, recirculating HVAC filtration was predicted to achieve risk reductions at lower costs of operation than equivalent levels of outdoor air ventilation, particularly for MERV 13e16 filters. Medium efficiency filtration products (MERV 7e11) are also inexpensive to operate but appear less effective in reducing infectious disease risks.","The airborne transmission of respiratory pathogens such as measles, tuberculosis, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), influenza, rhinovirus, and others in indoor environments and the associated risk of infection presented to uninfected occupants are governed by several complex physical and biological processes. Communicable respiratory illnesses lead to large excesses in expenses associated with healthcare, absence from work, and lost worker productivity [1] , but the control of airborne infectious disease transmission in indoor environments is not yet entirely understood [2] . Several studies have shown that building design and operational characteristics such as increased outdoor air ventilation rates, lower occupant density, and use of UV germicidal irradiation can reduce the risk of infectious disease transmission inside buildings [3e7] . Similarly, commonly available particle filters in recirculating heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems may also be used to reduce the risk of airborne infectious disease transmission, depending on the nature of infectious aerosols and some important building characteristics [2,4,8e12] .

However, key questions remain about (i) the effectiveness of particle filtration for controlling airborne infectious aerosols, (ii) the associated risk reductions achievable with HVAC filtration, and (iii) the relative costs of risk reduction by HVAC filtration versus other control mechanisms such as increased outdoor air ventilation rates. To address these questions, this article describes and applies a methodology for estimating the impact of recirculating HVAC filters on the control of size-resolved infectious aerosols in indoor environments using a modified version of the Wells-Riley model for predicting risks of airborne infectious disease transmission. Estimates of likely risk reductions and associated operational costs of both HVAC filtration and equivalent outdoor air ventilation are modeled and compared using a case study of airborne transmission of influenza in a hypothetical office space in multiple climates.

Aerosol transmission has been shown to be a predominant route of transmission for a number of communicable diseases, including rhinovirus [7, 13] , influenza [14e16], tuberculosis [17] , and SARS [18] . There is also growing empirical evidence that increased outdoor air ventilation rates in buildings can reduce the transmission of some of these same diseases [19] , which further confirms the likely importance of airborne transmission via infectious aerosols in indoor environments. One often-used approach to estimating the risks associated with airborne transmission of respiratory diseases is the Wells-Riley model, as shown in Equation (1) [20] .

where P infection ¼ the probability of infection; cases ¼ the number of infection cases; susceptibles ¼ number of susceptible individuals; I ¼ number of infector individuals; p ¼ pulmonary ventilation rate of a person (m 3 /hour); q ¼ quanta generation rate (1/hr); t ¼ exposure time (hr); and Q oa ¼ room ventilation rate with pathogen-free air (m 3 /hour).

The Wells-Riley model is based on a concept of ""quantum of infection,"" whereby the rate of generation of infectious airborne particles (or quanta) can be used to model the likelihood of an individual in a steady-state well-mixed indoor environment being exposed to the infectious particles and subsequently succumbing to infection. Note that some researchers have also expanded this model to include time-varying exposures [21] and others have developed zonal versions that account for incomplete mixing in an indoor environment [22] .

The quantum of infection term (q) in this risk model is not an actual physical unit; it is a hypothetical infectious dose unit that is typically back calculated from observational epidemiological studies. Conceptually, it describes the number of infectious particles in a way that implicitly accounts for both the amount of particles generated over time and the infectivity of particles, which also inherently captures susceptibility of individuals and particle size effects such as the probability of deposition in relevant regions of the respiratory system. Because of the empirical nature of the model in Equation (1), existing literature on quanta generation rates (q) is relatively limited. Published ranges of q for several infectious airborne diseases are shown in Table 1 .

It is also important to note the assumption of well-mixed indoor environments in this model and in previous derivations of quanta generation rates. Because of this assumption, the model cannot distinguish between long-range transport of smaller infectious aerosols (i.e., droplet nuclei) and close-contact airborne spread of infectious diseases that occurs when expelled infectious aerosols deposit directly on susceptible parts of the human body (i.e., large droplets). However, quanta generation rates are usually back calculated from scenarios where long-range transport was very likely a major factor. For example, Rudnick and Milton (2003) estimated quanta generation rates of 15e128 per hour for influenza (depending on steady-state or dynamic assumptions) using data from a grounded passenger airplane where the majority of passengers throughout the airplane acquired the influenza virus from one infected individual [23] . While the quanta generation rates in this case may have accounted for some close-range transport, it is reasonable to assume that many passengers would also have been infected by longer-range aerosol transport.

Despite some of these limitations, the Wells-Riley model has been used previously to show that some building factors, particularly outdoor air ventilation rates, can be an important removal mechanism for airborne infectious agents [17, 30, 31] . Because the removal mechanisms of any aerosol (including HVAC filtration) are primarily functions of particle size [32, 33] , it is important to consider the actual particle size distributions of infectious aerosols in indoor environments for use with this model. Although the original Wells-Riley model does not explicitly account for the sizeresolved nature of infectious aerosols, modifications have been made by others to do so [4, 34, 35] . Therefore, the next sections describe previous efforts to integrate other size-dependent loss terms into the Wells-Riley equation and then review existing knowledge of particle size distributions of infectious aerosols to inform the modeling effort herein. Infectious particle size distributions are explored with the specific intent of generalizing for use with the particle size range relevant to a common HVAC filtration standard: ASHRAE Standard 52.2 [36] .

From a mass balance perspective, HVAC filtration and other removal mechanisms are treated similarly to outdoor air ventilation because they both can be used to reduce indoor concentrations of airborne infectious particles. In fact, the steady-state Wells-Riley equation has previously been modified in other investigations to include additional removal terms other than outdoor air ventilation, including filtration by personal respirators, UV degradation, particle deposition, and HVAC particle filtration [3, 4, 10, 31] . Equation (2) follows the same procedures by including both HVAC filtration and deposition loss terms.

where V ¼ indoor air volume (m 3 ); l ventilation ¼ outdoor air ventilation rate (Q oa /V, 1/hr); k filtration ¼ infectious particle removal rate due to filtration (1/hr); and k deposition ¼ infectious particle deposition rate (1/hr). Deposition removal rates (k deposition ) depend primarily on particle size, density, and room characteristics such as airspeeds and surface areas [35, 37] . Filtration removal rates (k filtration ) depend on the rate of airflow through the HVAC filter (Q filter ), the fractional operation time of the HVAC system (f HVAC ), and the size-resolved infectious particle removal efficiency of the filter or air-cleaning device installed (h filter ) as shown in Equation (3). The airflow rate through the filter divided by the volume of the indoor air space served and multiplied by fractional operation time is also called the recirculation rate (l recirculated ).

where f HVAC ¼ fractional HVAC operation time (À); Q filter ¼ airflow rate through filter (m 3 /hr); h filter ¼ particle removal efficiency of the filter (À); and l recirculated ¼ recirculation rate through the HVAC filter (1/hr). Depending on the nature of the virus or bacteria of concern inside of expelled droplets or droplet nuclei, some rate of inactivation may also occur as aerosols are exposed to indoor air [34] . This rate has been explored for some viruses [38, 39] and is dependent in part on environmental conditions such as relative humidity. However, we have excluded this loss rate in this work in [20] part because of a lack of existing data on size-resolved inactivation rates for multiple infectious aerosols of concern and in part because quanta generation rates, when back calculated using Equation (1), should inherently account for any inactivation that occurred during the case study period. Additionally, although Equations 2 and 3 are shown without explicitly considering particle size effects, both the filtration and deposition loss parameters (k deposition and k filtration ) are size-dependent. Therefore, the following sections describe existing knowledge of the particle size distributions of infectious aerosols.

When an individual coughs, sneezes, speaks, or breathes, droplets consisting of liquid water, proteins, salts, and various other organic and inorganic matter are expelled into the air. If the emitter is infected with a particular respiratory infection, those droplets may also contain smaller infectious particles themselves, which may be viruses or bacteria depending on the type of infection. Viruses are typically an order of magnitude or more smaller in size than bacteria: w20e200 nm for viruses vs. w0.2e5 mm for most bacteria [40] . In other explorations of the impacts of particle filtration and other size-dependent processes on virus and bacteria disease transmission, some researchers have assumed that the individual virus or bacteria particles are aerosolized and exist suspended as individual organisms [11, 41] ; however, it is likely more appropriate to consider the particles as larger expelled droplets that contain aggregates of the smaller infectious particles within Refs. [8, 35, 42, 43] .

Once expelled from a high relative humidity environment (the human body) to a relatively less humid environment (most indoor environments), droplets rapidly decrease in size as the surrounding liquid evaporates. Several studies have shown that this liquid evaporation typically occurs within less than 1 s of emission for particles smaller than w50 mm in diameter [44] . After rapid evaporation, droplet nuclei containing the mix of solid particles (including any infectious particles) remain. Droplet nuclei typically have particle diameters that are 40e50% of the original droplet size [35, 39] .

It is commonly believed that droplet nuclei particles average 1e 3 mm in diameter [42] , although several recent studies have shown considerable variation in the size distribution of expelled droplets and droplet nuclei. Nicas et al. [35] summarized nearly 50 years of measurements of particle size distributions of droplets emitted by humans during coughing and sneezing and reported that coughgenerated aerosols could be divided into two lognormally distributed modes: (i) a small particle size distribution with a geometric mean diameter of w10 mm (ii) a large particle size distribution with a geometric mean diameter of w160 mm. However, the smaller particle size distribution was found to contain the majority of cough particles (w70%). Given that the same authors described some evidence of smaller particles being more infectious than larger

particles, it appears that smaller (i.e., <10 mm) particles are likely of greatest concern for droplet nuclei transmission of infectious diseases. Several more recent studies utilizing more advanced measurement techniques have revealed a general consensus that the majority (often 80e90%) of particles expelled during various human activities are actually smaller than 1e2 mm in diameter [45e 50], although it is not clear whether actual virus content scales more with particle number, surface area, or volume distributions.

While previous studies have been helpful for identifying the size of particles expelled during human activities, several more recent studies have utilized more sophisticated techniques (e.g., quantitative polymerase chain reaction, or q-PCR) to identify the presence of viruses or bacteria in expelled droplets and droplet nuclei collected on multi-stage bioaerosol samplers [46,51e55] . These studies offer insight not only into what size aerosols exist after expulsion from the human body, but in what size-fractions are viruses or bacteria actually present and are thus of most concern for infectious disease transmission. Several of these recent studies have focused on the particle size distributions of influenza in indoor and personal airborne particulate matter in indoor environments, as summarized in Table 2 .

In these recent investigations, the amount of influenza virus content in a range of particle sizes was quantified using a variety of bioaerosol samplers installed in a variety of locations and indoor environments. Sampling environments included healthcare centers, daycare centers, hospital emergency rooms, simulated patient rooms, and in the coughing/breathing zone of both people and manikins. Sampling locations within each environment included both stationary indoor measurements and personal measurements. Importantly, the variety of aerosol samplers used also varied in their particle size cut-off points. However, each study characterized Fortunately for this work, the size bins from the selected studies aligned relatively closely to the three size bins outlined in the most commonly used HVAC filtration standard in the U.S., ASHRAE Standard 52.2, which classifies filtration efficiency in bins of 0.3e 1 mm, 1e3 mm, and 3e10 mm [36] . Therefore, we adjusted each of the reported size distributions in Table 2 to fit within those three particle size ranges by assuming that the virus content has a uniform distribution in each particle size bin. These assumed distributions are shown in the rightmost columns in Table 2 . Although this assumption introduces some uncertainty, we have no way of directly quantifying the magnitude at this time. We do however explore uncertainty in a later section using both the mean and relative standard deviations of the assumed viral size distributions, as summarized in the bottom of Table 2 , which can place likely bounds on risk estimates made using Equation (2).

On average across all of these studies, we estimate that approximately 20% of influenza virus content is associated with particles in the 0.3e1 mm size range in these recent studies; 29% is associated with the 1e3 mm size range, and 51% is associated with the 3e10 mm size range. The smallest size range has the highest relative standard deviation from that mean (70%), followed by the middle size range (44%) and the largest size range (36%). At this point, we have reviewed enough background knowledge of the nature of infectious particles emitted during various human activities and the likelihood of those aerosols containing virus content to inform a mechanistic study of droplet nuclei transport and control based on these infectious aerosol characteristics.

This work uses the modified particle-size-resolved version of the Wells-Riley model in Equation (2) to estimate the risk reductions likely achievable by common HVAC filters for a case study of influenza transmission in a hypothetical office building. Estimates of operational costs are also made for both HVAC filtration and an equivalent amount of outdoor air ventilation in a range of climate zones across the U.S. in order to compare the likely costs of both control methods. The next sections describe our methodology for connecting the modified Wells-Riley model to HVAC filtration (i.e., MERV) and estimating operational costs.

To connect the modified Wells-Riley equation to HVAC filtration, we first linked likely infectious particle removal efficiency with the Minimum Efficiency Reporting Value (MERV) classification from ASHRAE Standard 52.2. A summary of the MERV table from Standard 52.2 is shown in Table 3 along with best estimates of particle filtration efficiency for lower-MERV filters that have no MERV requirement for certain particle size bins (i.e., MERV 4e11). Average values across each of the 0.3e1 mm and 1e3 mm size bins were taken from a previous study that measured the in-situ removal efficiency of lower efficiency filters [56] ; these values also align similarly to other previous studies [57, 58] .

Subsequently, the range of infectious particle size distributions for influenza virus from Table 2 were linked to the filter removal efficiencies in Table 3 by an infectious particle size-weighting procedure, as shown in Equation (4).

where h filter ¼ infectious particle size weighted filtration efficiency (À); h i ¼ size-resolved particle filtration efficiency for the geometric mean diameter of particle size bin i (from Table 3 ); and F i ¼ the fraction of virus content associated with particle size bin i (from Table 2 ). Because there are multiple references for the distribution of influenza virus content in size-fractioned aerosols, we introduced an estimate of uncertainty by assuming the infectious particle size distributions from each environment in each referenced study were equally likely to be present in the modeled indoor environment. These distributions for each filter are shown in Table 4 , along with the mean infectious particle removal efficiency for each filter averaged across each study in Table 2 Mean filtration efficiency values for infectious droplet nuclei are estimated to range from 10.5% for MERV 4 filters to 99.9% for HEPA filters. Assumptions across the wide range of infectious particle size distributions summarized in Table 2 lead to infectious droplet nuclei removal efficiencies that vary by as much as 19% absolutely (although the range narrows for higher MERV filters because of high removal efficiencies for all particle size ranges).

While Table 4 provides estimates for assumed removal efficiencies for various MERV filters across the size ranges of concern for infectious droplet nuclei transmission, other important parameters for determining the impact of filtration on infectious disease risk in indoor environments include the infectious particle deposition rate and the recirculation rate through the HVAC system (which is a function of specific building characteristics).

Particle deposition rates (k deposition ) are important for removal of indoor aerosols but are highly variable depending on the nature of the indoor environment [59, 60] . The original Wells-Riley model neglected particle deposition; however, for the particle sizes considered, it is more appropriate to account for deposition [4, 34, 35] . For simplicity, we assume constant values of k deposition based on size-resolved values used in Riley et al. (2002) [33, 61] .

Using a geometric mean diameter between 0.3 and 1 mm (0.55 mm), between 1 and 3 mm (1.7 mm), and between 3 and 10 mm (5.5 mm), deposition rates were estimated as w0.10 per hour, w0.45 per hour, and w3.0 per hour, respectively (taken directly from their Fig. 3 ). When combined with the mean infectious particle size distributions from Table 2 , these lead to a mean size-weighted estimate of w1.7 per hour for k deposition for particles containing the influenza virus. Values for k deposition ranged from w1.0 to w2.3 per hour depending on the range of infectious particle size distributions assumed from Table 2 . These values for k deposition for influenza were kept constant in each model scenario.

This section relies on a case study of a particular indoor environment (an office) to demonstrate the likely impacts that HVAC filtration can have on the risk of spreading a particular airborne infectious disease (influenza). The methods used herein are generalizable and repeatable for other environments although the results are limited to assumptions for the hypothetical environment.

We considered a hypothetical 500 m 2 office building with 3 m ceilings (V ¼ 1500 m 3 ). We assume the office space has 25 occupants, one of which is infected with the influenza virus (I ¼ 1; susceptibles ¼ 24). Per ASHRAE Standard 62.1 [62] , the minimum outdoor air ventilation rate should be 8.5 m 3 /hr per person þ 1.1 m 3 /hr per m 2 of floor area, which is equivalent to w760 m 3 /hr in the assumed space (yielding an air exchange rate (AER) ¼ 0.51/hr). Assuming the outdoor air supply fraction of total airflow is 25% [63] , the total supply airflow rate is w3000 m 3 /hr, with w2300 m 3 /hr provided as recirculated air. The removal rate due to recirculated air filtration is thus w1.52 Â h filter per hour (where 2300 m 3 /hr divided by 1500 m 3 ¼ 1.52/hour; multiply by particle removal efficiency to get k filtration , assuming that f HVAC ¼ 1). In the office we assumed that adult occupants work 8-h days (t ¼ 8 h) and that all occupants have an average breathing rate (p) of 0.67 m 3 /hr [64] . We relied on a central estimate of previously published values of quanta generation rate (q) for influenza: q ¼ 100 per hour. However we also explore the sensitivity to our modeling results using both upper bounds (q ¼ 500 per hour) and lower bounds (q ¼ 15 per hour) in the uncertainty analysis.

Although outdoor air ventilation rates have been shown to decrease the risk of spreading some infectious airborne diseases, introducing more ventilation air also comes with an energy penalty. Conversely, the introduction of higher efficiency filtration typically increases the pressure drop across the filter, which, in commercial systems with variable air volume fans and airflow controls, will generally increase the amount of energy required to move the same amount of airflow. The next sections describe methods to estimate the annual costs of both outdoor air ventilation and various levels of filtration.

The amount of energy required to condition excess ventilation air varies according to the magnitude of outdoor airflow rates, climate conditions, and system and equipment efficiency. However, approximate estimates of the amount of energy required to condition the sensible load from outdoor air ventilation can be made using metrics of heating-degree-days (HDD) and cooling-degreedays (CDD) and by making assumptions about equipment efficiency and system operational times [65, 66] . An approximation of the amount of energy required for heating on an annual basis was made using Equation (5) . This equation assumes that outdoor air ventilation rates do not vary during operational times. 

where E heating ¼ energy required for heating (MJ); r air ¼ density of air (1.2 kg/m 3 ); C p,air ¼ specific heat capacity of air (1000 J/(kg-K)); HDD ¼ heating degree days during times of building operation (Kdays); h heating ¼ conversion efficiency of heating equipment (À); and a ¼ units conversion factor (24 h/day Â 10 À6 MJ/J). Similarly, the amount of energy required for cooling on an annual basis was approximated using Equation (6) (and utilizing the same assumptions as Equation (5)):

where E cooling ¼ electricity required for cooling (kWh); h cooling ¼ electric efficiency of cooling equipment (À);

CDD ¼ cooling degree days during times of building operation (Kdays); and b ¼ units conversion factor (24 h/day Â 0.277 kWh/ MJ Â 10 À6 MJ/J). Finally, annual energy costs were estimated by multiplying average utility rates (assuming these are constant for simplicity) by the amount of delivered energy required. We assumed that electricity was used for cooling and natural gas was used for heating. We estimated the cost of outdoor air delivery in the case study office environment for four different locations across the United States: Chicago, IL, Charlotte, NC, Houston, TX, and Phoenix, AZ. We assumed that a 90% efficient natural gas boiler or furnace was used for heating and the air-conditioning equipment had a constant electric coefficient of performance (COP) of 3.0 (or approximately SEER 12, which is in line with many relatively new existing commercial buildings [67] ). We assumed that the office building did not operate continuously year-round, but that it operated w31% of the time (i.e., 11 h per day from 7 am to 6 pm to accommodate staff members, excluding holidays and weekends). We used the defined operational schedule and hourly TMY3 (typical meteorological year) weather data to calculate HDDs and CDDs for each hour of assumed operation [68] . HDDs and CDDs were calculated using a base temperature of 18.3 C. Estimates of HDDs and CDDs utilized in the model are shown in Table 5 , along with estimated annual costs of supplying one unit of outdoor ventilation air in each climate. We assumed electricity rates were constant at $0.12/kWh and that natural gas rates were $8/MMBTU (1 MMBTU ¼ 1055 MJ). These are generally in line with national average rates although we do not explore geographic variations for simplicity.

In commercial environments with variable speed fans, any additional cost of HVAC filtration can be expressed first in terms of additional fan power required to overcome the additional pressure drop associated with a higher efficiency (typically higher pressure drop) filter. This is not necessarily the case in many smaller commercial environments [69] , but is a reasonable assumption for this analysis. The additional fan power required to deliver a particular airflow rate through an HVAC system can be estimated in Equation (7).

where W fan ¼ power draw required for filtration (W); Q filter ¼ airflow rate through the HVAC filter (m 3 /s); DP avg ¼ average pressure drop across filter (Pa); h fan ¼ fan efficiency (assumed 70% constant as in Bekö et al., 2008) ; and h motor ¼ motor efficiency (assumed 65% constant as in Bekö et al., 2008 [70] ). The total fan energy cost can be estimated using Equation (8) .

C fan energy ¼ W fan t operating P electricity (8) where C fan energy ¼ cost required to overcome filter pressure drop ($); t operating ¼ amount of time that the building is occupied (hours); and P electricity ¼ electric price ($/Wh). The fan was assumed to operate 100% of the time that the building was occupied.

To estimate the total cost of filtration, one must also consider the initial cost of the filtration product itself, the number of filters required for each installation, the typical lifespan of filtration products, and the labor for filter installation and subsequent disposal at the end of its useful life [70] . Labor costs were estimated directly from Bekö et al. (2008) as $12 per filter installation and $5 per filter disposal. Assuming each filter is 24 00 Â 24 00 (0.6 Â 0.6 m), the number of filters required for the office environment was estimated by (i) dividing the airflow rate through the HVAC filter by an assumed constant 2 m/s face velocity, which yields the approximate area of filtration required, and (ii) determining the number of 24 00 Â 24 00 (61 Â 61 cm) filters to achieve that approximate area, rounding to the nearest whole number. This yielded one filter required in the hypothetical office environment. Annual labor costs were estimated by multiplying the labor cost of changing one filter ($12 þ $5 ¼ $17 per filter) by the estimated number of filter replacements during one year of operation. The initial costs of filtration products and the typical expected filter life spans were taken from an anonymous contact in the commercial filtration industry, as shown in Table 6 . The AHU fan in the office environment was assumed to operate 2717 h per year (or 31%) as described in Section 3.4.1.

This section first describes results from the infection risk modeling effort, followed by results from cost estimates and cost comparisons between filtration and outdoor air ventilation. Fig. 1 shows the predicted risk of infection by the influenza virus during an 8-h workday in the hypothetical office building with 25 occupants using a range of HVAC filters installed in the constant operation HVAC system. The central estimates represent risks predicted using Equation (2) with a quanta generation rate of 100 per hour and the mean assumption of viral particle size distributions from Table 2 . The error bars represent minimum and maximum risks predicted according to the range of assumptions for viral particle size distributions in Table 2 and infectious aerosol removal efficiencies in Table 4 (assuming the same quanta generation rate).

Using the central estimate for infectious particle size distributions (i.e., the mean from Table 2 ) and q ¼ 100 per hour, 15% of the susceptible occupants (4 out of 24) are estimated to acquire the flu virus from the sole infectious individual if the building is operated without a filter installed. The various assumptions for infectious aerosol size distributions from Table 2 impact estimates of absolute risk in each scenario, although trends across filter scenarios are unaffected. For example, the range of assumptions for size-resolved distributions of virus content in indoor aerosols results in an estimate of the absolute risk of acquiring influenza of between 12% and 21% without a filter installed.

Continuing with the central estimate of infectious particle size distributions, even a relatively low efficiency filter (MERV 7) is predicted to reduce the number of infected individuals by 1 (to 12% risk). Increasing to MERV 13 or higher likely prevents another individual from airborne influenza infection (to 10% or lower risk). Finally, increasing to MERV 16 or HEPA filtration has the same effect of lowering the likely number of infected individuals to 2 (with a w35e40% reduction relative to no or low filtration efficiency). For MERV 13 and greater, risk reductions are limited not by filtration efficiency but by the amount of airflow recirculating through the HVAC system and filter. Increasing recirculation rates may show stronger impacts of higher efficiency filters; however, these results Table 5 Climate conditions (HDD and CDD) and annual cost of outdoor air delivery used for the office environment under the assumed operational schedule in each location. suggest that MERV 13 can reduce the risk of influenza infection by as many as two individuals in this environment. For reference, one avoided influenza case has been estimated to provide approximately $375 in economic benefits in the United States [1] .

While the infection risk reductions shown in the previous section are absolute, we can also explore trends in risk reductions for each filtration case using a measure of relative risk (RR), as shown in Fig. 2 . RR values use the ""no filter"" condition as a baseline; thus, each RR is calculated as the probability of infection with a particular filter installed divided by the probability of infection without a filter installed. The black line shows the RR in the office assuming the mean assumption for infectious aerosol size distributions and a quanta generation rate of 100 per hour. The gray area shows how RR responds to the different assumptions for viral particle size distributions in Table 2 .

In Fig. 2 , MERV 4 filters are shown to provide only a 6e7% reduction in risk relative to no filtration. MERV 7 filters are likely to provide a 19e25% reduction in risk (RR ¼ 0.75e0.81) and MERV 11 filters are expected to provide 28e35% risk reductions (RR ¼ 0.65e 0.72). MERV 13 and greater levels of filtration are expected to provide between 31% and 47% risk reductions compared to an environment without filtration installed (RR ¼ 0.53e0.69).

Although not shown here, we also explored the effects of assuming different values of quanta generation rates for the influenza virus (ranging from 15 to 500 per hour). Ranges in assumptions for q greatly impact absolute risks as Equation (2) demonstrates (and more so than assumptions for particle size distributions of viral content), but relative risks remain largely unchanged (although the bounds on uncertainty are higher).

The following sections summarize results from the operational cost analysis for both HVAC filtration and outdoor air ventilation.

Using the costs and physical properties for filters described in Table 5 in conjunction with the procedure outlined in Section 3.4.2, estimates of the annual costs of filtration were made for each filtration scenario. Results are shown graphically in Fig. 3 and in tabular form in Table 7 . Total annual costs of filtration are divided into annual fan energy costs, filter purchase costs, and labor costs (which includes the cost of disposal).

Annual HVAC filtration costs are predicted to range from $112 for the MERV 

In order to compare estimates of annual HVAC filtration costs to the annual costs for delivering outdoor air ventilation, Fig. 4 shows annual costs of both filtration and outdoor air (OA) ventilation normalized by unit removal rate of each scenario. This normalized filtration cost is the total cost of filtration (i.e., the sum of annual labor, filter, and fan energy costs) divided by the average estimate of the infectious aerosol removal rate (i.e., the mean infectious removal efficiency from Table 4 multiplied by the HVAC recirculation rate in the space). This provides a measure of the cost of each control mechanism relative to its ability to remove infectious droplet nuclei from indoor air in units of $ per 1/hr. Fig. 4 contains data for both outdoor air ventilation in each of the four U.S. cities described previously and each level of HVAC filtration operating in the hypothetical office environment (assuming the central estimate of viral content distributions in indoor aerosols).

According to Fig. 4 , MERV 13 and 14 filtration products are estimated to provide the least expensive removal mechanism in this office environment (in terms of $USD per 1/hour of infectious droplet nuclei removal rate). This is attributed to both relatively high effectiveness (as described in Sections 4.1 and 4.2) and relatively low costs of operation (as shown in Fig. 3 ). Even HEPA filtration is expected to cost less on an annual basis than outdoor air ventilation in all climates. MERV 4 is the only filtration product that is more expensive than outdoor air ventilation according to this metric, primarily because of its very low effectiveness. Although this approach allows for direct comparison between OA ventilation and HVAC filtration, it does not provide information about achievable risk reductions in particular environments.

In order to compare costs of operation directly to estimates of risk reductions for both HVAC filtration and OA ventilation, Fig. 5 plots the mean predicted relative risk (RR) values from the Wells-Riley modeling (from Fig. 2 ) versus the total cost of providing that same risk reduction with both outdoor air ventilation in each climate and with each level of HVAC filtration. To compare OA ventilation in each location directly to HVAC filtration, OA ventilation rates have been adjusted to achieve the same removal rate as that of each level of HVAC filtration. For example, a MERV 15 filter is expected to achieve 1.37 per hour in infectious droplet nuclei removal in the office environment with the mean assumption for infectious particle size distributions; for outdoor air ventilation to achieve the same risk reduction as filtration, the office HVAC system would need to provide 1.37 additional air changes per hour of outdoor air ventilation. Therefore, OA ventilation and HVAC filtration can be thought of as equivalent in terms of risk reduction (on the y-axis), but will differ in their cost estimates (on the x-axis). For each of the four geographic locations, the cost per unit ($ per 1/hr) ventilation energy costs from Table 5 was used to estimate the cost of providing this equivalent reduction.

As Fig. 5 shows, for each level of risk reduction achievable by the use of every level of HVAC filtration except MERV 4, filtration is estimated to be less expensive on an annual basis than equivalent outdoor air ventilation in each of the four climate zones. MERV 13 and MERV 14 filters appear to achieve an optimal combination of lowest risk reductions at least costs. MERV 4 is actually more expensive to operate than providing equivalent outdoor air ventilation in each climate, primarily because of the very low effectiveness in controlling infectious aerosols. HEPA filtration appears to offer only a small incremental advantage over MERV 13e16 filters (i.e., 1e4% lower RR) for as much as 1.6e2.3 times the cost of operation, which suggests that MERV 13e16 filters may be most appropriate for cost-effectively reducing risks of influenza transmission in this particular indoor environment. In fact, switching from MERV 7 to MERV 13 could likely reduce the number of infected individuals in this office environment by one person at an additional annual cost of only $17. Compared to the estimated economic losses of a single influenza case of $375, MERV 13 Table 7 Estimated annual cost of filtration in the office environment.

Annual filter product costs filtration could provide a benefit-to-cost ratio of 20 or more. These basic relationships were not sensitive to the various assumptions for infectious particle size distributions.

According to the results herein, filtration of recirculated air may be able to reduce the transmission of airborne infectious diseases in this particular indoor environment. Although there is a tremendous amount of uncertainty involved in each step of this modeling effort, the sensitivity of the model to input parameters for both infectious aerosol size distributions and for quanta generation rates was shown to be relatively small for relative risks. The sensitivity to each parameter was larger for absolute risks, with much greater uncertainty associated with assumptions for quanta generation rates.

While this case study on a single office environment has been presented for demonstration, more robust statistical techniques could also be used to simulate a wide range of buildings, occupants, and infectious aerosol properties to provide a more generalizable estimate of the likely impacts of filtration across the building stock. Additionally, risk models should be used in conjunction with more detailed hourly building energy balances to more accurately explore the energy impacts of infectious disease filtration relative to control by outdoor air ventilation, which will necessarily vary by climate, human occupancy and activity, and building operational characteristics. Additionally, it is clear that particle size distributions of expelled droplet nuclei should be measured in more standardized ways with much greater numbers of individuals than only those studies identified in the literature review and summarized in Table 2 . Last, future epidemiological work should also validate the predictions herein.

It should be noted that there are also more physically and biologically grounded models for assessing risks of infectious respiratory diseases, such as doseeresponse (DeR) models that incorporate mass balances and/or Markov chains that predict infectious particle concentrations, exposures, and doses, the ""infectivity"" of the particles, and the organism's susceptibility to disease [29, 71, 72] . DeR models have been used in recent studies to model infectious disease transmission using more mechanistic properties of both tuberculosis [73] and influenza [39, 71] ; however, DeR models also have their own inherent limitations, including often requiring interspecies extrapolation to estimate susceptibility of a human subject. Regardless, results from the modeling effort herein demonstrate that HVAC filtration can very likely play a role in preventing the transmission of airborne infectious diseases at lower costs than providing an equivalent amount of outdoor air ventilation, as previous studies have typically explored [3, 4, 6, 7] .

In this work, an existing airborne infectious disease risk model (the Wells-Riley equation) was modified to include removal by recirculating HVAC filters and linked directly to the primary rating metric of ASHRAE Standard 52.2 for filtration products: MERV. Based on a series of assumptions about infectious particle size distributions resulting from human activities in indoor environments, the risk of acquiring the influenza virus from a single infector was modeled in a hypothetical office environment with a particular focus on what levels of risk reductions could be achieved by different levels of HVAC filtration and equivalent outdoor air ventilation, and at what costs of operation. Overall, recirculating HVAC filtration was predicted to achieve the greatest risk reductions at lower costs of operation than equivalent outdoor air ventilation, particularly for MERV 13e16 filters. Medium efficiency filtration products (MERV 7e11) are also inexpensive to operate but appear less effective in reducing infectious disease risks.

Adaptive Contact Networks Change Effective Disease Infectiousness and Dynamics,"Human societies are organized in complex webs that are constantly reshaped by a social dynamic which is influenced by the information individuals have about others. Similarly, epidemic spreading may be affected by local information that makes individuals aware of the health status of their social contacts, allowing them to avoid contact with those infected and to remain in touch with the healthy. Here we study disease dynamics in finite populations in which infection occurs along the links of a dynamical contact network whose reshaping may be biased based on each individual's health status. We adopt some of the most widely used epidemiological models, investigating the impact of the reshaping of the contact network on the disease dynamics. We derive analytical results in the limit where network reshaping occurs much faster than disease spreading and demonstrate numerically that this limit extends to a much wider range of time scales than one might anticipate. Specifically, we show that from a population-level description, disease propagation in a quickly adapting network can be formulated equivalently as disease spreading on a well-mixed population but with a rescaled infectiousness. We find that for all models studied here -SI, SIS and SIR -the effective infectiousness of a disease depends on the population size, the number of infected in the population, and the capacity of healthy individuals to sever contacts with the infected. Importantly, we indicate how the use of available information hinders disease progression, either by reducing the average time required to eradicate a disease (in case recovery is possible), or by increasing the average time needed for a disease to spread to the entire population (in case recovery or immunity is impossible).","During recent years it has become clear that disease spreading [1] [2] [3] transcends geography: the contact process is no longer restricted to the immediate geographical neighbors, but exhibits the stereotypical small-world phenomenon with inescapable impact [4] [5] [6] [7] . The SARS and, at the time of writing, the influenza A outbreaks provide arresting examples of this effect in a biological context, although the spread of computer viruses constitutes perhaps the most obvious manifestation of such a property. Recent advances in the science of networks [2] also brought the impact of disease interactions beyond geography to the spotlight, providing compelling evidence of the role that the networks of contacts between individuals or computers play in the dynamics of infectious diseases [3, 5] . In the majority of cases in which complex networks of disease spreading have been considered [7] , they were taken to be static entities. However, social networks are intrinsically dynamical entities. In fact, modern societies have developed rapid means of information dissemination, both at local and at centralized levels, which one naturally expects to alter individuals' response to vaccination policies, their behavior with respect to other individuals and their perception of likelihood and risk of infection [8] . In some cases one may even witness the adoption of centralized measures, such as travel restrictions [9, 10] or the imposition of quarantine spanning parts of the population [11] , which may induce abrupt dynamical features onto the structure of the contact network. Furthermore, individual knowledge (based on local information) about the health status of acquaintances, partners, relatives, etc., combined with individual preventive strategies [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] such as condoms, vaccination, the use of face masks or prophylactic drugs, avoidance of visiting specific web-pages, staying away from public places, etc., may also lead to bias in the organization of disease paths along dynamical networks.

As a result, quite a few studies have recently investigated the impact of dynamical networks on disease progression, as well as the influence of the way information (disease awareness) flows in parallel with disease progression and the role of noise in disease dynamics [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] . At par with these models, our model studies disease dynamics in a finite and constant population of individuals. Contrary to current models though (see Discussion Section for more details), our dynamical contact structure allows for a variable number of overall links between individuals, which in turn depends on the overall incidence of disease in the population. This increased complexity of the model, however, will allow us to describe analytically disease dynamics in finite populations. Infection occurs along the links of a contact network whose structure may change based on each individual's health status and the availability of information regarding the health status of others. We assume the existence of some form of (unsupervised) local information about the health status of social contacts, depending on which individuals may be more or less effective in avoiding contact with those infected while remaining in touch with the healthy. We investigate some of the most widely used models of disease spreading, such as the popular Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) model [1, 3] , the Susceptible-Infected (SI) model [1] used to study, e.g., AIDS [1, 34] , and the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model [1, 35] , more appropriate to model, for instance, single season flu outbreaks [1] or computer virus spreading [5] . We provide analytical results which show that, on finite adaptive networks, the effective infectiousness of a disease depends on i) the size of the population, ii) the number of infected and ultimately iii) on the efficiency of local information spreading. These results, obtained under the assumption that network reshaping occurs much faster than disease spreading, are shown (numerically) to remain valid for a much wider range of time scales. When combined with the analytical results already known for static networks [3] , which describe well the opposite limit in which the network dynamics is slow compared to disease dynamics, we demonstrate that one can describe analytically most of the time scale spectra. We further show how availability of information may either drastically reduce the time required to eradicate a disease (when recovery from the disease is possible), or drastically increase the time after which the entire population becomes infected (when the disease cannot be cured). Finally, we discuss the implications of assuming that individuals exhibit diverse response profiles to available information [36] [37] [38] .

Let us start by introducing the well established SIS model [1, 3] , whereby individuals can be in one of two epidemiological states: Infected (I) or Susceptible (S). Individuals occupy the nodes of a graph, whereas the links of the graph define who interacts with whom. As usual, we define a transmission probability l and a recovery probability d. We assume a population of finite and constant size N, but with variable number of links [39, 40] . Links are established and removed at rates which also depend on the health status of the individuals connected: Links of different types -SS, SI and II -will tend to last differently. The SIR model, on the other hand, requires the introduction of a new epidemiological state -Recovered (or Removed, R) -representing individuals who, once recovered from the infection, acquire immunity. In SIR, the same parameters l and d defined above remain finite, but now we have three new kinds of links -SR, RI and RR. Finally, the SI model can be viewed as the limit of the SIS model when d~0, representing diseases from which recovery is impossible.

Suppose all individuals seek to establish links at the same rate c. For simplicity, we assume that new links are established and removed randomly, a feature which may not always apply in real cases, where the limited social horizon of individuals or the nature of their social ties may constrain part of their neighborhood structure (see Discussion). Let us further assume that links may be broken off at different rates, based on the nature of the links and the information available about the neighbors: Let us denote these rates by b pq for links of type pq (p,q [ S,I,R f g). This allows us to write down a system of ordinary differential equations [39, 40] for the time evolution of the number of links of each type. These and all other technical details of the model are presented in the Methods section. In the steady state of the linking dynamics, the number of links of each type is given by L Ã pq~wpq L M pq , where w pq~c czb pq À Á are the fractions of active pq-links, compared to the maximum possible number of links L M pq , for a given number of S, I and R. In the absence of disease only SS links exist, and hence w SS determines the average connectivity of the network under disease free conditions, characterizing the type of the population under study. In the presence of I individuals, to the extent that S individuals manage to avoid contact with I, they succeed in escaping infection. Hence, the intuition is clear: Reshaping of the contact network based on available information of the health status of individuals will contribute to inhibit disease progression. In the extreme limit of perfect information and individual capacity to immediately break up contacts with infected, we are isolating all infected, thus containing disease progression. Our goal here, however, is to understand how and in which way partial individual information affects the overall disease dynamics.

Often individuals prevent infection by avoiding unprotected contact with infected once they know the state of their contacts or are aware of the potential risks of such infection [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] 28, 32] : such is the case of many sexually transmitted diseases [12, [41] [42] [43] , for example, and, more recently, the voluntary use of face masks and the associated campaigns adopted by local authorities in response to the SARS outbreak [11, [13] [14] [15] . In the present study, we assume that individuals are not centrally supervised or informed: Individual decision is based on available local information about the health state of one's contacts. To the extent that such information spreads quickly and contacts are not too frequent, one can study analytically the limit in which the network dynamics -resulting from adaptation to the flow of local information -is much faster than disease dynamics. In this case, one may separate the time scales between network adaptation and contact (disease) dynamics: The network has time to reach a steady state before the next contact takes place. Consequently, the probability of having an infected neighbor is modified by a neighborhood structure which will change in time depending on the impact of the disease in the population and the overall efficiency of local information flow. It will be shown that a quickly adapting community induces profound changes in the dynamics of disease spreading, irrespective of the underlying epidemic model. Furthermore, we will demonstrate numerically that the two limiting cases amenable to analytic treatment -static networks on the one hand, and quickly adapting networks on the other hand

During the past decade, we learned that the structure of contact networks plays a crucial role in the spread of diseases. Most theoretical studies addressing this issue assume that contact networks are static entities, whereas the actual disease paths continuously reshape based on local social dynamics. This work aims to achieve a better understanding of disease spreading in populations characterized by a dynamically structured contact network where contacts appear and disappear over time. The network dynamics are entangled with the disease dynamics, as individuals may have access to local information that makes them aware of both the existence of the disease and the health status of their contacts, allowing them to minimize exposure to infection. Here we show the equivalence between disease propagation in an adaptive contact network and that in a well-mixed population with a rescaled transmission probability, which depends also on the fraction of infected in the population. Thus, one can emulate the effect of an adaptive contact network with a simple correction of the transmission probability. This result is obtained in the limit where network adaptation proceeds much faster than disease spreading, but we demonstrate that it also holds for a much wider range of scenarios.

-remain valid for a wide range of intermediate time scales, strengthening the power of the analytical predictions derived here.

The amount of information available translates into differences mostly between the break-up rates of links that may involve a potential risk for further infection (b SI , b IR , b II ), and those that do not (b SS , b SR , b RR ). Therefore, we consider one particular rate b I for links involving infected individuals (b I :b SI~bIR~bII ), and another one, b H , for links connecting healthy individuals (b H :b SS~bSR~bRR ). In general, one expects b I to be maximal when each individual has perfect information about the state of her neighbors and to be (minimal and) equal to b H when no information is available, turning the ratio between these two rates into a quantitative measure of the amount of information available or the efficiency of information use. Note that we reduce the model to two break-up rates in order to facilitate the discussion of the results. The general principles and conclusions remain valid when all break-up rates are incorporated explicitly. It is worth noticing that three out of these six rates are of particular importance for the overall disease dynamics: b SS , b SR and b SI . These three rates, combined with the rate c of creating new links, define the fraction of active SS, SR and SI links, and subsequent correlations between individuals [44] , and therefore determine the probability for a susceptible to become infected (see Methods). This probability will increase when considering higher values of c (assuming b I .b H ). In other words, when individuals create new links more often, therefore increasing the likelihood of establishing connections to infected individuals (when present), they need to be better informed about the health state of their contacts in order to escape infection. In the fast linking limit, the other three break-up rates (b II , b IR and b RR ) influence disease progression since they contribute to altering the average degree of the network.

In the Methods, we show that disease spreading in a quickly adapting network can be studied as if it took place in a well-mixed population with same average degree SkT as the original network and transmission probability l A . Since the lifetime of a link depends on its type, the average degree SkT of the network depends on the number of infected in the population, and hence becomes frequency (and time) dependent. Similarly, fast linking dynamics leads to a rescaling of the transmission probability, l?l A~g{1 l, with g depending on the particular model of disease spreading. In the SIR model, g is given by

where i denotes the number of infected individuals in the population and r the number of recovered (immune). The rescaling parameter g for the SI and SIS models is the same, but with r~0. Note that g scales linearly with the frequency of infected in the population, decreasing the more individuals get infected (assuming w SS =w SI w1), and depends implicitly (via the ratio w SS =w SI ) on the amount of information available. We would like to stress the distinction between the description of the disease dynamics at the local level and that at the population level. Strictly speaking, a dynamical network does not change the disease dynamics at the local level, meaning that infected individuals pass the disease to their neighbors with probability intrinsic to the disease itself. At the population level, on the other hand, disease progression proceeds as if the infectiousness of the disease effectively changes, as a result of the network dynamics. Hence, analyzing an adaptive network scenario at a population level can be achieved via a correction on the transmission probability, keeping the mathematically more attractive wellmixed scenario. In this sense, from a well-mixed perspective, dynamical networks contribute to change the effective infectiousness of the disease, which becomes frequency and information dependent.

One can define a gradient of infection G, which measures the tendency of the disease to either expand or shrink in a population with given configuration (defined by the number of individuals in each of the states S, I and R). For the SIS model, eradication of the disease is favored (G(i),0), irrespective of the fraction of infected, whenever R A 0 : l d Nw SI v1 (see Eq. 35 in Text S1), indicating how the presence of information (b H ,b I ) changes the basic reproductive ratio. This is illustrated in the upper panel of Figure 1 , which depicts G for different values of b I (assuming b H ƒb I ) and a fixed transmission probability l. The corresponding quasi-stationary distributions, which characterize the relative time the population spends in each configuration (and defined in Methods), are shown in the lower panel and clearly reflect the sign of G. Whenever G(i) is positive (negative), the dynamics will act to increase (decrease), on average, the number of infected. Figure 1 indicates how the availability of local yet reliable information hinders disease progression: For b I~0 :75 the interior root of G(i) disappears, making disease expansion unlikely in any configuration of the population.

The analysis of the gradient of infection of the SIS model has the natural advantage of showing the effect of adaptive networks in a one-dimensional simplex (the fraction of infected). Yet, an analogous result holds for the SIR model. The gradient of infection now also depends on the number of recovered (r) individuals in the population and, once again, allows us to identify when disease expansion will be favored or not. Figure 2 gives a complete picture of the gradient of infection, using the appropriate simplex structure in which all points satisfy the relation i+r+s = N. The dashed red line indicates where G i,r ð Þ~0 in case individuals do not have any information about the health status of their contacts, i.e., links that involve infected individuals disappear at the same rate as those that do not (b I~bH ). Disease expansion is more likely than disease contraction (G i,r ð Þw0) when the population is in a configuration above the line, and less likely otherwise. Similarly, the solid blue line indicates where G i,r ð Þ~0 whenever individuals share information about their health status, and use it to avoid contact with infected. Once again, the availability of information modifies the disease dynamics, inhibiting disease progression for a broad range of configurations.

Up to now we have assumed that the network dynamics proceeds much faster than disease spreading. This may not always be the case, and hence it is important to assess the domain of validity of this limit. In the following, we discuss the particular case of the SIS model. An analogous study for both SIR and SI yields qualitatively similar results, as discussed in the Text S1. Figure 3 shows the average SIT of the quasi-stationary distributions (circles) obtained via computer simulations (see Methods for details) as a function of the relative time scale t of network update (taking as unit time scale that associated with disease dynamics). Whenever t??, we can characterize the disease dynamics analytically, assuming a well-mixed population (complete graph), whereas for t?0 we recover the analytical results obtained in the fast linking limit. At intermediate time scales, Figure 3 shows that as long as t is smaller than 10, network dynamics contributes to inhibit disease spreading by effectively increasing the critical spreading rate. Overall, the validity of the time scale separation extends well beyond the limits one might anticipate based solely on the time separation ansatz. As long as the time scale for network update is smaller than the one for disease spreading (tv1), the analytical prediction for the limit t?0, indicated by the lower dashed line in Figure 3 , remains valid. The analytical result in the extreme opposite limit (t??), indicated by the upper dashed line in Figure 3 , holds as long as tw10 5 . Moreover, it is noteworthy that the network dynamics influences the disease dynamics both by reducing the frequency of interactions between susceptible and infected, but also by reducing the average degree of the network. These complementary effects are disentangled for intermediate regimes, in which the network dynamics is too slow to warrant sustained protection of susceptible individuals from contacts with infected, despite managing to reduce the average degree (shown by crosses). In fact, for tw10 the disease dynamics is mostly controlled by the average degree, as shown by the solid lines in Figure 3 . Here, the average stationary distribution was determined by replacing, in the analytic expression for static networks, SkT by the timedependent average connectivity SkT Ã computed numerically.

Note that the specific behavior of SkT Ã shown in Figure 3 results from the frequency dependence of SkT. When b I wb H , the network will reshape into a configuration with smaller SkT as soon as the disease expansion occurs. For tv1, SkT Ã reflects the lifetime of SS links, as there are hardly any infected in the population. For 10 0 vtv10 3 , the network dynamics proceeds fast enough to reduce SkT, but too slowly to reach its full potential in hindering disease progression. Given the higher fraction of infected, and the fact that SI and II links have a shorter lifetime than SS links, the average degree drops when increasing t from 1 to 10 3 . Any further increase in t leads to a higher average degree, as the network approaches its static limit.

Contrary to the deterministic SIS model, the stochastic nature of disease spreading in finite populations renders certain the probability that the disease disappears after some time. However, this result is of little relevance given the associated times required to reach the absorbing state (except, possibly, in very small communities). Indeed, the characteristic time scale of the dynamics plays a determinant role in the overall epidemiological process and constitutes a central issue in disease spreading.

In the Text S1 we derive an analytical expression for the average recovery time (t i ) of a population with i infected individuals. Figure 4A shows the recovery time t 1 in adaptive networks for different levels of information, illustrating the spectacular effect brought about by the network dynamics on the recovery time. While on networks without information (b I = b H ) the recovery time rapidly increases with the rate of infection l, adding information moves the fraction of infected individuals rapidly to the absorbing state, and, therefore, to the disappearance of the disease. Moreover, as shown in the Text S1, the size of the population can have a profound effect on the recovery times. With increasing population size, the population spends most of the time in the vicinity of the state associated with the interior root of G(i). For large populations, this acts to reduce the intrinsic stochasticity of the dynamics, dictating a very slow extinction of the disease.

When recovery from the disease is impossible, a situation captured by the SI model, the population will never become disease-free again once it acquires at least one infected individual. The Markov chain that represents such diseases therefore has another absorbing state, corresponding to networks where everyone has been infected, besides the previous one in which no one is infected. The time to reach this state again depends on the presence of information. When information prevails, susceptible individuals manage to resist infection for a long time, thereby delaying the rapid progression of the disease, as shown in the inset of Figure 4B . Naturally, the average number of generations needed to reach a fully infected population increases with the availability of information, as illustrated in the main panel of Figure 4B .

Finally, in all models discussed here we also investigated the effect of allowing for different individual rates associated with the way each individual creates or destroys her social ties. Due to agestructure of most populations or intrinsic individual or cultural differences, some individuals will tend to react differently whenever they, or a contact, get infected [36, 38] . In the Text S1 we show that the disease spreading remains unaffected when individual rates (of seeking and removing links) are drawn from a normal distribution with variable variance, as long as the average value for the rate remains unchanged.

Making use of three standard models of epidemics involving a finite population in which infection takes place along the links of a dynamical graph, the nodes of which are occupied by individuals, we have shown analytically that the bias in graph dynamics resulting from the availability of information about the health status of others in the population induces fundamental changes in the overall dynamics of disease progression.

The network dynamics proposed here differs from those used in previous models of disease spreading on adaptive networks [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] . Similar to most models, the population size remains fixed. Unlike most of these studies, however, we do not impose any local or global linking constraints, meaning that individuals can create (or remove) a link without the need for removing (or creating) another one -in other words, the number of links will change in time, also adapting to the disease configuration of the population. Consequently, the average degree of the network results from the self-organization of the network structure, and co-evolves with the disease dynamics (cf. networks evolving towards critical values of connectivity, as studied in [45] ). A population suffering from high disease prevalence where individuals avoid contact in order to escape infection will therefore exhibit a lower average degree than a population with hardly any infected individuals. Such a frequency-dependent average degree prevents also that containment of infected individuals would result automatically in the formation of a dense healthy cluster, which is extremely vulnerable to future infection, as reported before in [21, 25, 26] .

The description of disease spreading as a stochastic contact process embedded in a Markov chain constitutes a second important distinction between the present model and previous studies. This approach allows for a direct comparison between analytical predictions and individual-based computer simulations, and for a detailed analysis of finite-size effects and convergence times, whose exponential growth will signal possible bistable disease scenarios. In such a framework, we were able to show that adaptive networks in which individuals may be informed about the health status of others lead to a disease whose effective infectiousness depends on the overall number of infected in the population. In other words, disease propagation on adaptive networks can be seen as mathematically equivalent to disease spreading on a well-mixed population, but with a rescaled effective infectiousness. In accord with the intuition advanced in the introduction, as long as individuals react promptly and consistently to accurate available information on whether their acquaintances are infected or not, network dynamics effectively weakens the disease burden the population suffers from. Last but not least, if disease recovery is possible, the time for disease eradication drastically reduces whenever individuals have access to accurate information about the health state of their acquaintances and use it to avoid contact with those infected. If recovery or immunity is impossible, the average time needed for a disease to spread increases significantly when such information is being used. In both cases, our model clearly shows how availability of information hinders disease progression (by means of quick action on infected, e.g., their containment via link removal), which constitutes a crucial factor to control the development of global pandemics.

Finally, it is also worth mentioning that the knowledge about the health state of the others may not always be accurate or available in time. This is for instance the case for diseases where recently infected individuals remain asymptomatic for a substantial period. The longer the incubation period associated with the disease, the less successful individuals will be in escaping infection, which reduces in our model to a lower effective rate of breaking SI links, with the above mentioned consequences. Moreover, the (social) network through which awareness of the health status of others proceeds may lead to different rates of information spread. In such cases, one may model explicitly the spread of the health state of each individual, as done in Refs. [28, 32] , and study the interplay between disease expansion and individuals' awareness of the disease. Of course, depending on the particular disease at hand and the contact network along which it propagates, one may have to take other factors into account, besides network adaptability, in order to make accurate predictions of disease progression. Creation and destruction of links may for instance not always occur randomly, as we assumed here, but in a way that is biased by a variety of factors such as social and genetic distance, geographical proximity, family ties, etc. The resulting contact network may therefore become organized in a specific way, promoting the formation of particular structures, such as networks characterized by long-tailed degree distributions or with strong topological correlations among nodes [2, [46] [47] [48] which, in turn, may influence the disease dynamics. The impact of combining such effects, resulting from specific disease scenarios, with those reported here will depend on their prevalence. A small fraction of non-random links, or of ties which cannot be broken, will likely induce small modifications on the average connectivity of the contact network, which can be incorporated in our analytic expressions without compromising their validity regarding population wide dynamics. On the other hand, when the contact network is highly heterogeneous (e.g., exhibiting pervasive longtail degree distributions), non-random events may have very distinct effects, from being almost irrelevant (and hence can be ignored) to inducing hierarchical cascades of infection [49] , in which case our results will not apply.

We define disease dynamics in finite populations of size N as a stochastic process. Time evolves in discrete steps and two types of events may occur which change the composition of the population: infection events and recovery events. Let us assume the SIR model, as this is the most general case (see Text S1 for a detailed analysis specific for each disease model). Each state of the population is characterized by two indices i,r ð Þ, where i is the number of infected individuals in the population and r the number of recovered (and immune) individuals (izrƒN). The number of infected decreases with a rate given by

where t 0 is the recovery time scale, i N the probability that a randomly selected individual is infected and d the probability that this individual recovers. Adopting t 0 as a reference, we assume that the higher the average number of contacts SkT, the smaller the time scale t INF at which infection update events occur (t INF~t0 =SkT) [3] . Hence, the rate of increasing the number of infected is given by

The first factor stands for the typical time scale at which infection events occur. The second factor represents the probability of randomly picking a healthy individual. This individual interacts with a random neighbor, who is infected with probability given by the third factor (well-mixed assumption). This contact leads to an additional infection with probability l. When r~0, Equations (M1) and (M2) describe both SIS and SI (d~0) models. We obtain the finite population analogue of the well-known meanfield equations characteristic of these models by recognizing that, in the limit of large populations, t 0 G i,r 

Equations (M1) and (M2) define a Markov chain M with variable states depending on the epidemic model (see Text S1). The fraction of time the population spends in each state is given by the stationary distribution of M, which is defined as the eigenvector associated with eigenvalue 1 of the transition matrix of M [50, 51] . In the SIS model, the state without infected (i = 0) is, however, an absorbing state of the Markov Chain. The quantity of interest is therefore the stationary distribution of the Markov chain obtained from M by excluding the absorbing state i = 0. This distribution is also known as the quasi-stationary distribution of M [52] and corresponds to the fraction of time the population spends in each state, assuming the disease does not go extinct (see Figure 1 ).

Consider a network of constant size N with variable number of links. New links are established randomly at rate c. Existing links between individuals with health states p and q (p,q [ S,I,R f g) disappear at rate b pq . The time evolution of the number L pq of pqlinks can be written as a system of ordinary differential equations _ L L pq~c L M pq {L pq {b pq L pq [39, 40] . L M pq denotes the maximum number of pq-links, which depends on the number of individuals in states p and q (L M pp~p p{1 ð Þ=2 and L M pq~p q for p=q) and thereby couples the network dynamics to the disease dynamics. In the steady state of the linking dynamics ( _ L L pq~0 ), the number of links of links of each type is given by L Ã pq~wpq L M pq , with w pq~c czb pq À Á .

When the time scale for network update (t NET ) is much smaller than the one for disease spreading (t DIS ), the number of infected increases with a rate

where we made t 0~1 . The effect of the network dynamics becomes apparent in the third factor, which represents the probability that a randomly selected neighbor of a susceptible is infected. In addition, Equation ( which shows that disease spreading in an adaptive network is equivalent to that in a well-mixed population with frequency dependent average degree SkT and a transmission probability that is rescaled according to l A~g{1 l, where

which is valid for both SIR, SIS (r~0) and SI (d~0,r~0) models.

All individual-based simulations start from a complete network of size N = 100. Disease spreading and network evolution proceed together under asynchronous updating. Disease update events take place with probability 1zt ð Þ {1 , where t~t NET =t DIS and t DIS~1 , network update events occur otherwise. For network update events, we randomly draw two nodes from the population. If connected, then the link disappears with probability given by the respective b pq . Otherwise, a new link appears with probability c. When a disease update event occurs, a recovery event takes place with probability 1zSkT ð Þ {1 , an infection event otherwise. In both cases, an individual j is drawn randomly from the population. If j is infected and a recovery event has been selected then j will become susceptible (or recovered, model dependent) with probability d. If j is susceptible and an infection event occurs, then j will get infected with probability l if a randomly chosen neighbor of j is infected. The quasi-stationary distributions shown in Figure 1 are computed as the fraction of time the population spends in each configuration (i.e., number of infected individuals) during 10 9 disease event updates (10 7 generations). The average number of infected SIT and the mean average degree of the network SkT Ã observed during these 10 7 generations are shown in Figure 3 . The results reported are independent of the initial number of infected in the network. Finally, the disease progression in time, shown in Figure 4b , is calculated from 10 4 independent simulations, each simulation starting with 1 infected individual. The reported results correspond to the average amount of time after which the population reaches a state with i infected.

Sequential Adaptive Mutations Enhance Efficient Vector Switching by Chikungunya Virus and Its Epidemic Emergence,"The adaptation of Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) to a new vector, the Aedes albopictus mosquito, is a major factor contributing to its ongoing re-emergence in a series of large-scale epidemics of arthritic disease in many parts of the world since 2004. Although the initial step of CHIKV adaptation to A. albopictus was determined to involve an A226V amino acid substitution in the E1 envelope glycoprotein that first arose in 2005, little attention has been paid to subsequent CHIKV evolution after this adaptive mutation was convergently selected in several geographic locations. To determine whether selection of second-step adaptive mutations in CHIKV or other arthropod-borne viruses occurs in nature, we tested the effect of an additional envelope glycoprotein amino acid change identified in Kerala, India in 2009. This substitution, E2-L210Q, caused a significant increase in the ability of CHIKV to develop a disseminated infection in A. albopictus, but had no effect on CHIKV fitness in the alternative mosquito vector, A. aegypti, or in vertebrate cell lines. Using infectious viruses or virus-like replicon particles expressing the E2-210Q and E2-210L residues, we determined that E2-L210Q acts primarily at the level of infection of A. albopictus midgut epithelial cells. In addition, we observed that the initial adaptive substitution, E1-A226V, had a significantly stronger effect on CHIKV fitness in A. albopictus than E2-L210Q, thus explaining the observed time differences required for selective sweeps of these mutations in nature. These results indicate that the continuous CHIKV circulation in an A. albopictus-human cycle since 2005 has resulted in the selection of an additional, second-step mutation that may facilitate even more efficient virus circulation and persistence in endemic areas, further increasing the risk of more severe and expanded CHIK epidemics.","The potential of RNA viruses to emerge into new environments often depends on their ability to efficiently adapt to new hosts. These adaptations sometimes comprise a stepwise process that includes 1) initial viral introduction/establishment in the recipient species, followed by 2) finite adjustment/optimization of the virus replication and transmission strategies for specific environments associated with a new host [1, 2] . This process has been well documented for several single-host viruses such as pandemic influenza A virus, the SARS coronavirus and canine parvovirus (reviewed in [3, 4] ) that do not rely on alternating infection of disparate hosts for their maintenance in nature. However, much less is known about the adaptive processes that mediate crossspecies jumps for double-host viruses such as arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses). Several recent studies documented that the acquisition of a single mutation in an arbovirus genome can mediate their cross-species transfer [step (1) ] [5] [6] [7] [8] . However, in none of these cases have subsequent, additional adaptive mutations been detected, posing the question of whether selection of second-step adaptive mutations is possible or necessary for these viruses to persist in nature. This information is critical for understanding and predicting the long-term consequences of pathogen emergence and maintenance in affected areas, which in turn could influence the development and success of targeted intervention strategies for managing outbreaks.

A new lineage of Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) [arbovirus in family Alphavirus, genus Togaviridae] emerged in 2004 in Kenya and subsequently spread into many countries in the Indian Ocean basin [hence the name: Indian Ocean lineage (IOL)], causing devastating outbreaks of arthritic disease [9] . In India, IOL strains were first detected in December 2005 followed by extensive geographic expansion during 2006-2011 into 19 Indian states with a total number of human cases estimated in 2007 at between 1.4 and 6.5 million [10, 11] . During 2006, the states most affected by CHIKV were Karnataka and Maharashtra, with a subsequent shift to Kerala, Coastal Karnataka and West Bengal [12, 13] . Several hypothetical factors may have contributed to the CHIKV emergence/spread on the Indian subcontinent [14] , including: 1) the use of immunologically naïve human populations for maintenance, amplification and virus dispersal among localities, 2) reliance on peridomestic and anthropophilic mosquitoes as vectors, and 3) the IOL-specific genetic predisposition for rapid adaptation to Aedes (A.) albopictus, which was previously considered only a secondary CHIKV vector [9] .

The mode of CHIKV maintenance in nature is complex and appears to be region-specific. In Africa, CHIKV is maintained in enzootic cycles involving transmission between non-human primates and canopy-dwelling, primatophilic Aedes mosquitoes, primarily A. furcifer, A. taylori, A. africanus, A. luteocephalus and A. neoafricanus [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] . In contrast, CHIKV transmission in Asia is believed to rely on humans alone as reservoir/amplification hosts, with the domestic A. aegypti and to lesser extent the peridomestic A. albopictus serving as primary urban mosquito vectors [19, 20] . Recent evidence, however, suggests the possibility of additional sylvatic, zoonotic transmission cycles [21, 22] .

In India, both urban CHIKV vectors are present, although their distributions differ, and their epidemiologic significance for CHIKV transmission probably varies locally. A. aegypti was considered to be the most important during the early phase of the CHIK epidemic in 2006 [23] . However, in subsequent years (2007) (2008) (2009) , the involvement of A. albopictus as the principal vector was documented at least in the states of Kerala and Coastal Karnataka [24] [25] [26] [27] . Interestingly, CHIKV transmission by A. albopictus was shown to be associated with the acquisition of the A226V amino acid substitution in the E1 envelope glycoprotein [24, [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] (Figure S1 ) that is responsible for alphavirus virion assembly and virus fusion in endosomes of target cells [33] [34] [35] . The role of the E1-A226V substitution on CHIKV adaptation to A. albopictus was directly demonstrated in laboratory studies, including those using reverse genetics, showing that this mutation is directly responsible for increased CHIKV infection, dissemination and transmission by this vector species [6, 36] . In India, evidence that CHIKV was undergoing genetic adaptation to A. albopictus via the E1-A226V substitution first came from Kerala State. During 2006, only the E1-226A variant was recovered there; however, during subsequent years (2007) (2008) , all isolates sequenced possessed the E1-226V residue [24] ( Figure S1 ). In 2008 the E1-A226V substitution was also found among the majority of CHIKV isolates from Coastal Karnataka, adjacent to Kerala [37] , suggesting introduction from the latter state.

In a follow-up study conducted in the state of Kerala, a novel substitution in the E2 envelope glycoprotein, L210Q, was discovered in all human and mosquito CHIKV isolates collected during 2009 [27] ( Figure S1 ). The E2 protein is located on the tips of alphavirus spikes and interacts with host cell receptors as well as with neutralizing antibodies [38, 39] . The L210Q substitution has not been reported in any other CHIKV strains, including those isolated in Kerala State during 2006-2008. This suggests that E2-L210Q substitution was selected as a result of CHIKV adaptation to specific ecological conditions present in Kerala State. Position E2-210 is located in the domain B of the E2 glycoprotein [39] , and several earlier studies demonstrated that mutations in this domain mediate host specificity of several alphaviruses [5, 7, [40] [41] [42] as well as the selection of escape mutants by neutralizing antibodies [43] [44] [45] . Moreover, we recently demonstrated that epistatic interactions between mutations at positions E1-226 and E2-211 of CHIKV influence the penetrance of the E1-226V substitution for fitness in A. albopictus [46] . The E2-I211T substitution was probably acquired by IOL CHIKV strains around 2004-2005 [47] , and provides a suitable background to allow CHIKV adaptation to A. albopictus via the subsequent E1-A226V substitution.

Considering that A. albopictus was a principal CHIKV vector in the state of Kerala in 2009, it was hypothesized that the novel substitution E2-L210Q provided an additional selective advantage for CHIKV transmission by this mosquito [27] . To test this hypothesis we undertook a comprehensive reverse genetic analysis of the effects of E2-L210Q in various CHIKV hosts. Our observations demonstrate that the E2-L210Q substitution mediates a significant increase in CHIKV dissemination in A. albopictus by increasing initial infectivity for midgut epithelial cells. In addition, we show that the E1-A226V substitution has a significantly stronger effect on CHIKV fitness in A. albopictus than E2-L210Q, probably explaining the observed time differences required for selective sweeps of these mutations in nature.

The E2-L210Q substitution is responsible for increased CHIKV dissemination in A. albopictus

To investigate the effect of the E2-L210Q substitution on CHIKV fitness in A. albopictus mosquitoes, we employed a reverse genetics approach based on the SL-CK1 strain of CHIKV (hereafter abbreviated SL07), isolated in 2007 in Sri Lanka [9] . Previous phylogenetic studies indicated that SL07 evolved from the Indian subgroup of IOL and represents one of the most closely related isolates to strains responsible for CHIKV outbreaks in India (including the Kerala state) [9, 48] . The SL07 isolate was passed only twice on Vero cells since its isolation from a febrile patient, thus limiting the potential for cell culture-adaptive mutations that can artificially influence alphavirus fitness in vertebrate and/or mosquito hosts. The SL-07 strain has an alanine residue at E1 position 226 and a leucine residue at E2-210, corresponding to prototype IOL strain introduced into India in late 2005. Since the E2-L210Q substitution was only detected in CHIKV strains form Kerala that had previously acquired the A. albopictus-adaptive E1-A226V substitution [24] , single E1-A226V and double (E1-A226V and E2-L210Q) substitutions were introduced into an infectious clone (i.c.), generated from the SL07 strain using site-directed mutagenesis. In addition, a clone with the single E1-A226V substitution (SL07-226V) was genetically marked by introducing a synonymous mutation 6454ARC that creates an ApaI restrictase site (SL07-226V-Apa). Previously we demonstrated that the 6454ARC substitution does not

Since 2004, chikungunya virus (CHIKV) has caused a series of devastating outbreaks in Asia, Africa and Europe that resulted in up to 6.5 million cases of arthritic disease and have been associated with several thousand human deaths. Although the initial step of CHIKV adaptation to A. albopictus mosquitoes, which promoted re-emergence of the virus, was determined to involve an E1-A226V amino acid substitution, little attention has been paid to subsequent CHIKV evolution after this adaptive mutation was convergently selected in several geographic locations. Here we showed that novel substitution, E2-L210Q identified in Kerala, India in 2009, caused a significant increase in the ability of CHIKV to infect and develop a disseminated infection in A. albopictus. This may facilitate even more efficient virus circulation and persistence in endemic areas, further increasing the risk of more severe and expanded CHIK epidemics. Our findings represent some of the first evidence supporting the hypothesis that adaptation of CHIKV (and possible other arboviruses) to new niches is a sequential multistep process that involves selections of at least two adaptive mutations.

influence CHIKV fitness in vitro or in vivo [6] . The infectious viruses SL07-226V-Apa and SL07-226V-210Q were rescued by electroporation of in vitro-transcribed RNA into Vero cells. The specific infectivity and viral titers in cell culture supernatants were almost identical for all constructs (Table S1 ), indicating that the introduced mutations did not attenuate CHIKV in Vero cells.

Although a variety of mechanisms may be involved, adaptation of arboviruses for enhanced transmission by mosquitoes is typically expected to result in an increased ability to develop a disseminated infection leading to salivary gland infection. To investigate the effect of the E2-L210Q substitution on CHIKV fitness in A. albopictus mosquitoes, direct competition experiments were performed using SL07-226V-Apa and SL07-226V-210Q viruses ( Figure 1 ). For these experiments, A. albopictus (Thailand strain) was presented with blood meals containing a mix of 5x10 5 plaque forming units (pfu)/mL of SL07-226V-Apa and 5x10 5 pfu/mL of SL07-226V-210Q viruses (combined titer 10 6 pfu/mL) and 10 days post-infection (dpi), the presence of disseminated viral infection as sampled from individual mosquito legs and heads was analyzed as described in the Materials and Methods. The dissemination of the SL07-226V-210Q in the Thailand colony of A. albopictus was 4.3 times more efficient compared to SL07-226V-Apa ( Figure 1A )(p = 0.021), supporting the hypothesis that glutamine at E2-210 was selected in CHIKV population in Kerala State due to its positive effect on CHIKV transmission. To corroborate these findings, the ApaI site was introduced into the backbone of SL07-226V-210Q, and the resultant virus (SL07-226V-210Q-Apa) was tested in direct competition in A. albopictus (Thailand colony) against SL07-226V that was produced by reverting the ApaI site in SL07-226V-Apa to the wild-type (w.t.) nucleotide sequence ( Figure 1B ). The dissemination of SL07-226V-210Q-Apa was 3.4 times higher than that of SL07-226V (p = 0.017), indicating that the genetic marker was not responsible for the competition outcome, and supporting the role of the E2-L210Q substitution in increased CHIKV dissemination in A. albopictus. To demonstrate that the outcome of competition experiments was not affected by CHIKV propagation in Vero cells (which were used to identify mosquitoes with disseminated infection, prior to CHIKV genotype analysis), these cells were infected at a multiplicity of infection of 0.1 pfu/cell in triplicate with 1:1 mixtures of viruses that were used in mosquito competition experiments. At 2 dpi, cell culture supernatants were collected for viral RNA extraction and processed as described in the Materials and Methods. No detectable differences in viral fitness (changes in the ratios of the 2 viruses) were observed after Vero cell passage, indicating that E2-L210Q substitution does not affect CHIKV fitness in these cells ( Figure S2 ).

Early studies of CHIKV competence to infect A. albopictus demonstrated significant variation in susceptibility among different geographic strains of this mosquito [49] . To demonstrate that the effect of the E2-L210Q substitution on CHIKV dissemination in A. albopictus was not limited to a particular geographic strain, we also compared dissemination efficiency of the SL07-226V-Apa versus SL07-226V-210Q viruses in mosquitoes derived from Galveston, USA. Similar to the results with Thailand mosquitoes, the E2-L210Q substitution provided a mean 4.5-fold increase in dissemination efficiency of CHIKV (p = 0.003) ( Figure 1A ). These data suggest that the E2-L210Q substitution would likely have a similar effect on CHIKV fitness in A. albopictus from Kerala State, India, and from other parts of the world.

To investigate if the fitness advantage associated with the E2-L210Q substitution is sufficient for selection of mutant viruses in a w.t. CHIKV population, the SL07-226V-210Q was serially passaged in the presence of a 100-fold excess of SL07-226V-Apa (surrogate ''wild-type'' virus) in an alternating cycle between A. albopictus mosquitoes and Vero cells. To initiate the cycle, A. albopictus (Galveston colony) were presented with blood meals containing 5x10 5 pfu/mL SL07-226V-Apa and 5610 3 pfu/mL SL07-226V-210Q viruses (100-fold excess of SL07-226V-Apa). After three consecutive passages, heads and legs of individual mosquitoes were processed as described above to determine if selection of virus with E2-L210Q substitution had occurred ( Figure 2A ). Despite being present in 100-fold lower quantity in the initial virus population, the SL07-226V-210Q virus alone was detected in 31.6% of mosquitoes after 3 alternating mosquito-Vero passages, whereas SL07-226V-Apa (w.t.) alone was found in 52.6% of mosquitoes, while 15.8% of mosquitoes had both competitors in their heads and legs ( Figure 2B ) (p = 0.227 onetailed McNemar test). These data indicate that the E2-L210Q substitution has the potential to be selected in CHIKV populations in locations where A. albopictus serves as the primary vector. The 31-fold increase over 3 artificial transmission cycles in the relative frequency of SL07-226V-210Q over its initial ratio in blood meals corresponds to a ca. 3-fold increase per cycle, which is in agreement with fitness advantage of the E2-L210Q substitution observed earlier in direct competition experiments ( Figure 1 ).

The E2-L210Q substitution does not alter CHIKV fitness in A. aegypti or human cells Historically, A. aegypti mosquitoes were the primary vector of CHIKV in Asia [19, 20] , and this species still plays a significant role in CHIKV transmission in India [23, [50] [51] [52] . To investigate if the E2-L210Q substitution also affects CHIKV fitness in A. aegypti, we analyzed the effect of E2-L210Q on CHIKV dissemination in this vector using competition experiments as described above. Since CHIKV transmission by A. aegypti has never been associated with the E1-A226V substitution, we first used the w.t. genetic background of the SL07 strain (E1-226A and E2-210L) to introduce the E2-L210Q substitution. Also, because A. aegypti is less susceptible to CHIKV than A. albopictus for strains with E1-226V, we used higher total oral doses up to 2.4610 7 pfu/mL ( Figure 3A , 3B). The dissemination efficiency of SL07 and SL07-210Q-Apa viruses in A. aegypti (Thailand strain) were almost identical (p = 0.395) ( Figure 3A ). Similarly, no difference in the dissemination efficiency between SL07 and SL07-210Q-Apa viruses was detected in Galveston A. aegypti mosquitoes ( Figure  S3 ). Additionally, competition between SL07-226V-210Q-Apa and SL07-226V viruses, which express E2-210Q and E2-210L residues in the background of E1-226V, respectively, was also analyzed in Thailand A. aegypti, again revealing no statistically significant differences in dissemination efficiency [p = 0.402] ( Figure 3B ). These data indicate that it is unlikely that the polymorphism at E2-210 affects CHIKV transmission by A. aegypti.

Alternatively, E2-L210Q could have been selected as a result of CHIKV adaptation to a vertebrate host in India, probably humans. Although we did not observe any fitness change associated with this mutation during propagation of CHIKV in Vero cells (derived from African green monkey kidneys), to extend our analysis we repeated competition experiments using the human-derived cell line 293 (embryonic human kidney) because earlier studies showed that CHIKV can infect and replicate in various primary human cell lines including epithelial, endothelial, fibroblast, muscle satellite and macrophages (reviewed in [11] ). No detectable difference in fitness resulting from the E2-L210Q substitution was observed in this cell culture model ( Figure 3B , 3C). Although cell lines are not ideal surrogates for in vivo infections, our data further support the conclusion that the E2-L210Q substitution was most likely selected only by A. albopictus. The E2-L210Q substitution acts by increasing CHIKV infectivity for midgut cells of A. albopictus Previous studies determined that the A. albopictus-adaptive E1-A226V substitution acts primarily at the level of midgut infectivity. It was suggested that efficient CHIKV infection of and replication in midgut cells promotes more active CHIKV dissemination and transmission by this vector [6, 36, 46] , thus allowing the selection of A. albopictus-adapted CHIKV strains in nature. To explore which step during CHIKV infection of A. albopictus mosquitoes is affected by the E2-L210Q mutation, we first compared the relative ratios of SL07-226V-Apa and SL07-226V-210Q RNAs in whole mosquitoes, mosquito midguts and mosquito carcasses (bodies without midguts) after oral infection ( Figure 4A ). We observed a marked increase in the relative amount of E2-210Q RNA in all samples analyzed, including midguts at 7 dpi. Furthermore, similar increases in the relative amount of E2-210Q RNA in mosquito midguts were observed as early as day 1 post infection, regardless of which of the two competitors was marked by the ApaI site ( Figure 4B , 4C). In contrast, no difference in the relative amounts of E2-210Q versus E2-210L RNAs were observed 2 days after intrathoracic infection of A. albopictus, when CHIKV titers peak ( Figure 4D ). When injected intrathoracically, CHIKV does not require infection of and replication within mosquito midguts to disseminate to other organs and tissues, suggesting that the initial infection/replication of the midgut epithelium is a major site of selection of the E2-L210Q substitution in A. albopictus.

To further test the hypothesis that the E2-L210Q substitution affects CHIKV fitness only during initial infection of the A. albopictus midgut, we first compared infection rates of mosquitoes presented orally with serial dilutions of the viruses expressing either E2-210L or E2-210Q residues in the backbone of the SL07 strain that has the E1-A226V substitution. The E2-210Q residue was associated with significantly higher infectivity (p = 0.006 and p = 0.034, Fishers exact test) for A. albopictus (Thailand) at the blood meal titers of 3.5 and 2.5 Log 10 (pfu)/mL, and the oral infectious dose 50% (OID 50 ) value calculated for SL07-226V-210Q was 8.9 times lower (higher infectivity) than that for SL07-226V ( Figure 5A, 5B) . The lack of a significant difference in infection rates after the highest dose (4.54 Log 10 (pfu)/mL) probably reflected the oral dose nearing saturation. By way of comparison, earlier studies, including those using the SL07 strain, determined that the well-established A. albopictus-adaptive substitution E1-A226V mediates a much greater, ,100-fold decrease in OID 50 values [6, 9] .

To directly study the effect of E2-L210Q substitution on initial CHIKV infection of A. albopictus midgut cells, we developed a replicon/helper system for the SL07 strain. Sub-genomic replicons of alphaviruses can be packaged into virus-like particles (VLPs) by co-transfection of replicon and helper RNAs into susceptible cells [53] . The helper RNA provides the structural genes that package replicon RNA into VLPs, but the helper RNA itself is not packaged into the VLPs. Therefore, the VLPs are capable of primary infection and replicon RNA replication within cells, but cannot spread to neighboring cells due to the lack of the structural genes in the replicon. Thus, replicon VLPs allowed us to investigate the effect of mutations of interest on initial infection of midgut cells.

Since transfection efficiency of viral RNA is critical in determining the efficiency of VLP production, we switched to BHK-21 cells that have superior RNA susceptibility compared to Vero cells. Earlier, we observed that CHIKV isolates that have not been passaged in rodent-derived cells lines (including SL07) are impaired in their ability to replicate in BHK-21 cells (KT, SCW, unpublished). Therefore, to ensure efficient recovery of CHIKV VLPs from BHK-21 cells, double BHK-adaptive substitutions (nsP1-L407P and nsP3-T348A) were introduced into the SL07 i.c. (see Materials and Methods for details). Although these substitutions increase replication capacity, rather than electroporation efficiency, of CHIKV in BHK-21 cells, they have no effect on mosquito infection (data not shown). The modified SL07 i.c (contains nsP1-L407P and nsP3-T348A substitutions) was subsequently used to generate all CHIKV replicons used in the mosquito infectivity study.

The SL07 replicon expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) was packaged into VLPs using w.t. SL07 helper (with E2-210L and E1-226A residues) or using a modified helper encoding E2-L210Q and E1-A226V substitutions. The SL07 replicon expressing cherry fluorescent protein (CFP) was packaged into VLPs using a helper encoding E2-210L and E1-226V residues ( Figure 6A ). In addition, the ApaI marker was introduced into the GFP-expressing replicon. The infectious titers of all recovered VLPs, as determined by titration on Vero cells, were identical ( Figure 6A ). Infection of Vero and C6/36 cells with 1:1 mixtures of GFP and CFP expressing VLPs [based on infectious unit (i.u.) titers] yielded equal number of cells expressing these fluorescent proteins (data not shown).

For mosquito experiments, GFP-and CFP-expressing VLPs were mixed 1:1 (based on i.u. titers) and presented in blood meals to A. albopictus as shown in (Figure 6A ). At 1 and 2 dpi, midguts of individual mosquitoes were dissected and analyzed by fluorescent microscopy to determine a number of cells expressing GFP and CFP in the same fields of vision ( Figure 6B ). We found that, on average, midgut cells were 4-5 times more likely to become infected with VLPs expressing the E2-210Q residue as compared with VLPs expressing E2-210L ( Figure 6D, 6E) . Similarly, 4-5 fold increases in relative amounts of E2-210Q RNA were observed after an ApaI digestion of RT-PCR amplicons derived from VLPinfected midguts ( Figure S4 ). Infectious viruses were not recovered after infecting Vero cells with homogenates of 30 mosquitoes infected with VLPs mixes (see Materials and Methods for details), indicating that the hypothetical formation of full-length viruses via recombination between helper and replicon RNAs, which could confound the interpretation of this experiment, did not occur. Altogether, these data demonstrate that the E2-L210Q substitution acts specifically by increasing initial CHIKV infectivity for midgut cells of A. albopictus.

In a parallel experiment using VLPs, we also compared the effect of the previously characterized E1-A226V substitution on CHIKV infectivity for midguts of A. albopictus ( Figure 6A ). The CFP-expressing replicon packaged using a helper encoding E2-210L and E1-226V residues (CFP/E2-210L/E1-226V) was competed against GFP-expressing replicon packaged using w.t. SL07 helper encoding E2-210L and E1-226A residues (GFP/E2-210L/E1-226A). In contrast to the polymorphism at E2-210, the valine residue at position E1-226 provided a far greater (41-43 fold) increase in a midgut cell infection compared to the alanine residue at the same position ( Figure 6C, 6D, 6E ), which agrees with previous results using infectious viruses [6, 36] . These data also indicate that the results of experiments using VLPs with 2 different fluorescent reporter proteins (GFP and CFP) cloned into replicons RNAs are not influenced by those reporter proteins themselves. The significant difference of ,10-fold between the effects of the polymorphisms at positions E1-226 versus E2-210 on CHIKV infectivity (p = 0.026 and p = 0.005 for 1 and 2 dpi respectively) ( Figure 6D, 6C) indicates that the E1-A226V substitution exerts significantly stronger selection compared to E2-L210Q, and thus would be expected to be selected faster during CHIKV transmission by A. albopictus.

To corroborate these findings we also analyzed effect of the E2-L210Q substitution on CHIKV infectivity for midgut cells of A. albopictus when this substitution is expressed in the background of w.t. CHIKV with the E1-226A residue. For this experiment, a GFPexpressing replicon was packaged using a w.t. SL07 helper encoding E2-210L and E1-226A residues (GFP/E2-210L/E1-226A), and was competed against a CFP-expressing replicon packaged using a helper encoding E2-210Q and E1-226A residues (GFP/E2-210Q/ E1-226A). The E2-L210Q substitution caused a 2.3-2.4-fold increase in CHIKV infectivity for A. albopictus midgut cells (Figure 7) , which was about 17.5 times weaker than the effect of the E1-A226V substitution in the same genetic background. Similarly, using direct competition experiments between infectious viruses SL07 and SL07-210Q-Apa (both have the E1-226A residue) we observed that the E2-L210Q substitution provided a mean 2.0fold increase in dissemination efficiency of CHIKV (p = 0.022) ( Figure S5 ) in the Thailand strain of A. albopictus. These data indicate that the E2-L210Q substitution would be selected more efficiently in CHIKV strains that previously acquired the E1-226V mutation.

In this study we showed that an E2-L210Q substitution recently identified in CHIKV populations of Kerala State, India, when expressed in the background of the initial adaptive E1-226V substitution, confers a selective advantage by increasing initial infection of A. albopictus midgut epithelial cells. Efficient infection of midguts promotes subsequent CHIKV dissemination into the hemocoel and transmission by this vector. However, the E2-L210Q substitution has no apparent effect on CHIKV fitness in the other primary mosquito vector, A. aegypti, or on fitness in cell culture models for primate infection (Vero and 293 cells) . These results as well as surveillance data indicating that CHIKV was transmitted primarily by A. albopictus in Kerala state of India when the E2-L210Q substitution was first detected [24] [25] [26] [27] , provide a comprehensive evolutionary explanation for its appearance in 2009. These results also indicate that adaptation of CHIKV to A. albopictus mosquitoes mediated by the previously characterized E1-A226V substitution was probably just a beginning of multi-step adaptive process that included the selection of a second (E2-L210Q) and possibly additional, future mutational steps by IOL strains now circulating in urban areas. These mutations, which have no deleterious effect on transmission by A. aegypti, will enable CHIKV to even more efficiently exploit urban transmission in environments populated by A. albopictus, but also to maintain the ability to utilize A. aegypti, which tends to occur in major urban centers [54] . Thus, our findings regarding the continued adaptation of CHIKV to A. albopictus raise serious public health concerns that even more efficient transmission may exacerbate the already devastating CHIK epidemics in India and Southeast Asia. Furthermore, the introduction of the E2-L210Q strain into new areas like Italy and France, where autochthonous cases have already occurred [55] [56] [57] , could spread epidemics into temperate climates where A. albopictus thrives. Considering the broad global distribution of A. albopictus, including nearly throughout the Americas, the E2-L210Q substitution may significantly increase the risk of CHIKV becoming endemic in additional locations.

Interestingly, Niyas et al. (2010) demonstrated that CHIKV strains with the E2-L210Q substitution can be isolated from adult A. albopictus mosquitoes that were reared from wild-caught larvae collected in Kerala State, suggesting that transovarial transmission (TOT) may also play a role in CHIKV maintenance, especially during dry seasons [27, 58] . Also, evidence suggests that TOT occurred in a small percentage of wild mosquitoes during recent CHIK outbreaks on Reunion Island, Madagascar, and in Thailand [59] [60] [61] . Although we did not attempt to study the effect of the E2-L210Q substitution on TOT, and at least one laboratory study failed to demonstrate TOT in A. albopictus of CHIKV strains with the E1-A226V substitution [58] , so the possibility that CHIKV mutations could influence rates of TOT warrants a thorough investigation.

The molecular mechanism explaining the effects of the E2-L210Q substitution on CHIKV infectivity for A. albopictus midgut cells remains unknown. Earlier, we hypothesized that the E2 region around position 211 could be directly involved in interactions with a specific cell surface receptor [46] . We showed that the E2-211T residue mediates a significant increase in infectivity for A. albopictus in concert with the E1-A226V substitution, and that residue E2-211I, which is common among CHIKV strains, blocks this effect. Moreover, using virus overlay protein binding assays (VOPBA) to study CHIKV binding to the proteins associated with the brush border membrane fraction of A. albopictus midguts, we demonstrated that the E2-T211I substitution dramatically alters CHIKV interactions with as yet unidentified proteins (KT unpublished). The recently determined crystal structure of the CHIKV E2 glycoprotein [39] provides additional insights into the possible involvement of residues E2-211 and E2-210 in interactions with a putative mosquito receptor (Figure 8 ). Both positions are located at the C' B sheet of the E2 protein, which is exposed on the virion surface on the lateral side of domain B, suggesting that these positions could be involved in interactions with cellular proteins. Substitutions of the aliphatic moieties with polar residues in this region may therefore be directly responsible for changing CHIKV affinities to as yet unidentified receptor(s). Interestingly, positions E2-207, E2-213 and E2-218, which have been shown to be involved in VEEV adaptation to equine and mosquito hosts [5, 7, 42] , are also located in the same lateral surface of domain B, further supporting the hypothesis that E2-L210Q enables CHIKV to interact with a particular protein expressed on the surface of midgut cells. The studies to identify these protein(s) are underway.

In the study by Niyas et al (2010) that discovered the E2-L210Q substitution in CHIKV strains from Kerala, only limited portions of CHIKV genomes including the nsP2, E2 and E1 genes were sequenced [27] . Since we did not have an access to these isolates or to complete sequence of these strains, we cannot rule out the possibility that other genome regions could be influencing CHIKV evolution in Kerala State. Epistatic mutations in different genome positions can dramatically affect CHIKV infection of A. albopictus [9] . For example, the recently determined, lineage-specific epistatic interactions between positions E1-226 and E1-98 probably limited for at least 60 years the emergence and establishment of new CHIKV strains in Asian regions inhabited by A. albopictus [9] . This suggests that Kerala strains of CHIKV might have acquired adaptive substitutions in addition to E2-L210Q that promote efficient transmission in the human-A. albopictus cycle, and indicates the need for a more detailed, continuous molecular characterization of CHIKV strains from throughout its distribution.

We also investigated if residue E1-226 has an epistatic effect on amino acid E2-210. The E2-L210Q substitution was detected only in CHIKV strains that already acquired the E1-A226V substitution. We observed that the E2-L210Q substitution mediates a 4-5fold increase in A. albopictus midgut infectivity when expressed in the background of E1-226V, whereas the same substitution caused only a 2.3-2.4-fold increase when expressed in the background of E1-226A (Figure 6 and 7) . These results indicate that selection of this mutation would have been even less efficient if it had occurred in a CHIKV strain that did not yet acquire E1-A226V change. Interestingly, our data show that, with regard to CHIKV infectivity of A. albopictus midgut cells, E2-L210Q has an approximately 17-fold (E1-226A background) or 10-fold (E1-226V background) weaker effect compared with E1-A226V ( Figure 6 and 7) . This could explain why E1-A226V was selected convergently by unrelated CHIKV strains on at least 4 well documented occasions, while selection of E2-L210Q has thus far been observed only once in Kerala State ( Figure S1 ). The stronger fitness effect of E1-A226V is consistent with its historically faster selection, which resulted in a selective sweep in parts of the Indian Ocean, India and Southeast Asia, compared with E2-L210Q, which has predominance in only one location. After CHIKV introduction into a region with large A. albopictus populations, the E. Each dot corresponds to a fold-difference in the number of cells expressing GFP vs. CFP [E2-210 (Q/L)] or CFP vs. GFP [E1-226 (V/A)] in individual mosquito midguts at 1 dpi (D) and 2 dpi (E). Red horizontal line represents the mean fold-difference for 5-10 individual midguts. The difference between strains expressing E2-L210Q and E1-A226V residues on VLP infectivity was compared for significance with a two-tailed Students t-test. doi:10.1371/journal.ppat.1002412.g006 E1-A226V substitution has consistently taken about 0.5-1 year to appear [24, 28] , whereas the E2-L210Q change was observed after at least 3 years of circulation in Kerala State [27] ( Figure S1 ). More studies are needed to determine the precise dynamics of the selective sweeps associated with both mutations.

Another interesting observation is that both A. albopictusadaptive substitutions exert their effect on CHIKV fitness primarily at the level of midgut infectivity (Figure 4 and 6) . The overall increase in the number of midgut cells infected with CHIKV VLPs expressing E2-210Q correlates with the increase in dissemination efficiency observed for infectious viruses. Also, the relative increase in the amount of E2-210Q RNA in midguts infected with VLPs is almost indistinguishable from the relative increase in amount of E2-210Q RNA in midguts exposed to infectious viruses (Figure 4 and S4) . Although we did not examine replication in a comprehensive set of mosquito tissues, these results suggest that, after establishing an initial infection from the midgut lumen, the subsequent spread of viruses among neighboring cells is not influenced by position E2-210. Moreover, no differences were observed in CHIKV replication in A. albopictus bodies after intrathoracic infection, indicating that replication of CHIKV in secondary mosquito organs also is unaffected by residue E2-210 ( Figure 4 ). Similar observations were provided earlier for position E1-226 [62] . Experimental studies of epizootic versus enzootic VEEV VLP interactions with the epidemic vector, A. taeniorhynchus, also indicated that midgut epithelia is the target organ for VEEV adaptation to this vector [63] . These findings suggest that adaptation of alphaviruses to a mosquito vector primarily occurs at the level of midgut infection.

In summary, we demonstrated that adaptation of CHIKV to a new mosquito vector can be a multistep process that, since 2005, has involved at least 2 amino acid substitutions in the envelope glycoproteins. The substitution that provides the strongest selective advantage, E1-A226V, was followed by second adaptive mutation (E2-L210Q) that has resulted in a strain circulating in India with the fittest phenotype detected yet for transmission by A. albopictus. We hypothesize that this sequential adaptation will facilitate even more efficient circulation and persistence of the A. albopictusadapted strains in endemic areas and will further increase the risk of expanded and more severe CHIK epidemics in new geographic ranges. This underscores the need for continued surveillance and studies of ongoing CHIKV evolution, as well as the molecular mechanisms that govern CHIKV adaptation to new environments.

The SL07 (SL-CK1) strain of CHIKV was isolated in 2007 from a human in Sri-Lanka (GenBank Acc. No. HM045801.1). This strain belongs to Indian subgroup of the IOL [9] and was obtained from the World Reference Center for Emerging Viruses and Arboviruses (WRCEVA) at the University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, TX after its generous submission by Aravinda de Silva of the University of North Carolina. Since its isolation the strain was passed twice on Vero cells before being used for i.c. construction. Viral RNA was extracted from lyophilized virus stock using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), reversetranscribed using Superscript III (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and cDNA was amplified using Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and PCR. To assemble the i.c., overlapping RT-PCR amplicons were cloned into modified pSinRep5 vector (Invitrogen) under the control of an SP6 promoter using a strategy described previously for strain LR2006 OPY1 [64] . Point mutations 10670CRT (E1-A226V), 9170TRA (E2-L210Q) and 6454ARC (synonymous, ApaI marker) were introduced in various combinations into the i.c. of SL07 using conventional PCR-based cloning methods [65] , and the PCR-generated regions were completely sequenced. Plasmids encoding sub-genomic replicons of strain SL07 were generated from the i.c. of the BHK-21 celladapted version of this strain [SL07-BHK that contains 1296TRC and 5087ARG (nsP1-L407P and nsP3-T348A) substitutions] which was reported previously [9] . These mutations were identified by electroporation of the SL07 i.c. into BHK-21 cells, followed by sequencing of the recovered, plaque purified viruses. Replicons were generated by replacing the structural gene region of SL07-BHK with the sequence of eGFP or CFP genes utilizing standard techniques [64, 66] . In addition, a point mutation 6454ARC (synonymous, ApaI marker) was introduced into the pRep-GFP construct that allows comparison of the relative RNA quantities in an experimental, mixed infection sample. The helper plasmids were generated by deleting the 373-7270 nt. cDNA fragment from i.c. of SL07 that has mutations of interest at E1-226 and E2-210. Plasmids were propagated using the MC1061 strain of E. coli in 2xYT medium and purified by centrifugation in cesium chloride gradients. Detailed information for all plasmids is available from the authors upon request.

Vero cells (African green monkey kidney) were propagated at 37uC, with 5% CO 2 , in Minimal Essential Medium (MEM; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS). BHK-21(S) [Baby Hamsters Kidney] and 293 (Human Embryonic Kidney) cells were maintained at 37uC with 5% CO 2 in MEM-alpha (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FBS and 1x MEM vitamin solution (Invitrogen). The Galveston colonies of A. albopictus and A. aegypti mosquitoes were established from the mosquitoes collected in Galveston, TX (USA). Thailand colonies of A. albopictus and A. aegypti mosquitoes were established from mosquito eggs collected in Bangkok, Thailand. All manipulations and handling of mosquitoes were done as described previously [67] .

Infectious viruses were generated by electroporation of the invitro transcribed RNA into Vero cells. RNA was transcribed from Positions involved in modulation of VEEV host range are in magenta [5, 7, 42] . Image is constructed based on atomic structure of CHIKV E2 protein [PDB ID:3N44, [39] ]. The 3-D model was analyzed using the PyMol molecular viewer [70] . doi:10.1371/journal.ppat.1002412.g008 SP6 promoter of the NotI linearized i.c. DNA using the mMESSAGE mMACHINE kit (Ambion, Austin TX). Ten mg of RNA were electroporated into 10 7 Vero cells using a BTX-Harvard Apparatus ECM 830 Square Wave Electroporator (Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, MS) and 2mm cuvette at the following conditions: 680V, pulse length 99 ms, 5 pulses, with an interval between the pulses of 200ms. Cells were transferred to a 75 cm 2 tissue culture flasks with 14 mL of Leibovitz L-15 (L-15) medium supplemented with 10% FBS and 5% tryptose phosphate broth (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). At 3 h post electroporation the cell supernatant was replaced with 14 mL of L-15 medium and maintained at 37 uC without CO 2 . Cell culture supernatants were collected at 24 and 48 h and stored at 280uC.

To estimate the specific infectivity of electroporated RNAs, an aliquot containing 1x10 5 electroporated Vero cells was serially tenfold diluted and cells were allowed to attach to sub-confluent monolayers (1x10 6 cells/well) of uninfected Vero cells in six-well plates [64] . After 2 h of incubation at 37uC, cells were overlaid with 0.5% agarose in MEM supplemented with 3.3% FBS and incubated for 48 h until plaques developed. The results (specific infectivity values) were expressed as pfu/mg of electroporated RNA (Table S1 ). Titers of the viruses recovered after electroporation and all experimental samples were determined by titration on Vero cells by plaque assay as previously described [7] .

To generate CHIKV VLPs expressing residues of interest in E2 and E1 glycoproteins, BHK-21(S) cells were used, which have superior RNA susceptibility compared to Vero cells. To ensure efficient recovery of CHIKV VLPs from BHK-21 cells, all CHIKV replicons were designed to include BHK-adaptive mutations (nsP1-L407P and nsP3-T348A) identified after rescue of w.t. i.c's in BHK-21(S) cells. Ten micrograms of in-vitro transcribed replicon and helper RNA were mixed and electroporated into 10 7 BHK-21(S) cells as described above for Vero cells. Cells were maintained in L-15 medium at 37uC, followed by harvesting supernatants at 30 h post-electroporation. The titer of VLPs was determined by titration on Vero cells as described earlier [68] . Briefly, 1610 6 Vero cells were seeded in six-well plates and, after a 16 h incubation at 37uC, monolayers were infected with 10-fold dilutions of the samples for 1 h at 37uC, followed by adding 2 mL of MEM. After 24 h of incubation at 37uC the numbers of GFP-or CFP-expressing cells were quantified by fluorescent microscopy and titers were expressed as infectious units (i.u.)/mL.

The role of viral mutations at position E2-210 on CHIKV dissemination in A. albopictus and A. aegypti mosquitoes was analyzed using direct competition experiment as described earlier [6, 9] . A pair of viruses that differed by mutations of interest in the E2 protein was mixed at a 1:1 ratio, with one of the viruses containing the ApaI marker. Viral mixes were used to prepare infectious blood meals by dilution in an equal volume of the defibrinated sheep blood (Colorado Serum, Denver, CO), then orally presented to 4-5 day old female mosquitoes at 37uC as described previously [6, 67] . Ten days post infection, heads and legs of individual mosquitoes were triturated in 500 mL of MEM media containing 5 mg/mL of Amphotericin B (Fungizone), and 100 mL of clarified supernatant were added to duplicate wells of a 96-well plate containing 5x10 4 Vero cells/well. At 3 dpi, supernatant from virus-induced CPE (cytopathic effect)-positive wells was used for RNA extraction followed by RT-PCR with 41855ns-F5 (5-ATATCTAGACATGGTGGAC) and 41855ns-R1 (5-TATCAAAGGAGGCTATGTC) primers sets using One-

Step RT-PCR kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). The PCR products were digested with ApaI restrictase (NEB, Ipswich, MA) and separated on 1.5% agarose gels followed by ethidium bromide staining. One PCR band in the digested sample corresponded to disseminated infection for one out of two viruses in the pair; two bands indicated that both viruses disseminated in the same mosquito. Differences in dissemination efficiencies were tested for significance with a one-tailed McNemar test.

Viral competition experiments with serial, alternating CHIKV passaging in A. albopictus and Vero cells were performed as described above with minor modifications. For the first passage, virus SL07-226V-210Q was mixed with 100-fold excess SL07-226V-Apa to generate infectious blood meals containing 5x10 5 pfu/mL (combined). The blood meal was used for oral infection of A. albopictus (Galveston colony) followed by virus extraction from combined head and leg homogenates derived from 50 individual mosquitoes in 1.5 mL of MEM medium at 10 dpi. Homogenates were filtered and used to infect 75 cm 2 flasks of Vero cells. At 2 dpi, cell culture supernatants were diluted 1:10 in L-15 medium and mixed with equal volumes of defibrinated sheep blood to prepare a blood meal for the second passage. The cycle was repeated a total of 3 times. At 10 dpi of third mosquito passage, heads and legs of individual mosquitoes were processed as described above.

For CHIKV competition experiments in specific body parts of A. albopictus, the mosquitoes were exposed to blood meals containing 1:1 mixes of [SL07-226V-Apa and SL07-226V-210Q] and [SL07-226V and SL07-226V-210Q-Apa]. Depending on the experiment, at 1, 2, 3 and 7 dpi whole mosquito bodies, mosquito carcasses, or mosquito midguts were collected in pools of ten, and were used for RNA extraction using TRIzol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). RNA was RT-PCR amplified, followed by ApaI restrictase digestion of amplicons as described above. Gel images were analyzed using TolaLab (version 2.01) and relative fitness for a given virus during competition was determined as the ratio between E2-210L and E2-210Q bands in the sample, divided by the starting ratio of E2-210L and E2-210Q in the blood meal. The results were expressed as an average value of 2 pools of 10 mosquitoes midguts per pool.

For CHIKV competition experiments in intrathoracically infected mosquitoes, 5 pfu of SL07-226V-Apa and 5 pfu of SL07-226V-210Q in 0.5 mL of L-15 media were directly injected into thoraxes of cold-anesthetized A. albopictus (Galveston colony) using capillary needles as described previously [69] . RNA from 2 pools, 5 mosquitoes/pool, was extracted at 1 and 2 dpi and processed as described above.

To investigate the relationship between the blood meal titers and infection rates in A. albopictus, the SL07-226V and SL07-226V-210Q viruses individually were serially 10-fold diluted, mixed with defibrinated sheep blood and presented orally to A. albopictus (Thailand). At 10 dpi individual mosquitoes were triturated in one mL of MEM and used to infect 5x10 4 Vero cells in duplicate in 96 well plates. CHIKV was detected by observing virus-induced CPE. The difference in the infection rates between SL07-226V and SL07-226V-210Q was tested for significance with a two-tailed Fishers exact test. The oral infectious dose 50% (OID 50 ) values were calculated using the PriProbit program (version 1.63).

For VLP experiments, A. albopictus (Thailand) were infected with 1:1 mixes (based on i.u. titers) of GFP-or CFP-expressing subgenomic replicons packaged into VLPs using CHIKV helpers that differed by substitutions at positions E1-226 and E2-210 ( Figure 6A and 7A) . At 1 and 2 dpi, 5-10 mosquito midguts were dissected in PBS, and cut longitudinally to generate monolayers of epithelial cells. These sheets were rinsed in PBS to remove residual blood and gently spread out on a glass slide. A cover slip was applied and the midgut sheets were immediately analyzed by fluorescent microscopy to determine the numbers of cells expressing GFP and CFP in the same field of vision. One or two fields of vision were analyzed for each midgut sheet. In parallel experiment, midguts infected with VLPs packaged using helpers that differ by substitutions at position E2-210 were dissected at 1, 2 and 3 dpi, collected in pools of ten, which were used for RNA extraction using TRIzol (Invitrogen). The RNA was processed as described above.

To demonstrate that replicon and helper RNAs did not recombine to generate infectious virus capable of autonomous replication, 30 mosquitoes were infected with VLPs mixes and at 7 dpi were triturated in 1 mL of MEM, filter sterilized and 300 mL of homogenate was used to infect each of 3 wells of confluent Vero cells in six-well plates. After 1 h of infection at 37uC, 2 mL of MEM was added to each well, followed by incubation at 37uC with 5% CO 2 . Cells were observed daily for signs of CPE for 5 days.

To investigate the effect of substitutions at E2-210 on CHIKV fitness in Vero and 293 cells, these cells were infected at a multiplicity 0.1 pfu/cell in triplicate with 1:1 mixtures of [SL07-226V-Apa and SL07-226V-210Q] and [SL07-226V and SL07-226V-210Q-Apa] viruses. Cells were maintained at 37 uC with 5% CO 2 in MEM and at 2 dpi, supernatants were collected for RNA extraction and processed as described above.

Black arrows correspond to the emergence and movement of the CHIKV lineages with the E1-226A residue. Red arrows correspond to the acquisition of the E1-A226V substitution. Blue arrow corresponds to acquisition of the E2-L210 substitution. The graph was constructed based on the data published in [24, [27] [28] [29] [30] .

At 2 dpi cell culture supernatants were collected for RNA extraction and viral RT-PCR analysis. The relative fitness (RF) within a given competition was determined as the average ratio between E2-210L and E2-210Q bands in the sample (r), divided by the starting ratio of E2-210L and E2-210Q bands in the inoculum (i) used for infection.

At 1, 2 and 3 dpi, mosquito midguts were dissected and 2 pools of 5 midguts per pool were used for RNA extraction and RT-PCR analysis (B). Relative fitness (RF) was determined as the average ratio between bands corresponding to VLPs expressing E2-210Q and E2-210L residues in the sample, divided by the initial ratio of E2-210Q and E2-210L bands in the BM used for mosquito infections.

Association between viral seasonality and meteorological factors,"We examined the effects of daily local meteorological data (temperature, relative humidity, ""humidity-","The common cold is typically a mild upper respiratory tract infection (URTI), with symptoms such as nasal stuffiness and discharge, sore throat, coughing and sneezing 1, 2 . URTI are mostly self-limiting but can progress to lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) particularly in those with underlying conditions 3, 4 . Adults suffer from a cold two to five times a year, and children can have 7-10 episodes annually 5 . Numerous viruses can cause URTI 6 . Rhinoviruses (also called the common cold virus), are responsible for around 30% to 70% of all respiratory infections 5, 6 . Since there are >100 different rhinovirus types, reinfections are very common 7 . Coronavirus is the second most common cause of URTI, causing 7% to 18% of cases 8 . Other viruses including respiratory syncytial viruses (RSV) types A and B, human parainfluenza viruses (HPIV) types 1-4, adenoviruses, human metapneumovirus (HMPV) and influenza viruses A-C (IAV, IBV and ICV) also cause URTI 8,9 . Most respiratory viral infections have seasonality. In temperate regions, URTI increase in frequency in autumn and spring, and remain raised through winter 8 . Three theories have been put forward to explain viral seasonality. 1: The effect of climatic conditions on host resistance to infection (low vitamin D levels following lack of sun exposure can affect our ability to fight infection) 9,10 . 2: The effect of meteorological factors (e.g. temperature, humidity) on virus survival and hence on infection rates 9, 11 . 3: The effect of behavioural changes on transmission (e.g. spending more time indoors in close proximity to others or aggregation of susceptible children at schools during the colder months) 8,9 . There are other hypothesis such as diminished immune responses in a chilled host, or the reactivation of dormant viruses by chilling for the increase in URTI during the colder months 12 .

Temperature has an important effect on viral activity, particularly in the case of enveloped viruses. In a guinea pig model, IAV transmission is more effective in cold and dry conditions 13 . Integrity of IAV envelopes are better at lower temperatures, whilst in warm temperatures, the envelope becomes disordered and the virus susceptible to damage 14 . Reports suggest that IAV survival is better associated with absolute humidity (which measures the amount of water vapour in air regardless of the temperature) rather than relative humidity 15, 16 . An association of absolute humidity with hospitalisation due to influenza LRTI (but not with LRTI due to Rhinovirus or RSV) has recently been reported 17 .

Most reports on viral seasonality concentrate on viruses that appear in the winter months, particularly influenza viruses and RSV. Here we aim to determine the seasonality of all the respiratory viruses detected over 6.5 years, and identify any associations between changes in meteorological factors (such as temperature or humidity) and the appearance of different viruses across a whole year.

Between April 2009 and November 2015, rhinoviruses and adenoviruses were present throughout the year. Rhinoviruses were present most days of the year (84.7%), followed by adenovirus which was present on 52.3% of the days. RSV (36.4%), HMPV (32.8%) and IAV (32.7%) were present in around 1/3 rd of the year. HPIV-3 was present in 24.6% of days, followed by HPIV-1 (15.5%) and IBV (15.2%). HPIV-2 was present for the fewest number of days (6.5%) ( Table 1) . Children ≤10 accounted for 45% of the number of samples tested. The age groups of those tested are in Table 2 . Figures 1-3 plot the weather conditions and the virus prevalence during the study period. Mean air temperature ( Fig. 1) showed the expected seasonality, with a peak in July (14 °C to 16 °C) and a trough in January (−1 °C to 4 °C). Mean dew point (Fig. 1 ) and the variation in humidity within a day (i.e. ""humidity-range"", Fig. 3 ) showed a similar pattern. Mean dew point was highest in August (10 °C to 12 °C) and lowest in February (−2 °C to 3 °C). ""Humidity-range"" was larger in the summer months (40% to 44%), and least variable in winter (15% to 18%). Mean relative humidity however showed the opposite pattern, typically highest in December (88% to 91%) and lowest in June (70% to 74%). Air pressure, wind speed and duration of daylight did not show clear seasonality (data not shown).

Many viruses have a definite seasonality (Figs 1-3 ). RSV and IAV have the largest seasonal peaks, appearing in November-December and December-January respectively. IBV (February-March), HMPV (March), and HPIV-3 (April-May) follow sequentially. IBV has a biennial distribution occurring every other year. HPIV-2 has two peaks, a major peak around October-November and a minor peak in July. A clear seasonality is not noticeable for HPIV-1. Adenovirus and rhinovirus are present throughout the year. Rhinovirus also has two peaks, a major peak around October-November and a minor peak in March. Adenovirus has a smaller peak in March-April.

Temperature appears to have the greatest effect on viral seasonality (Fig. 1) . The average temperature during the study was 9.2 °C. In keeping with their year-round presence, the mean temperature when adenovirus and rhinovirus are present is closer to the annual mean at 8.8 °C and 8.9 °C respectively. A preference for colder temperatures is noticeable for RSV, IAV, and IBV (6.3 °C, 6.7 °C and 6.3 °C respectively). HMPV is most prevalent when the temperature becomes slightly warmer (7.4 °C). HPIV-3 is the only virus to prefer above average temperatures (9.4 °C). The average dew point was 6.0 °C (Fig. 1) . Dew point has a similar pattern of relationship to viruses as temperature, with RSV (3.7 °C), IAV (3.9 °C), IBV (3.3 °C) and HMPV (4.4 °C) preferring lower dew points. In contrast, HPIV-3 prefers a higher dew point (5.9 °C). Temperature and dew point are both significantly lower on days adenovirus, RSV, IAV, IBV, and HMPV are present ( Table 3) .

The average relative humidity was 81% over the study period (Fig. 2) . RSV (84%), IAV (82.9%) and HPIV-1(82.6%) prefer higher relative humidity. HPIV-3 is more active when the relative humidity is lower (79.9%) ( Table 3 ). The average variation in humidity within the day (i.e. ""humidity-range"") was 25%. ""Humidity-range"" is significantly narrow for most viruses apart from rhinovirus, HPIV-2 and HPIV-3 (Table 3) . RSV (21.8%) and IAV (23.8%) prefer much narrower ranges then other viruses. HPIV-3, in contrast to the other viruses, appears to prefer a wide ""humidity-range"" (29.7%). Though HPIV-2 seems to prefer raised humidity and a narrow ""humidity-range"", the difference in these variables between days the HPIV-2 is present or absent is insignificant (Table 3) , potentially a reflection of the lower number of HPIV-2 cases. Table 4 shows the results of the binomial logistic regression carried out to determine the effect of multiple metrological factors on virus activity. It demonstrates how a unit increase in each meteorological variable (either 1 °C for mean temperature, or 1% for mean relative humidity or ""humidity-range"") alters the odds of a virus being present. Only results that were found to be significant in the t-test were examined using logistic regression (i.e. rhinovirus and HPIV-2 were excluded). Following the logistic regression, no significant association was found for HPIV-1. A mean temperature increase by 1 °C reduces the odds of detecting adenovirus, RSV, IAV, IBV and HMPV. Adenovirus has a small decrease (2.8%), while RSV (17.3%), IAV (13.7%), IBV (13%) and HMPV (9.9%) have larger decreases. A 1% increase in relative humidity reduces the odds of HPIV-3 being present (2.6%). A 1% increase in ""humidity-range"" also decreases the odds of detecting RSV (3.8%) and IAV (1.7%). Air temperature has a significant effect against the most number of viruses (n = 5) followed by ""humidity-range"" and relative humidity. The smaller effect of ""humidity-range"" in comparison to mean temperature may be due to an interrelationship between mean humidity and ""humidity-range"", since logistic regression takes multiple variables into account. Figure 4a -c are the generalised linear models (GLM), examining each virus' incidence across a year, averaged over the entire study period. This was compared with temperature over the same period. These models confirm a preference for colder temperatures for RSV, IAV and IBV, and the timings of their seasonal peaks in and around 17 th December, 12 th January and 8 th February respectively. Even though rhinovirus and adenovirus are present throughout the year, their GLM's point to periods of increased activity (around the 5 th of March for Adenovirus and around the 6 th November for rhinovirus). The GLM corroborates HPIV-3's preference for warmer temperatures and its seasonal peak around the 4 th of May. Finally, the GLM suggests that HMPV peaks around the 11 th of March, HPIV-1 peaks around the 31 st October, and HPIV-2 peaks around the 15 th of November.

From Fig. 4a -c, a rough order of seasonal peaks is noticeable for the different viruses, beginning with IAV in January. After this, there are peaks of IBV in February, HMPV and Adenovirus in March, HPIV-3 in May, HPIV-1 in the end of October, rhinoviruses, and HPIV-2 in November, and ending with RSV in December. Since temperature and humidity appear to have a significant impact on viral incidence when analysed individually, we Table 3 . Comparison of mean meteorological values on the days a virus is detectable or undetectable. CI: Confidence interval, p value from T test. Significant p values in bold. We measured the mean of each meteorological factor on days when we received positive samples for a given virus and on days where we did not receive a positive sample for that virus. Hence a larger difference in means denotes that a virus is commonly present at an extreme of that meteorological factor: e.g. RSV more often being present when temperature is lower.

Scientific RepoRts | (2019) 9:929 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-018-37481-y calculated the difference in mean temperature and humidity preferred by the different viruses and arranged them in the order as above (Table 5 ). Figure 5 represents this pattern visually using results from ANOVA. Starting with the seasonal peak of IAV in January, there is a decrease in relative humidity from 82.9% to 81.7% in February, along with a decrease in mean temperature from 6.7 °C to 6.3 °C. These changes are associated with peaks in incidence of IBV. Following this, relative humidity stabilises until March. However, the mean temperature rises significantly to 7.4 °C in March corresponding with the peak in HMPV and then further to 8.8 °C when a peak in adenovirus occurs. Next, there is a further increase in temperature to 9.4 °C along with a significant reduction in relative humidity to 79.9% in May when a peak in HPIV-3 is observed. A slight drop in mean temperature (8.4 °C) and a significant increase in mean relative humidity (82.6%), from May to October is associated with a peak in HPIV-1. With mean temperatures being fairly constant, a further drop in relative humidity (81.6%) is associated with a peak in rhinovirus activity in November. A slight increase in humidity and a drop in temperature in November is associated with the presence of HPIV-2. A dramatic drop in temperature to 6.2 °C and an increase in relative humidity to 84.0%, leads to the peak in RSV in December. Then the cycle begins anew with IAV in January.

Du Prel et al. have reported that air temperature and relative humidity were important factors affecting viral seasonality in Germany over a 6-year period 18 . As in our study, air pressure did not have a significant correlation. However, to our knowledge, this is the first study to report the association between meteorological conditions and the sequential appearance of viruses through the year and the effect of daily fluctuations in humidity (i.e. ""humidity-range"") on virus seasonality. Our data shows that all the viral agents of URTI show degrees of seasonal variation corroborated by the GLM. Based on similarity in structures and seasonality, there appear to be three groups. 1: Non-enveloped viruses (rhinovirus and adenovirus) which are present throughout the year. 2: Enveloped viruses with winter preponderance (RSV, HMPV, IAV and IBV) and 3: Parainfluenza viruses 1-3, enveloped viruses with a preference for warmer temperatures.

In our study, non-enveloped agents are present year-round with some seasonal variation. Adenovirus is known to be stable at high humidity levels (80%) 19 . Since this is very close to the mean humidity for the study period (81%), this could explain the presence of adenovirus throughout the year. Davis GW showed that adenovirus survival is better at high humidity levels (89%) than at lower humidity (50%) 20 . The peak in March found in our GLM for adenoviruses is different to the December peaks observed for enteric adenoviruses in Japan, though a peak in the winter months is seen when GLM was drawn for 2011, a year when visual peaks for all viruses were present (Supplementary Fig. 1) 21 . Our results show that adenoviruses prefer temperatures around 9 °C. The inverse relationship between adenoviruses and temperature, corroborated by the lower OR, is in keeping with the report from Germany 18 .

The year-round presence of rhinoviruses is similar to other reports 18, 22 , but the November peak found using the GLM is later than the September-October peaks found in other research. However, as these two peaks correspond to when children go back to school, it is possible that meteorological factors do not solely account for these peaks. As rhinovirus is present throughout the year, there appears to be no significant difference in meteorological factors on days rhinovirus is present or absent. This is unlike the negative correlation with temperature and a positive correlation with relative humidity reported from Germany 18 . Whether this reflects the climatic conditions of the UK (being an island) compared to Germany needs further evaluation.

In our study, enveloped viruses with peaks in the winter months, had an association with lower temperatures, dew points and humidity-ranges, and preference for higher humidity. A significant relationship with low temperature, dew point and high relative humidity have been reported for RSV 23, 24 , IAV 18,25 and IBV 25 . RSV and IAV appear to be associated with lower temperatures, dew point, ""humidity-range"" and high humidity, however, by logistic regression significant association is only seen with lower temperatures and lower ""humidity-ranges"". IBV and HMPV which appear to be associated with lower temperatures, dew point, and ""humidity-range"", are only associated with lower temperature by logistic regression. This illustrates the complex interaction between different meteorological factors and hence the difficulty in understanding their specific effects on viral prevalence. IBV has a biennial pattern in Edinburgh unlike the bimodal pattern from Okinawa, a subtropical region in Japan 26 . This suggests that local meteorological variation and factors affecting transmission and herd immunity might have a role to play in viral seasonality. Other studies have also reported early spring peaks of HMPV, Table 5 . Comparison of mean temperature and mean humidity for different viruses. To determine which variable significantly affects transition from one virus to another, we calculated the differences in mean temperature and relative humidity of virus in column minus virus in row. e.g. a decrease in temperature from autumn to winter is associated with a change from HPIV-2 to RSV. T = Temperature Difference, H = Humidity difference. Results of ANOVA. Significant p values in bold (*p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001).

Changes in mean temperature and mean relative humidity associated with sequential increase in activity of viruses between January and December (vertical lines -standard error of the mean). Each data point corresponds to the mean temperature or mean relative humidity during the period when the virus is most active (e.g. IAV in January).

Scientific RepoRts | (2019) 9:929 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-018-37481-y association with low temperature 27,28 and raised relative humidity 29 . The biennial pattern for HMPV reported from Germany 30 , Austria 30 and Sweden 31 , is not seen in our study. Both RSV and IAV appear when the relative humidity is high (83% to 84%) in Edinburgh. Others have reported variable findings, with some reporting a positive association 18 , and others reporting that enveloped viruses are better transmitted in low humidity 32 . For example, Iha Y et al. reported an inverse correlation with relative humidity for influenza A and a direct association with relative humidity for influenza B from Japan 26 . Since relative humidity is significantly associated only with HPIV-3 on logistic regression, the absolute value of humidity may be less important than fluctuation in humidity to the survival of the virus, particularly with viruses predominantly seen in the Autumn and Winter. It is possible that temperature and ""humidity-range"" could both have a combined impact on viral stability. In laboratory conditions, RSV survives for longer at lower temperatures, with infectivity falling rapidly as temperature increases. It is known that freezing and thawing leads to marked reduction in infectivity of RSV 33 . The preference for a narrow ""humidity-range"" and the change in relative humidity associated with changes in temperature 34 could explain why viruses are not stable in frost-free freezers which have to warm up regularly to prevent accumulation of ice in the freezer compartment. This needs further investigation. HPIV 1-3, despite being enveloped RNA viruses, seems to prefer warmer temperatures (8.2 °C-9.4 °C) than the other enveloped RNA viruses. Due to its low incidence over our study period, the seasonality of HPIV-1 and HPIV-2 remain unclear though the GLM suggests it is around October-November. There is a possibility of a biennial seasonality for HPIV-1, similar to that reported in the US 35 , but the trend remains unclear due to the low prevalence in our study. Unlike HPIV-1 and 2, HPIV-3 increases when temperature is highest (9.4 °C) and when relative humidity is lowest (79.9%). HPIV-3 also appears to tolerate large variations in ""humidity-range"" (29.7%). Following logistic regression, HPIV-3 is associated with lower relative humidity. The seasonal peak for HPIV-3 in May 35 , its stability at lower relative humidity 36 and higher temperatures 28, 36 have been reported previously. Our results indicate that most viruses prefer stable humidity (i.e. a lower ""humidity-range"") through the day. This requires confirmation from further studies.

There are some limitations to this study. There is a possibility that the samples tested may include those who do not live in the catchment area. As the data is anonymised, it is not possible to determine whether the individuals are tourists or residents of the area. However, since all samples tested over the time period were analysed we believe that it is as representative as it can be. And, as the incubation period in viral respiratory infections is relatively short, it is unlikely that a viral infection will have originated abroad unless the patient was infected just prior to travelling to Edinburgh, which should be a relatively small percentage of the overall population examined in this study. Another limitation is that our data only represents those who sought medical care and were then tested. Hence a time lag between the individual becoming infected, becoming symptomatic and subsequently becoming unwell enough to require medical attention is present. We have not corrected our data for incubation period or for duration of illness prior to sampling. We have analysed the proportion of positive results for each virus for each day. Since proportion depends both on the number of positive results and on the total number of samples tested, it does not directly reflect the number of positive cases. We did not analyse coronavirus seasonality as it was not part of the routine testing panel during that period. Since meteorological factors can be interlinked (e.g. dew point and relative humidity), examining the effects of individual meteorological factors on viral seasonality can lead to an incomplete picture 37 . We hence attempted to tease this out by performing logistic regression on variables which showed an association in the univariate analysis. Since dew point was removed to prevent collinearity affecting the results of logistic regression, a new regression could in the future be performed to analyse the impact of dew point by removing temperature. There is a preference for stable ""humidity-range"" in most enveloped viruses except for HPIV-3. Following a visual inspection of the minimum and maximum for each variable and comparison with virus seasonality patterns for different viruses, there appeared to be a relationship between ""humidity-range"" and viral seasonality. Hence, we investigated the relationship between ""humidity-range"" and viral seasonality. It would be interesting to assess if a similar relationship is seen with other ranges such as ""temperature-range"", ""dew point-range"", etc in the future. Relationship with other variables appears to be virus specific. Therefore, we need models which can investigate multiple variables for each virus. Changes in weather, human behaviour and the immune system can all affect an agent's seasonality and are all interlinked, as seen in the decrease in vitamin D in temperate climates due to the decrease in daylight hours (shorter/cloudier days). This also makes it difficult to describe the effect of weather on viral seasonality in isolation. Finally, the GLM used in this study has some disadvantages. The GLM used does not account for the lag period between people becoming infected and then seeking medical help, and it also cannot model the multiple peaks seen for rhinoviruses. Furthermore, average data was used to calculate the GLM. This has led to some of the curves not being as smooth as when yearly data is analysed (for e.g. from 2011 a year when peaks were seen for all viruses ( Supplementary Fig. 1) ). The two steps seen in the curves correspond to the start and end date and probably reflect the lack of samples from January to March in 2009 and the month of December in 2015 as we have analysed data from April 2009 and November 2015. Despite this, the average data over the 6.5 years is very similar to that from 2011. This helps confirm the seasonality for most viruses. There may be differences in individual years as can be seen for adenovirus which had a peak seasonality in December in 2011.

Nonetheless, our findings on temperature, humidity and ""humidity-range"" could potentially help explain the variation in seasonality between temperate and tropical regions of the world. IAV is known to occur throughout the year in South East Asian countries closer to the equator (warm, humid environment) 38 . The further you are from the equator, winter seasonality and or association with monsoon rains is notable 39, 40 . Our findings on ""humidity-ranges"" need confirmation in a tropical setting. The order of occurrence of different viruses in tropical and temperate regions needs to be investigated in relation to the parameters highlighted. Additionally, whether these peaks in viral activity change depending on the age of the population analysed could also be a topic for future research. In conclusion, non-enveloped viruses were present throughout the year. Enveloped viruses were more seasonal starting from IAV in January to RSV in December with other viruses in between. RSV, HPIV-3 and IAV and IBV showing the clearest patterns. RSV, IAV and IBV show a clear preference for colder temperature and dew point, as well as consistent humidity. In contrast, HPIV showed a preference for higher temperatures. Additionally, HPIV-3 demonstrated a significant tolerance to low humidity. Hence, meteorological factors like temperature, humidity and ""humidity-range"" have a significant effect on the incidence of the causative agents of the common cold and changes in meteorological factors could potentially predict the decline of one virus and the emergence of the next.

Meteorological data. Following discussion with the Met Office, Edinburgh Gogarbank weather station, which captures data on an hourly basis, was identified as the most representative weather station for the catchment areas examined in this study. We downloaded meteorological data collected by the Edinburgh Gogarbank weather station from the Met Office Weather Observation Website. Hourly air temperature (°C), air pressure (hPa), relative humidity (%) dew point (°C), wind speed and daylight length measurements from 1 st April 2009 to the 30 th November 2015 were available. Small periods of weather data were missing in October 2011 and June 2015 (reasons unknown). We calculated means and ranges for each variable for each day. We also created weekly and monthly aggregations of the data. As rhinoviruses and HMPV testing only started from the 4 th of September 2009, results for these two agents were only available after this date.

Virological Data. We collated anonymised virological results on all forms of respiratory samples (nose/throat swabs, nasopharyngeal aspirates, bronchoalveolar lavages, endotracheal aspirates, etc) tested at the Department of Laboratory Medicine, Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh. These included all samples from patients attending 8 hospitals around Edinburgh (Astley Ainslie Hospital, Chalmers Centre, Liberton Hospital, Royal Edinburgh Hospital, Royal Hospital for Sick Children, Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh, Royal Victoria Hospital, Western General Hospital), and 126 primary care centres across in Edinburgh and Lothian, tested at the Department of Laboratory Medicine, Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh. We had results from 36,191 individual patients over the study period. Of these patients, 17,936 were male and 18,241 were female (information on gender was not available for 14). The age groups of the cohort are in Table 2 . PCR results were available for rhinovirus, adenovirus, IAV, IBV, HPIV 1-3, RSV and HMPV. There were no major modifications to the assay in that time. Rhinovirus and HMPV data was unavailable until screening commenced in September 2009. Between 16 th -24 th February 2011, samples were not tested for rhinovirus due to high work load. Between September 15 th and December 9 th 2010, IBV was not tested due to technical reasons. We removed repeat positive samples from the same individual collected within 14 days from analysis, resulting in a total of 52060 samples for analysis. We calculated the proportion of positive results (as %) for individual viruses for each day, to help compare results over time. We used daily data for statistical analysis to avoid loss of accuracy from averaging data. To identify seasonal trends, we plotted the proportion of positive results for each day against individual meteorological factors.

Analysis. Univariate analysis of continuous variables (mean temperature, dew point, relative humidity, and the difference between maximum and minimum humidity in a day; ""humidity-range"") were compared between days where one or more samples were positive for a given virus, and days where no samples were positive for that virus using two-sample t-tests. To determine the impact of multiple factors, multivariable logistic regression was conducted using those variables with a univariate p-value of <0.1 in the t-test and models were built using the ""Enter (forced entry)"" method on SPSS. Due to the likelihood of collinearity affecting results because of the close relationship between dew point and temperature, dew point was removed from the logistic regression.

An analysis of variance (ANOVA) in conjunction with Tukey's range test were done, to determine if the mean temperature, dew point, pressure, relative humidity, and ""humidity-range"" at which individual viruses were present were different between viruses. This was performed in conjunction with post-hoc analysis.

Finally, seasonality of individual viruses identified in our study was confirmed with a generalised linear model (GLM) based on temperature following the method of Naumova et al. 41 . The GLM was calculated using daily incidence of each virus, averaged over the entire study period.

Spatially Adjusted time- varying Reproductive numbers: Understanding the Geographical expansion of Urban Dengue outbreaks,"the basic reproductive number (R 0 ) is a fundamental measure used to quantify the transmission potential of an epidemic in public health practice. However, R 0 cannot reflect the time-varying nature of an epidemic. A time-varying effective reproductive number R t can provide more information because it tracks the subsequent evolution of transmission. However, since it neglects individual-level geographical variations in exposure risk, R t may smooth out interpersonal heterogeneous transmission potential, obscure high-risk spreaders, and hence hamper the effectiveness of control measures in spatial dimension. therefore, this study proposes a new method for quantifying spatially adjusted (time-varying) reproductive numbers that reflects spatial heterogeneity in transmission potential among individuals. This new method estimates individual-level effective reproductive numbers (R j ) and a summarized indicator for population-level time-varying reproductive number (R t ). Data from the five most severe dengue outbreaks in southern Taiwan from 1998-2015 were used to demonstrate the ability of the method to highlight early spreaders contributing to the geographic expansion of dengue transmission. our results show spatial heterogeneity in the transmission potential of dengue among individuals and identify the spreaders with the highest R j during the epidemic period. the results also reveal that super-spreaders are usually early spreaders that locate at the edges of the epidemic foci, which means that these cases could be the drivers of the expansion of the outbreak. therefore, our proposed method depicts a more detailed spatial-temporal dengue transmission process and identifies the significant role of the edges of the epidemic foci, which could be weak spots in disease control and prevention.","The basic reproductive number (R 0 ) is a fundamental measure used to quantify the transmission potential of an epidemic 1 . It is defined as the number of infections caused by an index case within a completely susceptible population, i.e., a population in which there is no pre-existing immunity. R 0 is a summary index suggesting both the intrinsic transmissibility of a pathogen and the infrastructure that allows the disease to spread in a given setting. In particular, the value of R 0 is affected by transmission probability, contact rate and duration of infectiousness 2 .

Based on deterministic homogenous-mixing epidemic models 3 , public health practitioners usually regard R 0 = 1 as a useful threshold for ensuring the development of an outbreak, referred to as the epidemic threshold 4 . The health authorities also use R 0 for predicting final epidemic size 3, 5 and assessing the resources required to contain the outbreak, e.g., determining what proportion of people should be vaccinated 2 . Therefore, it is of great practical importance to estimate R 0 for a possible outbreak in public health practice. The value of R 0 is estimated from the initial growth rate of an epidemic based on mechanistic models, such as the susceptible-infected-recovered model 3, 6 . For example, R 0 has been estimated at approximately 1.5 for 2009 H1N1 influenza 7 , at 3 for the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak 8 , and at 12-18 for historical measles outbreaks 9 . As an epidemic unfolds, however, the depletion and recovery of the susceptible population cause fluctuating effective transmissibility, so the value of R 0 cannot reflect the time-varying nature of an epidemic. Moreover, when an epidemic occurs in a realistic contact network, R 0 can also fail to characterize the transmission potential at the initial stage 10 .

On the other hand, the effective reproductive number (R) is defined as the number of infections caused by any case 11 . The difference between R and R 0 is that the value of R does not depend on the assumption that the population is completely susceptible, which is often violated in later stages of an outbreak or in a situation in which the population has been exposed to the pathogen previously. Therefore, R aims to characterize the progression of an epidemic in a realistic scenario. Intuitively, counting the branches of infection on transmission trees (i.e., who infects whom 6 ) precisely quantifies the value of R; however, doing this is impractical in most circumstances except for confined outbreaks where contact tracing is feasible 12 . The epidemic curve (an illustration of the number of new infections) does not encode transmission dynamics and cannot be used to infer R directly. The renewal equation 11 , which describes the temporal transmission relationship between propagating generations of infected cases, is therefore proposed to estimate R from incidence data in different epidemic periods. More specifically, the renewal equation estimates the values of the time-varying effective reproductive number (R t ), defined as the population-level transmission potential at time t 11, 13 . In a fully susceptible population, early values of R t should approximate R 0 , but R t is more informative in that it tracks the subsequent evolution of transmission potential during the course of an outbreak. The values of R t can also reveal the time when an outbreak was contained by monitoring the epidemic threshold. During the 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa, R t captured a distinct temporal pattern of transmission potential in different countries, signaling the different levels of control measures needed 14 . As the change in transmission potential is highly correlated to control measures, public health practitioners can evaluate the effectiveness of control measures by determining the change in R t after implementation. For example, sudden drops in R t (from 3 to approximately 0.7) after the issuance of a global alert during the 2003 SARS outbreak indicated the effectiveness of the alert 15 .

Time-varying effective reproductive numbers can be estimated by the renewal equation with a weighted ratio of infectors and infectees 11 . The generation interval, defined as the infection time interval between a potential infector and an infectee, is the major component of the process of determining the temporal weights of possible transmission. A major pitfall of the renewal equation method is that it automatically assumes homogeneous mixing of individuals. In effect, the temporal weight assumes that transmission probability is determined only by the temporal difference in onset of illness between the infector and infectees, regardless of possible variations due to geographical and social proximity. Human mobility and contact patterns are highly structured in the real world [16] [17] [18] and inevitably violate the homogeneous mixing assumption 19 . Studies have demonstrated spatial heterogeneities in the transmission of dengue 20 , cholera 21 , influenza 22 , and foot-and-mouth disease 23 . Recent studies have also shown that spatial distance between cases strongly influences short-term movement 24 and, hence, the spread of these diseases. Moreover, short-range transmission has served the essential mode of disease transmission 25 , i.e., patients typically have a higher chance of infecting others nearby. Although this spatial effect has been considered in the aforementioned studies and in the transmission tree reconstruction of some diseases 26, 27 , the effect of spatial distance on the estimation of the effective reproductive number has not yet been explored. The spatial relationship between individuals can be utilized to calculate the discriminative transmission potential for each individual ( Fig. 1 ; see the methods section for details). Neglecting the spatial variation, conversely, may smooth out heterogeneities in transmission potential, obscure high-risk spreaders, and hamper the effectiveness of control measures. In summary, the effect of spatial proximity or distance should be accounted for in the estimation of effective reproductive numbers.

Therefore, the objective of this study is to propose such method for quantifying spatially adjusted reproductive numbers that reflects spatial heterogeneity in exposure risk. It generates individual-level effective reproductive numbers (R j ) and a summarized indicator for the whole population (R t ) by the transmission probability estimated for all infector-infectee pairs, based on both temporal and spatial characteristics. Temporal weighting functions account for the fact that infected cases can only transmit the disease effectively within a certain time window (the generation interval). When only temporal weighting is considered, our method is equivalent to the renewal equation, assuming homogeneous mixing. The spatial weighting function, on the other hand, accounts for the decaying chance of transmission when the distance between individuals increases. The value of spatially adjusted R j can provide more information regarding spatial heterogeneities in transmission potential and can better aid in the implementation of control measures. Data from dengue epidemics in southern Taiwan are used to demonstrate the ability of this method to identify early spreaders contributing to the geographic expansion of dengue transmission.

Study Area. Taiwan (23.778°N, 120.930°E) is an island country at the border of tropical and subtropical climate zones. Due to its geographic proximity to dengue endemic countries in Southeast Asia ( Fig. 2A) , dengue outbreaks in Taiwan are triggered by imported index cases from endemic regions. Large outbreaks have occurred in the tropical monsoon regions of southern Taiwan, particularly in the cities of Tainan (TN) and Kaohsiung (KH). These two large tropical cities feature high temperatures and high humidity, high population density, and highly urbanized landscapes, all of which provide appropriate breeding habitats for Aedes aegypti, the main vector mosquitoes of dengue virus. Thus, as dengue outbreaks occur frequently in late summer and wane in winter, the two cities form natural settings for the repetitive observation of dengue invasion and epidemic propagation.

Dengue data. Dengue fever is listed as a notifiable infectious disease in Taiwan. This means that physicians are mandated to report suspected cases in which the patient lives in or has a history of travel to a dengue-affected area and has corresponding symptoms, including fever, rash, eye pain, leukopenia, etc. The reported cases are then confirmed by standard laboratory tests, including real-time PCR, ELISA, and antigen detection 28 . These surveillance data are recorded and provided by Taiwan Centers for Disease Control, Ministry of Health and Welfare 29 . The dengue database starts in 1998, when the electronic reporting system was implemented, and we include all records since 1998-01-01. Individual-level information, including date of disease onset and X-Y coordinates of residence, is also provided. Each pair of residence coordinates is listed as the center of a basic statistical area, which is the smallest geographic unit for socioeconomic surveying in Taiwan. There was a total of 78,749 confirmed dengue cases (4.4% of them were imported cases) in Taiwan from 1998 to 2017, 92.5% of which occurred in Tainan and Kaohsiung cities. is estimated first. The sum of these probabilities is, by definition, the expected number of infectees caused by individual j, i.e., the individual reproductive number. The transmission probability itself is estimated based on solely temporal relationships (non-adjusted) or in combination with spatial relationships (spatially adjusted). In the non-adjusted method, p ·j is proportional to the temporal weight g(a) determined by the generation interval between infector j and its infectees. Cases in the same temporal cohort (i.e., with the same onset day, a 1 = a 2 = a 3 ) share the same transmission probability from previous infectors. They also share the same individual reproductive number since their relationship to subsequent cases is again identical. For the spatially adjusted method, p ·j is proportional to the spatial weights f(d), modulated by the distance between the infector and the infectees in space. Therefore, individual reproductive numbers of cases in the same cohort can be distinguished. The five most severe epidemics selected by the outbreak size were included in this study. The maps are generated by R package ggplot2, and sf (version 3.6.1, https://cran.r-project.org). Figure 2B shows the historical records of dengue epidemics in Taiwan since 1998; the five most severe outbreaks were included in this study. Among the five outbreaks, two occurred in Tainan (2007TN, 2015TN) , and three occurred in Kaohsiung (2002KH, 2014KH, 2015KH). The sizes of the outbreaks ranged from 22,784 cases in 2015TN to 1,183 cases in 2011KH. Generally, dengue outbreaks start in June, reach their peak around September, and end near the end of the year or early the next January. In this study, we analyzed the largest outbreak, 2015TN, to demonstrating our method, while detailed results for the other four epidemics are presented in our supplementary results. Of the 22,784 total infections in 2015TN, only 19 cases (<0.1%) were imported from foreign countries, suggesting that indigenous transmission was well established. In contrast with Kaohsiung city, very few outbreaks occurred in Taiwan before 2015.

Quantifying the temporal transmission dynamics. The renewal equation specifies the relationship between generations of incident cases, as shown in Eq. (1). It can be applied to estimate time-varying effective reproductive numbers due to its simplicity and generality regarding the temporal transmission dynamics 11, 13, 30 .

x a x a 0 R t represents the population-level time-varying effective reproductive number at time t. b

x denotes the number of incident cases at time x, and − b x a in the denominator denotes the number of potential infectors generated at a days (a ≥ 0) prior to time x. The hat notations stand for observed case numbers. g(a) stands for the distribution of the generation interval, which is used as a weighting function for representing transmission potential at time interval a. It can be specified by the nature of disease transmission process.

Importantly, the generation interval, also known as generation time, is the period between the infection of an infector and the infection of its infectees. It is a fundamental parameter reflecting the natural history of pathogens. Since the generation interval may vary between individuals, it can be described by a probability distribution, g(a), where a is a time interval. Therefore, the function can be regarded as the transmission weight between a pair of cases whose observed generation interval equals a (Fig. 1B) . The representation of transmission weight (also referred to as transmission likelihood 15 ) as g(a) is the basic component of the process of estimating effective reproductive numbers in the renewal equation and the following proposed method. The generation interval of dengue, in particular, is composed if four periods: host incubation, vector incubation, host infectious period and vector infectious period 31 . Nonetheless, showing compatibility with empirical data and mathematical convenience, gamma distributions are frequently used to model the generation interval of dengue collectively 32 . In this study, we used a gamma distribution with mean = 20 days and standard deviation = 9 days in our analysis, in accordance with a previous study 25 . individual reproductive number. In order to capture spatial variations among individuals, we adopted another method developed by Wallinga and Teunis 15 to estimate individual reproductive numbers (R j ). We refer to this method as the non-adjusted method (i.e., non-adjusted for spatial effect). The transmission probability between pair of cases can be described mathematically as

where p ij is the probability that case j infects case i. Note that we use superscripts to index time-invariant, individual (or pairwise) attributes (e.g., R j , p ij ) and subscripts for time-varying attributes (e.g., R t ). g(·) is the temporal weighting function, representing generation interval. Given the onset time interval = − >ˆt

ij is the transmission weight of the case pair (i, j). The pairwise transmission weight is then normalized by all received transmission weights of case i (from all potential infectors k ≠ i) to produce consistent estimation of transmission probability. The resulting p ij is interpreted as the probability of individual i being infected by individual j. Therefore, R j as the average number of secondary cases caused by individual j is the sum of all p ij involving j as the infector, as shown in Fig. 1A and Eq. (3).

Spatially adjusted reproductive number. In this study, we extend a previous method with a spatial weighting function, f d ( ) ij , in order to account for the effect of spatial variation on dengue infections. We refer to this extended method as the (spatially) adjusted method. The transmission probability for case pair (i, j) becomes

where d ij is the distance between the pair (i, j) and f is a function relating transmission weight to the distance between cases. The specifications of the temporal difference t ij and g remain the same as in the previous method. Likewise, the spatially adjusted individual reproductive number R j sp is the sum of those p ij sp involving j as the infector (Eq. 5). 

The spatial weighting function is also called the transmission kernel and is a monotonically decaying function with respect to distance, reflecting neighborhood transmission 32 . Thus, unlike the generation interval, which is typically marked with a temporally lagged effect because of the latency period of infectiousness, the spatial weighting function decreases monotonically as distance increases, which means people would be easily get infections if they live near each other. It reflects people in the nearby neighborhood may share common environmental sources of dengue infection. There are several kinds of spatial kernels used in the literature, including exponential decay 25 and power-law decay 33 . In the context of dengue transmission, we adopted an exponential decaying kernel with mean = 125 m 27 . This approach accounts for both temporal and spatial relationships when estimating individual-level reproductive numbers. Apart from the component of the generation interval inherited from the previous method, the distance-decayed spatial weighting function captures the spatial risk of dengue infection.

To calculate the population-level effective reproductive number from individual estimates, the R j values can be further aggregated to form the Adjusted R t given a specified time step τ 13 : 

Quantifying the preconditions of spreaders. To explore the phenomenon of spatial expansion, two types of spreaders are of interest: early spreaders and succeeding spreaders. Early spreaders are defined as those cases that trigger a new cluster (by introducing the disease into an unaffected area). There are usually few or no cases of the disease, and the cluster tendency is low until several early spreaders emerge. Succeeding spreaders are defined as those cases that were infected by early cases nearby. Although there is a clear distinction between the two spreaders in theory, most individuals lie on a spectrum between these two extremes. We have therefore quantified this property according to the clustering tendency at the location and time immediately before the emergence of that spreader. In other words, clustering tendency is used as the measure for the precondition of a dengue case, and the median clustering tendency is used as the cutoff to classify all dengue cases. If the precondition clustering tendency is higher than the median, the case is categorized as a succeeding spreader; otherwise, it is characterized as an early spreader. We used kernel density estimation (KDE) to quantify spatial clustering tendency in order to (1) determine the preconditions of a specific spreader and (2) compare the distributions of spatially adjusted effective reproductive numbers and case clustering patterns. The clustering tendency at the location of case j is defined as 34

where h is called the kernel bandwidth or smoothing parameter (i.e., the parameter controlling the extent of smoothness), d ij denotes the distance between case i and the locality of case j, and K(·) is a spatial smoothing function characterizing the contribution of each individual over the relative distance d h / ij .

The incidence of the 2015TN dengue outbreak are shown in Fig. 3A . The outbreak emerged in May with a handful of sporadic cases and finished the next January with a total of 22,784 cases. We divided the outbreak into six stages: emerging (I), growing (II and III), peak plateau (IV), and decaying (V and VI), to depict the spatiotemporal evolutions of the outbreak. Figure 3B shows the Adjusted R t and Non-Adjusted R t of the outbreak. These R t curves are median or mean estimates of the adjusted and non-adjusted individual reproductive numbers, summarizing the temporal evolution of population-level transmission potential. Adjusted R t provides further information: the shaded area represents the interquartile range (IQR) of adjusted individual reproductive numbers, reflecting the spatial individual heterogeneity of the transmission potential. In contrast, individual reproductive numbers of incident cases that shared identical dates of illness onset are constants in Non-Adjusted R t . This indicates that the incident cases during this period were highly geographically heterogeneous in their transmission potential. The distributions of Adjusted R j in these stages are also multimodal and right-skewed, which indicates that some incident cases could have higher transmission potential (i.e. super-spreaders). Figure 3C shows the spatial distributions of incident cases in these stages. We can identify the linkages between time-varying reproductive numbers (Fig. 3B ) and spatial-temporal distributions of incident cases (Fig. 3A,C) in different stages. In the emerging stage, the irregular growth of Adjusted R t reflects the initial growth of the outbreak with a sporadic distribution of incident cases and a small emerging cluster (Fig. 3C ). Subsequently, in the growing stages (from stage II to III), the epidemic curve started to show exponential growth (Fig. 3A) ; the larger IQR of the individual reproductive numbers (Fig. 3B ) reflects some incident cases with higher transmission potential that occurred and resulted in vigorous expansion of disease clustering (Fig. 3C ). In the stage of peak plateau (stage IV), Adjusted R t dropped under the epidemic threshold (<1), indicating that the outbreak was contained. The spatial distributions of cases also show that the clustering areas remained and stopped expanding. In sum, the time-varying reproductive numbers, Adjusted R t and Non-adjusted R t , can reflect the timing of the outbreak containment according to the epidemic threshold. The Adjusted R t can further reflect the timing of epidemic expansion when the IQR of individual reproductive numbers increases.

In Fig. 4 , the distributions of individual transmission distance were compared between the two methods: Non-adjusted and Adjusted R j . Based on the neighborhood transmission setting of Adjusted R j , the transmission distance of an infector is around 200-300 meters and few long-range transmission links (longer than 2 kilometers). Furthermore, we used Adjusted R j = 10 as a threshold to categorize super-(Adjusted R j > 10) and normal-(Adjusted R j < 10) spreaders. The figure also shows that long-range transmission links are from super-spreaders. The result indicates that dengue cases with high transmissibility have the ability to spread pathogens to geographically distant areas.

To further explore spatial relationships of super-spreaders and dengue epidemic expansion, we illustrated the locations of super-spreaders and clustering tendency of the dengue epidemic during the rapidly growing period (stages II and III), as shown in Fig. 5 . Except the very beginning of the stage II (June-25-July-6), the figure shows that super-spreaders tend to distribute at or outside the edge of the main clusters from July-06 to August-23. In addition, the circle size of the super-spreaders in Fig. 5 represent their transmission range. Therefore, the locations of larger circles would reflect long-rage transmission occurred at the edge of dengue clusters. It implied that the role of super-spreaders could be the drivers of geographic expansion of the dengue epidemic.

In order to profile the roles of different spreaders in detailed spatial transmission/expansion process, we classified the cases into two types, early spreaders and succeeding spreaders. Early spreaders are regarded as the sources of new emerging clusters, and succeeding spreaders are those that come after early spreaders. Figure 6 presents a succeeding spreader a (panel A) and an early spreader b (panel B). In each panel, we also compared different methods (spatially adjusted and non-adjusted) that estimate the transmission probability from a spreader to its potential infectees. The time of the incident cases on these maps is the 30 th day after the onset day of the given spreader. Infectees labeled with darker colors have a higher probability of becoming infected by spreader a or b. . Spatial distribution of super-spreaders (R j ≥ 10), compared with the main clusters of the dengue outbreak during the rapidly growing stages (II and III). The red area represents the most clustered region, the center of the ongoing outbreak, while the light yellow area represents the edge of the outbreak. The green circles represent the locations of the super-spreaders, with the radius being proportional to their transmission distances. The maps are generated by R package ggplot2, and sf (version 3.6.1, https://cran.r-project.org).

By the non-adjusted method, the two spreaders have identical transmission probabilities and individual reproductive number because of the homogenous mixing assumption (Non-adjusted R a = Non-adjusted R b = 4.15). However, they should play different roles in the spatial expansion of the outbreak. Spreader a (the succeeding spreader) occurred in an ongoing cluster; thus, this case is unlikely to be the primary source that triggered this local outbreak. Spreader b (the early spreader), on the contrary, initiated a new cluster where no case had occurred before, and the following cases that emerged were centered on spreader b. Thus, a subsequent local outbreak can be logically attributed to spreader b as the primary ancestor. The adjusted method (left-side maps in Fig. 6 ), which takes into account the spatial-temporal relationships of incident cases, differentiates the individual reproductive numbers of early and succeeding spreaders (Adjusted R a = 1.84, Adjusted R b = 5.74). It also yields more reasonable spatial transmission potential by upweighting the potential infectees proximity to spreader a in Fig. 6A .

To clarify the distinct roles of early and succeeding spreaders in the outbreak expansion process, we compared the distributions of Adjusted R j between different types of spreaders in Fig. 7A . We found that all the super spreaders (Adjusted R j > 10) are early spreaders and most of succeeding spreaders have low Adjusted R j . To examine the generalization of this pattern, we estimated Adjusted R j of dengue cases in top five largest dengue epidemics since 1990 in Taiwan, including KH2002, TN2007, KH2014, KH2015, TN2015, as shown in Fig. 7B . Non-adjusted R j were used as the baseline to control for the fluctuations across different stages of the outbreak. The figure showed consistent patterns among these large-scale dengue outbreaks, which means early spreaders with high transmissibility can be generally highlighted by the spatially adjusted method.

The effective time-varying reproductive number is a commonly used indicator for measuring disease transmissibility. However, the index conventionally does not capture spatial dynamics of disease transmission. We proposed a new method of calculating the spatially adjusted effective reproductive number by incorporating a spatial-weighting function that captures the nature of heterogeneous mixing. Unlike the averaged time-varying reproductive number, this method estimates different individual-level reproductive numbers (R j ) for given onset www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ times and locations of dengue infections. Thus, it can reflect spatial heterogeneity in transmission potential among individuals and identify the possible super-spreaders 35 with high R j during the rapidly growing period. Our results also reveal that dengue cases with high transmission potential and long-transmission distance are usually located at the edges of the epidemic foci, which means they could be the drivers of further outbreak expansion. Therefore, our proposed method depicts a more detailed spatial-temporal dengue transmission process and identifies the significant role of the edges apart from the epidemic foci, which could be the weak spots in disease control and prevention. Our spatially adjusted method also could further apply to assess individual-level transmission potential of other acute contagious diseases, such as influenza and Zika virus infection, with observed generation interval and the context of neighborhood transmission.

The effective reproductive number of dengue as estimated in past studies reflected an averaged overall epidemic trend, which did not take into account the spatial heterogeneity of transmissibility. Hsieh 36 estimated the effective reproductive number at the initial stage of the 2015TN outbreak to be 6.84, which is similar to our averaged estimates (Fig. 3B ). Hsieh's study also showed that Kaohsiung consistently possessed lower effective reproductive numbers (from 1.29 to 2.87), implying that Tainan city may have epidemiological characteristics, such as a lack of herd immunity, that make it more prone to dengue transmission than Kaohsiung. Internationally, Guzzetta 25 reported that the time-varying reproductive number of non-endemic urban cities in Brazil is much smaller than the estimates from Tainan and Kaohsiung cities (maximum R t is approximately 2.2). Codeco 31 and Pinho 37 also estimated time-varying reproductive numbers in Salvador and Brazil, with a maximum R t of approximately 4.5. Comparing the values of R t among different cities may be subject to possible confounding factors, such as weather conditions, host immunity and circulating viral strands.

Some studies considered location information to determine reproductive numbers for quantifying transmissibility of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) 38, 39 . These models considered spatial distribution of farms, however, it was difficult to capture FMD disease transmission process among animals. In other words, the time-varying reproductive numbers in these models are difficult to reflect nature course of FMD transmission in terms of implementing general interval and renewal equation. Furthermore, farm-level models for FMD outbreaks can be categorized the farms into infected and susceptible ones to determine relative transmissibility of each farm at a specific time. It may be difficult to estimate the amount of susceptible persons living around the infected cases for human infectious diseases, such as influenza and dengue fever. Other studies have also explored spatial heterogeneity by performing stratified analysis of R t with respect to different administrative regions and with respect to region-to-region transmission 40, 41 . These studies used a spatial weighting function to emphasize the interregional transmission process but still assumed a homogeneous-mixing model within each region. Thus, these studies did not address the spatial heterogeneous mixing issue when estimating reproductive numbers. Our study considered individual-level spatial heterogeneity and used the spatially adjusted reproductive number to measure the transmission potential of each individual.

Like the basic reproductive number, R j can be regarded as a function of duration of infectiousness, incubation period, transmission probability, vector mosquito density, and host-vector contact rate. The adjusted R j in this study could reflect vector mosquito density and host-vector contact rate, which are also highly heterogeneous in space 42 . Meanwhile, the dispersal of vector mosquitoes is largely confined to neighboring areas (average radius of 28-199 meters 43 ), providing an effective infectious zone of an infector. An exponential spatial weighting function herein represents this infectious zone. Guzzetta 25 estimated the mean transmission distance of dengue in a metropolis area to be approximately 127 m and further indicated that an exponential distribution described the data better than a radiation model which is a more dispersed distribution effectively describes human mobility 44 . Kissler, et al. 45 also reported the aptness of the exponential distribution when an outbreak is typically dominated by short-range transmission. Therefore, the exponential spatial weighting function in this study is an appropriate substitute for the effective infectious zone for measuring dengue transmission. The exponential distance-decayed www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ function also avoids overestimating the transmission probabilities of infector-infectee pairs with long geographic distances, especially for large-scale dengue epidemics. In sum, areas with high R j are potential risk areas for high dengue transmission; knowledge of such areas is important for spatial targeting during dengue epidemics.

Spatial epidemiological studies focused for many years on developing methods for identifying significant disease clustering in time and space, such as space-time scan statistics 46 or point pattern analysis 47 . Hotspot areas identified are usually regarded as significant risk areas and as high-priority sites for intervention strategies aimed at mitigating an epidemic 48, 49 . The significance of the study is to introduce the perspective of individual-level transmission potential to disease risk mapping. We found that locations of individuals with high transmission potential are usually located at the edges of growing disease clusters, which can easily be neglected when intervention resources focus on epidemic clusters. A previous study found that urban villages that were originally at the edge of the city but are now enclosed by urbanized lands act as transfer stations for dengue outbreaks 50 . In this study, we further provide a better understanding of outbreak expansion by categorizing different types of spreaders. Early spreaders with high transmission potential may initiate new source of infection at the edges of the main cluster, resulting in geographic expansion at the exponential growing stages of the outbreak. Therefore, the edge of the outbreak should be a priority of spatial targeting to contain the outbreak regarding both range and magnitude. Succeeding spreaders are indeed still important in tallying morbidity and fatality. However, their high-density clustering patterns make them prone to the depletion of local susceptible populations and degenerating transmission potential. In summary, the center and edges of epidemic clusters play different roles in developing epidemic progression in terms of different types of spreaders (succeeding vs. early) and different patterns of epidemic growth (intensifying vs. expanding). These findings provide important insights for implementing different interventions in the center and on the edges of epidemic clusters.

There are several limitations to this study. First, the method of estimating time-varying effective reproductive numbers is a retrospective procedure that uses observed infectee generation to estimate the R j of the infector generation. In other words, it cannot be used for predicting future epidemic progression in real time. Nonetheless, the method is helpful for understanding the course of an epidemic and studying the possible mechanisms of geographical expansion. Second, this study considers only geographical distance as a factor in transmission potential. Other factors influence the spatial spreading of dengue. Among these, host heterogeneity (including variations in density 51 , mobility 52 , and susceptibility 53 ) strongly modulates the transmission dynamic 42 and should be considered in further studies. Finally, the spatial weighting function reflects the assumption of distance-decayed properties (neighborhood transmission). However, the assumption may not reflect long-distance transmission 54 and complex urban transport and mobility 52 . The question of how to develop more detailed spatial weighting schemes that capture realistic mobility patterns warrants further investigation.

Does spatial proximity drive norovirus transmission during outbreaks in hospitals?,"Objective: To assess the role of spatial proximity, defined as patients sharing bays, in the spread of norovirus during outbreaks in hospitals. Design: Enhanced surveillance of norovirus outbreaks between November 2009 and November 2011.","Norovirus is the commonest cause of gastrointestinal infection worldwide. 1 There are between two and three million cases occurring each year in the UK. 2 3 Norovirus commonly presents as outbreaks of diarrhoea and vomiting and are frequently reported in hospitals, care-homes, schools and cruise ships. 4 5 Outbreaks in hospitals are disruptive, often leading to ward or bay closures, staff sickness and cancelled operations. 6 The cost of nosocomial outbreaks of norovirus to the National Health Service (NHS) in England was estimated at £115 million in 2002/2003. 6 Recently the cost in one region in Scotland was estimated at £1.2 million in the two norovirus seasons from 2007 to 2008. 7 Understanding the benefits of infection control measures is challenging, because they are usually instigated as a package with several measures being implemented during an outbreak. While these interventions are based on sound infection control principles, 

▪ We have shown a clear role of spatial proximity in the transmission of norovirus in hospital outbreaks. ▪ Patients who are in the same bay as patients who become ill have a higher probability of becoming ill compared with patients in a different bay. ▪ Increasing barriers to movement between bays by closing affected bays promptly would be effective in preventing further spread.

▪ Provides an estimation of serial interval, and assessment of significance of patient proximity in spreading norovirus within hospitals. ▪ Different modelling approaches showed consistent results. ▪ A weakness is that although data collection were standardised it is often difficult to assess the accuracy of the information on patients' positions on a ward. evaluating their efficacy in trials is difficult and the published literature on norovirus outbreaks does not provide clear evidence of the effectiveness of infection control measures. 5 In observational studies early ward closure has been shown to shorten the mean duration of outbreaks. 6 7 There is also evidence that vomiting and the resultant aerosols are important in transmitting the infection. People exposed to vomiting events, either by being close to the person who initially vomited, or by occupying the same area sometime after the initial event, have a higher infection risk. [8] [9] [10] [11] However, these analyses are based on single outbreaks or events that led to subsequent disease. Improved understanding of how norovirus spreads in closed environments could lead to better infection control procedures. The aim of our study was to assess how spatial proximity to a norovirus case is associated with risk of acquiring symptomatic norovirus gastroenteritis. Our hypothesis was that patients sharing bays (small self-contained areas within wards) with patients with symptomatic norovirus infection were more likely to become infected compared with those who were in another bay or part of the affected ward.

We carried out enhanced surveillance of norovirus outbreaks from all in-patient wards in five tertiary care hospitals serving two cities in England, with a combined catchment of approximately two million people.

We collected data during outbreaks from individual patients on date of onset of illness, symptoms (diarrhoea and/or vomiting), last date of illness for each patient, location on the ward at the time of the patients' symptoms onset (recorded as bed number and bay number) and also the ward type.

For two hospitals, information was recorded from January 2008 to November 2011 on specially designed forms that were completed by infection control staff and returned to the Health Protection Agency. Each month, we contacted the infection control lead at these hospitals asking about suspected or laboratory confirmed norovirus outbreaks and, if any had occurred and for the forms to be completed and returned. In three other hospitals the data were downloaded from a database on which infection control specialists had recorded these data items during outbreaks of norovirus occurring in the season of 2007/2008. Data from these three hospitals were downloaded during several visits to these hospitals. Data on outbreaks on norovirus were available from November 2007 to November 2011.

We obtained ward plans for two of the five hospitals, which assisted in locating patients in the ward if only part of the information on patient location was recorded in the outbreak reports.

Outbreaks were defined as two or more cases of diarrhoea and or vomiting of infectious origin in a ward occurring within 2 days of the first case suspected or confirmed to be due to norovirus. All the hospitals in this study used PCR for detection of norovirus in stool samples.

A bay is a small self-contained area within a ward. Usually bays contain between two and eight beds. Bays are not the same as individual single bed occupied rooms. Proximity was defined as patients who share a bay.

The analysis is based on a probabilistic reconstruction of chains of transmission (trees) based on the dates of illness onset for patients affected in outbreaks. It makes use of methods developed for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) transmission and later applied to norovirus. [12] [13] [14] [15] If we knew with certainty who acquired infection from whom it would be straightforward to quantify the role of proximity in norovirus outbreaks, for example, by using regression analysis. However, in practice, transmission events are unobserved, so instead we consider all possible infection trees consistent with the data. We used a previously described approach to calculate the probability, π ij , that patient i was infected by patient j for each pair of infected patients in each outbreak based on onset times and the serial interval distribution (the serial interval is the time from onset of symptoms in case i to case j), without using proximity data. The serial interval distribution tells us the probability of durations of 0, 1, 2… days between onset in a case and onset in secondary cases infected by this case. Given multiple possible sources for a case, we can use knowledge of this distribution to tell us how likely each is to be the true source. Full technical details are described in Wallinga and Teunis. 12 We then used the matrix of π ij values to simulate 1000 possible infection trees for each outbreak, by assigning the infector of patient i to be patient j with probability π ij .

In these simulations, we assumed that the case with the earliest onset time was the index case and had no infectors on the ward. If more than one patient had the earliest onset date in a given outbreak, we selected the index case from these patients with equal probability in each simulation. For each outbreak k, we used these 1000 simulations to produce a proximity metric, P k , defined as

where s ijkl is equal to 1 if patient i was infected by patient j in simulation l of outbreak k and is zero otherwise. The p ijk terms measure proximity between patients i and j in outbreak k. In this application, we consider this to be a binary variable equal to 1 if patients i and j occupied the same bay at the time of first symptom onset of these patients. An overall proximity metric, P, is obtained by summing the P k values. The value of P (and of P k for individual outbreaks) should be interpreted as a measure of how much transmission occurs between patients in the same bay.

If people in the same bay pose a greater risk of infecting each other this will tend to lead to larger values of the proximity metrics, P, and P k . We compared this observed metric with values obtained if proximity was not associated with transmission. This distribution was derived by performing random permutations of the bays of the patients in each outbreak and calculating P k as above for each outbreak. These values were again summed to give an overall proximity metric, S, when proximity was by assumption not an important factor. We repeated this for 1000 random permutations of the patient bays to obtain 1000 sampled proximity metrics. These 1000 S values therefore represent a sample from the distribution of proximity metrics that would be expected if proximity played no role in spreading the disease during the outbreak. By comparing the 1000 sampled values of S with the observed value P we can evaluate whether transmission is more (or less) likely to occur between patients in close proximity. If proximity is unimportant the observed value of P would be unlikely to be in the tails of the distribution of S. If proximity leads to increased transmission the observed value of P would tend to be greater than most of the sampled S values. If proximity leads to decreased transmission (which could occur as a result of enhanced hygiene measures, eg,) the observed value of P is likely to be smaller than most of the sampled S values. Formally, we can perform a two-sided hypothesis test with a null hypothesis that proximity is not important where the p value is given by the proportion of sampled S values which are the more extreme than the value observed, P.

A key input for constructing the transmission trees is the serial interval. Our best estimate came from the observed distribution of the difference between first and second onset dates for each outbreak, and our primary analysis made use of this empirical serial interval distribution. Often, more than one patient was ill on the first day of the outbreak, so we used the first date of illness onset in the next patient(s) for calculating the serial interval. This gave a mean serial interval of 1.86 days (median 1 day, 95% CI 1.6 to 2.2 days, obtained by bootstrapping).

We also performed sensitivity analyses using different assumptions. First, we used an estimate from a study of a community outbreak of norovirus at a scouting jamboree, giving a mean serial interval of 3.6 days, with an assumed γ distribution. 13 We then considered γ distributions with the same variance (4.1) but with the mean serial intervals varying between 0.5 and 5 days in half day increments. Data were analysed using R. 16 

Data were collected from 149 outbreaks in five hospitals between November 2007 and November 2011. These outbreaks affected 1694 patients and 456 staff. The average duration of the outbreaks, determined as the first date of onset to the last date of onset, was 8.9 days (median 8; range 1-40 days). Outbreaks affected an average of 11.4 patients (median 11; range 1-30) and an average of 3.2 staff (median 2; range 0-20). Data from these outbreaks gave a mean serial interval of 1.86 days. Figure 1 shows the distribution of serial intervals from the observed data and the nearest fitting γ distribution.

The spatial modelling analysis used data from 65 outbreaks where all data (for both onset dates and position in ward when taken ill) were complete. The outbreak characteristics were similar in these 65 outbreaks compared to the full dataset. The corresponding figures for these outbreaks were: average length of outbreak 9.5 days (median 8 days) average number of patients 11.9 (median 11) average number of affected staff 3.4 (median 2). The outbreaks affected various ward types, with most occurring in general medical wards (34%) and care of the elderly wards (28%). Other specialties were respiratory medicine (12%), stroke/neurology wards (11%), coronary care wards (9%) and orthopaedic/trauma wards (6%). Figure 2 shows the observed proximity metric and the distribution of proximity metrics obtained under the assumption that proximity was not associated with transmission (from the simulated permutations). This shows how the proximity metrics observed relate to the distribution of proximity metrics if proximity was not important. The dashed line indicates the observed proximity metric (P) and the bars indicate the distribution of proximity metrics from the simulated permutations. For the model using the serial interval taken from the observed onset dates, the observed metric is outside of the range of the simulated distributions and is highly statistically significant ( p=153.34, p<0.001). With serial intervals of less than 2 days proximity is either outside or at the extreme right of the simulated proximity metrics and the p values ranged from <0.001 for serial intervals of 0.5 days to 0.01 at a serial interval of 2 days. If we increase the assumed serial interval, the proximity metric moves to within the range expected from the simulated values, and at 3 days the p value was 0.2 (figure 2). Using the γ probability distribution derived from a community outbreak by Heijne et al 13 (mean serial interval 3.06 days), the proportion of observed proximity values fell within the range that would be expected if proximity were not important.

The results show that the proximity metric (P) was larger than would be expected by chance under the null hypothesis (that proximity is not important) up to a serial interval of 2.5 days ( p=0.05).

We have detected a strong association where patients who are in the same bay as patients who become ill have a higher probability of themselves becoming ill compared with patients in a different bay. In other words, transmission of norovirus infections is more likely to occur among patients sharing a bay, compared with transmission among patients in different bays. While this might at first seem an obvious finding, there are competing theories about the transmission of the virus in complex healthcare settings. For example, transmission might occur through staff transferring virus on their hands or patients touching infected surfaces with their hands when moving around the wards or the hospital. The strength of our conclusion is sensitive to the assumed serial interval distribution. We used values derived from the dates of onset of illness in patients during outbreaks on hospital wards. We also performed sensitivity analysis using a serial interval distribution derived from a study of norovirus in children. 13 However, because the degree to which this generalises to a hospital setting is unclear (intuitively the high contact rates in hospitals would be expected to lead to shorter serial intervals) 17 we explored serial intervals from 0.5 to 4 days, while constraining the variance. Our results show that for serial intervals of less than 2 days the observed effect of proximity (sharing a bay with someone else who was ill) is highly significant ( p<0.001) and for serial intervals up to 2.5 days remained significant at the 5% level. This pattern was similar whether using the observed serial interval distribution from the outbreak data or using a parametric probability distribution.

Our study has some limitations. Although data collection were standardised it is often difficult to assess the accuracy of the date and place that patients were when they became ill. Specifically, accurate information on patients' positions on a ward was available for 44% of the outbreaks. The spatial analysis was undertaken on 65 outbreaks. In addition to the sensitivity analysis we also analysed the data by including outbreaks where onset dates of illness were complete but data on patient location were incomplete (where fewer than 10% of patient data on position was incomplete, 85 outbreaks). We dealt with missing values by allocating a completely separate bay for patients with missing data on location at time of onset. This approach is conservative in that it would underestimate the impact of proximity. Second, we removed the patients from the outbreaks if positional information was missing. Despite this limitation, the additional models indicated that that the results are robust to different assumptions about missing data which is evidenced by slightly higher probabilities obtained when using records with complete information only (see online supplementary table S1 and figure S1). As a check to demonstrate that the results were not an artefact of the statistical methods, we also ran the models on data where patient position was randomly assigned. This showed no pattern and the proximity measures were not significant for any of these models. In our analysis the estimation of Pk depends on outbreak size. However, we are not interested in the absolute values of P, only in how the value of P calculated with real proximity data compares with the value calculated with randomly generated proximity data (based on a permutation of the bay identities) which will be affected in the same way by outbreak sizes. We also performed a sensitivity analysis, normalising Pk by dividing it by the number of branches in the transmission tree for each network. This gives equal weight to each outbreak and allows Pk to be interpreted as the probability that two linked cases were in the same bay. This did not change the results of the analysis; the P metric still fell well outside of the measure one would expect from the random simulations ( p=0.004, data not shown).

We used more than one approach to modelling the infection trees because of the lack of data on serial interval in norovirus outbreaks. Heijne et al's method used data from child siblings at home. This was a useful starting point but is unlikely to be applicable to transmission in a hospital setting. Therefore, we derived γ distributions for serial intervals from 0.5 to 4 days. The average incubation period for norovirus is considered to be between 24 and 48 h. 1 4 In our analysis the serial intervals of up to 2.5 days is likely to be a more appropriate time period in a hospital setting, than the analysis from Heijne et al.

Molecular analysis of stool samples could more definitively link outbreaks, which can help to reveal transmission networks. 18 19 For example, in this study we have assumed that each ward outbreak was distinct, that is, all cases within a ward were part of a chain of transmission, but this may not necessarily be true. It is possible for multiple introductions to occur, and some outbreaks may have spread from one ward to another. Genetic characterisation of samples from each ward during possible multiple outbreaks of norovirus would shed light on transmission events and lead to further insight about the direction of transmission, including the possibility that the virus can be moved around the hospital.

Our study focused on patients rather than staff. Our hypothesis was that symptomatic patients who vomit are most likely to contaminate the area close to them and other patients in their vicinity. Obtaining data on staff movements is much more complicated and would only really be practical in a detailed prospective study.

The importance of spatial proximity in propagating transmission is consistent with other recent studies. 15 20 One study which used similar methods to calculate the infection trees 15 suggests that symptomatic individuals are likely to be the drivers of outbreaks of norovirus in hospital settings. Furthermore, the effective reproductive number was significantly higher for symptomatic patients compared with that for symptomatic staff. Norovirus transmission between people in close contact during sport, both within and between teams, has also been shown to occur 21 as well as airborne transmission through explosive vomiting. 22 One study demonstrated that successive staff working on an aircraft in which a member of the public had vomited also became sick. 11 Norovirus has a low infectious dose 4 23 24 shedding virus occurs during episodes of vomiting, where the virus can become aerosolised and expose others in the vicinity. Therefore, closing the bay quickly, preventing movement to and from that bay and immediately paying attention to cleaning areas nearby to initial vomiting events are likely to be effective in preventing further spread. The index of suspicion for patients who become ill should be high and implementing infection control interventions should not be delayed until the results of sampling are received, because this would increase morbidity and prolong the outbreak. New guidelines on controlling outbreaks of norovirus in hospitals and care homes recently released in the UK 25 move away from the need to close wards and operate on a 'manage within bays' principle. Our study has shown that patients in proximity to symptomatic patients are at increased risk of becoming infected by these patients.

We have shown a clear role of spatial proximity in the transmission of norovirus in hospital outbreaks. Increasing barriers to movement between bays by closing affected bays promptly would be effective in preventing further spread.

Examining Landscape Factors Influencing Relative Distribution of Mosquito Genera and Frequency of Virus Infection,"Mosquito-borne infections cause some of the most debilitating human diseases, including yellow fever and malaria, yet we lack an understanding of how disease risk scales with human-driven habitat changes.","Looking at the world from above, it is striking how once vast belts of tropical rainforest are being fragmented into ever smaller forest blocks (Myers, 1990; Myers et al., 2000; Fig. 1) . Human encroachment on pristine ecosystems is driven by logging and agricultural conversion, resulting in sharp and rapidly moving gradients between the relatively cool and humid primary forest and the cultured land or villages, which show strong insolation, higher temperature, and lower humidity (Malhi and Wright, 2004) . Simultaneously global warming is further modifying rainfall and temperature levels (Kerr, 2007) . The consequences of these changes on the flora and fauna are frequently discussed (Trenberth, 2004; Vora, 2008; Ellis and Wilcox, 2009 ). In general, alterations to habitats and increasing proximity of humans to wild animals are creating new opportunities for infectious diseases to emerge in humans and wildlife, including vector-borne diseases, such as dengue fever, yellow fever, malaria, or Lyme disease, and also parasitic or respiratory infections (Daszak et al., 2000; Allan et al., 2003; Patz et al., 2005; Nunn and Altizer, 2006; Reiter and LaPointe, 2007; Gillespie and Chapman, 2008; Köndgen et al., 2008) .

Nearly one-fourth of emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) in humans are vector-borne, and one-third of these have been identified during the last decade (Jones et al., 2008) . Mosquitoes are common disease vectors because they provide an effective way to spread pathogens between humans and wildlife (Gubler, 2001; Mackenzie et al., 2004; Enserink, 2007) . Infection risk with mosquito-borne diseases depends on several factors, including the abundance of competent vectors, the availability of vertebrate hosts, and the biting rate (number of mosquitoes biting their host per time unit). Mosquito prevalence, density, and distri-bution are in turn influenced by a number of other factors: notably, temperature, rainfall, humidity, vegetation, food supply, and hatchery resources (Kramer and Ebel, 2003) .

Because mosquitoes are dependent on ecological conditions, it is likely that habitat degradation and climate change greatly impact the abundance and richness of mosquitoes (Daszak et al., 2000; Reiter and LaPointe, 2007) . Indeed, deforestation was shown to have an impact on the biting rate of malaria vectors in South America (Vittor et al., 2006) , and anthropogenic land use changes are associated with altered abundance of mosquito vectors for West Nile virus and malaria in France (Poncon et al., 2007) . However, the studies focused on mosquito abundance rather than virus or parasite prevalence in the vectors.

Less widely appreciated is that mosquito richness and habitat conditions can impact the abundance and richness of mosquito-vectored pathogens. Thus, an understanding of the links between habitat variation, mosquito abundance, and pathogens carried by the mosquitoes is essential for building predictive models of disease emergence in humans and wildlife.

In this pilot study we developed a system for analyzing the mosquito species richness in disturbed and undisturbed areas of a tropical rainforest region and for investigating whether the observed diversity translates into variation in virus infection prevalence. Our study provides a basis for further in-depth studies to assess how anthropogenic changes can modulate vector and virus distribution, and potentially disease risks, for both humans and wildlife.

At 435,000 hectares, Taï National Park in Cô te d'Ivoire represents the largest remaining tropical rainforest in West Africa, yet it accounts for only a fraction of the original forest, which once covered approximately 40 million hectares (Boesch and Boesch-Achermann, 2000) . The climate is characterized by two dry seasons: from December to March, and from August to September. The annual rainfall is approximately 1,800 mm in this region. In 1979 a research camp was constructed in the primary forest (geographic coordinates: lat 5.86767554/long -7.33968803) with the purpose of studying chimpanzees. Three additional research camps have since been built and included in this study (Fig. 1; geographic position: lat 5.87235332/ long -7.33774074; lat 5.83327353/long -7.34220930; lat 5.84151328/long -7.34666177) . Five sampling points were in the primary forest of Taï National Park (lat 5.86350739/ long -7.35515901; lat 5.86298704/long -7.35587248; lat 5.86266518/long -7.35780903; lat 5.86294949/long -7.35530385; lat 5.86287975/long -7.35483178). The border of the park is lined by a secondary forest, which was partially logged for agricultural use but integrated into the park in 1977. Vegetation in the secondary forest is not as high and dense as in the primary forest (trees < 20 m). In the secondary forest mosquitoes were collected at three different sampling points (lat 5.84795058/long -7.38078483; lat 5.84979594/long -7.37809190; lat 5.84871769/long -7.38030204). Cultivated land, including coffee plantations (lat 5.83680868/long -7.40369090) and cocoa plantations (lat 5.83935142/long -7.39825674), abuts the park. Humans are present on a daily basis in these plantations. The human population around the park increased from 23,000 in 1965 to 375,000 in 1988 and with that more coffee and cocoa plantations were established around the park. Two villages (Gouléako lat 5.83436787/long -7.41086313 and Taï lat 5.87468348/long -7.45474125) were included as sampling points (Fig. 1 ). The number of inhabitants today is estimated at 600 for Gouléako and 8,000 for Taï. Settlements were founded during the French colonization at the end of the 19 th century. Different expert opinions were used to describe primary and secondary forest habitats.

Adult mosquitoes were collected with CDC miniature light and gravid traps (John W. Hock Company, USA) in the described habitats between February and June 2004. Alternating Octanol, carbon dioxide-producing hand heaters, and unwashed socks were used as attractants for the light traps, which operated for 12-h periods from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. Water was mixed with sugar (5 spoons per liter) at least 24 h before use to act as an attractant in the gravid traps, which operated from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. In the primary forest, traps were set up at five different heights above forest ground (1 m, 8 m, 16 m, 24 m, 32 m) and in the secondary forest at three different heights (1 m, 8 m, 16 m; Fig. 1 ). Traps were installed for 3 days at each sampling point. To cover the total height of each habitat and to sample a representative mosquito population, traps were set up to the canopy level for each habitat. Female mosquitoes were anesthetized with triethylamine and identified using the key of Gillies and De Meillon (1968) and Gillies and Coetzee (1987) for the Anophelinae and the key of Jupp (1996) and Edwards (1941) for the Culicidae. Species belonging to the Culex decens complex, which can only be differentiated by dissection of genitalia, were not differentiated and are marked as Culex decens complex. After identification, the mosquitoes were pooled according to species, sex, habitat, and altitude level, placed in sterile cryovials, and stored in liquid nitrogen.

Female mosquitoes take blood meals and contribute to virus transmission, whereas male mosquitoes nourish on nectar only. Therefore, only female mosquitoes were used for further analyses. Mosquito species from each sampling point were separated and divided into pools of 1-50 specimens (Table 1 ), such that pools were generated according to species, height, and sampling location. Mosquito species that were rarely found (less than 10 individuals per sampling point) were grouped with other rare species from the same sampling point to minimize number of pools. Although data were acquired by species across multiple canopy heights, due to limited numbers data were combined to genus level by habitat type for the statistical analyses.

Mosquitoes were homogenized in 1 ml of medium and after centrifugation the clarified supernatant was used for infection of insect cells (Aedes albopictus, C6/36) and vertebrate cells (African Green monkey, Vero) . Cell culture supernatant was passaged two times on fresh cells. Induction of cytopathic effect (CPE) was scored as virus infection. Viruses in culture supernatants were identified morphologically by electron microscopy and genetically by using sequence-independent amplification methods . Smaller and larger pools were random between habitats and thus not likely to bias the frequency of CPE-positive pools. We did not score the intensity of the CPE; all cell cultures that showed signs of morphological changes were further passaged and investigated. Positive pools were screened in retrospect by molecular means to ensure viral detection.

RNA was extracted from supernatants of infected pools using the Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and eluted in 60 ll of AVE buffer. cDNA synthesis was performed using the Superscript Kit (Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany) and random hexamer primers (TIB Molbiol, Berlin, Germany). Based on the viral sequence information obtained primers and probes for specific real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) systems for viral sequence fragments were designed as follows: 

Primers and probes were synthesized by TIB Molbiol (Berlin, Germany). PCR conditions were as follows: 1 cycle of 10 min at 95°C and 45 cycles of 15 sec at 95°C, 35 sec at 60°C, using the ABI Prism TM 7500 real-time PCR System. Products were sequenced using the ABI Big Dye Termination Kit. Pools were also screened using real-time PCR for YFV (Bae et al., 2003) , WNV (Linke et al., 2007) , and DENV 1-4 (details will be published elsewhere).

Infection rate could not be derived directly from the sampled mosquitoes, because CPE values represented sized mosquito pools that ranged from 2 to 100 mosquitoes. Thus, we derived the most likely infection rate using a maximum likelihood approach (Gu et al., 2003) . We considered the trapping of uninfected mosquitoes to be a binomial random process. For each CPE/virus-positive pool, we estimated the cumulative binomial probability P (0 < k n) that at least one mosquito in the pool was infected (CPE/virus positive) as

(n = pool size, k = number of infected mosquitoes, p = infection probability). For each negative pool, we estimated the probability that no mosquito in the pool was infected as

The proportion of captured infected mosquitoes per trapping period was calculated as the average number of trapped mosquitoes per night and habitat times the infection probability. To exclude differences reflecting different collection height, comparative analyses were performed only for traps set at the same height. Results did not significantly differ when all heights were considered.

We compared mosquito abundance, CPE, and virus prevalence in different habitats using permutation tests (Manly, 1997) . For mosquito abundance, we chose as the test statistic the absolute difference between trapping rates derived for secondary forest and the other habitats. We permuted the data by first randomly choosing a number of values from the other habitats, with the number of values chosen equal to the number of trap sites in the secondary forest. We then exchanged these randomly chosen values with randomly chosen values observed in secondary forest. To reflect that under the null hypothesis any observation could happen in each habitat, an actual exchange of two values (between secondary forest and any other habitat) took place with a probability equaling the proportion of other habitats in our sample. All random selections were performed with replacement, and a total of 1,000 permutations were conducted. For CPE and virus prevalence, we permuted the mosquito pools 100 times to reestimate infection probability. The multiple testing for the analysis on the induction of CPE in cell culture according to mosquito genera in each habitat required error-level correction. We did this using Fisher's omnibus test. This procedure combines a number of P values into a single chi-square distributed variable with its degrees of freedom equaling twice the number of P values (Haccou and Meelis, 1994) . All statistical analyses were run in R.

Analyses of mosquito distribution were performed at genus level (Aedes n = 169, Anopheles n = 357, Culex n = 2958, Uranotaenia n = 1492, and others n = 919 (composed of Aedomyia n = 14, Coquilletidia n = 2, Culiseta n = 1, Culicinae n = 39, Eretmapodites n = 1, Harpagomyia n = 10, Mansonia n = 10, Toxorhychitinae, and genus not determined n = 845); Table 1 ). We recorded significant variation in the distribution of mosquito genera in different habitats in and around a tropical rainforest region (Fig. 2) . Although Uranotaenia mosquitoes were dominant in the primary forest, they were rarely found in the other surveyed habitats (permutation test, P = 0.032). Conversely, Culex mosquitoes were most common in disturbed habitats, including the research camps, but were least abundant in the primary forest (permutation test, P = 0.002). Anopheles mosquitoes were found at significant numbers only in the villages (permutation test, P = 0.029), whereas Aedes mosquitoes were mainly trapped in the secondary forest (permutation test, P = 0.019). Among these mosquito genera, Aedes, Anopheles, and Culex are known to transmit human pathogens. Because variance among species within these genera in host preference and vector competence due to differences in vectorial capacity amongst species for specific viruses is great, comparison on species level by habitat type was performed for ten species that were caught in sufficient numbers (Ae harrisoni n = 85, An gambiae complex n = 71, Cx annulioris n = 274, Cx decens complex n = 631, Cx nebulosus n = 619, Cx quinquefasciatus n = 85, Ur chorleyi n = 93, Ur mashonaensis n = 630, Ur ornata n = 424). Aedes harrisoni was the most abundant Aedes species and encountered predominantly in the secondary forest. Although mosquitoes of the Anopheles gambiae complex, the primary vectors of Plasmodium, were not found in the primary forest as previously reported (Doucet et al., 1960) , one mosquito of the Anopheles gambiae complex was trapped at a camp site. The majority of mosquitoes belonging to the Anopheles gambiae complex were found in the villages, indicating a potential risk for malaria infection. Culex species were prominent in humanaltered habitats but differed between habitat types: Cx annulioris showed a higher prevalence only in the plantations, mosquitoes belonging to the Culex decens complex in the secondary forest and the plantations; Cx nebulosus was highest in the villages followed by secondary forest and plantations; Cx quinquefasciatus was highest in the villages. Ur chorleyi, Ur mashonaensis, and Ur ornata were almost exclusively found in the primary forest.

To control for trap efficacy among habitat types, trapping counts (all mosquitoes per trap per night) were compared using the permutation test. Trap counts did not significantly differ between habitats (permutation test, P = 0.229), suggesting that the distribution of mosquito genera is not related to trap efficacy but rather to general habitat preferences for each mosquito genus. To exclude an influence of different trap heights, comparative analyzes were performed using the same statistics but only for trappings at the same height.

To investigate the presence of viruses in trapped mosquitoes, pools of female mosquitoes were generated as indicated in Table 1 and used for virus isolation in an insect and primate cell line (C6/36 and Vero E6/7). For statistical analyses genus and habitat specific pools were compared (4,839 mosquitoes in 432 pools). The induction CPE was scored as an indication of virus replication. Ninety-eight of the pools (22.7%) induced CPE; the proportion of CPE-positive pools was significantly higher in the samples originating from the villages (44%, permutation test, P = 0.002) and the secondary forest (30%, permutation test, P = 0.017) than in those originating from camp sites and the primary forest (14%, permutation test, P = 0.012; Fig. 3 ). Estimated statistical infection rates for a single mosquito did not differ significantly for the primary and secondary forest and for the plantations, yet this rate was four-fold higher for the villages and three-fold higher for the camp sites. Analysis of CPE by mosquito genus in each habitat indicated Culex mosquitoes as the predominant source for CPEpositive pools (permutation test, P < 0.001; Fig. 3 ). Pools of Aedes and Anopheles mosquitoes from the villages also caused CPE at higher level compared with other habitats. In contrast, mosquitoes of the genus Uranotaenia are estimated to account for less than 5% CPE-positive mosquitoes per trapping night across all habitats (Fig. 3) . Next, we investigated the distribution of five viruses that were isolated from the mosquitoes trapped in disturbed and undisturbed habitats. Real-time PCR assays were established for Nounané virus (NOUV, a flavivirus; Junglen et al., 2009) , Moussa virus (MOUV, a rhabdovirus; Quan et al., 2009) , Cavally virus (CAVV, coronavirus-like), Gouléako virus (GOUV, a bunyavirus), and Herbert virus (HERV, unclassified isolate). All pools that induced a CPE were tested for the presence of these five viruses; in addition all 432 pools tested negative for yellow fever virus, dengue virus, and West Nile virus, three common viruses of the region. As summarized in Fig. 4 , NOUV was only found in two mosquito pools of the same species (Ur mashonaensis) trapped in the primary forest. In contrast, MOUV was found in seven pools of Culex and other mosquitoes from all habitat types except the villages, with highest prevalence in the secondary forest. CAVV was found in 39 pools and in all habitats, with highest prevalence in the villages. The virus was most frequently isolated from Culex species; however, Anopheles (three pools) and Aedes (one pool) mosquitoes also were infected. GOUV and HERV were detected in 28 pools and in all habitats, and in three different mosquito genera: Anopheles, Culex, and Uranotaenia. In most pools, both viruses were present, but infection with only one of the viruses was evident. The prevalence of these two viruses was lowest in the primary forest and highest in the villages. With the exception of NOUV, which was detected exclusively in primary forest, we found higher virus prevalence in mosquito pools from disturbed habitats, the camp sites, secondary forest, plantations, and villages compared with the primary forest (permutation test, P = 0.001).

Our study design combined systematic mosquito sampling in different habitat types, including pristine rainforest, forest border zones, agricultural crop land, and human settlements, with screening for viral infections followed by specific testing of mosquitoes from all habitats for any of the isolated viruses. This approach to vector and virus surveillance can provide important insights into changes within mosquito populations, enable early detection of viral emergence, and provide insights into human driven habitat changes on the risk of mosquito-borne infections. However, our statistical analyses showed that broader sampling approaches are needed to accurately estimate the factors driving the differences observed.

The results of this pilot study point to differences in mosquito and virus prevalence in disturbed and undisturbed habitats. Our data for five virus isolates from widely differing taxonomic groups are consistent with the notion that disturbed habitats, and especially human settlements, seem to support proliferation of endemic viruses more efficiently than the pristine primary forest. Aedes, Anopheles, and Culex mosquitoes were most common in disturbed habitats and likely to carry pathogens. Species belonging to the genera Aedes, Anopheles, and Culex differ greatly in their feeding preferences and further investigation of the distribution of individual species is important to identify potential bridge vectors that can introduce viruses to new habitats or hosts. If we assume that mosquito abundance and the presence of virus-positive mosquitoes represent a human disease risk, the highest risk exists in the villages, followed by plantations and the secondary forest. The risk in the primary forest is lowest, but seems to increase in association with clearings and the presence of humans at camp sites. Thus, our data are in concert with others who have proposed that changes in habitat may have a marked impact on the distribution of mosquito genera and species, influencing virus distribution and risk for human disease (Vasconcelos et al., 1992; Patz et al., 2004; Obsomer et al., 2007) .

Although the shifts that we have documented are associated with anthropogenic habitat degradation of the forest border zones and a gradient of human presence, other factors may be implicated. Differences in temperature, rainfall, and humidity are known to influence the life cycles of different mosquito species, thus contributing to the success of some species compared with others (Vasconcelos et al., 1992) . Variation in vegetation-especially height of the forest-also can have major impact on mosquito abundance in general and on specific genera in particular, as can the density of suitable hosts for blood meals (Wolfe et al., 2007) . We were unable to investigate differences along a forest canopy gradient due to insufficient numbers of mosquitoes collected. Furthermore, little is known about environmental effects on the survival of viruses within mosquito hosts. In this respect, assessment of male mosquitoes as an index for horizontal transmission will be an interesting aspect for future studies.

PCR is a sensitive and rapid method for routine detection of known arboviruses (Jupp et al., 2000; Kramer et al., 2002) . We used PCR to test all mosquito pools and all CPE-positive cell cultures for the presence of WNV, DENV 1-4, and YFV. None of these viruses were detected in the pools by PCR. YFV and DENV infections most often occur at the beginning and in the second half of the rainy season (Germain et al., 1977; Cordellier, 1978; Cornet et al., 1978; Cornet et al., 1979; Germain et al., 1981) . Because mosquitoes were collected in the dry and at the beginning of the rainy season from February to June, YFV and DENV may not have been circulating in detectable levels in the mos- With the exception of NOUV, viruses were most prevalent in disturbed habitats, and Culex mosquitoes were the most frequent vector. The majority of species belonging to this genus prefer habitats warmer and drier than the forest. Other studies have shown that mosquitoes, such as Cx tarsalis, Cx pipiens, and Cx nigripalpus, may serve as potential bridge vectors because they change their feeding preferences according to the seasons from birds to mammals (Edman and Taylor, 1968; Kilpatrick et al., 2006; Kyoko et al., 2006; Kent et al., 2009) . At present we have no data that indicate mammal or human infection with the viruses reported here. However, human serum collections are under investigation to address this point.

Our data indicate that future research must include an even broader mosquito sampling approach than presented here to allow sufficient sample sizes that support statistical analyses at the species level. In addition, sampling for 1 year or multiple years is desirable to address seasonality, as well as validation of the trends revealed in our study through analyses of other rainforest edge areas. Although additional research is needed to place these real-world data into a firmer theoretical framework for generating predictive models of vector/virus dynamics, our data show the validity of such an approach and provide a basis for the design of further studies.

Stochastic challenges to interrupting helminth transmission,"Predicting the effect of different programmes designed to control both the morbidity induced by helminth infections and parasite transmission is greatly facilitated by the use of mathematical models of transmission and control impact. In such models, it is essential to account for as many sources of uncertainty-natural, or otherwise -to ensure robustness in prediction and to accurately depict variation around an expected outcome. In this paper, we investigate how well the standard deterministic models match the predictions made using individual-based stochastic simulations. We also explore how well concepts which derive from deterministic models, such as 'breakpoints' in transmission, apply in the stochastic world. Employing an individual based stochastic model framework we also investigate how transmission and control are affected by the migration of infected people into a defined community. To give our study focus we consider the control of soil-transmitted helminths (STH) by mass drug administration (MDA), though our methodology is readily applicable to the other helminth species such as the schistosome parasites and the filarial worms. We show it is possible to define a 'stochastic breakpoint' where much noise surrounds the expected deterministic breakpoint. We also discuss the concept of the 'interruption of transmission' independent of the 'breakpoint' concept where analyses of model behaviour illustrate the current limitations of deterministic models to account for the 'fade-out' or transmission extinction behaviour in simulations. The analyses based on migration confirm a relationship between the infected human migration rate per unit of time and the death rate of infective stages that are released into the free-living environment (eggs or larvae depending on the STH species) that create the reservoir of infection which in turn determines the likelihood that control activities aim at chemotherapeutic treatment of the human host will eliminate transmission. The development of a new stochastic simulation code for STH in the form of a publicly-available open-source python package which includes features to incorporate many population stratifications, different control interventions including mass drug administration (with defined frequency, coverage levels and compliance patterns) and inter-village human migration is also described. : medRxiv preprint","Helminthiases are a class of the neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) that affect many hundreds of millions of humans and animals worldwide. One group of worms, the soiltransmitted helminths (STH) are especially prevalent are transmitted through the ingestion of eggs (for Ascaris lumbricoides or Trichuris trichuria) or larvae (in the case of the hookworms: Necator americanus and Ancylostoma duodenale). They are estimated to affect 1.45 billion people at present [1, 2] .

In recent years, mathematical models of both infectious disease transmission [3, 4, 5] and intervention impact have been widely used in infectious disease epidemiological studies and public health policy formulation [6, 7, 8, 9, 10] . Their use in the study of the NTDs is more recent, where the variety of approaches implemented have included both deterministic [11, 7] and individual-based stochastic simulation models [12, 13, 14, 15] . Much progress in model formulation, * r.hardwick@imperial.ac.uk parameter estimation and application has been made over the last 20 years. Model-based analyses are increasingly serving an important role in policy formulation and the evaluation of different control policies [16, 17, 18] as is well illustrated by the activities of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation funded NTD Modelling consortium [19] . Furthermore, following the London Declaration in 2010, which stimulated the expansion of large mass drug administration (MDA) programmes under the direction of World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines on treatment strategies [17, 20, 21] , mathematical models have played an increasing role in determining how best to design and evaluate MDA programmes [22, 23, 24] .

Two key concepts emerge from analyses of deterministic models. The first is the existence of a 'breakpoint' in transmission created by the dioecious nature of the worms (a male and female must be present in the same host to ensure the production of fertile eggs and pass to the external environment and form the pool of infectious material) which creates an unstable equilibrium separating the stable endemic infection equilibrium Basic reproductive number Mean worm burden S t a b l e e n d e m i c e q .

Uns tabl e 'bre akp oint ' eq. from the other stable equilibrium of parasite extinction. Independent of this breakpoint, a further epidemiological situation arises where only one stable equilibrium exists; namely, parasite and transmission extinction where the rate of infection is always too low to sustain the parasites in the human host. In this case transmission is interrupted, since an adult female worm in the human host on average, produces too few offspring to ensure one of her offspring matures in the human host to perpetuate the lifecycle. For many viral and bacterial infections (the microparasites), this is the situation where the basic reproduction number, R 0 < 1, where R 0 describes the generation of secondary cases. For the macroparasitic helminths, the concept of R 0 needs modification since it describes the average number of female offspring, produced by female worms, that survive to reproductive maturity by infecting a new human host and maturing within it [7] . The concept of R 0 is further modified by two density dependent processes: acting on fecundity as a population regulatory factor and acting via the dioecious nature of the worm. Because of the action of these two processes, the crtical R 0 value to sustain transmission is greater than unity in value. These two concepts are illustrated diagrammatically in Fig. 1 . Note, in particular, how the darker red shaded region -which demarcates the R 0 < 1 region -is replaced with a lighter shaded red 'breakpoint' region once these density dependent processes have been introduced.

The importance of these notions when we move from the deterministic world to a stochastic one is linked to explaining what the interruption of transmission really appears as in a noisy world full of variation and chance events. Even when the deterministic breakpoint is crossed, when its value is low due to high degrees of parasite aggregation in the human host (see Ref. [7] ), stochastic noise may induce fluctuations where bounce back or extinction occur [24, 25] . Similarly, even when transmission is interrupted when the average female worm produces too few offspring to ensure the continuation of the life cycle, stochastic noise may not always result in parasite extinction in a defined location. In this paper, we shall analyze these situations with the use of a full individual-based stochastic model and certain approximations to the fully-simulated outcomes. In particular what is novel in our approach, is both looking at noise around the breakpoint and the transmission interruption state, and assessing how the migration of infected humans influences the likelihood of achieving effective control or even transmission interruption by MDA.

At present the demand is for increasing complexity in models to describe all known biological and epidemiological complexities including, for example: differing patterns of compliance to treatment; infected human migration patterns in and out of defined control activity regions; and various heterogeneities in human behaviour that influence transmission. In such circumstances, the temptation is to move to ever more complex simulation models, with a concomitant growth in parameters and the associated problems in measurement and estimation. In this paper we adopt a somewhat different approach, seeking to address the following fundamental questions:

• How well can deterministic models match the predictions made using stochastic simulations?

• Do the concepts such as 'breakpoints' in transmission still apply when stochasticity is introduced?

• How are transmission and control affected by infected human migration in a world of stochasticity?

In addressing these questions here we seek to ascertain the uncertainties that have the greatest impact on forecasts of NTD control initiatives both to enhance the quality of predictions and focus attention on what needs to be measured to improve accuracy.

The results described in this paper are underpinned by various analytical and numerical methods. We focus attention on stochastic models for STH infection and control, with epidemiological parameters set to those of the two hookworm species (Necator americanus and Ancylostoma duodenale). However, the methodologies developed are generalizable to other human helminth infections.

In Sec. 2 we introduce the mathematical model and formalism within which the first two main questions posed above are answered. In Sec. 3 we then extend this formalism to include a model for MDA control and infected human migration between reservoirs of infection, which we then use to answer the third question above. Lastly, in Sec. 4 we conclude with a summary of our findings and a discussion of future work.

For a recent review of stochastic STH models and their predictions concerning tramsmission dynamics and control impact, see Ref. [23] .

Consider an ensemble of Poisson walkers, each representing individual worm hosts within a community, and each assigned a worm uptake rate λ jn Λ j (t) (or the 'force of infection') for the nth individual within the j-th age bin, where one initially draws human predispositions to worm uptake from a unit-mean and 1/k j -variance gamma distribution 1

and one evolves the contribution to the force of infection in the j-th age bin according to the following differential equation

where it is important to note that the quantity which accounts for egg input into the reservoir from sexually-reproducing worms

depends on the total number of worms w jn (as opposed to the just the number of females) in the n-th individual within the j-th age bin. Throughout we shall assume that the standard exponential relationship for STH which takes into account the density dependent fecundity of worms z ≡ e −γ [7, 11, 26] is set to γ = 0.08, unless otherwise stated. Now let us build a corresponding Poisson process in the opposing direction to model the worm and human deaths, given by rates µ 1 and µ. In such a model, the total mean worm burden m(t) is defined as a weighted sum over the mean worm burdens within each age bin m j (t) (with N a age bins in total) -which itself is the average over the individual worm burdens

and can hence take different values, depending on the realisation. The stochastic jump equation, which governs its time evolution over a population of N p people, takes the following form

where the worm uptake U j (t) and (worm and human) death D j (t) are given by the following Poisson processes summed from n = 1 to N j individuals within the j-th age bin

where ∆t i ≡ t i − t i−1 , τ is a pre-specified timescale short enough such that no event is expected to take place.

We have developed a new stochastic simulation code for helminth transmission based on the model defined above. This code comes in the form of a publicly-available open-source python class: helmpy, which includes features to incorporate any population stratifications, models of control with MDA, inter-cluster human migration (building from earlier work in Refs. [27, 28] ) and an interactive notebook tutorial for calculating all of the quantities discussed in this paper. 2 This code will also be extended to include the other helminths in the future.

The individual-based stochastic model implemented in the helmpy code follows a similar pattern to the Gillespie algorithm [29] , however we also adopt a separate methodology for the mean field expansion (which we shall introduce later) to compare the with the former, which relies on a multidimensional Langevin solver, i.e., numerically evolves many coupled drift-diffusion processes simultaneously -see, e.g., Ref. [30] .

The code is written in a (mostly) vectorised implementation of the python programming language. To provide a benchmark for the performance, we note here that a single individual-based stochastic realisation of the code which implements multiple MDA treatment rounds and migration between 40 clusters of 500 people (each cluster corresponding to a different infectious reservoir) requires ∼ 20 minutes to run for 100 years on a laptop with a 1.7 GHz Intel Core i5 processor and 4GB of memory.

Stochastic individual-based simulations of STH transmission seek to incorporate a range of uncertainties into the populationlevel dynamics of the host-parasite interaction. It is interesting to note that these may typically be categorised into either one, or all, of three important biological/epidemiological components:

1. Uncertainty in predispositions of people (i.e. the specific chance of a particular group of people having their predispositions to STH infection drawn from a probability distribution), i.e., finite population uncertainty induced by specific samples of realisations. 2. Uncertainty in precisely when new infections, resulting in new worm acquisition, or worm/host deaths, resulting in worm loss, occur, i.e., dynamical uncertainty about precisely when events occur. 3. Uncertainty in the demographic parameters and initial conditions of the given human community (or 'system') under consideration, i.e., either prior or posterior uncertainty on the initial conditions.

One may average over the above forms of uncertainty either individually, or in combination. In particular, to obtain the dynamics corresponding to deterministic models of STH transmission, one must average over the first two -which we shall hereafter refer to as an 'ensemble average'. The ensemble average of Eq. (2) may be written as

where the result

has been derived in numerous Refs. [26, 11, 7] . Note that we have also defined the ensemble average over m j (t) as M j (t) ≡ E[m j (t)]. Performing an equivalent ensemble average over N j m j , the mean-field evolution equation for M j (t) is given by

matching the standard theory of the mean or 'deterministic' disease model [7] . Note that we have also used Eq. (1) to iden-

assuming that λ jn and Λ(t) may be treated as independent random variables. Note that this latter assumption is especially poor when the number of infected individuals (predominately controlled by k and/or treatment) is low since a limited number of individuals asserting their influence on the reservoir will lead to stronger cross-

In contrast to the simplicity of computing the dynamical equations for M j (t) above, calculating the time evolution of V j (t) ≡ Var[m j (t)] will require knowledge of the overall distribution.

It is straightforward to derive a master equation which governs the out-of-equilibrium behaviour of the n-th individual's (in the j-th age bin) worm burden distribution as a function of time P(w jn , t). This is d dt P(w jn , t) = − λ jn Λ j (t) + (µ + µ 1 )w jn P(w jn , t)

where one recognises the solution as an inhomogeneous Poisson walker w jn (t) ∼ Pois[w jn (t); I jn (t)] with intensity (for the explicit derivation, see Appendix A)

(16) Therefore, for an ensemble of N j independent walkers (hence individuals) the corresponding probability mass function is also that of a Poisson distribution

where we have also used the definition of the mean worm burden in the j-th age bin given by Eq. (4) . Note that in the case where Λ j (t) is roughly constant for all time, the timescale for the distribution to achieve stationarity is ∆t stat 1/(µ + µ 1 ).

Note that by assuming that the reservoir of infection Λ(t) in Eq. (16) is deterministic in time and averaging over λ jn according to Eq. (1), one recovers the well-established [7] negative binomial distribution for worms within hosts as the result of a gamma-poisson mixture. In reality, of course, the sample mean estimate for the number of infectious stages entering the reservoir in Eq.

(2) will induce stochastic fluctuations in Λ(t). Estimating the amplitude of these fluctuations will be essential to evaluating the distribution of worms within hosts in the stochastic individual-based simulation.

To begin with, we must first understand the variation in Λ j (t) that is induced from the finite sample of N j individuals assigned with an initial value of λ jn . The implicit solution to Eq. (2) is given by

Between ensemble realisations of Eq. (18), the only source of random variation is the sample variance in individual worm burdens when computing the value of the double sum

As discussed in Ref. [28] , the extremely short reservoir timescale 1/µ 2 compared to the timescales of the other processes, e.g., 1/µ and 1/µ 1 , allows for an accurate approximation 4 to Eq. (18) to be made where one may coarse-grain (integrate) over time such that

(20) If one now also assumes that w jn is drawn from an approximately negative binomial distribution then the distribution of N a j=1 N j samples drawn from the individual's egg input distribution is approximately also a negative binomial with updated mean and variance [28] such that

where one may compute the variance of the egg input distribution through evaluation of its second moment, yielding

By combining Eqs. (1), (17) , (20) and (21) we may infer that the full distribution over ensemble realisations of P(w jn , t) may be approximated by

where we have marginalised over all possible reservoir config-urationsȲ (within the negative binomial approximation) and individual uptake rates λ jn . In Appendix B we calculate the approximate ensemble mean and variance of the mean worm burden constructed from summed samples from Eq. (25) . Sampling directly from Eq. (25), one may effectively reconstruct an accurate ensemble of realisations at any specified point in time as long as the negative binomial approximation of the reservoir is accurate. However, accurate temporal correlations between the sum of individuals will require alternative methods.

In order to obtain a better approximation to the temporal correlations of the system, we shall perform a mean field expansion which allows us to calculate an accurate approximation to the stochastic noise around the mean worm burden of the deterministic STH model. Let us now rewrite the value of N j m j in separate components which depend differently on the system size N j , to obtain

where ξ j (t) denotes a fluctuation in each age bin at each moment in time.

Note that in Eq. (26) we have performed a temporal average (as opposed to ensemble average) over the states of the Poisson walkers, each with intensity I jn (t) -see Eq. (17) . The full ensemble of realisations for the system, which includes a random set of values chosen for λ jn , is not strictly ergodic. Hence, in order to assess the temporally correlated behaviour, in this section we shall use the temporal average (with notation · ) to refer to drawing the random values of λ jn a priori for a given realisation of the system -averaging over only the uncertainty component 2. as discussed at the beginning of Sec. 2.2. The full ensemble may then be restored subsequently by a second averaging over finite population samples (component 1. of Sec. 2.2) a posteriori.

In Appendix C we perform a van Kampen [31] expansion to obtain a Fokker-Planck equation for the evolution of the distribution over fluctuations ξ j in time, which is

which has the following stationary solutioñ

The exact form of the force of infection Λ j (t) is not generally known, however in the limit where the mean-field equations apply, the following estimator may be intuited which uses the ensemble average

Using the approximation in Eq. (30) we may thus use the solution to the mean field Eqs. (10) and (12) to stochastically evolve trajectories of the mean worm burden with temporal correlations.

C1 R 0 = 3.5; k = 0.3; M(t 0 ) = 2

Having established the main mathematical preliminaries, in the analysis of our results it will be convenient to refer to specific configurations of the human heminth system (according to initial choices of transmission parameters) to illustrate our results more effectively. These configurations shall always include the following choices corresponding to the hookworm timescales of: the adult worm death rate µ 1 = 1/2 per year (or an average life span of 2 years); the eggs/larvae death rate in the infectious reservoir µ 2 = 26 per year (or an average life span of 2 weeks) and a density-dependent worm fecundity power of γ = 0.08 [32] . We also have provided the particular choices of parameters in the configurations C1 and C2 of Table 1 . Configuration C1 has been chosen with parameters such that the system is far from the unstable 'breakpoint' equilibrium as illustrated in Fig. 1 , conversely, configuration C2 has been chosen such that the system is much closer to the breakpoint for a clear comparison.

In Sec. 2.2, we stated that deterministic models of STH transmission are obtained by averaging over both of the uncertainties in predispositions to infection and when events precisely occur in time. As such, the first of our results regarding the relationship between the deterministic models of STH transmission and stochastic simulations is not unexpected. The deterministic predictions for the dynamics of the mean worm burden [7] and the mean of the mean worm burdens derived from individual-based simulations exactly match -see, for instance, the good match between dashed lines plotted in the left and right top panels of Fig. 2 , where we have plotted the dynamics of the mean worm burdens in a community with parameters in configuration C1 (see Table 1 ) for a range of population sizes. The left and right columns of this figure correspond to the numerical solution to the fully individual-based stochastic simulation that we defined at the beginning of Sec. 2 and the mean field model with the stochastic noise approximation using Eqs. (27) and (28), respectively.

Considering the same pair of plots (top row) in Fig. 2 in more detail we find that, for a given range of parameters, the two methods used to generate the 68% credible intervals about each mean value also agree to very good accuracy. This agreement is not always the case, however, as we illustrate with the same pair of plots but with different transmission parameters on the bottom row of Fig. 2 . Given configuration C2 (see Table 1 ), in which the endemic equilibrium value is situated closer to the unstable 'breakpoint' equilibrium, we find that an important phenomenon which exists in the individual-based stochastic simulation is not present in the deterministic model -this phenomenon is known as 'fade-out' in the parasite population. 'Fade-out' is where transmission is interrupted due to chance events, even when the underlying transmission success (the value of R 0 ) is above the level that deterministic models predict will result in parasite persistence. In other words, values just above the transmission breakpoint of the deterministic model may indeed move to parasite extinction, due to chance effects.

Ordinarily in disease transmission models, the stochastic noise approximation using Eqs. (27) and (28) may be used to compute similar 'fade-out' effects to great accuracy, see, e.g., in an SIR model [33] . However, the presence of the unstable 'breakpoint' equilibrium leads to a stronger fade-out effect as one can observe in the drift towards a zero mean worm burden (transmission interruption) of the lower 68% credible interval contour (and mean) in the bottom row plots of Fig. 2 with population sizes of 100 and 350, and which markedly reduces the accuracy of the mean field stochastic approximation. A simple Gaussian approximation notwithstanding, fade-out is a very important phenomenon of considerable practical relevance to the prospect of helminth transmission interruption. Note that the probability of a fade-out event also increases from very small to large as village population size decreases, as is also shown by the results of Fig. 2 . The inability of the stochastic noise approximation model to capture the fade-out phenomenon is of considerable interest and is requires a more detailed mathematical description of the stochastic dynamics of the reservoir of infection. Such work is planned for investigation in future work.

In our analysis in this section, although we ignored age structure, its inclusion does not influence the general insights although it will influence quantitative detail. For hookworm, the absence of age structure is not too serious, even in quantitative terms since field studies suggest that the force of infection is often independent of age [32] . To illustrate this point, in Fig. 3 we have plotted the C1 configuration (see Table 1 ) with relevant hookworm age stucture included, where the difference between 

STHs are dioecious and therefore both male and female parasites must be in the same host for the female worm to be fertilized and produce viable eggs or larvae which sustain transmission. Past research in the context of the deterministic models of transmission has demonstrated that there are three apparent equilibria: a stable endemic state, parasite extinction, and an unstable state termed the 'transmission breakpoint' which lies between the stable state and parasite extinction [34, 35, 36] . The existence of such a breakpoint can be intuited by the above limitations of STH reproduction when it becomes difficult to find a male and female worm pair within an individual host and it represents a clear target for control policies which aim to achieve transmission interruption. As we also discussed earlier in Sec. 1 and illustrated in Fig. 1 , this (dashed) breakpoint curve in the phase plane of Fig. 1 acts as a separatrix between 6 .

In this instance, the population has been split into two equal-sized components of ages 0-14 and 15+, where we the worm uptake rate in the case of the 15+ group has been set to exactly 3 times that of the 0-14 group. The observed lack of an effect may be restricted to hookworm infections where the force of infection is often constant across age classes. This is not the case for Ascaris and Trichuris infections [23] . the attractor basins of the stable (endemic) and exctinction equilibria.

Extensive past numerical analyses based on using the individual-based simulation code [37, 25] strongly indicate that the uncertainties which are inherent in individual-based simulations dominate the transmission dynamics near the deterministic breakpoint in transmission. This is especially true if the breakpoint is close to the endemic equilibrium of parasite extinction (as opposed to the stable equilibrium of endemic infection) as a consequence of high degree of parasite aggregation in the human population [38, 7] , as is illustrated by the appearance of the fade-out effect between the top left and bottom left plots of Fig. 2 . Furthermore, in the previous section, we highlighted some limitations in the standard formulation of deterministic models to account for the specific phenomena of population 'fade-out' (or spontaneous transmission interruption) which are present in the real world due to chance effects in population growth and decay especially when host population densities are low. Such effects are also captured by individualbased stochastic simulation models. It may hence be reasonable to ask whether concepts which exist in the deterministic framework are present in the stochastic simulations.

Conclusions drawn from hookworm simulation studies in Refs. [25, 37] for a range of population sizes study thresholds in prevalence in the range 0.5%-2% below which the probability of transmission interruption is assessed. In particular, attaining a prevalence below the threshold of ∼ 1% for population sizes 100-1000 leads to interruption of transmission with a high probability. In this section, we provide a theoretical argument for the existence of this threshold as a 'stochastic breakpoint' which works in a similar way to the behaviour present in deterministic models, but accounting for some unavoidable uncertainty.

Let us define a net 'grower' as an individual who, given a particular reservoir of infection and adult worm death rate, is able to accumulate more than one worm over time in a consistent manner (an individual who is predisposed to infection). Such individuals are crucial to the survival of the parasite in a defined community as they provide future material to the reservoir of infective stages in the habitat which subsequentially may grow the number of human hosts who become net growers of infection themselves, and so on. One can typically state that if the number of human hosts in which the parasite population grows (net growers) is one or more in a given cluster or community of people, then the chances of parasite extinction in the long-term are low.

Immediately after, e.g., treatment through an MDA programme, only a limited number of infected individuals remain in each age bin N inf and hence are able to contribute to the reservoir in the following timesteps (until further relaxation of the system towards some equilibrium). Using a modified version of Eq. (20) we may infer the following estimate of the infectious reservoir contribution by those individuals into the j-th age bin

Hence, by further assuming that the fluctuations in the reservoir of infection are well-approximated by the negative binomial distribution, we may evaluate the expected maximum fraction E( f >1 max ) -of all individuals in the cluster -whose ratio between their uptake rate λ jn Λ j (t) inf and the death rate of a single worm (µ + µ 1 ) exceeds 1 through the following integral motivated by the form of Eq. (25)

where NB inf [Ȳ; E(Ȳ), Var(Ȳ)] denotes the reservoir egg count negative binomial distribution corresponding toȲ| inf and Θ(·) is a Heaviside function. Given Eq. (32) he expected number of net growers is therefore simply N p E( f >1 max ). Let us now define the prevalence of infection p as the fraction of the total population who are infected. We therefore deduce that p = N inf /N p . Using Eqs. (25) and (32), we have plotted a calculation of both the probability of the number of net growers for communities with configurations C1 and C2 (see Table 1 ) in Fig. 4 and the expected number of net growers as a function of the prevalence in Fig. 5 for a wide range of system configurations. In both sets of plots we consider population numbers of 100, 350 and 1000, as indicated. Fig. 4 demonstrates that for system configurations further from the unstable 'breakpoint' equilibrium -configuration C1 in the right column of plots -the probability of exceeding a net number of growers larger than 1 becomes large once the 1% 8 .

The copyright holder for this preprint The relative probability (the probability mass divided by the maximum value) of a number of individuals who will gain more than one worm, or, 'net growers' given that effectively only one individual is contributing to the reservoir of infection per unit time for two different system configurations (given by the left and right columns). This probability has been calculated using Eq. (25) and the condition for a net grower -as discussed in Sec. 2.5. The right columns have the same parameters of the system as those of configuration C1 in Table 1 (which is assumed to have attained an endemic equilibrium mean worm burden). The left columns have the same parameters of the system as those of configuration C2 in Table 1 (which is also assumed to have attained an endemic equilibrium mean worm burden).

prevalence threshold, with the contrary being true below this threshold. The plots in the left column -which correspond to configuration C2 -the probability for the number of net growers to be above 1 remains low even for a prevalence of 2%, which is to be expected due to this configuration's proximity to the unstable 'breakpoint' equilibrium. Furthermore, from Fig. 5 , it is immediately apparent that the expected number of growers is extremely unlikely to exceed 1 if the prevalence of infection is lower than ∼ 1% in all cases of population number. Hence, this threshold essentially acts as a 'stochastic breakpoint', below which the probability of interrupting transmission in stochastic individual-based simulations becomes very likely. Note that caveats to our analysis here include varying the population number well beyond the prior limits used in our short sensitivity analysis -in such situations it is possible for apparent thresholds to go much lower or higher, e.g., consider the small, but non-negligible probabilities of sustaining transmission below a prevalence of 1% for much larger population numbers than those studied here in Ref. [37] . It is important to also mention that the approximate bound we obtain on the prevalence as a 'stochastic breakpoint' applies as more of a strict bound and hence does not exclude the possibility (or even high likelihood in some specific configurations) of elimination at a higher prevalence of 2%. Our discussion here is therefore complementary (and not contradictory) to, e.g., Ref. [25] .

We expect that similar conclusions apply in settings where parasite interruption is predicted since the basic reproduction number (R 0 ) is too low to sustain transmission (see Fig. 1 ). If the mean worm load is just below this critical R 0 value to sustain transmission in regions where the only stable state is parasite extinction, there will be a probability distribution of situations where parasite persistence occurs for a while due to chance events which may obscure the precise location of this threshold.

Our short analysis in this section has provided some theoretical justification for the existence of a 'stochastic breakpoint' which has been identified to be an important target for transmission interruption from previous hookworm simulation studies [25, 37] and our analysis may also be extended to other parasites, which shall be subject of future work.

In the stochastic model we have built, the effect of people ageing over time has been neglected so far. Assuming that the effective number of people in each age bin remains unchanged, the passing of individuals between age bins may be fully accounted for as a reservoir pulse of the same form as Eq. (33) which introduces new egg pulses drawn from the ( j − 1)-th age bin and removes eggs from the j-th bin into the ( j + 1)-th bin. The reservoir fluctuation model described above demonstrates how ageing can can only affect the system by a significant variation in k j between bins -furthermore, such fluctuations are can be shown to be damped significantly when the age bins are much wider than 1/(µ + µ 1 ) due to the relaxation timescale of each individual Poisson walker (see, e.g., Eq. (17)). In light of this fact, we have elected to avoid a direct description of ageing in this work without loss of generality in our Figure 5 : The expected number of individuals who will gain more than one worm, or, 'net growers' given that effectively only one individual is contributing to the reservoir of infection per unit time for a range of different system configurations. These values have been obtained by randomly sampling configurations of Eq. (32) with flat priors defined over the following intervals in one cluster without age structure for illustration: the basic reproduction number R 0 ∈ [2, 4]; the logarithim (base 10) of the worm aggregation parameter log 10 k ∈ [−4, 0]; the initial mean worm burden M(t 0 ) ∈ [2, 5] and an assumed density-dependent worm fecundity power of γ = 0.08. The range of system configurations sampled corresponds to much wider range than those given in Fig. 4.

argumentation, while leaving future versions of our stochastic simulation to include these sub-dominant effects. Past published individual-based stochastic models of helminth transmission have included a dynamically ageing population [23] .

Up until this point we have not considered processes which may modify the standard STH transmission model. Applying control measures through MDA and the effect of infected human migration between clusters are both processes which modify the dynamics. The impact of MDA has been covered in various recent publications [39, 25, 37] , whereas, infected human migration in the context of STH transmission has only recently been addressed in the context of its impact on achieving breakpoints in transmission [27, 28] . In the context of STH infections it is necessary for infected people to be present at a location long enough to contribute to the infectious reservoir.

In this paper, we incorporate the migration model for STH described in Ref. [28] into our individual-based stochastic simulation. We shall use this model to describe the consequences that infected human migration has on human helminth transmission using illustrative examples. In Ref. [28] the relative size of the migration rate of individual egg counts into or out of a region (e.g., some number of people per year) compared to the death rate of infectious stages within the reservoir, µ 2 (µ 2 = 26 per year for hookworm), was found to be have important implications for the effect of migration on transmission. Hence, in all of the results on migration in this section, the migration rate shall be quoted as a factor of µ 2 to investigate the importance of the ratio between these two parameters in the fully individualbased stochastic simulation.

The migration of infected individuals between clustered communities represents a combination of both the finite population and dynamical uncertainty described at the beginning of Sec. 2.2. A simple modification to the model we have introduced, which builds from the work in Ref. [28] , may be considered to incorporate the effects of human migration into the transmission dynamics: consider a compound Poisson process j (t) which perturbs Eq. (2) in the following way 3 3 As was also shown in Ref. [28] , when the reservoir timescale µ 2 is not as fast, Eq. (34) should receive a non-Markovian modification ∝ 1 − e µ 2 (t−t 0 ) to account for the slower decay of pulses in the reservoir.

and where r + and r − are the ingoing and outgoing the migratory rates, respectively, and we have coarse-grained in time to obtain the j (t) fluctuation amplitude with respect to the mean worm burden -as in Eq. (20) . With the effect of migration defined in this way, the parameters of Eq. (35) may be randomly selected from any of the corresponding available age bins, and the ensemble mean updated to account for any out-of-equilibrium behaviour. Using a similar set of pulses, in Ref. [28] it was further shown that the migratory rate must exceed or be around the same order as the death rate of infectious material in the reservoir, i.e., r + , r − µ 2 , for the migration to affect the dynamics significantly.

In Ref. [28] it is also assumed that the reservoir pulses which arise from migration are uniform across the full ensemble of realisations: though this captures the inherent variability due to migration effects, it does not marginalise entirely over the full ensemble of possible fluctuations which are captured in this work. It is necessary in the finite population limit, then, for such processes to be modelled by a full stochastic individualbased simulation, where we leave the possibility of an analytic description for future work.

In light of the apparent necessity for a numerical approach, we also point out that when using a fully individual-based simulation one may randomly draw from the worm burdens of the individuals and compute an egg pulse amplitude using Eq. (3) -in doing so potentially capturing the out-of-equilibrium behaviour of the reservoir during, e.g., rounds of treatment. For the latter reason we shall adopt this approach when generating our numerical results throughout. We further note that such an approach has also been advocated in similar models such as those in Ref. [27] .

In the bottom left panel of Fig. 2 we provided an example of the fade-out effect which appears in standard individual-based simulations. In metapopulation disease transmission models it is well-known that migration effects can stabilise local tranmission, evading effects such as fade-out even when the population sizes are small -see, e.g., Ref. [40] . By including migration from a cluster with configuration C1 (see Table 1 ) into the cluster depicted in the plot with configuration C2 (with 350 people each), in Fig. 6 we demonstrate that a similar stabilisation of the fade-out effect can also occur for helminth transmission models, despite the especially strong fade-out induced from the presence of the unstable 'breakpoint' equilibrium. As targets for helminth elimination trials drive the prevalence in regions closer to (and beyond) the unstable equilibrium, this is an important possibility to take note of with practical implications should migration within a given region be of the same order or higher as is indicated in Fig. 2 . Note that in order for this effect to be important, the migration rate needs to exceed the death rate of eggs/larvae in the infectious reservoir, i.e., r + , r − µ 2 , which is an early confirmation of the conclusions drawn from Ref. [28] , but we shall now investigate the importance of migration rates relative to µ 2 in more detail by examining another 11 .

Three different migration rates of individuals are used as scales of the death rate of eggs/larvae in the infectious reservoir µ 2 and are depicted by different shades of blue colour.

new consequence of migration. Migration into a cluster may also occur from an untreated external source (UES), i.e., from a location with a defined negative binomial distribution of worms within hosts and population number that is left untreated in the endemic state. In such instances, it is also possible that the region may have previously achieved elimination which is then reversed -an 'outbreak' scenario.

In Fig. 7 we have plotted the prevalence of worms within hosts after a period of 100 years for a previously-eliminated cluster experiencing UES migration for a range of migration rates (as a ratio of the eggs or larvae death rate for comparison). The transmission parameters chosen for the UES match a cluster of the indicated population size and configuration C1 from Table 1 from which migrants move to a cluster with the same indicated population size and transmission parameters from configuration C2 in the left column of plots (configuration C1 in the right column of plots), where the latter cluster has been initialised without any initial infections. From these plots one can immediately see that a discrete transition occurs in prevalence after a critical UES migration rate has been reached and that this value changes according to population size. This transition marks the point at which the STH transmission is sustained endemically, and hence the UES migration rate that this corresponds to is of critical importance to policy makers and implementers of STH control programmes since achieving elimination above this critical point in migration rate is likely impossible without treating the external source of migrants simultaneously.

For the larger population numbers (350 and 1000), Fig. 7 also confirms the conclusions drawn in Ref. [28] -that critical mi-gration rates to affecting transmission must exceed a threshold of at least µ 2 . Note, however that the precise number of individuals required to be contributing to the reservoir per unit time can be substantially modified when the population number is changed and the apparent prevalence required to trigger the outbreak transition can be much higher than 1% -typically 10%. Therefore, it is important that we state that the stochastic breakpoint that we derived in Sec. 2.5 only applies to situations where the prevalence of infection is lowered due to treatment, as opposed to being raised from a zero worm state due to UES migration. Such a difference in breakpoint prevalence value required between these two scenarios is due to the greater homogeneity in worm loads of individuals in the case of UES migration, as opposed to the case of post-treatment where a limited number of individuals have a large number or worms -the latter of which is more consistent with the negative binomial reservoir approximation used to derive the stochastic breakpoint in Sec. 2.5. We plan to investigate this apparent asymmetry in how the stochastic breakpoint applies for individual-based simulations in future work.

Note here that for configuration C1 and a small population number of 100, in Fig. 7 (top right panel) we see that transmission may transition to the endemic state spontaneously with a much lower migration rate than µ 2 -such an effect is due to the additional variance induced by finite population effects and this represents a potentially important caveat to the migration rate threshold we have proposed above.

To demonstrate the difficulty in achieving STH transmission interruption with an MDA control programme when migration of infected humans between clustered communities is in place, even when treating all communities at once, in Fig. 8 we plot the positive predictive value (PPV) of elimination after 100 years having reached at least a given prevalence threshold or below (as indicated on the horizontal axis) in a cluster with a C2 configuration (see Table 1 ) after 3 rounds of treatment (assuming 100% efficacy). Treatment rounds have been applied in years 15, 16 and 17 simultaneously to clusters with configurations C1 and C2 (with population sizes of 350 each), where the dashed black horizontal line at a PPV of 1 shows that elimination is essentially certain in the C2 configuration after treatment if no migration occurs between the two clusters. Once again, however, we find that this PPV drops sharply as the migration rate between clusters is increased in rate relative to the eggs/larvae death rate in the reservoir, µ 2 .

The control of helminth infections worldwide will require a greater degree of monitoring and evaluation throughout 2020 to 2030 as treatment programmes strive to get to the point where transmission interruption thresholds have been achieved. This leads to an increased focus of research into predicting the likelihood of 'bounce back' once the transmission breakpoint has been achieved. Such breakpoints are variously defined, but in Table 1 from which migrants move to a cluster with the same indicated population size and transmission parameters from configuration C2 in the left column of plots (configuration C1 in the right column of plots), where the latter cluster has been initialised without any initial infections. Note that we are using the death rate of eggs/larvae in the infectious reservoir, µ 2 , as a unit with which to measure the relative migration rate, where µ 2 = 26 per year for hookworm. Dashed vertical black lines indicate when the migration rate equals µ 2 .

The copyright holder for this preprint Table 1 ) given that a prevalence threshold -which is varied on the horizontal axis -has been crossed immediately post-MDA. In three of the shown cases the C2 cluster is also experiencing migration from another cluster with a C1 configuration (once again, see Table 1 ) where the migration rates are indicated (using units of µ 2 = 26 per year for hookworm). The treatment has been applied to both clusters and is 3 rounds of MDA with a random compliance pattern of individual behaviours assumed at 60% coverage (and 100% efficacy) in years 15, 16 and 17 of the overall 100. general for human helminths, the indication from modelling studies is that a true prevalence (based on the use of a very sensitive diagnostic) of less than 1% moves the dynamics of the system to the interruption of transmission. Defining the breakpoint and designing monitoring and evaluation programmes requires the use of stochastic individual-based models to determine this likelihood in terms of PPV and NPV values of the probability of transmission elimination or bounce back. It is therefore highly desirable to account for as many sourcesnatural, or otherwise -of uncertainty to ensure a high degree of confidence in the predictions made by such models. The effect of infected human migration in and out of health implementation units on control outcomes, is but one important example of a key source of heterogeneity.

In this paper, we have sought to answer a number of questions of importance to providing reliable predictions for the design of public health programmes for the control of human helminth infections and their monitoring and evaluation.

Averaged quantities, e.g., the mean worm burden, are matched well by the deterministic model to the individualbased simulations. This is an expected result conformed by past work [12] . Stochastic versions of the deterministic models employing mean-field approximations may be derived to predict how fluctuations in the averaged quantities vary over time. The mean-field approximation, however, appears to fail to predict specific important phenomena accurately which exist in an individual-based simulation; namely, fade-out effects.

Our analyses suggest that deterministic models of STH (and other helminth) transmission provide important general guidelines to making predictions of what level of control, such as MDA coverage, and what patterns of individual compliance to treatment will move the system close to or below the deterministic breakpoint in transmission. However, once in this region, chance effects can result in either transmission elimination (fade out) or bounce back even when above or below the breakpoint. In practice, around the unstable equilibrium, stochastic noise induces a degree of uncertainty in outcome which must be described as a probability of a certain outcome being achieved. Deriving these probability descriptions in terms of, for example PPV and NPV values, requires the use of an individual-based stochastic model.

Our analyses suggest that public health workers will benefit from determining the transmission threshold -or 'breakpoint' -for transmission interruption using individual-based simulations, and that theoretical calculations suggest a true prevalence target of below ∼ 1% to have an extremely high probability of interruption in a wide variety of scenarios for all the major helminth infections of humans. The important public health message, however, is that in a stochastic world where chance events play a central role, nothing is certain. As such, outcomes should be expressed as probability events. Even below the 1% threshold, however, bounce back can occur due to chance events, where its likelihood will depend on host and parasite population size.

Infected human migration, like treatment, is an effect which requires individual-based simulation to assess its importance in sustaining high levels of control in the real world where much heterogeneity exists within and between health intervention population units in most regions of endemic infection. Analyses suggest that sufficiently rapid migration from regions with prevalent infection can shift units in which high MDA coverage is achieved to a situation of sustained transmission. This suggests that external processes such as inter-cluster migration could play an important role in sustaining STH transmission.

The models suggest the existence of a near-universal critical migration rate (up to the population number caveat discussed in Sec. 3.1) corresponding to the death rate of eggs or larvae in the case of STH infections in the infectious reservoir exists, above which, simulations exhibit various behaviours. These include stabilization of fade-out effects such that infection persist; migration from a neighboring setting generating infection bounce back in locations where infection has been well controlled; and lower PPVs for transmission elimination, proceeding treatment achieving a target prevalence of infection threshold is likely even if all clusters are being treated when migration between locations is occurring. The key result is that migration from an untreated external source (UES) is capable of causing bounce back even in areas with effective MDA coverage to get transmission close to the breakpoint once its rate equals or exceeds the death rate of eggs or larvae in the infectious reservoir. For hookworm, this is typically around 26 infected individuals per year. As a consequence of the result above, if the rate of infected migration exceeds or equals the defined threshold, the PPV for elimination may be lowered even if all clusters are treated.

Finally, public health workers will hopefully benefit from open access to simulation models, such as our public code, helmpy, in order to examine the effects of infected human migration on the effectiveness of their control policies for STH and other helminths, though some simpler approximate descriptions exist under certain assumptions [28] . In future work, we plan also to extend the helmpy package to include features for likelihood-based inference for parameter estimation from epidemiological data in given settings.

The models suggest the existence of a near-universal critical migration rate (up to the population number caveat discussed in Sec. 3.1) corresponding to the death rate of eggs or larvae in the case of STH infections in the infectious reservoir exists, above which, simulations exhibit various behaviours. These include stabilization of fade-out effects such that infection persist; migration from an neighboring setting generating infection bounce back in locations where infection has been well controlled; and lower PPVs for transmission elimination, proceeding treatment achieving a target prevalence of infection threshold is likely even if all clusters are being treated when migration between locations is occurring. The challenges for future work on migration impact on the likelihood of achieving transmission breakpoints, lie in good measurement of both the heterogeneity of MDA coverage over time in adjacent health implementation units and migration patterns between such units. Since the mean of Eq. (27) is an averaged quantity it does not fluctuate as a random variable, hence we may now rewrite the probability distribution in terms of the other remaining random variable which now characterises the fluctuations of the system around the temporal average λ jn Λ j (t) + (µ + µ 1 )

Spatial and temporal analyses to investigate infectious disease transmission within healthcare settings,"Background: Healthcare-associated infections (HCAIs) cause significant morbidity and mortality worldwide, and outbreaks are often only identified after they reach high levels. A wide range of data is collected within healthcare settings; however, the extent to which this information is used to understand HCAI dynamics has not been quantified. Aim: To examine the use of spatiotemporal analyses to identify and prevent HCAI transmission in healthcare settings, and to provide recommendations for expanding the use of these techniques. Methods: A systematic review of the literature was undertaken, focusing on spatiotemporal examination of infectious diseases in healthcare settings. Abstracts and full-text articles were reviewed independently by two authors to determine inclusion. Findings: In total, 146 studies met the inclusion criteria. There was considerable variation in the use of data, with surprisingly few studies (N ¼ 22) using spatiotemporal-specific analyses to extend knowledge of HCAI transmission dynamics. The remaining 124 studies were descriptive. A modest increase in the application of statistical analyses has occurred in recent years. Conclusion: The incorporation of spatiotemporal analysis has been limited in healthcare settings, with only 15% of studies including any such analysis. Analytical studies provided greater data on transmission dynamics and effective control interventions than studies without spatiotemporal analyses. This indicates the need for greater integration of spatiotemporal techniques into HCAI investigations, as even simple analyses provide significant improvements in the understanding of prevention over simple descriptive summaries.","Healthcare-associated infections (HCAIs) are problematic worldwide, with a recent report by the World Health Organization estimating hospital-wide prevalence in high-income countries at 8%. 1 In addition to causing significant, yet preventable, morbidity and mortality 2 in countries with centrallyfunded and managed healthcare systems, such as the UK National Health Service, HCAIs increase waiting times and reduce availability of resources to provide care to the population. 3 HCAIs present a unique challenge as active transmissions are often only identified after numerous patients have been infected. Additionally, the wide range of HCAI facilitators (e.g. procedures, 4 environment 5 ) and increasingly susceptible patients 6 complicate transmission dynamics, making prospective identification and control exceedingly difficult. When multiple cases of an infection occur within a hospital, it is difficult to differentiate a true nosocomial transmission from unrelated cases, and cohorting patients by risk group may lead to assumptions of a common source but molecular analyses often demonstrate lack of transmission. 7 Sophisticated spatiotemporal analyses can be used to confirm clustering statistically over time and/or space, which would increase confidence in assuming the relatedness of cases. These methods can also be used to control for the effects of cohorting and other patient characteristics that may give the spurious impression of clustering or transmission when it has not occurred. This, in turn, would provide better information on where interventions could be targeted most effectively, and when or where to anticipate outbreaks. These methods may also be useful in more rapid identification of a problem, as even small clusters (e.g. two or three cases) can be detected. Even the introduction of more simplified analytical methods to evaluate spatial and temporal relationships could be beneficial. One example is the Knox test, which has been used widely to detect timeespace clusters since the 1960s. The null hypothesis in Knox testing would be that all HCAI cases are independent, and the test returns the number of pairs of cases that are deemed to cluster in time and/or space. The tool is simple to apply as it only requires information on cases, not controls or susceptible individuals, and can work on a minimal clinical dataset. 8 Nowadays, researchers are using geographic information systems (GIS) to further extend understanding of spatiotemporal clustering and transmission. These are computer-based programs that combine cartography, statistical analysis and database technology to layer databases on top of a predefined map. They have been applied in a range of ecological investigations of disease, 9 and to determine whether there is a spatial association between disease risk and environmental pollution. In this study, GIS and spatial analysis were employed to investigate the risk of breast and lung cancer in a small region. 10 After identification of significant clusters, it was possible to identify local risk factors specific to each cancer type, providing evidence of potential environmental contamination. The use of similar techniques to create hospital maps, on which infection data can be displayed and analysed, could increase understanding of local transmission and risk, 11 and provide rapid dissemination of information through visualization. 12 With healthcare systems worldwide under pressure to improve patient safety whilst cutting costs, use of the existing infrastructure of routinely collected data, which are often overlooked for HCAI investigation and research, 13 is an innovative solution. Frequently, investigations of HCAIs provide a basic epidemiological description of cases over time by providing an epidemic curve, or show how cases are distributed across wards using a diagram. However, hospital databases contain laboratory results, building management data and floor plans, and information on patient admissions and movement that could easily be incorporated into more detailed analyses to improve understanding of local HCAI epidemiology. Use of interdisciplinary tools may increase the ability to identify transmission prospectively and implement preventive measures. 14 The aims of this review were to determine the extent of use of spatiotemporal analyses for identifying and preventing HCAI transmission, and to provide recommendations for expanding the use of GIS and spatiotemporal statistical analyses within healthcare settings.

A systematic review of the literature on spatiotemporal examination of infectious diseases in healthcare settings between January 1961 and June 2013 was conducted using the following search terms: infection (e.g. HCAI, nosocomial, etc.); healthcare settings (e.g. hospital, intensive care, etc.); and time/space (e.g. spaceetime, spatial epidemiology, etc.). Potential synonyms for each search term (e.g. infection, healthcare settings and time/space) were identified and combined using Boolean operators.

To ensure comprehensive capture of the literature, BIOSIS, Cochrane Review, CSA, DARE, Embase, HEED, JSTOR, PubMed, Science Direct and Web of Science were searched for all indexed publications. Additionally, Google Scholar was searched for indexed and grey literature using the above search terms. All papers, reports, abstracts and letters were included in the initial search.

Inclusion/exclusion was conducted in two stages: abstract/ title review and full-text review. All identified titles/abstracts were reviewed independently by two authors to ensure reliability in full-text retrieval. Papers were retrieved if they mentioned time or space in the abstract, or no abstract was provided and the title did not provide enough information to assess inclusion.

Full-text papers were reviewed independently by two authors and included if they were: (a) published post-1961; (b) written in English; (c) examined potential transmission in more than three patients; (d) provided more than a simple report of cases over time periods exceeding three months (i.e. not routine national surveillance reports); and (e) discussed time/space as a specific aim or discussion point of the study, rather than a simple mention in the results. Any studies on which the reviewers did not agree were discussed and a consensus was reached.

The methodologies of all included studies were reviewed and categorized into either descriptive or analytical studies of time/space, and further 'subtyped' based on the data and analyses employed. Studies were classified as 'case reporting' if they only used temporal or spatial data as an overview (i.e. an epidemic curve). 'Basic descriptive epidemiology' studies examined how the cases were linked by describing their locality in time and/or space and possible exposure events, but did not use statistical methods to determine the probability that they were linked. 'Basic descriptive epidemiology with molecular data' studies focused on the genetic diversity of the organisms, including a description of the distribution of the strains in space and/or time. 'Statistical spatiotemporal analysis' studies used statistical methods to explore HCAI distribution in time or space. Studies were classified as 'statistical spatiotemporal analysis with molecular data' if they combined molecular data with statistical analyses to investigate the dissemination of strains across time or space. The final category, 'spatiotemporal analysis using GIS', included studies that used GIS within hospital settings. Findings were synthesized to evaluate the actual use of spatiotemporal analysis on infectious diseases in healthcare settings. Meta-analysis was considered but was not deemed to be feasible due to the heterogeneity of research designs and outcome measures; as such, the findings were synthesized qualitatively.

In total, 43,819 titles/abstracts were identified during the literature search ( Figure 1 ). Of these, 584 met the inclusion criteria for full-text retrieval. Four of the included studies were not available, and 146 were included in the review. Most of the studies excluded did not meet the spatiotemporal criteria; 171 provided some spatiotemporal results but did not discuss this information as it was not the focus of the study. Others examined annual trends, were case studies or review papers, or focused on non-healthcare settings. Six studies were excluded for being written in a language other than English.

Included studies were predominantly descriptive in their reporting of spatiotemporal data (85%), and varied greatly in encompassing a range of settings, populations and HCAIs. Half of the studies were carried out hospital-wide (53%), 42% (N ¼ 61) were performed on specific wards, and only seven (5%) were based within nursing homes. The majority of studies were retrospective (72%), often using data to investigate outbreaks after the event had ended. Five (3%) studies combined retrospective analyses and prospective interventions to enhance surveillance, whilst the remaining 25% of studies were prospective.

Numerous HCAIs were investigated, with the most common group being bacteria (62%), such as meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) (11%) and Clostridium difficile (10%). Studies focusing solely on viral or fungal infections accounted for 29% of studies, including norovirus (3%), severe acute respiratory syndrome (3%) and Aspergillus spp. (7%). Among the 74 molecular studies in this review, only five incorporated spatiotemporal analyses to understand the transmission dynamics.

The studies were separated into two types, 'descriptive' and 'analytical', based on their use of spatiotemporal-specific statistical analyses. To enable clearer comparisons between the groups and to evaluate the variation in exploitation of clinical data, the studies were further classified into six subtypes (Table I) . These are described in detail below.

Descriptive studies primarily focused on summarizing outbreak investigations, environmental assessments and cluster identification. For the vast majority of these studies, causes or sources of outbreaks, cases or clustering were the primary aim. However, simple qualitative descriptions were not sufficient in most cases to confirm or refute identified sources or clusters.

Case reporting studies Basic descriptions of time and space were common (20%, N ¼ 29) (Table II) . Two-thirds of these studies provided a retrospective temporal description of the incidence of cases over time (i.e. an epidemic curve). Many of these studies examined outbreaks 15e22 and evaluations of intervention strategies, 23e25 while others attempted to identify factors associated with potential nosocomial transmission (i.e. healthcare worker carriage, 26, 27 direct contact with cases, 28, 29 inadequate cleaning of medical equipment 30, 31 and the physical layout of hospital utilities 32, 33 ). Only four studies described the spatial distribution of cases to show the impact of hospital renovations 34 or the layout of cases across specialities, 16, 27, 34, 35 with the majority of studies describing temporal trends in cases. 36, 37 Most case reporting studies examined bacteria (62%); however, the most informative studies were those examining organisms such as Aspergillus spp. and Legionella spp., where environmental contamination is considered to be the primary risk factor. 15,35,38e42 Basic descriptive epidemiology Investigations that described the temporal or spatial distribution of cases were categorized as basic epidemiology (18%, N ¼ 26) (Table II) . A number of studies provided a retrospective evaluation of the incidence of cases by assessing temporal links between patients, while 58% of studies combined spatial and temporal elements to varying degrees in their evaluations. The main organisms considered were bacteria (46%); however, the studies that evaluated Aspergillus spp. focused on spatial data to the greatest extent. Indeed, the only study that focused solely on the spatial element examined fungal contamination of the hospital environment. 43 Some studies combined infection information with building 'schematics' to explain the physical layout of the ward 44 or to display the location of patients. 45e53 However, these studies did not investigate the importance of the geographical distribution of cases, as has been highlighted in studies that have looked at the impact of construction on the incidence of fungal infections. 43,54e56 In addition to evaluating the distribution of cases, some investigators used graphics to visualize the connections between cases, 57 and attempted to identify possible clusters 58e62 or provide evidence of potential transmission. 63, 64 A number of studies used timelines to evaluate how cases were linked. 65e67 Chen et al. visualized the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome within an emergency department. 68 By combining temporal data with patient locations, the researchers identified distinct 'clusters' of cases, and prevented further dissemination of the disease by quarantining contacts of these individuals. Whilst the outcome was positive, the assumed clusters were based purely on description of the patients' locations at certain times, and the lack of statistical analysis meant that the clusters were not proven to be statistically significant.

Basic descriptive epidemiology with molecular data Most descriptive studies incorporated molecular data (47%; N ¼ 69) (Table II) , presumably because a molecular link provided more evidence of clustering or transmission than purely describing potential clusters. Numerous studies combined spatiotemporal and molecular data to attempt to develop a better understanding of strain dissemination 69e81 or potential sources 82e85 within the institutions in which they were conducted. Integration of molecular and temporal data enabled investigators to highlight potential links between patients, and identify potential transmission events, 86e92 with greater substantiation than simple descriptive studies. In one study, researchers were able to differentiate between two consecutive outbreaks of Stenotrophomonas maltophilia on their intensive care unit by visualizing the temporal distribution of isolates identified using restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) 93 ; however, it is possible that these two distinct outbreaks could have encompassed several smaller events with the same RFLP type introduced multiple times.

Descriptive studies that included molecular data covered a range of applications including outbreak investigations, 94e102 cluster identification 103 and improving control interventions. 104 ,105 However, the most common applications of 77,115e121 Many studies evaluated the distribution of strains over time or space, 122e126 aiming to establish epidemiological links between cases, but were limited by lack of statistical analysis. The geographical layout of cases was used in some studies to suggest potential factors associated with their distribution. 127e133 The study by Witte et al. mapped the distribution of MRSA strains at national level in Germany to compare changes in resistance phenotypes with various local prescription practices across regions, 134 but there were no statistical analyses to support or refute these qualitative observations.

Analytical studies tended to focus more on predictive modelling of future outbreaks and determining the impact of various changes within the healthcare setting, rather than describing an outbreak. They used a wide range of statistical modelling techniques, indicating a number of options for looking at spatiotemporal clustering. Interestingly, a number of the descriptive studies focused on identifying the source of an outbreak, and found that they were unable to do so conclusively. In contrast, GIS was shown to enable fast identification of possible sources during an outbreak, and enabled a targeted investigation that led to the source being discovered. This was possible using clinical data that are collected routinely, and required little additional data retrieval.

Thirteen studies (9%) conducted statistical analyses of temporal and spatial data (Table III) . All were undertaken in hospital settings, 85% (N ¼ 11) were published in 2000 or later, and 62% (N ¼ 8) focused on bacterial infections. The temporal studies (N ¼ 8) tended to be retrospective and employed time-series analysis (e.g. weekly aggregated measures plotted over time) to demonstrate if antibiotic prescription had an effect on the incidence of MRSA 135e137 and C. difficile, 138 or if control measures for multiple organisms reduced the incidence. 139 Without the incorporation of temporal analysis into these investigations, the impact of the interventions may have been masked by other factors, such as seasonality. Additionally, temporal analysis was used to examine ways to improve infection control measures, 140, 141 while Haley and Bregman used multi-variate statistical models to assess the temporal associations between infections and overcrowding, providing evidence that handwashing compliance is reduced markedly under these conditions. 142 Spatiotemporal studies (N ¼ 5) typically aimed to model infections retrospectively to investigate outbreaks and to detect clustering. 8, 143 By using modelling techniques, others were able to estimate the potential effect of interventions, beyond which descriptive studies could use the results to advocate their incorporation into standard control measures.

Statistical spatiotemporal analysis with molecular data Only 3% (N ¼ 5) of studies combined the use of molecular typing with spatial or temporal analyses (Table III) , which has the benefit of molecular differentiation and statistical evidence in confirming transmission. All of these studies were undertaken in 2005 or later, and analysed the retrospective distribution of bacteria while attempting to establish links between isolates.

The earliest study in this category compared the effectiveness of molecular typing with spatiotemporal analysis. 144 Polymerase chain reaction was used to characterize toxin genes in C. difficile isolates, which were mapped to a grid representing each ward, and analysed statistically for clustering by Knox test. This identified a single ward cluster compared with four clusters detected by molecular fingerprinting analysis, leading the investigators to conclude that the Knox test was less effective for identifying nosocomial transmission than molecular fingerprinting. However, most studies have shown that in order to gain the most from available data, spatiotemporal and molecular analyses should be used in combination.

The remaining studies evaluated potential transmission routes or attempted to gain a better understanding of outbreaks. Nuebel et al. applied whole-genome sequencing of MRSA in a neonatal intensive care unit 145 to compare accumulated sequence variation in the isolates, and used Bayesian skyline analysis to reveal epidemiological links between patients, healthcare workers and parents. They concluded that integration of epidemiological mapping and genomic data was necessary to understand MRSA transmission. Similarly, Gandhi et al. performed a retrospective study to investigate epidemiological links between extensively-drug-resistant tuberculosis patients in South Africa 146 by combining RFLP analysis and social network data to build transmission networks among genotypically similar patients. Their findings showed that the epidemic was highly clonal, and network analysis indicated transmission across a network with high levels of interconnectedness. de Celles et al. tried to estimate the variability in transmission between different multi-drug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii clonal groups 147 using data on carriage on a surgical ward. They identified three clonal complexes by performing molecular fingerprinting, and applied stochastic transmission models to estimate transmission rates for each complex. Results suggested that one of the clones had enhanced transmissibility compared with the other two clones, and further explained local epidemic dynamics. Finally, Kumar et al. 148 optimized cluster identification by organizing multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria isolates from admitted patients into co-resistance groups, and using schematics of the ward layouts in a Monte Carlo simulation. They concluded that this was 'a powerful way to quickly identify outbreaks', and early detection is critical with the decreasing number of effective treatment regimens available.

Spatiotemporal analysis using GIS GIS was used in only 3% (N ¼ 4) of studies identified in this review, demonstrating its limited uptake in the investigation of HCAIs (Table III) ; all of these studies were undertaken in 2000 or later. The studies were conducted hospital-wide, and all but one described a prospective application.

Kistemann et al. employed GIS for a retrospective investigation of a salmonella outbreak, 149 the source of which could not be identified by biological testing as food samples had been discarded. By mapping the distribution of cases across the hospital site and using analytical tools in GIS, the researchers identified that the sole link between cases was food delivery from a central kitchen. This led to an investigation of food production and the source was discovered. Kruger and Steffen 151 Kwan et al. incorporated GIS successfully in a wide range of hospital-based investigations. 12 Using GIS as the central repository for spatial and temporal data of infectious disease cases, the collected data were queried and analysed to identify disease clusters. The results were then communicated to the appropriate personnel, helping decision makers to target control efforts.

This review highlights numerous (N ¼ 146) studies focusing on spatiotemporal investigations of infectious diseases within healthcare settings; however, very few of these (N ¼ 22) used appropriate statistical methods to confirm transmission or clustering. This suggests that spatiotemporal data are regularly collected in healthcare settings to examine the potential for clustering, but confirmation using statistical analysis is infrequent, which introduces the risk of misinterpretation and hence development of less effective interventions and management of the problem. Of note, most of the published descriptive analyses were also retrospective, and in the absence of further statistical testing, provide little information for future prevention or prediction activities. Similarly, while half of all identified studies included molecular techniques for differentiating clusters, many of these were older techniques used to determine very large differences in bacteria, and are not conclusive. Only 7% of studies that included molecular data also used statistical analyses to provide more quantitative evidence of transmission clusters.

This review found that while the collection of spatiotemporal data has been integral to HCAI prevention activities for decades, the use of spatiotemporal statistical analysis is relatively new to the study of HCAIs in comparison with infectious diseases occurring within the community. 9 Most of the studies identified in this review used spatial and temporal information to provide a qualitative description of disease occurrence by time/space, and in contrast to those that employed more sophisticated analyses, were limited in the scope of their findings. Naturally, the ways in which spatial or temporal data are used within investigations of HCAIs varied greatly, and presentation depended upon the aim of each study. However, the large amount of data collected was often not used to its full potential, and opportunities to gain a more thorough understanding of the problem were missed.

The ability of descriptive studies to identify any significant influences of infectious disease dynamics is limited. Several studies discussed the significance of the geographical distribution of cases without undertaking any analyses, 48, 64, 68 which is a serious issue as sharing the same geographical space does not prove that transmission has occurred. 19 confounding factor (e.g. cohorting of high-risk patients). This highlights a missed opportunity to learn more about the spread of organisms within healthcare settings, and to develop more effective intervention strategies based upon transmission dynamics within that particular setting. 83 Maximizing data usage It is extremely important that hospitals are able to understand the local HCAI epidemiology to inform their routine practice, rather than generalizing evidence from other settings. A major stumbling block can be the perception that these analyses may involve active data collection; however, an abundance of existing datasets could be used. Examples of disparity in data usage are the studies by Kroker et al. and Mody et al., in which they attempted to identify potential clusters of C. difficile within their hospitals. 8, 62 Both studies were published in 2001 and used clinical patient notes and laboratory results for C. difficile toxin assays. Mody et al. defined a cluster arbitrarily as one or more cases occurring within 21 days of a previous case on the same nursing unit, and used this to identify temporal clusters within their dataset; however, they were unable to suggest potential factors related to the observed pattern. Kroker et al. employed the Knox test to identify timeespace clusters, which highlighted hospital geography and traffic between wards as significant factors, and enabled them to adapt their infection control procedures.

Incorporation of molecular data into investigations can have a profound impact on the effectiveness of any outbreak response. Recent advances in molecular biology, such as rapid benchtop sequencing, have led to a revolution in the detail that can be gained from clinical samples. 88 While many hospitals only perform basic identification of micro-organisms due to the resources available, this data, when available, can be useful to enhance current investigations. A study by Adams et al. in 1981 investigated nosocomial infections on a paediatric intensive care unit, and was able to distinguish that there had been two separate outbreaks involving separate strains of herpes simplex virus type 1. 76 The initial investigation, which had not included molecular data, concluded that all cases belonged to a single outbreak, and thus limited the impact of their initial control measures.

Molecular data can be invaluable in ruling out a link between cases; however, as emphasized in the study by Helweg-Larsen et al., clusters of infections can occur for many reasons and are often caused by factors other than nosocomial spread. 7 Therefore, incorporation of true temporal or spatial analysis, to eliminate similarity of micro-organisms by chance, alongside molecular techniques could lead to a better understanding of the true transmission dynamics, as inappropriate assumptions are often made about clustering when based solely on molecular data.

Prior to 2000, only two studies were identified that had performed spatial or temporal analysis; in the last decade, this number has increased to 11. This may be due, in part, to the development of novel statistical methods and further advancement of user-friendly statistical and GIS software; however, the majority of the statistical methods in these studies have been widely employed in other fields since before the 1980s. The increased use of electronic databases in hospitals for storage of medical information has created a rich source of epidemiologically and clinically relevant information, allowing more detailed analyses to be performed.

The major aim of this review was to identify how spatiotemporal analyses have been used previously, and to suggest how they can be employed to benefit practices within healthcare settings. The Knox test is a simple analysis that can be used to identify clustering, and methods using outbreak thresholds are common within infection control reporting. However, the ideal situation is to design control programmes based upon the dynamics and processes observed within the local institution.

As randomized controlled trials can be difficult or costly to undertake in clinical settings, some authors have employed predictive modelling techniques to build their own evidence base. For example, Rushton et al. used a statistical approach to investigate clustering and patterns of spread of a number of organisms within an intensive treatment unit. 143 They obtained data from pre-existing datasets including numbers of infected patients, admission details, duration of stay and bed movement, whilst they estimated some additional variables from evaluating nurseepatient contacts. They identified variation in the degree of clustering of different organisms, and tested the impact of potential control interventions in the model. The findings suggest that bed movement and staffepatient contacts have to be controlled, and control strategies may need to be organism-specific.

Spatiotemporal analysis can distil a much greater amount of relevant information from data collected on HCAIs than purely descriptive studies. Analysis is key to furthering understanding of the epidemiology and dynamics of transmission of these organisms. The underuse of spatial and temporal data may be due to the primary focus of studies on retrospective actions in response to an outbreak, and this 'fire-fighting' approach may be propagated by institutional goals. However, new sophisticated techniques allow for greater adaptability to the current challenges in health care, including increased cohorting of atrisk patients, spread of resistance and the corresponding decrease in the number of available effective antimicrobials. A focused approach on development of understanding of HCAI epidemiology is likely to lead to identification of significant risk factors and better prevention.

Molecular typing technology is quickly moving from research to clinical settings, and it is becoming more common for detailed molecular analyses to be undertaken to investigate nosocomial infections. From this review, it is clear that the uptake of statistical analyses is the limiting step in moving towards modern sophisticated analyses of HCAIs. Few healthcare workers have the training to develop statistical models or perform in-depth analyses, and this is where collaboration with academic institutions can be exploited to improve the understanding of local disease dynamics without massively increasing the costs to hospitals. These collaborations would provide rich datasets for researchers to use, while enabling clinicians to employ cutting-edge methodologies that will inform their routine practice.

One possible intermediary step would be to further the use of GIS for HCAI investigations, as it enables a wide range of analyses to be undertaken within one piece of software in which staff could be trained. Whilst the initial implementation may be time and cost intensive, 149 the benefits are clear from the few studies identified in this review. The combination of HCAI datasets from numerous sources in one system and subsequent visualization can enable healthcare workers to incorporate up-to-date infection data into their clinical practice. As hospitals move to combine databases and increase the level of electronic recording, this presents an ideal time to incorporate GIS into these systems and create a fully-integrated hospital information system.

With movement of patients between care structures, differentiation between infection control in primary and secondary care is becoming more difficult. The small number (N ¼ 7, 5%) of studies based within nursing homes in this review suggests that less attention has been given to care units outside of hospitals. However, these could act as reservoirs of infections, and regular re-admission of their residents could lead to further hospital transmission. In addition to providing an analytical toolkit for spatial clustering, GIS could improve the understanding of this relationship by enabling healthcare providers to consider the impact of their local community.

The future potential applications in healthcare settings are ever expanding as more sophisticated molecular, statistical and computational techniques become increasingly commonplace. Publication of analytical studies on HCAI in major clinical journals rather than specialized niche journals, as observed in this review, could increase awareness of these techniques and widen their use.

In structuring the search strategy for the review, the authors endeavoured to ensure the inclusion of studies from as broad a range as possible. However, due to the great variation in the terminology used across the numerous clinical and scientific fields, it is possible that a few studies were missed. Further, the heterogeneity within the evidence base precluded metaanalysis of the findings. Finally, publication bias cannot be fully avoided in a review.

To truly understand and stem the growing problem of HCAIs worldwide, a multi-disciplinary approach is required. This is dependent on the skills and technology available to those investigating the problem, and is likely to require collaboration between experts. This review suggests that greater integration of spatiotemporal techniques into HCAI investigations could prove invaluable in highlighting previously unobserved patterns of infections, and maximizing the understanding of disease dynamics. Given that infections within a small contained area, such as a hospital, have greater potential for misclassification of clustering, it is necessary to use both molecular techniques and the appropriate spatiotemporal statistical techniques to maximize the accuracy of the study findings. Given the expanding technology of information systems (e.g. electronic medical databases), advancement in molecular and statistical techniques, development of analytical platforms that enable greater access to non-experts and increased interdisciplinary collaboration, the potential for using pre-existing data to prevent future avoidable infections and improve patient safety can become a reality.

Determining the dynamics of influenza transmission by age,"Background: It is widely accepted that influenza transmission dynamics vary by age; however methods to quantify the reproductive number by age group are limited. We introduce a simple method to estimate the reproductive number by modifying the method originally proposed by Wallinga and Teunis and using existing information on contact patterns between age groups. We additionally perform a sensitivity analysis to determine the potential impact of differential healthcare seeking patterns by age. We illustrate this method using data from the 2009 H1N1 Influenza pandemic in Gauteng Province, South Africa.","The importance of the dynamics of influenza transmission between age groups is well-appreciated [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] . Several studies have assessed the non-uniformity of the impact of influenza, particularly pandemic influenza, on different age groups [1] [2] [3] [4] [7] [8] [9] . The overarching interest in these studies is to gather information in order to influence policy to best determine a strategy to impact on the spread of outbreaks. Which age groups carry the greatest disease burden and which groups are responsible for the greatest amount of disease transmission is an important component of this information.

One key aspect of this work is to estimate the extent to which people in different age groups interact with one another and to what degree they are in contact. This information can then be used as a surrogate for transmission probabilities between age groups [10] [11] [12] . Several studies have generated matrices with estimated numbers of contacts between various age groups [5, 12, 13] . Additionally, social network models have been used to estimate these contact patterns [7] . A common finding amongst these studies is that children tend to mix mostly with each other, and to a lesser extent with their parents, while adults mix with individuals from a larger range of ages [5, 7] . These matrices have subsequently been used in modeling exercises to better understand the dynamics of disease spread by age.

When determining which groups to target for interventions in an outbreak, one strategy is to target those who potentially carry the greatest burden of disease [14] , which has typically been found to be children [1, 5, 7, 8, 13] . For instance, Bansel et al. [4] consider data from influenza pandemics over the past century and show that the burden of disease is highest amongst children during a pandemic and then shifts to adults the following season.

To better understand the utility of targeting the groups with the greatest burden of disease, it is also important to determine when different age groups tend to have their peak incidence of cases. This can also be seen as a surrogate measure for the age group that is driving an outbreak [15] [16] [17] . Most recently Schanzer et al. [16] used 10 years of Canadian surveillance data of laboratory confirmed cases of influenza and found that during seasonal influenza the 10-19 and 20-29 year-old age groups tended to peak one week earlier than other groups. During the pandemic in 2009, the peak came earliest for only the 10-19 year old age group. This is inconsistent with the findings of Brownstein et al. [15] who found that children aged 3-4 were consistently the first to peak.

A different tactic for determining which groups should be the target of interventions is to select those groups most responsible for transmission [18] . Studies examining disease transmission by age have consistently shown that children have higher estimated values of the reproductive number than adults. Recent work has focused on the dynamics during the 2009 Influenza pandemic. During the initial phase of the pandemic in Japan, Nishiura et al. [19] report that children were transmitting illness at higher rates than adults. Glass et al. [2] used Japanese data and a novel method to estimate the reproductive number, R 0 , for adults and children that assume particular forms for a nextgeneration matrix and estimate the parameters of this matrix, leading to outbreak specific estimates of R 0 . They estimate R 0 to be between 2.8 and 3.6 for children and between 0.2 and 0.7 for adults, depending on the assumptions made. In a later study, Glass et al. [3] used serosurvey data and estimate R 0 from the final size of the epidemic to be 1.6 for kids and less than 1 for adults. Wallinga et al. [18] have similarly shown that the rate in change of the reproductive number for a particular group is related to the incidence of infection and force of infection and suggest allocating resources based on examining these two quantities.

In the present study, we present a new approach to estimating the reproductive number by age group by modifying a method initially proposed by Wallinga and Tuenis [20] . We study age dynamics in South Africa during the 2009 Influenza H1N1 pandemic and illustrate the importance of an appropriately estimated measure of the transmission dynamics on final estimates. Finally, we discuss our results and their implications for future studies on how to respond during an emerging outbreak.

We use de-identified data previously reported in [21] that includes a line list of the 12,543 confirmed cases reported in South Africa during that outbreak. Included in the data are the ages of the individuals, the provinces where the specimens were collected, the sex of the individuals, the dates of onset of symptoms, and the dates of the reporting of specimens. The information on the date of symptom onset was reported for 758 cases (6%). We use multiple imputation techniques to create 500 different datasets with the missing onset times imputed, as predicted by the province and an indicator of whether the specimen was collected on a weekday or weekend, using Poisson regression [22] . We report the averages and ranges over the 500 imputed datasets. Contact tracing information was collected on 100 initial cases, to provide an estimate of the serial interval, as has been previously reported [21] . We only use data from Gauteng province (n = 5579, 44% of cases) to avoid confounding the results with potential spatial variation in transmission. Gauteng province is the most populous, yet smallest geographically, of the nine provinces in South Africa, with over 10 million inhabitants, predominantly in the cities of Johannesburg and Pretoria.

Wallinga and Teunis [20] (denoted WT method hereafter) proposed a method for the estimation of the effective reproductive number by making use of the epidemic curve, N = {N 1 ,…, N T }, where N t is the number of cases at time point t, and an estimate of the serial interval, p 1 ,…, p k , where p i describes the probability of a serial interval of length i and the maximum serial interval length is k. We review this method in Appendix 1. The estimator they obtain for the effective reproductive number for individual j on day t' is

where n s denotes the number with symptom onset on day s and q s,t denotes the relative probability that case s was infected by case t.

We propose the use of additional structure in this method to describe the probability of an infection event occurring between two cases that incorporates information on their ages by modifying the probability of transmission to be:

where a j is the age group of individual j and w a i 0 a j is a measure of the likelihood of transmission between individuals in age group a i and a j . The matrix W = { w a i a j } does not necessarily have to be symmetric. This method requires information on the likelihood of infectious contact between different age groups, or the w a i a j . Increasingly studies are being conducted to obtain such information by assuming that transmission is directly related to contact patterns. We use the results of two such studies:

The first is a study of 571 randomly selected individuals in a South Africa township performed in 2010 and reported by Johnstone-Robertson et al. [12] . The authors report two matrices with age specific contact patterns in five year intervals up to a 45+ category. The first matrix only considers contacts that involve all close contacts while the second includes information on only those contacts that involve physical touch.

The second set of matrices we use comes from the European based PolyMod study of Mossong et al. [5] .

This study includes information on 97,904 contacts amongst 7,290 participants from eight countries in Europe: Belgium, Finland, Great Britain, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and Poland. Contact matrices describe all close contacts, and then separately, close contacts that involve physical touch. The matrices report age-specific values for five year age groups up to 70+. We modify these matrices to match those presented by Johnstone-Robertson et al. [12] and to match the demographics of South Africa's young population by averaging all values above 45 years of age to create a single 45+ age category. In our results we focus on those obtained using the contact matrices from South Africa, as these matrices would seem more appropriate for the data at hand. We report results from the PolyMod matrices as a sensitivity analysis.

We estimate R t and R 0 using the 18 matrices described above with the imputed epidemic data from South Africa, and report age specific estimates of these quantities, as well as aggregate estimates across age groups. The reproductive numbers for each age group represent the expected number of infections generated across the population by an individual in that particular age group.

In the Appendices, we further report the results of two sensitivity analyses: First we test the sensitivity of the results to potential errors in the reporting dates by selecting a single imputed dataset and randomly jittering the onset dates of 10% of the individuals, within 30 days of their observed (or imputed) onset date (Appendix 2). We create 50 such datasets and repeat all analyses on these datasets and compare these results to those obtained without jittering the data. The second sensitivity analysis tests the impact of differential healthcare seeking behaviors by age. We smooth the distribution of the proportion of cases that were hospitalized by age group to serve as a surrogate distribution of healthcare seeking behavior and/or reporting patterns by age. This distribution is U-shaped, indicating that the very young and very old are more likely to seek medical care, a finding that has been reported elsewhere [23] . We attach various weights to this distribution and augment 25 of our imputed datasets according to this distribution. We reanalyze this augmented data to determine the potential impact of differential case reporting by age group on the results (Appendix 3). Figure 1 provides the epidemic curves across all age groups. Here, school age children and young adults tend to have the greatest number of cases initially in the outbreak. TheR t estimates are similar regardless of the type of contact matrix assumed (close contact versus those involving physical contact). Overall,R t is much higher for those in the 15-19 and 20-24 year old groups throughout much of the epidemic, with the 10-14 and 25-29 year old age groups rapidly achieving high values, as well. Those over 45 initially have fairly high estimates ofR t but these taper off quickly. Estimates ofR t are not obtainable for those between 5 and 9 and those less than 5 until the outbreak is well under way, due to the paucity of observed cases for those age groups early on in the epidemic.

We obtain estimates of R 0 , the basic reproductive number, by averaging the estimates of R t during the epidemic period. In reality this can be viewed as a pseudo-R 0 given the prior immunity to this strain of influenza. We will refer to it as R 0 throughout the text. We assume that the epidemic period corresponds to the point at which transmission was sustained in Gauteng Province until the overall number of cases peaked. This corresponds to the period between 22 June 2009 and 21 August 2009. Figure 3 and Table 1 show the estimates of R 0 across age groups along with the number of individuals in each age group who were reported infected throughout the epidemic. Regardless of the choice of matrix, supercritical values of R 0 are obtained for those between the age of 5 and 24, with the highest values being observed for those in the 10-14 age-group (R 0 = 1.53 for close contacts).

We contrast these estimates with those obtained using contact matrices from Europe [5] . Figures 3a and 3b shows the estimates of R 0 across the 10 age groups obtained when using contact patterns from South Africa and the eight European countries in the PolyMod study for all close contacts (Figure 3a ) and all contacts involving physical touch (Figure 3b ). There are few notable differences between the estimates. In Figure 4 , the mean estimates of R 0 are shown for each age group. We observe a similar overall trend for the estimate of R 0 across the age groups.

Finally we provide the overall estimate of R 0 collapsed over all age groups ( Table 2) . For comparison purposes, we first estimate R 0 by using a traditional analysis that assumes homogenous mixing among the age groups (R 0 =1.28, range: 1.26-1.31). This is similar to that obtained for all the other contact matrices considered. Additionally there are virtually no differences observed between results from the two contact matrices.

Our first sensitivity analysis, which jitters the onset dates of a subset of the population, (Additional file 1: Table S1 ) provides results that are consistent with the results presented. Not surprisingly, the impact of reassigning onset dates to a portion of the dataset has the impact of flattening the epidemic curve and thus lowering the estimates of R 0 . However the results remain consistent and, coupled with the imputation variability reported, provide insight on the overall variability of the estimates reported.

In our second sensitivity analysis (Additional file 2: Table S2 and Additional file 3: Figure S1 ), examining the potential impact of differential reporting by age, we note a Page 5 of 10 http://www.ete-online.com/content/11/1/4 dramatic impact on the results. As we assume a greater underreporting of cases among those who are middle aged, we estimate the bulk of transmission being attributable to those who are older and less transmission being attributed to the very young, a finding contrary to the original results we present.

We present a novel approach to estimating the effective and basic reproductive number by age group, and have applied this method to data from the 2009 Influenza H1N1pdm in Gauteng Province in South Africa. This method requires some estimate of contact patterns between age groups. We show results for 18 different possible contact matrices and the impact that these matrices have on the estimates. Additionally, as with the original method proposed by Wallinga and Teunis [20] , it is necessary to have an estimate of the serial interval and we use an estimate obtained from contact trace data in South Africa.

As has been previously noted, that the burden of disease appears to be greatest amongst the young [21] , a finding consistent with other studies [1, 4, 7] . These data argue that aiming interventions at youth would target the group that carries the largest burden and should have the best chance of success in limiting transmission. This finding is consistent with the strategy proposed by Wallinga et al. [18] and provides further information in the form of actual estimates of the reproductive number.

Our results also illustrate the importance of accounting for the age structure when estimating reproduction numbers. Though the overall estimates of R 0 are unaffected by the incorporation of this information, we obtain much richer information with the ability to obtain age-specific estimates of the reproductive number. This analysis provides greater insight into the dynamics of disease transmission and informs intervention strategies.

The results obtained using information on transmission dynamics from the study based in South Africa [12] as well as that of the PolyMod study [5] , appear to corroborate previous results for influenza pandemics [2, 3, 19] which seem to imply that school aged children are responsible for the bulk of disease transmission. Specifically we estimate thatR 0 is highest for 10-14 year olds when using South African contact trace matrices (close contacts:R 0 = 1.53, range, 1.49-1.58; physical touch contacts:R 0 = 1.47, range, 1.44-1.51). These results are similar to the results from other studies [2, 19] and those obtained using the European based contact matrices.

Interestingly, it does not appear to make a substantial difference which contact pattern matrix we use in our analysis. One would assume that the matrices obtained in South Africa would be most relevant to the outbreak data we are analyzing and indeed, we have chosen to present the majority of our results using these matrices. We note, however, that when we use contact patterns from other European countries, where the demographics, climate, healthcare system, government, overall health, etc. are different from that of South Africa, there are only minor changes in the results. Indeed, the contact patterns observed in the Polymod study and the South African contact study are not substantially different, however they are not identical. This appears to argue that using some form of adjustment is superior to assuming homogenous mixing, but the method we propose is not overly sensitive to the form the adjustments take [24] . This result is similar to that of Glass et al. [2] who experimented with four forms of next generation matrices to estimate the reproductive number for adults and children separately. They found that the estimates of the reproductive numbers were not overly sensitive to the matrix forms that they assumed.

However, one should still take care in the assumptions used when implementing this method, or others like it. Our study is only one instance and it is not clear that the results we obtain would replicate in other settings. For instance, if one were to always use the Polymod study information for studies throughout the world, there is still the potential for errors if contact patterns do differ dramatically from those observed in Europe. While it is impossible to know with certainty if this is the case without detailed contact pattern information for the area of study, one can, at the least conduct a sensitivity analysis to determine the potential impact of the contact matrix on the analysis. Additionally we implicitly assume that contact patterns are directly related to transmission probabilities, an assumption that has yet to be rigorously tested. There is also work to show that contact patterns can change considerably during illness [25, 26] . Our work relies on the contact patterns of healthy individuals. While we suspect, based on our sensitivity analyses, that this will not have a substantial impact on our results, this is important to note.

It is important to note the caveats and limitations of this study. Our results would be impacted if reporting was inconsistent throughout the outbreak among the age groups. For instance if reporting was very good among one age group initially but declined in quality as the outbreak progressed, we can expect that our results would be biased [27] . In general the default assumption is that the pyramid of disease reporting described in [28, 29] is the same for all age groups. Our second sensitivity analysis (Appendix 3) explores the impact of this assumption and shows that if reporting or healthcare seeking behavior is much lower among middle aged groups than the very old and very young, our results will change dramatically. In the extreme case, we see that transmission is mostly attributable to those who are at least 30 years old and that the very young are unable to sustain transmission. While this result is contrary to what has been reported in the scientific literature to date, the potential for reporting inconsistencies that we explore are not unlikely, and have not been recognized and corrected for in other analyses that we are aware of. Brooks-Pollock et al. [23] report results from a survey conducted during the 2009 H1N1 Influenza pandemic in the UK that showed that the very young and very old were more likely to seek healthcare when ill. The impact of correcting surveillance data to accommodate this phenomenon was to shift the burden of illness from the very young to the middle-aged. Further investigation into potential reporting inconsistencies is important to better understand infectious disease dynamics by age similar to what was previously done but not incorporating age [27] . Another reporting issue arises from silent infections, or those who carry infection and have the potential to transmit it, but are asymptomatic. We did not investigate the impact of these individuals, though the issues are similar to those we have just described.

Additional reporting inconsistencies are possible spatially or across other socio-economic factors. Our analysis was only performed on data from Gauteng province, the most urban province in South Africa. It is possible that reporting would not be as dramatically variable as it would be if we were to make use of data from the entire country. It is also important to note that we chose to limit our analysis to Gauteng province so as to limit the impact of spatial effects and make the assumption of homogenous mixing more reasonable. This could limit generalizability.

We have also assumed that the contact matrices we use are correct and do not allow for any uncertainty in their estimation. These results might be improved upon and made more realistic by allowing for greater stochastic effects and/or flexibility in the transmission matrix. Ideally we would estimate these parameters in our study, but we do not have sufficient data to do so in the present framework. Glass et al. [2] have shown how to do this for a matrix with adults and children, but are limited to two by two matrices that presume a pre-specified structure and are unable to consider a larger number of age groups, thus limiting their ability to gain a more thorough and detailed understanding of transmission.

We have applied a novel method to estimate transmission patterns between individuals from different age groups during the 2009 Influenza H1N1pdm in South Africa. We show that assumptions regarding the assumed contact patterns between age groups do not substantially impact the conclusions one draws from the data analyses in our study. Our results are consistent with other studies that show children are much more likely to become ill and transmit disease than adults during a pandemic, if the completeness of the data reported is independent of the age of the patients. These methods can be used to estimate heterogeneity in transmission parameters in real time by using the modification proposed by Cauchemez et al. [30] and thus inform the use of targeted interventions by age group.

Wallinga and Teunis (20) (denoted WT method hereafter) proposed a method for the estimation of the effective reproductive number by making use of the epidemic curve, N = {N 1 ,…, N T }, where N t is the number of cases at time point t, and an estimate of the serial interval, p 1 ,…, p k , where p i describes the probability of a serial interval of length i and the maximum serial interval length is k. For ease of presentation, we assume that the time step is a day. Individuals are placed in a network temporally by symptom onset date and the probability of transmission occurring between two individuals in the network is determined by the serial interval. The calculation of R t occurs in three steps. In what follows, we let t i denote the i th individual with symptom onset on day t, where i = 1,…,N t .

1. For the i th individual with symptom onset on day t, calculate the probabilities of infection by all those with symptom onset on prior days t 2 (t2 < t.) These probabilities equal the serial interval probability for the distance in time between the potential infector, t j 2 , and infectee, t i , P (t j ' →t i ) = p t i −t 0 j .

Calculate the relative probability that the case t i was infected by the j th case on day P (t j ' →t i ), denoted by q t i ;t j 0 , q t i ;t j 0 ¼ where n s denotes the number with symptom onset on day s.

Sensitivity analysis: Impact of errors in reporting dates

In this analysis, we choose a single imputed dataset and randomly jitter the onset dates of 10% of the sample within 30 days of their observed (or imputed) onset date.

Pathogen Transmission and Clinic Scheduling,"probability of transmission from environment to caregiver; Pce, probability of transmission from caregiver to environment.; Ppe, probability of transmission from patient to environment; Pep, probability of transmission from environment to patient.","We developed a model of pathogen dissemination in the outpatient clinic that incorporates key kinetic aspects of the transmission process, as well as uncertainty regarding whether or not each incident patient is contagious. Assigning appointments late in the day to patients suspected of being infectious should decrease pathogen dissemination. P athogen dissemination within hospitals has been extensively analyzed (1) . However, it has been the subject of far fewer investigations within the outpatient clinic. We developed a model of pathogen dissemination in the outpatient clinic and explored the anticipated effects of a system-based intervention (temporal segregation of suspected infectious and noninfectious patients) and an individualbased intervention (increased compliance with hand hygiene) on the risk that an uncontaminated patient will become contaminated during a clinic visit. An annotated copy of the model, as well as more detailed simulations and supporting material, may be obtained from the corresponding author.

We treat pathogen dissemination as a stochastic (chance-based) sequence of discrete encounters between incident patients (P) who are either infectious or noninfectious, a caregiver (C), and the environment (fomites, such as surfaces or waiting room magazines, [E]), each of which can be contaminated or uncontaminated. Four classes of encounter exist: 1) caregiver-patient, 2) caregiver-environment, 3) patient-environment, and 4) patient-patient. For each class of encounter, a user specifies a probability that a contaminated or infectious participant can transmit the pathogen to an uncontaminated participant (caregiver, environment [fomites], and surrounding patients). A contaminated caregiver can, in turn, contaminate subsequent patients ( Figure 1 ). The contamination probabilities are not predicated on a specific mode of transmission but represent the gross probability that a contaminated or infectious participant will contaminate an uncontaminated participant during an encounter. With the exception of patient-topatient transmission (see below) the contamination probabilities can be asymmetrical. Asymmetrical contamination probabilities allow consideration of droplet transmission; e.g., an infectious patient could cough on a caregiver, who then transfers the pathogen from his or her hands to the next patient.

An infectious patient can also contaminate the 4 patients surrounding him or her in the clinic queue (2 preceding and 2 following patients). The model does not incorporate patient-patient transmission by contaminated patients, given the relatively low frequency of intimate patient-to-patient physical contact in the clinic.

If contaminated, the caregiver may be decontaminated, e.g., by hand hygiene or pathogen attrition, with a specified probability after each patient visit. Similarly, a specified probability exists that the environment, if contaminated, will be decontaminated between visits. These 2 decontamination processes (for the caregiver and the environment) are independent. Both the caregiver and the environment can be recontaminated after decontamination. The contamination probabilities for transmission from a contaminated environment to a patient or the caregiver are fixed (i.e., not a function of the number of preceding infectious persons).

The model generates a random number for each class of encounter between potentially contaminated or infectious and uncontaminated participants during each clinic appointment slot. If this random number is less than the contamination probability specific to the class of interaction being considered, the uncontaminated member becomes contaminated during the encounter.

The user specifies the population prevalence of the pathogen. A screening instrument for classifying patients as high or low risk for being infectious is assumed to exist. We assume that the screening instrument can be applied before the patient's clinic visit (at the time of appointment scheduling). The screening instrument could comprise a symptom inventory, knowledge of recent travel, household exposure, membership in a known high-risk group, or a combination of these or other elements. Such screening instruments exist for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant enterococci, and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) (2) (3) (4) (5) . The postulated instrument has a defined sensitivity and specificity; values that can be combined with the population prevalence of infectious patients to determine how many patients deemed at high risk or low risk are actually contagious.

Incident patients are assigned to appointment times following 1 of 2 protocols. In the baseline protocol, patients are randomly assigned appointments without regard to their risk status. In the segregated protocol, patients at high risk are assigned to appointments at the end of the clinic day ( Figure 1 ). Clinics that segregate high-risk patients to later appointments might also adopt more stringent infection control strategies during the portion of the day populated by high-risk patients. Accordingly, the user can specify values for each contamination probability that differ between low-risk (early in the day) and high-risk (late in the day) clinic slots.

We modeled 1 day in a clinic in which 20 patients are seen by 1 caregiver. The model predicts the likelihood (risk) that a previously uncontaminated patient will become contaminated during his or her clinic visit. The model also predicts the risk that a patient who is classified as high-risk based on the screening instrument, but who is not infectious, will be contaminated in the segregated configuration. Figure 2 illustrates the effect of temporally segregating patients deemed to be at high risk of being infectious to clinic appointments late in the clinic schedule (panel A) and the consequences of changes in caregiver hand-hygiene compliance (panel B). Relevant pathogen-contamination probabilities were arbitrarily fixed at 20%, a level that is reasonable, and possibly conservative, for a wide range of pathogens (Table 1) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) . Temporal segregation substantially decreases the risk for pathogen dissemination, an effect that is at least comparable in magnitude to that arising from changes in the likelihood of effective hand hygiene within the clinically relevant range (15) . Table 2 addresses the ethical concern of the increase in contamination risk faced by noninfectious incident patients who are classified as high risk, using the same system inputs shown in Figure 2 . The absolute risk for Risk that an uncontaminated patient will become contaminated during his or her clinic visit as a function of pathogen prevalence in incident patients and clinic infection-control practices. A) Predicted effects of temporally segregating patients at high risk of being infectious to appointments at the end of the clinic day, using a screening instrument that is either 70% sensitive and specific or 90% sensitive and specific. Transmission, hand hygiene, and environmental decontamination probabilities are as given in Table 1 . B) Effects of varying levels of effective caregiver hand hygiene (25%, 50%, or 75%) on pathogen dissemination. All other inputs (probabilities of contamination) are identical to those in A. Each data point represents the mean of 2,000 simulations of a model day. An annotated copy of the model, as well as more detailed simulations and supporting material, may be obtained from the corresponding author.

contamination faced by noninfectious but high-risk patients increases at all levels of prevalence and screening tool sensitivity and specificity; however, this increase does not exceed 6% (in the setting of a completely ineffective screening tool). More extensive analysis demonstrates that selectively deploying more aggressive infection-control practices to slots designated as high risk can lower the risk faced by noninfectious but nominally high-risk patients to below its value in the unsegregated configuration. These data are available from the corresponding author.

The results do not address direct patient-to-patient pathogen transmission; such transmission does not change the qualitative predictions of the model. The model does not incorporate either the potential for the environmental pathogen load to increase over time or differences in host susceptibility. The potential for cross-transmission of additional pathogens that have a higher prevalence in the highrisk group is also not addressed. For example, a population of patients deemed at high risk of having influenza or SARS might also have a higher prevalence of other transmissible pathogens, such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis.

Improved hand hygiene, barrier precautions, patient use of hand sanitizers or facemasks, and avoidance of environmental fomites can each diminish dissemination risk. However, these measures depend on individual behavior, rendering them susceptible to implementation failure. Temporal segregation adds a system-based layer of protection to such behavior-based interventions, providing an additional barrier to pathogen dissemination that is not critically dependent on individual compliance. When additional data addressing pathogen transmission within the clinic become available (currently such data are sparse), mathematical models could help guide the allocation of resources required to support system-based infection-control measures. Moreover, numerical experimentation could help inform the design of infection-control strategies for pathogens that have transmission dynamics that are not yet well characterized.

Transmission or Within-Host Dynamics Driving Pulses of Zoonotic Viruses in Reservoir-Host Populations,"Progress in combatting zoonoses that emerge from wildlife is often constrained by limited knowledge of the biology of pathogens within reservoir hosts. We focus on the host-pathogen dynamics of four emerging viruses associated with bats: Hendra, Nipah, Ebola, and Marburg viruses. Spillover of bat infections to humans and domestic animals often coincides with pulses of viral excretion within bat populations, but the mechanisms driving such pulses are unclear. Three hypotheses dominate current research on these emerging bat infections. First, pulses of viral excretion could reflect seasonal epidemic cycles driven by natural variations in population densities and contact rates among hosts. If lifelong immunity follows recovery, viruses may disappear locally but persist globally through migration; in either case, new outbreaks occur once births replenish the susceptible pool. Second, epidemic cycles could be the result of waning immunity within bats, allowing local circulation of viruses through oscillating herd immunity. Third, pulses could be generated by episodic shedding from persistently infected bats through a combination of physiological and ecological factors. The three scenarios can yield similar patterns in epidemiological surveys, but strategies to predict or manage spillover risk resulting from each scenario will be different. We outline an agenda for research on viruses emerging from bats that would allow for differentiation among the scenarios and inform development of evidence-based interventions to limit threats to human and animal health. These concepts and methods are applicable to a wide range of pathogens that affect humans, domestic animals, and wildlife.","Long identified as potential sources of zoonotic pathogens [1, 2] , bats (Order Chiroptera) are now associated with several deadly emerging infectious viruses, including Hendra, Nipah, Marburg, Ebola, and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS CoV). Although spillover from bats to humans or domestic animals remains rare, the case fatality rate from these diseases is high, and onward transmission can occur. Public health preparedness would benefit from understanding bat virus dynamics to allow predictions of viral spillover in space and time.

Spillover of bat viruses is often associated with discrete temporal and spatial pulses of virus excretion from the bats that function as reservoir hosts [3] [4] [5] [6] . Outbreaks in livestock or humans occur seasonally with high annual variability. For example, spillover of Hendra virus in Australia, Nipah virus in Bangladesh, Marburg virus in Uganda, and Ebola virus in Central Africa is seasonal, but incidence and location of spillover infections vary among years [5] [6] [7] [8] .

Longitudinal surveys of bat colonies also have detected seasonal variation in the prevalence or seroprevalence of zoonotic viruses, including Nipah virus in Pteropus lylei in Thailand, Hendra virus in Pteropus sp. in Australia, and Marburg virus in Rousettus aegyptiacus in Uganda [6, [9] [10] [11] [12] .

Markedly different underlying mechanisms can yield similar spatial and temporal patterns in prevalence and seroprevalence data. We outline three distinct scenarios that could generate pulses of viral excretion in bats (Figs 1 and 2) . Although the scenarios fall along a continuum, each one leads to a different set of hypotheses that can be tested in the field or laboratory. Within-and between-host processes drive the first and second scenarios: pulses of transmission among bats with clearance of infection and either long-term ( Fig 1A) or waning immunity ( Fig 1B) . Within-host processes drive the third scenario, with pulses triggered by viral reactivation in persistently infected bats (Fig 1C) . A common driver among the three scenarios is seasonal forcing, which occurs through birth pulses, seasonal transmission, waning maternal immunity in young, and periods of environmental or physiological stress (Fig 2) . Research efforts often reflect the working hypothesis that pulses are driven by between-host transmission or that pulses are driven by within-host processes of reactivation, but often without using data collection methods that would allow them to be distinguished [5, [13] [14] [15] [16] . In reality, the evidence for either hypothesis has not been fully assessed for the emerging viruses discussed here.

Even though the different scenarios can lead to similar observed dynamics, strategies to predict or manage spillover risk will be different for the different underlying mechanisms (and mechanisms would be expected to vary between virus types). Strategies that confront dynamics driven by transmission between hosts are likely to focus on population density, connectivity among populations, or herd immunity [17] . By contrast, strategies to address dynamics driven by within-host reactivation are likely to target pathogen biology or processes that produce stress [18] .

As part of the international focus on surveillance of zoonoses and bat-borne viruses such as Ebola virus, understanding the dynamics of pathogens within animal reservoir hosts should be a research priority [19, 20] . However, research on wildlife diseases often focuses on cross-sectional surveillance methods within a limited geographic area and does not capture information that would allow inference to spatial and temporal dynamics. Many studies do not examine the drivers of disease dynamics and therefore cannot draw predictive inferences about the occurrence of zoonotic spillover. Identifying the drivers of bats' excretion of virus would allow prediction of locations and times when the likelihood of spillover is high, potentially leading to better management or even prevention of spillover.

Here, we establish a framework to assess the evidence for the different mechanisms that could drive the observed epidemiological patterns of emerging bat viruses. We highlight the strengths and limitations of potential investigation methods and recommend ways to distinguish between scenarios, which require ambitious, interdisciplinary research (Table 1) . We explain some distinct challenges associated with pathogen studies in bats. Although rabies is an important zoonosis of bat origin, we restrict discussion to the less well-understood emerging bat pathogens. Our concepts are transferable to numerous diseases that affect wildlife, domestic animals, and humans. Drivers of disease dynamics within hosts, and within populations, given persistent infections with latency and reactivation (SILI dynamics) or immunizing infections with or without waning immunity (SIR or SIRS dynamics). A common factor among scenarios is seasonal forcing, which occurs through birth pulses, seasonal transmission, or periods of environmental or physiological stress. These factors affect SILI dynamics through reactivation and SIR or SIRS dynamics through transmission.

Three hurdles have constrained understanding of within-host dynamics of emerging viruses in bats. First, although serological assays often indicate high levels of exposure in bat populations, few studies have isolated the corresponding live virus. For example, Ebola virus [21] and African henipaviruses [22, 23] have not yet been isolated from bats despite serological evidence and molecular detection across the range of many African species. Additionally, a SARS-like coronavirus was only recently isolated from bats, nearly a decade after the SARS pandemic [24] . Second, experimental infections may be unsuccessful at reproducing natural infections in bats. For example, after Hendra virus and Nipah virus were isolated, amplified, and experimentally inoculated into bats, viral excretion was rarely detected [25, 26] , although interpretations were hampered because lifetime infection histories of wild caught bats were unknown. Moreover, most captive infection experiments did not use inoculum derived from wild bats ( Table 2 , Stress of intervention may increase viral reactivation and shedding.

doi:10.1371/journal.pntd.0004796.t001 Table 2 . Summary of results from experimental inoculation of bats with emerging bat viruses (see S1 Table) , and little is known about doses and routes of infection that mimic exposures in the wild [27] . Third, the necessity of working in biosecurity level 4 conditions constrains the scope and duration of experiments on emerging bat viruses [e.g., 25, 28] . For these reasons, many mechanisms that drive infectious disease dynamics in bats, such as viral clearance or persistence, immune memory, and transmission, remain poorly characterized.

Experimental infections of Hendra, Nipah, and Marburg viruses in bats have suggested that, after a short incubation period, bats have an acute systemic phase of viral replication ( Table 2 , S1 Table) . RNA from Hendra virus was detected in urine and feces for an average of seven days [25] ; Hendra virus was isolated from bat tissues 10 days, but not 21 days, after infection [29, 30] . Likewise, in three Marburg virus experiments, bats experienced a short period of viremia followed by clearance from most sampled tissues by 10 to 14 days after inoculation [31] [32] [33] . There were no signs of morbidity or mortality induced by Hendra, Nipah, Ebola, or Marburg viruses, consistent with previous virus detections in apparently healthy wild bats (Table 2 ) [6, [33] [34] [35] . However, all henipavirus experiments and one Marburg virus experiment were conducted with individual wild-caught bats without knowledge of the prior infection and immune histories.

The sequelae to the acute period of viral infection and shedding in bats are less well characterized. Although virus was not isolated from bats at the conclusion of any experiment, RNA was frequently detected in tissues at necropsy (S1 Table) . For instance, Hendra virus RNA was detected in the lung, liver, spleen, and kidney of bats at the conclusion of a threeweek experiment [25] . Marburg virus RNA was detected in the spleen at the conclusion of one four-week experiment [31] but was cleared from all sampled tissues at the conclusion of another three-week experiment [32] . To understand viral clearance, two important questions must be resolved. First, is the absence of PCR detection sufficient to demonstrate clearance? Measles virus RNA, for example, can be detected in humans for months after active infection has cleared [36] . Second, what experimental duration is adequate for assessing viral persistence?

Although there is no direct evidence that the henipaviruses or filoviruses persist within individual bats, it is commonly assumed that bats host persistent infections [37] . This assumption may be derived from evidence of persistent flavivirus and Rio Bravo virus infections during experiments conducted in the 1960s and 1970s [38, 39] , and a common paradigm that reservoir hosts carry persistent infections (e.g., hantavirus in rodents and simian immunodeficiency virus [SIV] in primates [40, 41] ). More recently, simultaneous shedding of several viruses (and sometimes bacteria) from many individuals was observed during pulses of excretion [e.g., [42] [43] [44] ; this observation could be explained by within-host persistence. Some features of the immune systems of bats appear to be different from those of other mammals, and this has fueled speculation that bats may host persistent infections [16] . For example, the set point of interferon responses in bats appears to be relatively high compared to other mammals [45] . The latter is consistent with the possibility that bats rapidly control viral replication, thus avoiding the pathological consequences of disease observed in other species [45] . Moreover, it has been proposed that bats can coexist with pathogens due to adaptations inadvertently acquired during the evolution of flight [46] [47] [48] . Despite this growing body of research on batpathogen interactions, there is no direct evidence that henipaviruses or filoviruses persistently infect their bat hosts.

If bats do not clear infections, there are at least two mechanisms by which viruses may persist within bat hosts [18] . First, bat hosts may tolerate viruses. In this case, a tempered inflammatory response would minimize immunopathology; viral replication may fluctuate as a function of the immunological competence of the host [18] . Second, persistent latent or low-level infections from which virus can be reactivated may become established in bats [13] . In theory, persistent bat viruses could reactivate in response to processes that affect host immunity, such as stress, pregnancy, or poor nutrition [5, 14] . Whether a particular individual clears infection or remains persistently or latently infected may depend on immune status, dose received, coinfections, route of infection, history of infection, and individual variation-all factors that may differ amongst individuals and through time [18] .

Latent and recrudescent Hendra and Nipah encephalitis cases were observed in humans, and, therefore, recrudescence was proposed as a mechanism of persistence in bats. However, recrudescent virus in humans was not transmitted and, therefore, did not contribute to epidemiological dynamics [e.g., 49, [50] [51] [52] . Nevertheless, the different cellular interactions between viruses and reservoir hosts versus incidental hosts may lead to different mechanisms of persistence. For example, the ability of bats to control viral replication may limit the capacity of viruses such as Hendra and Nipah to spread to the central nervous system of bats. In general, characterization of host pathogen dynamics in a spillover host does not provide evidence for the dynamics being similar in reservoir hosts [5, 27] . Recrudescent Nipah virus infection was reported in a bat, but the evidence presented was weak and alternative explanations were not ruled out [13] .

Experimental evidence for protective immunity following viral infection in bats is inconsistent and suggests differences among species and viruses (Table 2 ). In the 1960s Sulkin et al. [53] described recurrent viremias in bats and susceptibility to reinfection with Japanese B encephalitis virus, establishing a paradigm for bats as hosts of recurrent infections. By contrast, repeat challenge studies with Rabies virus in one bat species confronted our assumptions about the universal lethality of rabies virus in mammals. Although some individual bats experienced acute, lethal infections, other individuals survived with protective immunity and never shed virus [54] . Contemporary work on emerging bat viruses has been less conclusive. Bats challenged with Marburg virus seroconverted and were protected from viral replication when rechallenged 48 days later, suggesting some short-term protection after recovery from acute viremia [32] . In contrast, 50% of bats inoculated with Hendra or Nipah virus seroconverted, and there was no consistent relation between seroconversion and recovery of viral genome [25] . Moreover, in another study, bats excreted Nipah virus in urine while neutralizing antibody was present in the serum [26] . Together, these studies indicated that antibodies may not be the primary driver of henipavirus clearance in bats [55] . Reinfection experiments with Nipah virus were inconclusive; most bats did not respond to the first inoculation with productive infections [25] . Waning prevalence of Hendra virus antibody was reported in a maternity colony of Pteropus scapulatus over six months [9] , and waning maternal henipavirus antibodies have been reported in numerous systems [e.g., 9, 56, 57] , but the effective protection conferred by these antibodies was not determined. The association between antibodies and Ebola viral nucleic acids in samples from bats was unclear [58] .

As is the case with most wildlife diseases, the process by which bat viruses are transmitted in the wild is poorly understood. Transmission events cannot be observed directly, viral infections of reservoir hosts may be asymptomatic, and sampling of individuals through time is difficult. Therefore, inferences must be drawn from multiple sources of indirect evidence. Bat viruses have been detected in urine, feces, saliva, and soiled fruit, indicating the potential for virus transmission via excreta between bats in the wild [5, 59] . However, under laboratory conditions, bat-to-bat transmission for most of these viruses is difficult to achieve (Table 2 ) [e.g., 32]. Following experimental inoculations, viral shedding by bats for both Nipah and Hendra viruses was minimal [25] , although continuous exposure to a low-dose viral rain may increase the probability of infection [5] . Natural and experimental vertical transmission of Hendra virus has been documented, but inconsistently and under specific conditions, such as parenteral inoculation (but not oronasal inoculation) [25, 29] . A few longitudinal serological and virological surveys and theoretical models have proposed that seasonal patterns in incidence or spillover could be explained by peaks of transmission in response to demographic or ecological drivers such as birth pulses, waning maternal immunity, and migration [12, 15, 60, 61] , but these proposed dynamics have not been confirmed.

Disease dynamics within populations are primarily driven by interactions among the processes of pathogen transmission and clearance, immunity, and host population dynamics. We focus on three different scenarios-representing different combinations of these within-and between-host processes-that could generate pulses of viral excretion in bat populations (Fig  2) . Although we present these scenarios as discrete, they fall along a continuum. Our purpose in proposing these scenarios is to inform research on the relative importance of key components of these systems to allow for generation of testable hypotheses. Simulations combined with field and laboratory studies can then be used to assess the relative explanatory capacity of the three models.

The first scenario is that pulses of infection are driven by transmission of short-lived infections that provide long-lasting immunity (Fig 1A, susceptible-infectious-recovered [SIR] dynamics). Two paramyxoviruses, measles virus and distemper virus, are emblematic SIR diseases in human and animal epidemiology [17] . The dynamics of Hendra virus and Nipah virus, which are also paramyxoviruses, have been assumed to be similar to those of measles and distemper [e.g., 15]. A recent model of filoviruses in bats similarly assumed that SIR dynamics characterized Ebola and Marburg viruses in bats [60] . In the absence of antigenic evolution, SIR pathogens render recovered hosts immune. Therefore, epidemic pulses can only occur after births or immigration have replenished the pool of susceptible individuals [17] . Large, regular outbreaks of zoonotic viruses within bat populations could occur through local viral extinction and then recolonization, seasonal aggregations, or the influx of susceptible juveniles [5, 15, 60] .

In the second scenario, pulses of infection are driven by transmission of short-lived infections with fluctuating host immunity (Fig 1B, susceptible-infectious-recovered-susceptible [SIRS] dynamics). The pool of susceptible individuals is replenished via antibody decay in immunized hosts. In this scenario, although births or immigration contribute to the cycles of infection, loss of immunity within individuals strongly affects the age-specific incidence. Replacement of susceptible individuals from within populations also contributes to endemic persistence of pathogens in small populations. Whether this scenario may occur in bats has not been explored. However, it could explain short intervals between pulses of excretion of viruses, such as Hendra virus [12] , that would be unlikely under SIR dynamics. If SIR dynamics explain pulses of infection, then more time between pulses would be necessary to replenish susceptible individuals.

The third scenario hinges on resolution of the acute infection without clearance of virus, allowing pulses of transmission to be triggered by viral reactivation (Fig 1C, we call these dynamics susceptible-infectious-latent-infectious [SILI] ). Under this scenario, pathogen carriage is stable in space and time even if viral shedding is episodic [18] . The synchrony of shedding among bats may depend on the extent and synchrony of the drivers of shedding (Fig 2, e.g., food shortages or climate conditions), the abundance of susceptible individuals (e.g., during a birth pulse [61] ), and behaviors that increase transmission rates [15] .

Each of these scenarios can be considered as discrete examples along a continuum. For example, diseases driven by SIR and SIRS dynamics may have similar patterns if the duration of the R state is long in the SIRS case. Diseases driven by SILI and SIR dynamics may have similar patterns if the duration of the I state is long in the SIR case. Moreover, SIR, SIRS, and SILI dynamics may not be mutually exclusive; they might even co-occur within or among heterogeneous populations.

Each of the three scenarios outlined above may generate similar patterns in prevalence or seroprevalence data. Research methods that can be combined to distinguish among these scenarios include field sampling to document seroprevalence and prevalence, statistical modeling to identify patterns of infection, pathogen sequencing and phylogenetic analysis, and dynamic simulation modeling to generate epidemiological scenarios that can be evaluated with data.

Quantification of seroprevalence often has been the first line of investigation for newly discovered bat zoonoses [e.g., 8, 9, 11] . Serological assays have some limitations [62] , but antibodies are generally easier to detect than antigen; sera can be nonlethally sampled, and, because antibodies generally persist after virus is cleared, the probability of detecting seropositive animals is higher than that of detecting infected animals. However, seroprevalence is a poor metric for quantifying epidemic dynamics. If antibodies persist within bats, seroprevalence measures cumulative exposure. If antibody persistence exceeds the period over which hosts move between populations, then antibody prevalence may not reflect the epidemic history of the sampled population, but simply the infection history of the individual [63] . Thus, longitudinal monitoring of seroprevalence may be most useful for studying the dynamics of viruses that produce short-lived antibody responses in relatively sedentary host species (unlike Pteropid bats).

Measuring age-specific serostatus and antibody titers increases the power of serological surveys. If age-specific seroprevalence increases monotonically as age increases in populations sampled over multiple outbreaks, SIR dynamics can be inferred (Table 1 ). In contrast, SIRS and SILI dynamics could exhibit complex patterns in cross-sectional serosurveys. These patterns would change through time as epidemics wax and wane. In general, inference from serology alone is unlikely to differentiate among our proposed epidemiological scenarios.

The difficulty of estimating prevalence of emerging bat viruses may reflect true low prevalence, low test sensitivity, or sampling of tissues in which virus does not persist. Pathogens that cause acute infections may circulate at low prevalence or may be heterogeneously distributed in space and time and therefore require large sample sizes to detect [64] .

Pathogens that persist within their hosts may be sequestered in tissues that are difficult to sample non-lethally. For example, Ebola virus RNA has only been detected in the liver and spleen of wild bats [58] . Viremia or shedding in excreta may be periodic, and, therefore, estimation of infection status from these samples may yield false negatives.

Prevalence data collected across space and time may allow identification of geographic patterns, such as travelling waves, that are likely to be caused by host-to-host transmission (SIR or SIRS dynamics) ( Table 1) . Age-structured prevalence data with an age-specific incidence skewed towards younger individuals suggests an endemic disease with SIR dynamics. If the duration of maternal-derived immunity is known, the mean age of infection is a direct reflection of the basic reproductive ratio of the disease in the population. Although prevalence data provides many insights into the dynamics of disease, there are few situations in which prevalence data alone can distinguish among our proposed epidemiological scenarios.

Longitudinal sampling of the infection status of individuals can help distinguish between scenarios if four conditions are met: (1) Prevalence of the infection must be high enough to detect pathogen within a small number of sampled individuals but must not approach 100% so that variations can be observed. (2) The period over which individuals are resampled must exceed that of the infectious period (and therefore the infectious period must be known). (3) The host's lifetime must far exceed the infectious period. (4) Pathogen must be detectable without lethal sampling. It is our contention that, if these conditions are met, it should be possible to distinguish among scenarios. In a population with waning immunity and cyclical reinfection, the probability that a given individual becomes infected is expected to be equal to the prevalence of infection among other individuals of similar age and the same sex. Therefore, past infection status is not expected to predict present infection status. In contrast, if individuals are persistently infected but shed episodically, the prevalence of infection among previously positive individuals will be higher than among the population, and past infection increases the likelihood of positive infection status (Table 1) . However, large sample sizes and intermediate levels of prevalence probably are required to distinguish cyclical reinfection from persistent infections, and alternative explanations for patterns of prevalence may be difficult to reject. For example, the individuals most likely to be exposed may appear to be persistently infected. In this case, complementing longitudinal sampling with sequence data may improve inferences.

A caveat to this method is that longitudinal, systematic sampling of wild animals, particularly highly mobile or migratory species, requires major effort. For example, large populations of Eidolon helvum (the reservoir hosts of henipaviruses and Lagos bat virus) migrate across continents [22] . Even in resident populations, such as urban populations of Pteropus alecto (the reservoir host of Hendra virus), recapture of individuals within populations that include tens of thousands of individuals is difficult if not impossible. In contrast to studies in migratory canopy-dwelling species, capture-mark-recapture methods have been implemented in cavedwelling species. For example, Frick et al. [65] reported recapture rates of 0.10 to 0.35 during longitudinal studies of Myotis lucifugusi, and Smith et al. [66] reported recapture rates of up to 0.81 during longitudinal studies of Myotis macropus.

If recapture is possible, generating a consistent time-series of recaptures may be challenging, affecting the ability to make inferences on the temporal resolution of the underlying processes. Nevertheless, some mechanisms may be ruled out even with incomplete time-series data. For example, SIR dynamics are unlikely in an animal in which virus is detected, not detected, and then detected again. However, genomics still is necessary to differentiate SIRS from SILI dynamics.

We hypothesize that pulses of infection arising from reactivation of persistent viruses or reintroduction of acute viruses may leave distinguishable evolutionary signatures in viral genomes at the population and individual levels (Fig 3) . Viral reintroduction followed by extinction could result in pulses with low levels of viral diversity (Fig 3A) . In contrast, pulses driven by reactivation may contain higher viral diversity given the longer evolutionary history of the virus in the population (Fig 3B) . The opposite pattern is expected in comparisons of viral diversity across multiple pulses. Each pulse of reintroduced viruses is more likely to represent a different viral lineage, but reactivated viruses may be similar among pulses. Therefore, reintroduced pulses are expected to create low lineage diversity within an outbreak, but higher lineage diversity among outbreaks. The opposite could be expected for pulses driven by reactivation. For example, diverse lineages of Marburg virus circulated simultaneously within and among bat colonies in Uganda across years [67] , a pattern that is more consistent with persistence within hosts and reactivation than pulses of reintroduction, which would require simultaneous extinction-recolonization of multiple strains. Information on viral diversity should ideally be coupled with knowledge of the landscape-level and host community-level distribution of viral lineages, enabling inference to the geographic or species origins of viral reintroductions to focal populations [68] .

In the absence of comprehensive, landscape-level data, other features of viral evolution may help distinguish reactivating from recolonizing viruses. Because viral evolutionary rates can be estimated for many species or can be approximated from better-studied related viruses [69] , internal branches of the phylogenetic tree connecting pulses of infection in the same bat population may be too long to be plausible under a model of reactivation. Moreover, because neutral evolutionary rates are likely to be slow while viruses are latent, even less evolutionary distance would be expected between pulses driven by reactivation compared to viruses that circulate continuously over the same timespan [70, 71] . Predictions of coalescent theory may also help identify recolonizing viruses because viral effective population size is expected to be driven by transmission between individuals [72] . Therefore, effective population sizes are expected to increase exponentially during pulses driven by reintroduction and between-host transmission but may appear stable in pulses driven by reactivation [73] . However, this effect may dissipate if reactivated infections of a few individuals drive a more extensive outbreak with betweenindividual transmission (i.e., pulses that are driven by multiple mechanisms). Also, as with any such analysis, reconstructions of effective population size depend on a number of epidemiological and evolutionary factors (e.g., selection) as well as sampling effort, so they must be considered with some caution [72] .

Repeated sampling of individuals, although challenging and sometimes impossible, may also provide powerful insights. In pulses of reintroduced viruses, the individual viruses sampled at different points in time might be paraphyletic (i.e., recent samples are not necessarily derived from older samples in a phylogenetic tree), whereas reactivated viruses are expected to be monophyletic, with differences among pulses attributable to within-host evolution (Fig 3) . Combining deep-sequencing methods that can characterize mixed-strain infections with repeat sampling could further indicate whether lineages are lost and reintroduced or maintained in individuals over time [74] .

Viral sequence data may therefore help to distinguish the mechanisms driving pulses of viral infection in bats; however, several aspects of viral evolution present challenges. First, patterns of evolution within and between hosts are just beginning to be understood and different processes can generate similar patterns [73, 75] . For example, strong within-host selection and viral reintroduction could create temporal structure in the virus phylogeny [76] . In this regard, sequencing both neutrally evolving and selected parts of the viral genome would be advantageous and is increasingly practical with advances in whole genome sequencing [74] . These methods will be most powerful in rapidly evolving RNA viruses that are temporally and spatially sampled, but this requires major investment in field sampling of highly mobile species like bats, particularly when the prevalence of detection of viral genomes can be low. Even when abundant molecular data are available, experiments and modeling should be designed to complement field sampling and sequencing of RNA viruses over space and time, particularly in more complex epidemiological scenarios in which our hypothesized expectations may not be realized or detectable.

In the face of incomplete data, modeling is regularly applied to explore the dynamics that would be expected given different scenarios for within-and between-host processes. For example, Blackwood et al. [77] compared the strength of evidence for four epidemiological models of rabies in vampire bats. They concluded that abortive immunizing infections and metapopulation dynamics contribute to population-level maintenance. Assuming an SIR scenario for Filoviruses in Rousettus aegyptiacus bats, Hayman [60] investigated the relative importance of parameters controlling bat life history and infection dynamics, highlighting the key role played by the biannual birth pulses that are characteristic of this species. Plowright et al. [15] used models to demonstrate that Hendra virus prevalence and seroprevalence studies were inadequate to distinguish between SIR or SILI dynamics in fruit bats. Although models cannot prove a certain epidemiological scenario exists, they can identify patterns that may help distinguish between scenarios, and therefore parameters, that are important to measure in the natural systems. It is important to reiterate that, to remain useful, models should be revised throughout the course of research programs to include the latest updates from empirical data and any new scenarios deemed relevant [78, 79] .

Effective interventions to limit threats to human health from emerging infectious diseases rely on understanding the connections among observed pathogen dynamics, the underlying transmission mechanisms, and their ecological and environmental drivers. We propose that multiple processes can lead to similar spatial and temporal patterns in prevalence and seroprevalence data, and, to our knowledge, existing empirical data often are insufficient to identify the underlying mechanisms. We encourage researchers to collect appropriate data to identify the scenarios driving pulses of excretion of emerging bat viruses because strategies to predict or reduce spillover risk should depend on the mechanisms' underlying dynamics (Table 1) . Current management strategies include dispersing bats, culling bats, preventing contact between bats and spillover hosts, or vaccinating spillover hosts [80, 81] . With the exception of equine vaccination for Hendra virus, few data exist on the efficacy of these strategies. Simulations combined with knowledge of bat virus dynamics can be used to assess the relative effectiveness of each strategy and identify situations in which management action may be counterproductive. For example, culling bats may decrease spillover risk if transmission of the virus increases as population size increases (SIR dynamics), whereas culling may increase spillover risk if pulses are driven by viral reactivation after stress (SILI dynamics). Dispersing bat colonies has clear potential for unintended consequences if pulses are driven by recolonization (SIR dynamics) or by viral reactivation (SILI dynamics). Predicting pulses driven by SIR, SIRS, or SILI dynamics may require information on herd immunity, withinand between-group transmission, and environmental stress, respectively. Thus, the research with the greatest potential to inform prediction and management of spillover varies among scenarios (Table 1) .

Identifying the mechanisms and drivers of pulses of virus excretion may be the greatest challenge to predicting, managing, and preventing spillover of emerging diseases. We suggest that genomics and longitudinal sampling of individuals be integrated into virus and antibody surveys, and that these data be analyzed with inferential models. These methods will allow for identification of the drivers of infection pulses and thus set the agenda for research on emerging viruses that originate from bats. Moreover, these techniques can be applied to a range of animal and human systems in which differentiating between-from within-host mechanisms is challenging.

• Spillover of emerging bat viruses to humans often coincides with pulses of viral excretion from bat populations. We present three scenarios of within-host and betweenhost processes that can generate these pulses of virus excretion. Each scenario involves different underlying mechanisms, yet can produce similar patterns in prevalence data.

Research efforts often do not use data collection methods that would allow these mechanisms to be distinguished.

• We show that understanding the connections among observed pathogen dynamics, the underlying mechanisms, and their ecological and environmental drivers requires ambitious, interdisciplinary research. We suggest a research agenda combining genomics, longitudinal sampling of individuals, virus and antibody surveys, and inferential models.

SEIR Transmission dynamics model of 2019 nCoV coronavirus with considering the weak infectious ability and changes in latency duration,"Pneumonia patients of 2019-ncov in latent period are not easy to be effectively quarantined, but there is evidence that they have strong infectious ability. Here, the infectious ability of patients during the latent period is slightly less than that of the infected patients was assumed. We established a new SEIR propagation dynamics model, that considered the weak transmission ability of the incubation period, the variation of the incubation period length, and the government intervention measures to track and isolate comprehensively. Based on the raw epidemic data of China from January 23, 2020 to February 10, 2020, the dynamic parameters of the new present SEIR model are fitted. Through the Euler integration algorithm to solve the model, the effect of infectious ability of incubation patients on the theoretical estimation of the present SEIR model was analyzed, and the occurrence time of peak number in China was predicted.","The new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is a major epidemic that humans are experiencing. As a kind of coronavirus, it poses a continuing threat to human health because of its high transmission efficiency and serious infection consequences [1] . Since the first case of novel coronavirus pneumonia was discovered in early Dec 2019, it has spread widely over the past two months. By the end of 10:00, Feb 10th, 2020, there were 42708 confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV infection and 21675 suspected cases in China. At present, 2019-nCoV pneumonia cases have been confirmed in dozens of countries and regions including the United States, Germany, France, Canada, Australia, and Japan.

The rapid spread of 2019-noV pneumonia around the world poses a major threat to the closely connected and interdependent world today. The reproductive number R refers to the average number of secondary cases generated from primary cases, and has become a key quantity to determine the intensity of interventions needed to control epidemics [2] . On January 29, 2020, Li et al conducted a study of the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan, showing that the R of 2019-nCoV was 2.2, and revealed that person-to-person transmission occurred between close contacts [3] . On January 26, 2020, new research shows that the reproductive ratio of 2019-nCoV is 2.90, which is higher than the 1.77 SARS epidemic [4] 。In the absence of comprehensive treatments or vaccines, China has adopted the most effective isolation prevention and control measures to isolate patients diagnosed with 2019-nCoV to control the spread of infection, but the number of 2019-nCoV infections has far exceeded that of SARS epidemics. Existing basic research results and actual situation of epidemic spread have shown that 2019-nCoV has a higher pandemic risk than the outbreak of SARS in 2003 [4] 。 This paper discusses the feasibility of using the deterministic model of the transmission dynamics model of infectious diseases to assess the development of the 2019-nCoV epidemic in China. Some researchers have tried to study and evaluate the development trend of the 2019-nCoV pneumonia epidemic through the transmission dynamics. On Jan 24, 2020, British scholars Read et al [5] estimated that the number of 2019-nCoV infection cases in Wuhan would reach 190000 on Feb 4, which obviously overestimated the development trend of the epidemic. On Jan 31, 2020, Wu et al [6] , scholars from Hong Kong, China, predicted that the number of infections in Wuhan on Jan 25 exceeded 75815, which also obviously overestimated the spread of the epidemic. Chinese scholars Shen et al. [7] used dynamics models to predict the peak time and scale of the epidemic, and estimated that the peak number of infections was less than 20,000, which was lower than the raw data released on Feb 10. Chinese scholars Xiao et al. [8] established a transmission dynamic model with considering intervention strategies such as close tracking and quarantine. Based on their model, scholars predicted that the epidemic would reach its peak around Feb 5 [8] , which made an early estimation of the peak time of the epidemic. In summary, although some researchers have carried out research on the transmission dynamics of the 2019-nCoV pneumonia epidemic, the real epidemic development has far deviated from the prediction results of previous studies.

In previous studies on the transmission dynamics of infectious diseases, the epidemic was in the early stages of development and lacked sufficient raw data, so it was difficult to accurately predict the development of the 2 / 5 epidemic. In addition, the shortcomings of the transmission dynamic model itself have also become the direct cause of limiting its prediction effect. Latent patients are not easy to be effectively quarantined, and recent evidence shows that latent patients have a strong infectious ability, but the existing epidemic transmission dynamic models [5] [6] [7] [8] often ignore the transmission risks caused by patients in the latent period. In addition, researchers have found that estimates of the average latency of 2019-nCoV are also changing. The incubation period was determined to be 7 days in January, and it was recently estimated to be 3 days, which means that 2019-nCoV infected people become more likely to develop symptoms.

Obviously, it is still necessary to make a new assessment of the spread of the 2019-nCoV epidemic situation, which has important practical significance for the research, judgment and prevention of the epidemic situation. In this paper, we established a new SEIR propagation dynamics model, considering the weak transmission ability of the incubation period, the variation of the incubation period length, and the government intervention measures to track and quarantine comprehensively. Based on this new SEIR propagation dynamics model, the effect of infectious ability of incubation patients on the theoretical estimation of the present SEIR model was analyzed, and the occurrence time of peak number in China was predicted.

Considering that the Chinese Spring Festival began on January 23 and the Chinese government initiated effective prevention, control and quarantine measures for the whole people, it can be considered that there are few new imported cases in all provinces, and the impact of migrant population flow can be basically ignored. Therefore, the premise of carrying out dynamic model research on infectious disease transmission is sufficient. The model in this paper is based on the classical SEIR model. The classic SEIR model divides the population into S (Susceptible), I (Infected), E (Exposed), and R (Recovered). In this model, it is also assumed that all individuals in the population are at risk of infection. Antibodies will be produced when the infected individual recovers, so the recovered population R will not be infected again. In addition, quarantine measures to prevent and treat infectious diseases are also taken into account in the model. The population components in the model also includes Sq (isolated susceptible), isolation exposed Eq (isolated exposed) and Iq (isolated infected). In view of the fact that isolated infected individuals will be immediately sent to designated hospitals for quarantine and treatment, this part of the population will be converted to hospitalized H in this model. Therefore, the original populations S, I, and E respectively refer to susceptible, infected, and exposed individuals who have missed quarantine measures. The isolated susceptible person is reconverted to the susceptible person after isolation. Both the infected and the exposed have the ability to infect the susceptible, turning them into the exposed. The transformation relationship among different groups of people is shown in Fig. 1.   Figure1 . Modified SEIR propagation dynamics model It is assumed that the quarantine ratio is q, the probability of transmission is  , and the contact rate is c. 

where  is the ratio of the transmission ability of the exposed to the infected. When =0

 , it means that the infection ability of the patients in the latent period is ignored. When =1

 , the infection ability of the patients in the latent period is the same as that of the patients with symptoms. And  is the rate of isolation release, hence 1/14  = (the quarantine duration is 14 days).

With the growth of statistical data, researchers' estimation of the average latent period of 2019-nCoV is also changing. The average incubation period has changed from 7 days determined in January to 3 days estimated recently, which means 2019-ncov infected people are more likely to show symptoms.  is the transformation rate from the exposed to the infected. Considering the change of actual latent period, a smooth transition curve from 1/7 to 1/3 is used to represent the change law of transformation rate from the exposed to infected under the change of the latent period. The curve equation is

where A and B correspond to the values of the transformation rate of the exposed to the infected in the early and late stages of the epidemic period studied. The epidemic data in this letter are from Jan. 23 to Feb. 10 in China, so A and B correspond to the conversion rates of Jan. 23 to Feb. 10 respectively. In Eq. (2) , 0 t represents the time when the conversion rate is the average of A and B, and k can be directly determined by the rate of change and the derivative value of the conversion rate at time.

The newly established 2019-nCoV modified SEIR propagation dynamics system model is as follows 3 / 5 

where I  is the quarantine rate of the infected, I  is the recovery rate of the infected, q  is the transformation rate from the exposed to the isolated infected,

is the recovery rate of the isolated infected, is  the diseaseinduced death rate, and  is the transformation rate from the exposed to the infected.

The epidemic data used in this paper comes from the raw epidemic notification data published on the official website of the National Health Commission of the people's Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/). In this paper, the governing Eqs. 2 and 3 is solved using Euler's numerical method, and the integration step is 0.01 (days). The initial value of the dynamic system refers to the epidemic data officially released by the Chinese government on January 23, 2020, and some parameters have been reasonably estimated. The specific parameter values are shown in Table 1 . The other model parameters are the results of fitting optimization based on the original data.  ), the corresponding model parameters are obtained by fitting and optimization based on the raw data, and predict the epidemic situation in future. As can be seen from the Fig. 2 , the corresponding optimal model parameters are found with different infectious abilities. Under the optimal parameters, the number of infected persons predicted by the theoretical model is in good agreement with the raw data from January 23, 2020 to February 10, 2020. Next, we can analyze the effect of different infectious ability of patients in latent period on model estimation. Note that without considering the infectious capacity of patients in the incubation period, that is, =0  , the present model can degenerate to obtain the recent dynamic model of infectious disease transmission established in Ref. [8] . The results shown in Figure 2 show that the peak estimate of the number of infected people using the theory established in Ref. [8] is much higher than the estimate made by the present theoretical model. This is due to the neglect of the infectious ability of patient in latent period in previous models [6] [7] [8] . Because only the infected are transmissible, the actual probability of infection needs to be overestimated to adequately fit the raw data, which ultimately leads to overestimation of the number of infected people. Figure. 2.Effect of infectious ability of patient in latent period on the theoretical estimation. Fig.3 . Impact of variation of incubation period length on the theoretical estimation.

Next, Figure 3 analyzes the effect of variation of incubation period length on the theoretical estimation. It can be seen from Fig. 3 that the peak number of infected persons in the model considering the variation of the incubation period is lower than that in the model with the constant incubation period. This corresponds to an easily understood fact. With the development of the epidemic, the length of the incubation period has shortened, which directly leads to the patients in the incubation period to show symptoms faster and be taken to hospital and quarantined.

Fig. 4 . Evaluation of the spread of China's 2019-nCoV epidemic Finally, the trend of China's 2019-nCoV epidemic was evaluated by using the new present SEIR model. In order to obtain an interval estimate of the peak number of infections and its occurrence time, the contact rate was set to vary within the interval of [2.8, 4.2] . The prediction of the current theoretical model indicates that the number of 2019-nCoV infections in China reaches its peak after February 19, and the upper and lower limits of the estimated peak time of the epidemic respectively correspond to the abscissa of the peaks of the upper and lower envelopes of the theoretical forecast data of the number of infected. The current theoretical estimation of the number of infected people in China is in good agreement with the raw number of infected people in the period from January 23, 2020 to February 10, 2020. It is worth noting that the theoretical model and parameters of this paper were initially established before February 5. The prediction results of the number of infected persons from February 6 to February 10 are mainly consistent with the actual data of subsequent reports, which initially proves the feasibility of the model in predicting the short-term development situation of the epidemic.

This paper attempts to estimate the short-term development of China's 2019-nCoV epidemic and predicts that the number of people infected in China will peak after February 19. It should be noted that because the infectious ability of patient in latent period and variation of incubation period length are considered, our present model in this paper is closer to the real situation, so the estimates based on it should also be more reliable. However, some necessary assumptions are still made during the model establishment in this paper. The mathematical descriptions made by the model are different from the complex reality, which leads to the inevitable deviation of the prediction results. All rights reserved.

Characterizing the Transmission Dynamics and Control of Ebola Virus Disease,"Carefully calibrated transmission models have the potential to guide public health officials on the nature and scale of the interventions required to control epidemics. In the context of the ongoing Ebola virus disease (EVD) epidemic in Liberia, Drake and colleagues, in this issue of PLOS Biology, employed an elegant modeling approach to capture the distributions of the number of secondary cases that arise in the community and health care settings in the context of changing population behaviors and increasing hospital capacity. Their findings underscore the role of increasing the rate of safe burials and the fractions of infectious individuals who seek hospitalization together with hospital capacity to achieve epidemic control. However, further modeling efforts of EVD transmission and control in West Africa should utilize the spatial-temporal patterns of spread in the region by incorporating spatial heterogeneity in the transmission process. Detailed datasets are urgently needed to characterize temporal changes in population behaviors, contact networks at different spatial scales, population mobility patterns, adherence to infection control measures in hospital settings, and hospitalization and reporting rates.","Ebola virus disease (EVD) is caused by an RNA virus of the family Filoviridae and genus Ebolavirus. Five different Ebolavirus strains have been identified, namely Zaire ebolavirus (EBOV), Sudan ebolavirus (SUDV), Tai Forest ebolavirus (TAFV), Bundibugyo ebolavirus (BDBV), and Reston ebolavirus (RESTV). The great majority of past Ebola outbreaks in humans have been linked to three Ebola strains: EBOV, SUDV, and BDBV [1] . The Ebola virus ([EBOV] formerly designated Zaire ebolavirus) derived its name from the Ebola River, located near the epicenter of the first outbreak identified in 1976 in Zaire (now the Democratic Republic of Congo). EVD outbreaks among humans have been associated with direct human exposure to fruit bats-the most likely reservoir of the virus-or through contact with intermediate infected hosts, which include gorillas, chimpanzees, and monkeys. Outbreaks have been reported on average every 1.5 years [2] . Past EVD outbreaks have occurred in relatively isolated areas and have been limited in size and duration (Fig. 1 ). It has been recently estimated that about 22 million people living in areas of Central and West Africa are at risk of EVD [3] .

An epidemic of EVD (EBOV) has been spreading in West Africa since December 2013 in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone [8] . A total of 18,603 cases, with 6,915 deaths, have been reported to the World Health Organization as of December 17, 2014 [9] . While the causative strain associated with this epidemic is closely related to that of past outbreaks in Central Africa [10] , three key factors have contributed disproportionately to this unprecedented epidemic: (1) substantial delays in detection and implementation of control efforts in a region characterized by porous borders; (2) limited public health infrastructure including epidemiological surveillance systems and diagnostic testing [11] , which are necessary for the timely diagnosis of symptomatic individuals, effective isolation of infectious individuals, contact tracing to rapidly identify new cases, and providing supportive care to increase the chances of survival to EVD infection; and (3) cultural practices that involve touching the body of the deceased and the association of illness with witchcraft or conspiracy theories. Congo (1976 Congo ( , 1995 Congo ( , 2014 [4] [5] [6] and Uganda (2000) [7] . Case incidence was normalized by the total number of cases reported for each outbreak.

EBOV is transmitted by direct human-to-human contact via body fluids or indirect contact with contaminated surfaces, but it is not spread through the airborne route. Individuals become symptomatic after an average incubation period of 10 days (range 2-21 days) [12] , and infectiousness is increased during the later stages of disease [13] . The characteristic symptoms of EVD are nonspecific and include sudden onset of fever, weakness, vomiting, diarrhea, headache, and a sore throat, while only a fraction of the symptomatic individuals present with hemorrhagic manifestations [14] . The case fatality risk (CFR), calculated as the proportion of deaths among the total number of EVD cases with known outcomes, has been estimated from data of the first 9 months of the epidemic in West Africa at 70.8% (95% CI 68. 6-72.8) , in broad agreement with estimates from past outbreaks [12] .

Two important quantities to understand in the transmission dynamics of EVD are the serial interval and the basic reproduction number. The serial interval is defined as the time from illness onset in a primary case to illness onset in a secondary case [15] and has been estimated at 15 days on average for the ongoing epidemic [12] . The basic reproduction number, R 0 , quantifies transmission potential at the beginning of an epidemic and is defined as the average number of secondary cases generated by a typical infected individual during the early phase of an epidemic, before interventions are put in place [16] . If R 0 < 1, transmission is not sufficient to generate a major epidemic. In contrast, a major epidemic is likely to occur whenever R 0 > 1. When transmission potential is measured over time t, the effective reproduction number R t , can be helpful to quantify the time-dependent transmission potential resulting from the effect of control interventions and behavior changes [17] . Estimates of R 0 for the ongoing epidemic in West Africa have fluctuated around 2 with some uncertainty (e.g., [12, [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] ), which are in good agreement with estimates from past EVD outbreaks [23] . R 0 could also vary across regions as a function of the local public health infrastructure (e.g., availability of health care settings and infection control protocols), such that an outbreak may be very unlikely to unfold in developed countries simply as a result of baseline infection control measures in place (i.e., R 0 < 1) while poor countries with extremely weak or absent public health systems may be unable to control an Ebola outbreak (i.e., R 0 > 1).

Mathematical models of disease transmission have proved to be useful tools to characterize the transmission dynamics of infectious diseases and evaluate the effects of control intervention strategies in order to inform public health policy [16, 24, 25] . There are a limited number of mathematical models for the transmission and control of EVD, but a number of efforts are underway in the context of the epidemic in West Africa. The transmission dynamics of EVD have been modeled on the basis of the simple compartmental susceptible-exposed-infectiousremoved (SEIR) model that assumes a homogenously mixed population [23] . The modeled population can be structured according to the contributions of community, hospital, and unsafe burials to transmission as EVD transmission has been amplified in health care settings with ineffective infection control measures and during unsafe burials [23] . A schematic representation of the main transmission pathways of EVD is shown in Fig. 2 .

A recent study published in PLOS Biology by Drake and colleagues [26] presents an interesting and flexible modeling framework for the transmission and control of EVD in Liberia. Their framework is based on a multi-type branching process model in which ""multi-type"" refers to the consideration of two types of settings where transmission can occur, while ""branching process"" is the mathematical term to specify a probabilistic model. For instance, in the case of a single-type branching process, the transmission dynamics are simply described using a single reproduction number, i.e., the average number of secondary cases produced by a single primary case. However, when two types of hosts are considered in the transmission process, two reproduction numbers are needed to characterize within-group mixing (e.g., within-hospital and within-community transmission) and two reproduction numbers characterize transmission between groups (e.g., transmission from hospital to community and vice versa).

Drake and colleague's elegant modeling approach describes EVD transmission according to infection generations by calculating probability distributions of the number of secondary cases that arise in the community via nursing care or during unsafe burials and in health care settings via infections to health care workers and visitors. The model explicitly accounts for the hospitalization rate-the fraction of infectious individuals in the community seeking hospitalization (estimated in this study at 60%). However, the number of effectively isolated infectious individuals is constrained by the number of available beds in treatment centers-which are assumed in this study to operate at twice their regular capacity. It is important to note that the number of beds available to treat EVD patients was severely limited in Liberia prior to mid August 2014 ( Fig. 1 in [26] ). Moreover, the rate of safe burials that reduces the force of infection is included in their model as an increasing function of time. The model was calibrated by tuning six parameters to fit the trajectories of the number of reported cases in the community and among health care workers during the period 4 July to 2 September 2014 for a total of four infection generations during which the effective reproduction number was estimated to decline on average from about 2.8 to 1.4. The model was able to effectively capture heterogeneity in transmission of EVD in both the community and hospital settings.

Drake and colleagues [26] employed their calibrated model to forecast the epidemic trajectory in Liberia from 3 September to 31 December 2014 under different scenarios that account for an increasing fraction of cases seeking hospitalization and a surge in the number of beds available to isolate and treat EVD patients. Their results indicate that allocating 1,700 additional beds (100 new beds every 4 days) in new Ebola treatment centers committed by US aid reduces the mean epidemic size to~51,000 (60% reduction with respect to the baseline scenario), while epidemic control by mid-March is only plausible through a 4-fold increase in the number of beds committed by US aid and enhancing the hospitalization rate from 60% to 99% for a final epidemic size of 12,285. Moreover, an additional epidemic forecast incorporating data up to 1 December 2014 indicated that containment could be achieved between March and June 2015.

Other interventions were not explicitly incorporated in their model because it is difficult to parameterize them in the absence of datasets that permit statistical estimation of their impact on the transmission dynamics. These additional interventions include the use of household protection kits, designed to reduce transmission in the community; improvements in infection control protocols in health care settings that reduce transmission among health care workers; and the impact of rapid diagnostic kits in Ebola treatment centers, which reduce the time to isolation for infectious individuals seeking hospitalization. Increasing awareness and education of the population about the disease could have also yielded further reductions in case incidence by reducing the size of the at-risk susceptible population (Fig. 3) [27] . Nevertheless, some of these effects could have been indirectly captured implicitly by the time-dependent safe burial rate parameter in their model. Importantly, prior models of EVD transmission [23, 28, 29] and the model by Drake and colleagues have not incorporated spatial heterogeneity in the transmission dynamics. In particular, the EVD epidemic in West Africa can be characterized as a set of asynchronous local (e.g., Figure 5 . Epidemic growth in two populations characterized by two different underlying contact networks. Random mixing leads to a rapidly disseminating infectious disease that spreads exponentially fast. By contrast, disease spread is significantly slower in a highly clustered contact network because the contacts of recently infected individuals are likely to be already infected by other infectious individuals. The contact networks are shown for illustration and are composed of a set of nodes (individuals) denoted by red dots while blue lines (links) between nodes denote static contacts. Each solid blue curve of cumulative cases corresponds to a stochastic epidemic realization of the simple SEIR (susceptible-exposed-infectious-removed) [16] , while the dashed red curve corresponds to the average of 100 stochastic realizations.

doi:10.1371/journal.pbio.1002057.g005 district) epidemics that exhibit sub-exponential growth, which could be driven by a highly clustered underlying contact network or population behavior changes induced by the accumulation of morbidity and mortality rates (see Fig. 4 and [30] ). EVD contagiousness is most pronounced in the later and more severe stages of Ebola infection when infectious individuals are confined at home or health care settings and mostly exposed to caregivers (e.g., health care workers, family members) [30] . This characterization would lead to EVD transmission over a network of contacts that is highly clustered (e.g., individuals are likely to share a significant fraction of their contacts), which is associated with significantly slower spread relative to the common random mixing assumption as illustrated in Fig. 5 . The development of transmission models that incorporate spatial heterogeneity (e.g., by modeling spatial coupling or human migration) is currently limited by the shortage of detailed datasets from the EVD-affected areas about the geographic distribution of households, health care settings, reporting and hospitalization rates across urban and rural areas, and patterns of population mobility in the region. Some of these limitations may be overcome in the near future. For instance, cell phone data could provide a basis to characterize population mobility in the region at a refined spatial scale.

The ongoing epidemic in West Africa offers a unique opportunity to improve our current understanding of the transmission characteristics of EVD in humans. To achieve this goal, it is crucial to collect spatial-temporal data on population behaviors, contact networks, social distancing measures, and education campaigns. Datasets comprising detailed demographic, socio-economic, contact rates, and population mobility estimates in the region (e.g., commuting networks, air traffic) need to be integrated and made publicly available in order to develop highly resolved transmission models, which could guide control strategies with greater precision in the context of the EVD epidemic in West Africa. Although recent data from Liberia indicates that the epidemic is on track for eventual control, the epidemic in Sierra Leone continues an increasing trend, and in Guinea, case incidence roughly follows a steady trend. The potential impact of vaccines should also be incorporated in future modeling efforts as these pharmaceutical interventions are expected to become available in the upcoming months.

Unifying Viral Genetics and Human Transportation Data to Predict the Global Transmission Dynamics of Human Influenza H3N2,"Information on global human movement patterns is central to spatial epidemiological models used to predict the behavior of influenza and other infectious diseases. Yet it remains difficult to test which modes of dispersal drive pathogen spread at various geographic scales using standard epidemiological data alone. Evolutionary analyses of pathogen genome sequences increasingly provide insights into the spatial dynamics of influenza viruses, but to date they have largely neglected the wealth of information on human mobility, mainly because no statistical framework exists within which viral gene sequences and empirical data on host movement can be combined. Here, we address this problem by applying a phylogeographic approach to elucidate the global spread of human influenza subtype H3N2 and assess its ability to predict the spatial spread of human influenza A viruses worldwide. Using a framework that estimates the migration history of human influenza while simultaneously testing and quantifying a range of potential predictive variables of spatial spread, we show that the global dynamics of influenza H3N2 are driven by air passenger flows, whereas at more local scales spread is also determined by processes that correlate with geographic distance. Our analyses further confirm a central role for mainland China and Southeast Asia in maintaining a source population for global influenza diversity. By comparing model output with the known pandemic expansion of H1N1 during 2009, we demonstrate that predictions of influenza spatial spread are most accurate when data on human mobility and viral evolution are integrated. In conclusion, the global dynamics of influenza viruses are best explained by combining human mobility data with the spatial information inherent in sampled viral genomes. The integrated approach introduced here offers great potential for epidemiological surveillance through phylogeographic reconstructions and for improving predictive models of disease control.","The emergence and worldwide dispersal of novel human pathogens is increasingly challenging global public health [1] .

Notable recent examples include novel influenza strains, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus and Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, which all exploit today's complex and voluminous transport networks to rapidly disseminate in a globalized world. In the context of human infectious diseases, the worldwide air transportation network is by far the best studied system of global mobility [2] . Air travel likely drives the global circulation of seasonal influenza A (H3N2) viruses [3] , and may explain seasonal dynamics in the absence of locally-persistent strains between epidemic seasons. Retrospective modeling of the 'Hong Kong flu' H3N2 pandemic in 1968 indicates that the virus spread through a global network of cities interconnected by air travel [4] . Numerous modeling and simulation studies have subsequently explored the potential influence of air travel on influenza virus spread, e.g. [5] [6] [7] [8] , but few have attempted to verify such models against underlying empirical data on human movement patterns [9] .

Two studies on the timing and rate of seasonal influenza transmission across the United States of America (USA) highlight the difficulty of using standard epidemiological data to disentangle the relative contributions of different human transportation systems to influenza spread. Using weekly time series of excess mortality due to pneumonia and influenza (P&I), Viboud et al. [9] demonstrated that the patterns of timing and incidence of outbreaks across the continental USA are most strongly associated with rates of movement of people to and from their workplaces, and to a lesser extent with the distance between locations and various measures of domestic transportation. In contrast, Brownstein et al. [10] concluded that the rate of inter-regional spread and timing of influenza in the USA, as measured using weekly P&I mortality statistics, is predicted by domestic airline travel volume in November. These discordant findings generated significant debate [11] , especially in the context of a potential pandemic of pathogenic influenza [12] , which would require rapid decisions to be made on the implementation of travel restrictions.

As a historical record of epidemic spread, viral genetic sequence data may offer a valuable source of information for the empirical verification of epidemiological models. Several studies have demonstrated their utility and power, for example by revealing the genetic dynamics of influenza A H3N2 seasonality [13] and the spatial patterns of global H3N2 circulation [3, 14] . More generally, it is recognized that the genetic diversity of rapidly evolving viruses like influenza should be analysed in a framework that unifies evolutionary and ecological dynamics [15] . Current attempts to reconstruct viral spread through time and space from genetic data, however, typically fit parameter-rich models to sparse spatial data and result in phylogeographic patterns that are difficult to relate directly to underlying ecological processes [16] . Together with potential sampling bias, this complicates phylogeographic tasks, such as the characterization of source-sink dynamics in seasonal influenza. It is therefore unsurprising that different studies on the global circulation of H3N2 are sometimes inconsistent [3, 14, 17] , despite the importance of such work for influenza surveillance and vaccine strain selection.

Here we use a model-based approach to explicitly tests spatial epidemiological hypotheses by integrating empirical data on human movement patterns with viral genetic data. This framework enables us to measure the relative contribution of different predictive variables to viral spatial spread. We apply this approach to seasonal H3N2 dynamics and use it to identify key drivers of the global dissemination of influenza viruses. Analysis of different sampling schemes, including one that represents the community structure in global air transportation, provides consistent support for air travel governing the spatial dynamics of seasonal H3N2 infections. Using epidemiological simulations, we further demonstrate that estimates resulting from the merger of human air travel and H3N2 influenza genetics best capture the observed global expansion of pandemic H1N1 influenza in 2009.

We complemented a previously collected hemagglutinin sequence data set, comprising 1,441 sequences sampled globally from 2002 to 2007 [3] , with publicly available sequences sampled within the same time interval. The allocation of the sequence data into 15 and 26 geographic regions as well as into 14 air communities is described in detail in Supporting information Text S1.

The worldwide air transportation network is defined by a passenger flux matrix that quantifies the number of passengers traveling between each pair of airports. We use a dataset provided by OAG (Official Airline Guide) Ltd. (http://www.oag.com), containing 4,092 airports and the number of seats on scheduled commercial flights between pairs of airports during the years 2004-2006. We take the number of seats on scheduled commercial flights from airport i to j to be proportional to the number of passengers traveling.

To identify air transportation communities, we approximate a maximal-modularity subdivision of the 1,227-largest-airport network by employing a recently described stochastic Monte-Carlo approach [18] . Modularity provides a measure of how well the connectivity of a network is described by partitioning its nodes into non-overlapping groups; for a definition we refer to [19] . For any given partition, modularity will be high if connectivity within groups is high and connectivity among groups is low. For large networks, a variety of methods have been introduced to approximate their optimal subdivision. The method we employ here generates an ensemble of high modularity subdivisions and computes the consensus in this ensemble by superposition. For further details we refer to [18, 20] and in Text S1 we describe how we incorporate subdivision uncertainty in our phylogeographic approach.

We employ a novel approach to simultaneously reconstruct spatiotemporal history and test the contribution of potential predictors of spatial spread. The approach extends a recently developed Bayesian method of phylogeographic inference [21] into a generalized linear model (GLM), by parameterizing each rate of among-location movement in the phylogeographic model as a log linear function of various potential predictors. For each predictor j, the GLM parameterization includes a coefficient b j , which quantifies the contribution or effect size of the predictor (in log space), and a binary indicator variable d j , that allows the predictor to be included or excluded from the model. We estimate the d variables using a Bayesian stochastic search variable selection (BSSVS) [22, 23] , resulting in an estimate of the posterior inclusion probability or support for each predictor. This approach uses the data to select the explanatory variables and their effect sizes from a pre-defined set of predictors that can explain the phylogenetic history of among-location movement while simultaneously

What explains the geographic dispersal of emerging pathogens? Reconstructions of evolutionary history from pathogen gene sequences offer qualitative descriptions of spatial spread, but current approaches are poorly equipped to formally test and quantify the contribution of different potential explanatory factors, such as human mobility and demography. Here, we use a novel phylogeographic method to evaluate multiple potential predictors of viral spread in human influenza dynamics. We identify air travel as the predominant driver of global influenza migration, whilst also revealing the contribution of other mobility processes at more local scales. We demonstrate the power of our inter-disciplinary approach by using it to predict the global pandemic expansion of H1N1 influenza in 2009. Our study highlights the importance of integrating evolutionary and ecological information when studying the dynamics of infectious disease.

reconstructing the ancestral locations in the evolutionary history. In Text S1, we (i) provide more mathematical detail of the GLM model, (ii) describe novel transition kernels for efficient statistical inference, (iii) propose prior specifications and (iv) explain how Bayes factors can be calculated for each predictor based on d estimates. The method introduced here is implemented in the BEAST software package [24] .

The GLM approach offers many statistical advantages over other approaches [25] in efficiently testing spatial hypotheses (see Text S1 for a detailed comparative analysis). Commonlyused Bayesian measures of model fit (such as marginal likelihood estimation using the harmonic mean), which can be applied to models with among-location movement rates fixed to a particular predictor, have been shown to perform poorly [26] [27] [28] . Although more accurate alternatives have recently been proposed [26] [27] [28] , they are computationally prohibitive on large data sets such as those studied here. Importantly, the previous approach provides only a relative ranking of different models and, unlike the GLM model, cannot identify which of the top-ranked predictors need to be jointly considered as explanatory variables. A further advantage of the GLM approach is that in addition to providing a measure of support for each predictor, it can also quantify the contribution or effect size of each predictor by estimating the associated coefficients (b).

For the spread of seasonal influenza, we consider several potential predictors of global migration, including different logtransformed measures of geographical distance, absolute latitude, air transportation data, demographic and economic data, viral surveillance data, antigenic evolution and sequence sample sizes (described in more detail in Text S1). Text S1 also reports the evolutionary and demographic models used in BEAST and describes how phylogenetic uncertainty is approximated during phylogeographic inference.

Phylogeographic movement events among locations are modeled by a continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) process along each branch of the viral phylogeny. Although both the transitions among locations (Markov jumps) and the waiting times between transitions (Markov rewards) are not directly observed, posterior expectations of these values can be efficiently computed [29, 30] . Here, we implement posterior inference of the complete Markov jump history through time in BEAST and use these estimates to assess the source-sink dynamics of influenza and to evaluate the predictive performance of phylogeographic models.

To compare the performance of different migration rate models in predicting global pandemic spread, we simulate a stochastic meta-population susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model with n = 14 populations, matching the 14 air communities analyzed in the phylogeographic model. The model tracks the number of susceptible (S), infected (I) and recovered (R) individuals in each population each day of the simulation. The simulations begin with a single initial infection in Mexico on January 5th 2009 [31] . Infection spreads through mass-action within each population according to the following epidemiological parameters. Population-specific host population size is equal to human population size (Text S1). Basic epidemiological parameters are based on empirical estimates from H1N1: the duration of infection was chosen as 3 days [31] and the basic reproductive number (R 0 ) or average number of secondary infections arising from a primary infector during their infectious period in a completely susceptible population was chosen as 1.3 [31] . This results in a transmission rate b~0:433. Although estimates of R 0 for pandemic H1N1 vary across studies, the exact R 0 value is unlikely to affect the comparative simulations we perform as this is expected to equally impact the overall expansion rate and not the relative migration dynamics across populations. Force of infection l j within population j scales with infected frequency across populations following l j~P n i~1 r ij bI i S j =N j , where the coupling coefficient r ij represents the rate of contacts from population i to population j relative to within-population contacts and r jj~1 . Other pairwise coupling coefficients are taken to be proportional to pairwise migration estimates, so that r ij~c m ij , where m ij is the air travel based or phylogenetically estimated rate of migration from population i to population j per year and parameter c is fitted to the data. Parameter c is the only free parameter in this model and we set this to the value that maximizes correspondence between simulations and observations (see below). This ensures that we can use phylogeographic migration rates as per capita migration rates in the simulation model, despite their different scales. Compartments are updated according to a t-leaping algorithm [32] with one-day intervals.

Migration rates between populations in the SIR model are defined according to four scenarios, as follows: (A) equal rates, (B) rates proportional to the amount of air travel occurring between them (in terms of the number of passengers moving from one population to another), (C) rates proportional to Markov jump estimates based on a standard phylogeographic model (undertaken with and without BSSVS to reduce the number of rate parameters) and (D) a GLM model that only considers air travel as a predictor. To compare the spread of influenza under these simulated models to recorded H1N1 pandemic spread, we measure the relative correspondence between the mean peak times (across 100 simulations) and the observed peak times for all locations except Mexico (based on World Health Organization data; Text S1). Correspondence was measured using the Spearman's rank correlation coefficient, and tested with associated p-values obtained using a permutation test (Text S1), as well as using the mean average error (MAE; in days). We consider the Spearman's rank correlation coefficients to be more appropriate for our comparison because they are more robust to outliers, which are clearly present in the observed peaks. Therefore, the scaling of between-population coupling c for the various migration matrices was also adjusted so as to maximize Spearman's rank correlation.

To identify key factors in the seasonal dispersal of human influenza viruses, we use a Bayesian model selection procedure to estimate the phylogeographic history of H3N2 viruses sampled worldwide between 2002 and 2007 (Text S1), while concurrently evaluating the contribution of several potential predictors of spatial spread. In addition to considering two geographic discretizations of the available data, we also identify community structure in global air travel by determining partitions with high intracommunity connectivity and low inter-community connectivity (Methods). Although this approach is blind to the airports' geographic locations, the 14 resulting global air communities are spatially compact with few exceptions (Fig. 1) . We find air communities that are largely specific to Oceania, China, Japan, Sub-Saharan Africa, Mexico and Canada. Madagascar, Réunion and some Caribbean destinations are examples of exceptions that are, as non-European locations, connected to a European air community.

Our analysis reveals that many potential predictors of global influenza virus spread are not associated with viral lineage movement, specifically, geographical proximity, demography and economic measures, antigenic divergence, epidemiological synchronity and seasonality do not yield noticeable support (Fig. 2) . Instead, we find consistent and strong evidence that air passenger flow is the dominant driver of the global dissemination of H3N2 influenza viruses. This is reflected in both the estimated size of the effect of this variable (*1 on a log scale) and the statistical support for its inclusion in the model (posterior probability .0.93 and Bayes factor .760). This effect size means that viral lineage movement rates are about 15 times higher for connections with the highest passenger flow compared to connections with the lowest flow, controlling for all other predictors. The result is robust when we repeat the analysis (i) using different partitions of sampling locations (air communities and different geographic partitions, Fig. 2 ), (ii) using different sequence sub-samples for the air communities (Fig. S1 ), (iii) using the full data set or a small but more balanced number of sub-samples (Fig. S2) , and (iv) using a more liberal prior specification on predictor inclusion (Fig. S3) . We down-sampled particular air communities or geographic regions relative to their population sizes (Text S1), which still leaves considerable heterogeneity in sample sizes, explaining why they are included as an explanatory variable in the GLM model. Our aim is not to demonstrate a role for sample sizes in phylogeography, but by explicitly including them as predictive variables, we raise the credibility that other predictors are not included in the model because of sampling bias. We note that the sample size predictors may in fact absorb some of the effect of air travel because a GLM model that only considers passenger flux as a predictor of H3N2 movement among the air communities results in a higher mean effect of size of about 1.5.

To also explore spatial dynamics at smaller scales, we further partition large geographical regions that are administratively coherent, such as the USA, China, Japan and Australia, resulting in 26 global sampling regions (Text S1). In this analysis, air travel again predicts viral movement (posterior probability .0.99 and Bayes factor .18000), but the movement is also inversely associated with geographical distance between locations (posterior probability = 0.76 and Bayes factor = 87), and, less intuitively, with origin and destination population densities (although the size of the latter effects are weaker, Fig. 2 ). The negative association of population density with viral movement may suggest that commuting is less likely, per capita, to occur out of, or into, dense subpopulations.

Although not the main focus of the current study, our integrated approach also provides phylogeographic reconstructions that offer insights into the global source-sink dynamics of human influenza. The trunk or backbone of phylogenies reconstructed from temporally-sampled hemagglutinin genes (Fig. 3) represents the lineage that successfully persists from one epidemic year to the next [14, 33] . We determine the spatial history of this lineage using Markov rewards in the posterior tree distribution, thereby estimating the contribution of each location to the persistence of the trunk lineage from 2002 to 2006 (Fig. 3) . These estimates provide strong support for mainland China as the principal H3N2 source population, occupying close to 60% of the trunk time in the H3N2 phylogenies (Fig. 3) , followed by Southeast Asia, which comprises about 15% of the trunk time. We further examine temporal heterogeneity in the source-sink process by combining a summary of the estimated trunk location through time together with an phylogenetic summary in Fig. 3 impact of temporal sampling heterogeneity on these estimates because the Southeast Asian trunk dominance precedes a period of higher sampling availability for Southeast Asia relative to mainland China (Fig. 3) . The important role of mainland China in seeding the global seasonal spread of human influenza results in a high net migration out of this air community (Fig. S4) . However, air communities that do not contribute significantly to the trunk can also maintain high net outflow, in particular the USA, which may be seeded by relatively few introductions each year whilst exporting comparatively more viruses to other locations during the epidemic season.

In order to assess the extent to which evolutionary analyses such as ours benefit from integrating host mobility data, we examine their predictive performance by using them to predict the relative timing of the geographic spread of the pandemic H1N1 influenza variant that emerged in 2009. We conduct simulations of the spread of a novel pathogen out of Mexico using an SIR model whose transmission parameters are informed by epidemiological estimates obtained for pandemic H1N1 [31] and whose spatial spread is determined by one of four different migration rate models, each defined by a different matrix of movement rates among all pairs of locations (Methods). We measure the relative correspondence between the simulated and observed H1N1 peaks for each location except Mexico using a Spearman's rank correlation coefficient (r) and mean absolute error (MAE; in days) (Fig. 4 ). An equal rates model (A), which does not express any migration rate preference, results in a weak match (r~0:11, P = 0.73, MAE = 40.9 days) between the simulations and the observed spatial spread of H1N1 (Fig. 4) , indicating that the population sizes included in the SIR model for each region offer limited predictive performance. As expected, adding information on the number of airline passengers (model B) yields a large improvement in correspondence between simulations and observations (r~0:61, P = 0.03, MAE = 35.8 days). In contrast, a standard parameterrich phylogeographic model that is only informed by sequence data and not air traffic information (model C) yields only part of this improvement in predictive performance (r~0:47, P = 0.10, MAE = 39.4 days). However, if inference under model C is made more efficient by focusing on a small set of parameters (using BSSVS, [21] ; see Methods) then phylogeographic estimates yield a predictive performance (r~0:62, P = 0.02, MAE = 36.4 days, Fig. S5 ) that is close to that of the air travel model (B). Finally, The inclusion probabilities are defined by the indicator expectations E½d because they reflect the frequency at which the predictor is included in the model and therefore represent the support for the predictor. Indicator expectations corresponding to Bayes factor support values of 10 and 100 are represented by a thin and thick vertical line respectively in these bar plots. The contribution of each predictor, when included in the model (bDd~1), where b is the coefficient or effect size, is represented by the mean and credible intervals of the GLM coefficients on a log scale. NA 1 : no conditional effect size available because the predictor was never included in the model. We tested different population size and density measures, different incidence-based measures and different seasonal measures (Text S1), but only list the estimates for a representative predictor for the sake of clarity. The estimates for the full set of predictors are summarized for each sub-sampled data set in Fig. S5 . NA 2 : no indicator expectation or conditional effect size available because the predictor was not available for this discretization of the sequence data. doi:10.1371/journal.ppat.1003932.g002 the GLM model (D) predicts the observed spread of H1N1 more accurately than all other models (r~0:82, P,0.01, MAE = 32.3), suggesting that global influenza transmission is best predicted by combining passenger flux data with the information on viral lineage movement contained in sequence data. The simulations generally correspond better with observed H1N1 peaks during the initial period of pandemic expansion, while the epidemic peaks for Russia and Africa occur significantly earlier in the simulations than in reality. This is likely due to the multi-peaked character of the regional epidemics (Text S1); the H1N1 virus spreads to most of the world during the first pandemic wave, whereas regions like Russia and Africa appeared to miss the first wave entirely. Seasonal effects that are unaccounted for by our simulation may at least partly explain the outliers, but they affect the models we aim to compare in a very similar way. Because of the outliers, we consider the non-parametric Spearman's r to be a more appropriate measure of correspondence than the MAE, but they are consistent in their model ranking. We note that absolute prediction errors can be considerably improved by only considering the 9 air communities that peaked prior to September, 2009, which returns a MAE of 11.2 day for the GLM model. However, because of the difficulties in establishing initial waves and their peaks, and the uncertainty in our epidemiological model, we caution against more detailed interpretation of these simulations beyond the general trends we extract here.

The prevention and control of influenza at the global scale relies critically on our understanding of its mode of geographical dissemination. Here, we demonstrate that such dynamics are most powerfully investigated by combining phylogeographic history with empirical data on the patterns of human movement worldwide. Our analysis strongly suggests that air travel is key to global influenza spread, an intuitive result that has long been predicted by modeling studies (e.g. [5] ), but has, until now, remained difficult to obtain from empirical data. The dominant predictors of influenza spread will undoubtedly be scale-dependent, as indicated here by the importance of geographic distance as a predictor within more confined geographic areas (Fig. 2) , which may represent forms of human mobility other than air travel, such as workplace commuting [9] . This indicates that our statistical framework could also prove valuable in testing hypotheses at smaller scales, where the underlying spatial processes may be less obvious, provided adequate sequence and empirical movement data are available. One of the limitations of the current heterogeneous sampling of H3N2 sequences worldwide is that geographic partitions need to be adjusted to account for the number of samples per location, which results in regions of widely different areas and population sizes. More representative sampling across the globe, or within a more geographically confined area of interest, will allow for more appropriate geographic partitioning and may facilitate more detailed spatial hypothesis testing based on the associated demographic and mobility measures. In particular, if sequences were sampled appropriately then our inference method could incorporate the rich geographic data that is currently available as global gridded population data sets [34] . In addition, many of the predictors used here can be improved in accuracy and resolution, for example by accounting for seat occupancy and actual origin-destination flows in air traffic passenger fluxes.

Due to the difficulties associated with geographic partitioning, we used algorithms to optimally define communities in the global air transportation network as an alternative strategy to specify phylogeographic states, and subsequently show that our GLM results are robust to the different partitions used. Because air travel is a consistent and highly supported explanatory variable for global influenza dispersal, communities within the air transportation network are likely to provide the most appropriate spatial structuring of our data. However, in addition to the partitioning itself, further research is also needed to select the appropriate number of samples from the resulting regions to improve on ad hoc down-sampling based on population size.

Although identifying the causes of pathogen spread is of great importance in spatial epidemiology, integrating this information in evolutionary models also offers major advantages for phylogeographic reconstructions and their relevance to infectious disease surveillance and pandemic preparedness. By capturing a more realistic process of spatial spread, our novel approach results in more credible reconstructions of spatial evolutionary history, which may shed further light on the persistence and migration dynamics of human influenza viruses. Because of the importance of influenza dynamics for vaccine strain selection, different phylogeographic reconstructions have attempted to characterize the global population structure of the virus and have arrived at somewhat mixed findings [3, 14, 17] . This may be explained by the use of both different sampling and different methodology. The data and methods used here corroborate the explorations of antigenic and genetic divergence by [3] and demonstrate the prominence of mainland China and Southeast Asia as locations of trunk lineage persistence. Our findings are however based on roughly the same genetic data, and our approach of inferring the spatial history of the trunk lineage through Markov reward estimates may be viewed as the more direct, statistical equivalent of measuring strain location distance from the trunk [3] . Although we find a strong signal for the presence of the trunk lineage in mainland China and Southeast Asia, our analysis is restricted to the period 2002 to 2006, and thus we make no conclusions about the location of the trunk lineage outside of this period. The degree of temporal stochasticity in the source location of seasonal influenza and its heterogeneity among different influenza variants has yet to be determined and requires datasets of longer duration. Moreover, we suggest that analyses of future data sets that are more comprehensively sampled through time will also benefit from phylogeographic models that can accommodate temporal heterogeneity in movement rates. Such models may also improve the performance of some explanatory variables. For example, in the analysis presented here, we do not consider the absence of support for seasonality as a predictor in our GLM model as evidence against seasonality in H3N2 spread. Rather, it simply reflects the difficulty in incorporating seasonality into a time-homogeneous model of lineage movement. Developments are now underway to appropriately accommodate heterogeneity in spatial spread through time.

By using models to predict the observed global emergence of pandemic H1N1, we demonstrate that an approach that integrates passenger flux data with viral genetic data provides a more accurate prediction of global epidemic spread than those which include only one source of information. Although the prediction improvement of the combined data over the passenger flux data alone is not very large, it remains remarkable because we attempt to predict the spatial expansion of an epidemic lineage (pandemic H1N1) from the seasonal dynamics of another lineage (H3N2) and because the main process underlying the global dispersal of H3N2 influenza appears to be air travel itself. Passenger flux data among pairs of locations is symmetric, thus it is possible that the phylogeographic data is capable of capturing asymmetry in the seasonal process of viral spread, which may also be important in explaining the spatial expansion of pandemic H1N1. Investigations using more advanced simulation techniques, e.g. [35] , may be able to build upon the conceptual bridge between genetic data and epidemiological modeling implied by our findings. Future prediction efforts may also need to focus on alternative scenarios of spatial spread, as highlighted by the recent emergence of a novel avian influenza H7N9 lineage in China [36] . Should this virus evolve sustained human-to-human transmissibility, then airline-passenger data and flight routes from the outbreak regions in particular, would be able to pinpoint worldwide regions of immediate risk. If the virus remains restricted to avian hosts, however, risk maps for the transmission of avian influenza viruses (perhaps based on predictors calibrated against H5N1 avian influenza) may help to target H7N9 surveillance and control efforts. In conclusion, our framework is applicable to different infectious diseases and provides new opportunities for explicitly testing how host behavior and ecology shapes the spatial distribution of pathogen genetic diversity.

These sub-samples were obtained by randomly down-sampling the four locations with the highest number of samples relative to their population size for each sampling year. The inclusion probabilities are defined by the indicator expectations E½d because they reflect the frequency at which the predictor is included in the model and therefore represent the support for the predictor.

If the inclusion probability is zero for a predictor, no corresponding GLM coefficient is shown. We tested different population size and density measures, different incidencebased measures and different seasonal measures (Text S1), but only list the estimates for a representative predictor for the sake of clarity.

The inclusion probabilities are defined by the indicator expectations E½d because they reflect the frequency at which the predictor is included in the model and therefore represent the support for the predictor. As opposed the analysis reported in main manuscript (Fig. 2) , which specifies a prior probability of 0.019 on each predictor's inclusion, we here specify a prior probability of 0.5 on the inclusion of each predictor. Indicator expectations corresponding to Bayes factor support values of 3 and 20 are shown as a thin and thick vertical line respectively in these bar plots. The contribution of each predictor, when included in the model (bDd~1), where b is the coefficient or effect size, is represented by the mean and credible intervals of the GLM coefficients on a log scale.

We tested different population size and density measures, different incidence-based measures and different seasonal measures (Text S1), but only list the estimates for a representative predictor for the sake of clarity. NA 2 : no indicator expectation or conditional effect size available because the predictor was not available for this discretization of the sequence data. A comparison with the analysis reported in main manuscript (Fig. 2) indicates that our results are robust to the prior specification for the inclusion probabilities; only the scale of the Bayes factor support shifts to lower values because of the higher prior odds (1:1 as opposed to 0.019:0.981) in this case.

Successful establishment and global dispersal of genotype VI avian paramyxovirus serotype 1 after cross species transmission,"The evolutionary history of avian paramyxovirus serotype 1 (PMV1), which includes the agents of Newcastle disease (ND), is characterized by a series of strain emergence events since viruses in this family were first recognized in the 1920s. Despite the importance of ND to the poultry industry, little is known about PMV1 strain emergence events and the subsequent dispersal and evolution of new strains. The genotype VI-PMV1 was first identified in the 1980s and has been named pigeon paramyxovirus-1 (PPMV1) because of unusual host specificity with Columbiformes (Collins et al., 1996); it has been responsible for panzootics in both chickens and pigeons during that time. Here, we used evolutionary analyses to characterize the emergence of this contemporary PMV1 lineage. We demonstrate that GVI-PMV1 arose through cross-species transmission events from Galliformes (i.e. chicken) to Columbiformes, and quickly established in pigeon populations. Our studies revealed a close association between the time of viral emergence and panzootic events of this virus. The virus appeared first in Southeastern Europe and quickly spread across the European continent, which became the epicenter for global virus dissemination.","The number of emergent or re-emergent infectious viral diseases that are linked to cross-species transmission from reservoirs to naive hosts is increasing in both animals and humans (Woolhouse, 2008) . Notable examples include emergence of avian and swine influenza viruses, henipaviruses, and the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus. The mechanisms in viral emergence are complex and include ecological, immunological, and genetic features of both virus and host (Lloyd-Smith et al., 2009; Parrish et al., 2008) . Although the dispersal of viruses in humans following zoonotic transmission can be documented by integrating epidemiological data with virus sequence data, the events that precede productive viral infection in a new host are more difficult to untangle (Lloyd-Smith et al., 2009) . Similarly, cross-species transmissions among animal species leading to successful strain emergence are poorly understood. With the increased availability of genetic data and associated temporal and geographic information from improved surveillance effort, it is now possible to obtain insights of inter-species transmission dynamics that give rise to new viral strains, which pose health risks in animals.

Avian paramyxovirus serotype 1 (PMV1) is a negative-sense single stranded RNA virus in the family Paramyxoviridae. It is best known for causing outbreaks of Newcastle disease (ND), a source of significant economic loss to the poultry industry worldwide. In the 1950s, 30 years after the first reported PMV1 outbreak, modified live vaccines derived from the dominant circulating strain were deployed to prevent and control the disease (Alexander, 1988a) . Subsequently, a series of new strains have emerged from unknown sources that contribute to the ND global burden. There are now at least ten reported genotypes of PMV1 contributing to the extensive genetic diversity in avian populations worldwide (Aldous et al., 2004; Jestin, 2003, 2005; Diel et al., 2012; Infection, Genetics and Evolution j o u r n a l h o m e p a g e : w w w . e l s e v i e r . c o m / l o c a t e / m e e g i d Kommers et al., 2001; Liu et al., 2006; Mase et al., 2009; Meulemans et al., 2002; Panshin et al., 1999; Servan de Almeida et al., 2009; Sleeman, 2010; Tsai et al., 2004; Ujvari et al., 2003; Zhu et al., 2010, http://www.worldpoulty.net/) . Understanding the mechanism of successful strain emergence in PMV1 can inform efforts to control ND and other viral diseases with similar evolutionary dynamics that threaten domestic and wild birds.

In the late 1970s, a distinct strain of PMV1 was sporadically isolated from pigeons in proximity to ND outbreaks in chickens Alexander et al., 1985a; Kaleta et al., 1985; Kaleta and Baldauf, 1988; Stewart, 1971 ). The new virus, called pigeon-associated PMV1 (PPMV1), was initially presumed to be of chicken origin and to infect pigeons only as a result of sporadic spill over events. However, in 1984, multiple ND outbreaks in Great Britain were initiated by PPMV1 and spread from pigeons to chickens (Alexander et al., 1985b) . Subsequently, PPMV1 has been responsible for other chicken ND outbreaks worldwide (Aldous et al., 2004; Capua et al., 2002; Kommers et al., 2001; Liu et al., 2006; OIE, 2011a,b; Toro et al., 2005; Werner et al., 1999) and has caused extensive panzootic infections in racing pigeons in European countries despite vaccination efforts (Alexander et al., 1997; Kommers et al., 2001; Meulemans et al., 2002; Werner et al., 1999; Zanetti et al., 2001) . Genetic analysis of PPMV1 demonstrated that this strain, named genotype VI-PMV1 (GVI-PMV1) (Aldous et al., 2004) , constituted a distinct monophyletic lineage with considerable genetic heterogeneity.

Although virulent PMV1 is considered to be exotic to US poultry, serological data evidenced GVI-PMV1 in ND outbreaks in pigeons during the 1980-1990s (Barton et al., 1992; Pearson et al., 1987; Tangredi, 1988) . A recent molecular study (part of the West Nile Virus Surveillance program) (Kim et al., 2008) also confirmed that GVI-PMV1 is circulating in North American pigeon populations. The evolutionary dynamics of this pathogen in North America remains unclear because of limited sequence data and absence of coordinated national surveillance.

In this study, we aim to understand the events leading to the emergence and the molecular evolution and phylogeography of the new strain. We inferred the evolutionary timescale for the entire GVI-PMV1 lineage with statistical confidence. The chicken-topigeon transmission events leading to the establishment of the major GVI-PMV1 sub-lineage in Columbiformes populations was studied in details. Using advanced phylogenetic methods, we estimated the time and geographic origin of this important cross-species event. To better understand the viral spread in North America, we sequenced the F genes of 74 PMV1 isolates collected in northeastern United States (US) from 2001 to 2009. We demonstrate that there were at least three introductions of GVI-PMV1 into North America, including one associated with Eurasian collared doves. We also provide evidence for viral population expansion in one of the two circulating lineages.

The Animal Diagnostic Laboratory at The Pennsylvania State University (PSU-ADL) conducted virus isolation tests on avian cases submitted from Pennsylvania and other states in the US. Bird tissue specimens and swab samples were processed for virus isolation in specific pathogen free (SPF) embryonated chicken eggs (ECE) and/or chicken embryo fibroblast (CEF) cell cultures following described procedures [(Alexander, 1988b) and OIE Terrestrial Manual, 2009 (Manual, 2009 ]. Hemagglutination (HA) and hemagglutination-inhibition (HI) tests were conducted for PMV1 identifi-cation. PMV1 field strains isolated from various avian species at PSU-ADL between 1996 and 2009 were retrieved for this study.

Viral RNA was extracted using the QIAamp Viral RNA extraction kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA-USA) and was reverse transcribed using a specific PMV1 oligonucleotide targeting the 3 0 untranslated region of the genome (5 0 -ACGGGTAGAAGGTGTGAATC-3 0 ) with the Affini-tyScript™ Multiple Temperature Reverse Transcriptase Kit (Stratagene, Santa Clara, CA-USA). PCR amplification was performed targeting the entire coding region of the F gene using two pairs of specific primers (GVI-forward primer: 5 0 -TGCTCGGACCTTCTGTG CTTGTGA-3 0 ; GVI-reverse primer: 5 0 -TGCGGACCTTGTTCTTGCTGC-TAC-3 0 ; GII-forward primer: 5 0 -TGACCGCCGACCACGAG-3 0 ; GIIreverse primer: 5 0 -TCAGGAGAGGCCGATTCAAGTATT-3 0 ) with the TaKaRa Ex Taq Hot Start PCR kit (Clontech, Mountain View, CA-USA). These primer sets also amplify the entire coding region of the HN gene. A total of 74 PMV1 isolates were amplified. PCR products were gel purified using the QIAquick Gel Extraction kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA-USA) and sequenced. Sequences were assembled and edited using the Lasergene DNASTAR software package (DNASTAR Inc. WI, USA). Sequences have been deposited in GenBank (Accession numbers JX901304-JX901377; Table S1 ).

A total of 3631 F gene sequences of PMV1 were downloaded from GenBank in April, 2011 and aligned using Muscle program (Edgar, 2004) . Sequences with length shorter than 240 bp were removed. The 74 PMV1 sequences generated in this study were combined with GenBank sequences, and tested for recombination by RDP2 (Martin et al., 2005) . Putative recombinants, which were confirmed by GARD method (Kosakovsky Pond et al., 2006) , were removed. This resulted in a final data set of 3469 sequences, which included sequences ranging from 240 to 1662 bp. Of these 710 were full-length.

A maximum likelihood (ML) panoramic phylogeny was built from the F gene sequence data set using FastTree v2.1 program (Price et al., 2010) . The GVI-PMV1 lineage (n = 534, with known isolation dates; 512 were longer than 350nt and 108 were fulllength) was identified and extracted from the panoramic phylogeny for further analyses (detailed taxon names are shown in Table S2 ). A refined ML phylogenetic tree of GVI-PMV1 was reconstructed by PhyML v3 program (Guindon et al., 2010) , where the best tree was selected from subtree pruning and regrafting (SPR) and nearest-neighbor interchange (NNI) topological optimizations.

The general time reversible with gamma distribution (GTR + C) nucleotide substitution model was used. Local topological supports were assessed by Shimodaira-Hasegawa (SH) tests (Guindon et al., 2010) . Among the new PMV1 sequences generated in this study, 61 isolates were GVI and the remaining 13 isolates were grouped in genotype II (GII; the genotype to derive vaccine strain). These strains are indicated in Fig. 1A .

The time-scaled phylogeny of GVI-PMV1, along with various evolutionary parameters including substitution rate and population size, were estimated simultaneously by the Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (BMCMC) method implemented in BEAST v1.6.1 program (Drummond and Rambaut, 2007) . Relaxed clock model with uncorrelated lognormal distributed rates was used. Table S5 ). Nomenclatures of GVI-PMV1 grouping used in this study are indicated with right brackets; while the phylogenetic groupings used in (Aldous et al., 2004; Czegledi et al., 2002 and Ujvari et al., 2003) are indicated by grey vertical bars. Numbers adjacent to the selected nodes refer to topological supports summarized in Table 1 Hasegawa, Kishino, and Yano with gamma distribution (HKY + C) and GTR + C nucleotide substitution models were applied separately for comparison. Bayesian skyline demographic model was employed to estimate the effective virus population size over time (Drummond et al., 2005) . Robustness of topology was assessed by the clade posterior probability (PP) in the maximum clade credibility (MCC) tree summarized from the BMCMC analysis. With sampling at every 10 3 steps and disposal of the first 10% of the steps, a total of 10 9 steps were run. Convergence was assessed in Tracer v1.5.1 program (http://beast.bio.ed.ac.uk/Tracer). Uncertainties in BMCMC estimates were indicated by the ranges of the 95% highest posterior density (HPD).

The history of cross species transmissions was investigated using a comparative phylogenetic approach. Depending on the order of the avian species from which the virus sequence was obtained, one of nine discrete states including Columbiformes, Galliformes, Anseriformes, Passeriformes, Psittaciformes, Gruiformes, Struthioniformes, Falconiformes, and 'unknown' was assigned to each sequence. The species states of the sequences can be observed at the tree tips. The unobserved species states of the internal nodes of the MCC phylogeny were estimated using the Fitch parsimony method (Fitch, 1977) implemented in BEAST library (Drummond and Rambaut, 2007) , where the parsimony rule -i.e. minimum state change -was complied in the algorithm. A change of species state between two nodes in the phylogeny was considered a putative cross-species transmission event. In addition, the ancestral host states in the internal nodes were also estimated with the Bayesian trait analysis (Lemey et al., 2009) implemented in BEAST software. In this full Bayesian probabilistic method, host states were treated as discrete traits, and their transitions in the tree were modeled in reversible continuous-time Markov chains.

The GTR + C model was used for the sequence evolution and other BMCMC model specifications were similar to those described in Section 2.5.

The phylogeography of GVI-PMV1 was studied using a comparative phylogenetic approach similar to that described above. Briefly, unobserved ancestral geographic (discrete) states in the internal tree nodes were inferred based on the observed isolation localities (categorized as discrete states in a regional basis, i.e. either North America, Asia, Europe, South Africa or Middle East; see Table S3 ) of the sequences in the MCC phylogeny, using the Fitch parsimony method (Fitch, 1977) . The history of geographic dispersion of the virus was reconstructed by tracing the changes of the estimated geographic states from the tree root to tips. These changes were considered as the dispersion events of the virus. Moreover, the ancestral geographic states in the internal nodes were estimated with the Bayesian phylogeographic analysis, treating localities as discrete traits (Lemey et al., 2009 ) using a similar approach to the host trait analysis described above.

To extrapolate finer resolution of ancestral geographic regions and migration trajectory of GVI-PMV1, geographic localities of the sequences were taken as continuous variables of the average latitudes and longitudes (according to CIA World Factbook; http://www.maxmind.com/app/country_latlon) of the countries where the viruses were isolated. Multivariate diffusion models (Lemey et al., 2010) , employing uniform rates and variable rates of lognormal, gamma and Cauchy distributions of random walks were applied independently in the BMCMC analysis (with GTR + C) using the BEAST program, to reconstruct the ancestral geographic states (continuous variables, as latitude and longitude) in the phylogeny. Other BMCMC model specifications were set similarly as described above. The best-fit diffusion model was selected by the Bayes factor test.

The Slatkin-Maddison test (Slatkin and Maddison, 1989) , which is a discrete parsimony approach, was used to test the hypothesis of random mixing (i.e. panmixis) for the dispersion of GVI-PMV. Under the assumption of panmixis, the expected number of migration (E) was the parsimony state change estimated from the phylogeny with random shuffling of the geographic locations among the taxa. A distribution of E was generated by random shuffling 10,000 times. If the observed number of migrations (O) were significantly less than those expected in panmixis (E), then we conclude that the virus movement was restricted.

The gene flow frequency of GVI-PMV1 between each pair of discrete geographic states was determined by estimating the scaled Slatkin-Maddison's ''s'' as previously described (Lam et al., 2012b) . Briefly, O was divided by E, which was generated by randomly shuffling the taxa locality in a pair-wise manner, to accommodate unequal sampling frequencies in different geographic states. In our case, only viruses isolated within one-year prior or after their isolation were shuffled to generate E values, to avoid generating excessive E that is unlikely to occur in panmixis due to the time-space difference between samples. To investigate the effect by excessive numbers of European sequences in our data set, random sub-samplings (n = 10) of European sequences were performed to create smaller data sets in which the number of European sequences at most equals the largest number of samples from other localities in each year. The analysis of gene flow frequency was applied similarly in these randomly sub-sampled data sets. Furthermore, a Bayes factor test was performed to identify statistically supported gene flows from a Bayesian stochastic search variable selection (BSSVS) procedure in the BMCMC phylogeographic analysis (Lemey et al., 2009 ).

In the panoramic phylogeny of PMV1 (Fig. 1A) , all genotypes except III, IV, VIII and IX formed distinct monophyletic lineages. GVI shares a most recent common ancestor (MRCA) with GVII. They have comparable intra-genotypic diversities (0.0423 [95% CI: 0.0132-0.1071] and 0.0538 [0.0108-0.0945] substitutions per site for GVII and GVI, respectively). There was a strong positive linear correlation between genetic divergence of GVI-PMV1 and their isolation dates (Fig. S1 ), suggesting that viruses in this lineage were evolving at a relatively constant substitution rate and that applying a molecular clock would yield a reliable time-scale of GVI-PMV1 evolutionary history.

In the estimated time-scaled phylogeny based on most available F gene sequences (n = 3,469) (Fig. 1A) , the MRCA of all existent GVI-PMV1 (n = 534) was dated to 1959 (HPD = 1948 (HPD = -1965 ; Node 1 in Fig. 1B ; Table 1 ). The GVI-PMVI lineage has two sub-lineages, denoted as GVIa and GVIb, which were primarily associated with chicken and pigeon hosts, respectively ( Fig. 1B; detailed taxon names are shown in Fig. S2 and Table S2 ). The GVIa sub-lineage is comprised of a GVIai subgroup, which appeared around 1965 (HPD = 1960 (HPD = -1968 ; Node 2 in Fig 1B) in Eastern Asia, with local spread evidenced by a cluster of isolates from Korea (Green block; PP = 1.00). A European subgroup diverged from the Eastern Asian clusters around 1971 (HPD = 1968 (HPD = -1973 ; Node 21 in Fig. 1B ; Table S4 ), and caused sporadic ND in chickens in Western Europe and Bulgaria in the mid-1990s [designated as 'GVIc' by Czegledi et al. (2002) and Ujvari et al. (2003) ]. A number of sparsely distributed non-chicken isolates (color coded branches indicating different bird orders in Fig. 1B) is observed in the GVIai subgroup, suggestive of sporadic but unsustained cross-species transmissions from chickens. The phylogeny based on a mixture of full and partial F gene sequences (Fig. 1B) is consistent with that inferred from a smaller data set of exclusively full-length F gene sequences (n = 120), and of full-length HN gene sequences (n = 39) (Fig. S3) .

After the GVIai and GVIaii subgroups emerged in chicken populations at around 1965 and 1963 (Node 2 and 3 in Fig. 1B ; Table 1) , there was a successful chicken-to-pigeon transmission event that is associated with the divergence of a pigeon-associated GVIb sublineage from GVIaii ( Fig. 1B ; Nodes 4-7; species illustrated as colored branches in Fig. 1B and D) . We applied the parsimony rule to determine the scenario with the least number of possible viral cross-species transmission steps to account for the successful viral introductions from Galliformes (i.e. chicken) to Columbiformes. Two equally plausible scenarios (red dashed box in Fig. 1B and in Fig. 1D ) exist. In one scenario (Fig. 1B) , the first successful transmission from Galliformes to Columbiformes is estimated to have occurred around 1967 (HPD = 1962 (HPD = -1970 , at the branch from node 4 to node 5). This scenario presupposes backward transmission events from Columbiformes to Galliformes, the first around 1971-1973 (see node 20 in Fig. 1B ; Table S4 ) is characterized by two isolates from Bulgaria in 1974-1982 and the second in Sudan, Kenya and Tanzania in 1969-1971 (between nodes 6 and 23 in Fig. 1B ; Table S4 ); these strains persisted until the 1990s. An equally parsimonious scenario (Fig. 1D) suggests that the major event of Galliformes-to-Columbiformes transmission that gave rise to the current GVIb sublineage occurred around 1970 (HPD = 1965 (HPD = -1974 ; between node 6 and 7) and requires two additional transmissions from Galliformes to Columbiformes in Turkey in 1995 and in a geographically confined lineage of viruses found in Central/Eastern Europe from 1995-2010 (node 20 in Fig. 1D ; Table S4 ). The result of the Bayesian discrete trait analysis supports this second parsimony scenario -i.e. the major cross-species event occurred between node 6 and 7 (Table 1) .

After the successful introduction of PMV1 into Columbiformes, there were numerous sporadic pigeon-to-chicken transmissions (n = 14) and a smaller number of sporadic transmissions to other avian species including Anseriformes (n = 3), Psittaciformes (n = 6) and Passeriformes (n = 1). Many of these cross-species events were represented by only one or two isolates, suggesting that GVIb-PMV1 could not successfully transmit in non-Columbiformes or that these species are poorly represented in surveillance efforts.

We estimated the geographic origins of the major cross-species transmissions from chicken that resulted in successful adaptation of the GVIb lineage in pigeons. Nodes 4-7 in the phylogenetic tree (Fig. 1B) represent hypothetical virus ancestors in which such cross-species events might have occurred. Based on BMCMC estimation of geographic regions as discrete states, the posterior probabilities that Middle East, Europe, or South Africa were estimated in node 4 are 0.002, 0.993 and <0.001, respectively; 0.003, 0.997, and <0.001, respectively for node 5; <0.001, 0.963, and 0.017, respectively for node 6; and 0.02, 0.979, and 0.001, respectively for node 7. To increase the precision of geographical information used for analyses, we employed a recently developed Bayesian continuous diffusion model (Lemey et al., 2010) where the latitudes and longitudes of sequence isolations were used as inputs to estimate the location coordinates of ancestral nodes, by assuming variable spatial diffusion rates among branches. The relaxed random walk (RRW) model with gamma distributed rate variation was the best-fit model according to Bayes Factor tests (lnBF > 3), in which nodes 4-7 were estimated to Southeastern Europe (Table S5 ) with posterior probabilities of 0.994, 1, 0.99, and 0.864, respectively. This result is consistent with the detection of the earliest pigeon isolate of GVI-PMV1 in Iraq. Notably, the latitude and longitude estimates for these nodes were patchy at the country level. Therefore, the estimates were grouped into larger geographic regions (e.g. Southeastern Europe), to avoid potentially biased conclusions.

The adaptation of PMV1 to pigeons coincided with multiple worldwide outbreaks of PMV1 in Columbiformes at the end of the 1970s and extensively in the 1980s and resulted in rapid genetic diversification of this new lineage. The GVIb lineage split into two major extant subgroups (GVIbi and GVIbii; Fig. 1B) in 1978 (HPD = 1974 -1980 Node 8) and 1975 (HPD = 1972 -1978  Node 10) respectively. The GVIbi subgroup has diversified into three clades, termed 'a', 'b', and 'c', which is in agreement with the grouping proposed by Aldous et al. (2004) . There is some geographic structure to this subgroup; GVIbi-a consists of viruses isolated from America and Eurasia, GVibi-b is dominated by Italian isolates with a substantial numbers of Central/Eastern European viruses, and GVIbi-c is mainly restricted to UK and Irish isolates.

GVIbii has diversified into four major clades, termed 'd', 'e', 'f', and 'g', with notable spatial structure due to sampling of small transmission clusters (color blocks; Fig. 1B ). Ujvari et al. (2003) named this group 'recent European viruses' VIb/1(EU/re). European isolates are basal to the GVIbii strains derived from outbreaks in other international locations (Fig. 1B) .

Based on F gene sequences of GVI-PMV1, we tested whether there was significant restriction to viral gene flow between different continents (i.e. random mixing), using the Slatkin-Maddison test. The mean number of observed geographical state change (O) values for all geographical state pairs (see Section 2.) was significantly lower than the null distribution of geographical state changes (E) value under panmixis (p < 0.0002). This suggests that geographical structure existed in the GVI-PMV1 population, and hence the viral gene flow between continents was restricted to a significant degree. Using a modified version of Slatkin and Maddison's ''s'' (Lam et al., 2012b) to quantify the level of gene flow, we found that viral gene flow between Europe and other regions was considerably higher (average: 0.287) than the flow among other regions ( Fig. 2; Table S3 ), consistent with Europe being the epicenter of GVIb-PMV1 dispersal. The Bayesian phylogeographic analysis result also identifies gene flows from Europe as topologically significant by Bayes factor tests (lnBF > 3; Table S3 ). There was a weak signature of isolation-by-distance. For example, gene flow between North America and Europe and Asia was higher than gene flow between North America and Middle East and South Africa (Table S3) . Furthermore, GVI-PMV1 gene flow between North America and other regions was less frequent than that among countries in the Eurasian-African continent (on average 0.039; Fig. 2 ; Table S3 ). Similar results were obtained if European samples were randomly down-sampled (see Section 2.) to obtain more geographically balanced data sets.

The F gene of 74 PMV1 samples from several avian species submitted to PSU-ADL were sequenced, and analyzed with the limited North American PMV1-GVI sequences in GenBank (Table S1 ). The GVIbi-a clade was the first to disperse to North American Columbiformes. This small cluster consists of three pigeon isolates from New York and Maryland obtained in 1984, a Japanese chicken isolate, and other Columbiformes viruses detected during the first European panzootic of PMV1 in in the 1980s. There are no contemporary isolates that fall into this cluster, suggestive of lineage extinction.

GVIbii-d ( Fig. 1B and 3A ) was introduced to North America in the late 1980s; this lineage shares ancestry with isolates from China (blue block of GVIbii-d in Fig 1B; blue-colored strain names in Fig 3A) . European isolates form a basal group of GVIbii-d viruses, suggesting that they were introduced from the European continent to other countries, and their subsequent circulation was geographically restricted. The North American cluster consists of samples from Canada, Texas and Mexico collected during the late 1980s and 1990s (PP = 0.91 in Fig. 3A ; yellow and pale blue dots plotted in Fig. 3C ). Our newly obtained US sequences (collected between 2001 and 2007) indicate that these North American strains are still circulating but have diversified locally, leading to geographical clustering. Noteworthy, a long branch preceding this small cluster (node 16, orange block of Fig. 1B; Fig. 3A ) indicates that the ancestral viruses were not sampled during the eight-year period that separates these groups.

The majority of North American isolates are represented within the GVIbii-g clade (Figs. 1 and 3B ), which has an estimated time of introduction around 1996 (HPD = 1994 (HPD = -1999 (node 17, orange block of Fig. 1B) and includes a cluster of strains from Eurasian collared doves. Closely related strains have been recovered from a native US Columbiforme species (mourning dove) and a sick racing pigeon from Minnesota indicating that the US GVbii-g clade has successfully dispersed in several wild and domestic US species.

Within GVIbii-g, there is a clear geographical separation of isolates into Northeastern and Central North America (Fig. 3) . This could be due to multiple introductions of closely related viruses. Alternatively, it is possible that the virus dispersed from a point source into multiple populations that are geographically or ecologically isolated. The Northeastern US monophyletic lineage is comprised primarily of our newly sequenced isolates and one sample each from Quebec and Rhode Island (Kim et al., 2008) . The geographical proximity of the sampling locations (red dots plotted on the map in Fig. 3C) indicates that GVIbii-g effectively dispersed within the Northeastern US over a decade. The Central US cluster consists of Texas and Minnesota isolates (blue dots plotted on the map in Fig. 3C ). Noteworthy, European isolates from Austria and Germany (purple strain name, Fig. 3B ) are basal to the entire cluster of North American isolates within GVIbii-g clade, supporting our result that global dispersal of GVI virus originated in Europe.

Bayesian estimates of the evolutionary rate for the global dataset of GVI-PMV1 (n = 534) based on the F gene are between 1.48 and 1.81 Â 10 À3 substitutions/site/year. The Bayesian skyline plot (BSP), which infers the relative genetic diversity over time, demonstrates an abrupt expansion of the population in the early 1970s, coincident with the time of emergence of both GVIbi and ii subgroups (Fig. 1C) . The population size remained constant or grew slowly for the following 15 years, with a number of small fluctuations. From the 1990s onwards, the global GVI-PMV1 population size has a declining trend. The Bayesian estimates of the evolutionary rates for both North American GVIbii-d and -g clusters are consistent with the global rate, at 1.14-2.34 Â 10 À3 and 1.30-2.14 Â 10 À3 substitutions/site/year, respectively and are comparable to those previously estimated from all PMV1 genotypes (Chong et al., 2010) . In North America, GVIbii-g lineage has experienced exponential-like population growth (Fig. 3C, blue) , and the GVIbii-d lineage has been constant over time (Fig. 3C, red) .

Our studies integrated large amounts of genetic data with associated temporal and geographic information to investigate the emergence and global dispersal of GVI-PMV1. We provide quantitative data that the successful establishment of Columbiformes GVIb lineage occurred in the 1980s, likely in Southeastern Europe, and that the ancestral host was Galliformes. The virus dispersed worldwide from Europe, including multiple introductions into North America.

The ultimate establishment of GVIb in Columbiformes was preceded by a number of sporadic unsuccessful transmissions from chickens to pigeons. Once GVIb became established in Columbiformes, spillovers of GVIb-PMV1 to non-Columbiformes bird species were detected along terminal branches; these included multiple transmissions to Galliformes and Psittaciformes and infrequent spillovers to Anseriformes and Passeriformes. This latter spill over is consistent with the presumed route by which pathogenic viruses including H5N1 influenza and other PMV1 genotypes that circulate in wild birds have been introduced to domestic chickens (Kim et al., 2009; Miller et al., 2010) . However, our data demonstrate that viral strains circulating in wild birds can be derived from domestic poultry, evolve in the new host, and be reintroduced to poultry, providing an additional model to explain epizootic viral emergence in commercial flocks. These data suggest that detection of endemic poultry virus strains in wild and peri-domestic species could presage a virus emergence event.

Establishment of GVIb PMV1 in pigeons was more likely a result of adaptation to the new host than a host range expansion for several reasons. With range expansion, we would expect to observe similarly high associations of contemporary GVIb isolates with both pigeons and chickens. However, both epidemiological reports (Abolnik et al., 2008; Hassan et al., 2010; Pedersen et al., 2004) and our phylogenetic data support that such adaptation is unidirectional host switch and not a range expansion. The observed back transmission from pigeons to chicken may reflect the tight ecological interface between their populations, and possibly a relative lower species barrier. Experimental studies confirm that pigeon derived GVIb strains do not readily infect chickens but, significantly, their ability to infect and cause disease in chickens requires only a few serial passages in chickens (Alexander and Parsons, 1984; Collins et al., 1996; Kommers et al., 2003) . Reverse genetics studies and complete sequence analysis further confirmed that three substitutions in the P and L proteins are sufficient to increase replication efficiency in chickens (Dortmans et al., 2011) . Notably, the number of reports of GVIb-PMV1 in poultry farms is increasing recently (Abolnik et al., 2008; Hassan et al., 2010; Pedersen et al., 2004) . Therefore, it is important to determine whether the natural evolutionary trajectory of GVIb isolates in different regions will result in increased risk of backward transmission into chicken populations.

The global dispersal of GVIb-PMV1 after emergence into Columbiformes was rapid. International and local transportation of birds may have played an important role in spreading the new virus (Alexander et al., 1985a; Kaleta et al., 1985; Stewart, 1971 ). Rapid early dispersal could account for the lineage radiation that took place within the first decade after emergence. The two founding Columbiformes lineages, GVIbi and GVIbii, that branched in the early 1980s, have diversified into several sub-lineages, some of which are still circulating. GVIbii viruses expanded into 28 countries involving Africa, Asia, Europe North America and Oceania continents, whereas GVIbi viruses have been recorded in 20 countries of the same continents except Oceania. The extensive diversity that has occurred in GVIb has confounded nomenclature, and we reconcile our data with that found in the literature (Fig. 1) (Aldous et al., 2004; Czegledi et al., 2002; Kwon et al., 2003; Ujvari et al., 2003) .

Our phylogenetic analysis of migration patterns revealed a strong spatial structure in GVIb-PMV1 globally, which may reflect the geophysical barriers to gene flow between continents following the initial dispersal and establishment of the virus. Recent studies have also demonstrated strong spatial isolation of both low and high pathogenic avian influenza amongst wild and domestic birds (Lim et al., 2012a,b; Wallace and Fitch, 2008) , and suggested that long distance movement was less favored possibly due to migration patterns of wild birds or by trade restrictions imposed at international borders. Increased awareness of the global impact of avian diseases in response to high pathogenic avian influenza could also be impacting the contemporary dispersal patterns of PMV1 genotypes.

Our data indicate that GVIb-PMV1 was introduced to North America from Europe on multiple occasions and the virus is now maintained as an endemic infection in wild (Kim et al., 2008) and domestic birds. The first introduction event of GVIbi-a either failed to sustain in North America, or that the strain was missed by sampling efforts. The identification of GVIbii-d and g clades indicates that there were at least two additional introduction events. Given the extensive dispersal of PMV1 from Europe to other countries, GVIb could have been brought into North America through legal or illegal transport of infected birds. It is noteworthy that GVIbii-g strains have been isolated from the Eurasian collared dove. This invasive species was first identified in Florida in the mid-1980s, likely from escaped captive birds brought into the Bahamas for the pet bird trade in the 1970s (Smith, 1987) . Our phylogenetic data and molecular dating analyses estimate that the North American GVI-PMV1bii-g was introduced in the mid-1990. We cannot confirm whether the Eurasian collared dove was the source of the introduced North American GVIbii-g lineage because there are no samples from the late 1980s from this species. However, the close affiliation of GVIbii-g strains isolated from domestic pigeons, Eurasian collared doves, and mourning doves indicates that collared doves are competent hosts and that their rapid range expansion, which now extends to southern Alaska, could facilitate dispersal of the virus throughout North America.

It is noteworthy that vaccination policy to prevent ND, which is applied in many countries, has not stopped the emergence of new PMV1 strains in domestic birds. The two genotypes responsible for most of the recent ND outbreaks in poultry and wild birds, GVIand GVII-PMV1, diverged from a MRCA in the mid-1960s (Fig. 1A) , approximately a decade after vaccination was implemented. The rapid global dispersal of new genotypes as they emerge implicate human involvement in establishing new viral genotypes, although we cannot rule out the bird migration could contribute in some areas. It is likely that the number of molecular changes that occurred to allow GVIaii viruses to successfully establish in pigeons is small given that only a few changes are needed for GVIb viruses to replicate in chickens. Our data demonstrate that PMV1 has a rapid evolutionary rate and that one of the extant sub-lineages introduced into North America is currently undergoing a population expansion. This suggests that the mixing of Columbiformes species with domestic chickens could facilitate the adaptation of potentially virulent viruses to chickens.

Does spatial proximity drive norovirus transmission during outbreaks in hospitals? Title Does spatial proximity drive norovirus transmission during outbreaks in hospitals?,"To assess the role of spatial proximity, defined as patients sharing bays, in the spread of norovirus during outbreaks in hospitals.","Norovirus is the commonest cause of gastrointestinal infection worldwide [1] . There are between two and three million cases occurring each year in the United Kingdom [2, 3] .

Norovirus commonly presents as outbreaks of diarrhoea and vomiting and frequently reported in hospitals, care-homes, schools and cruise ships [4, 5] . Outbreaks in hospitals are disruptive, often leading to ward or bay closures, staff sickness and cancelled operations [6] .

The cost of nosocomial outbreaks of norovirus to the National Health Service (NHS) in

England was estimated at £115 million in 2002/2003 [6] . More recently the cost in one region in Scotland was estimated at £1.2 million in the two norovirus seasons from 2007-2008 [7] .

Understanding the benefits of infection control measures is problematic, because they are usually instigated as a package with several measures being implemented during an outbreak.

While these interventions are based on sound infection control principles, evaluating their efficacy in trials is difficult and the published literature on norovirus outbreaks does not provide clear evidence of the effectiveness of infection control measures [5] . In observational studies early ward closure has been shown to shorten the mean duration of outbreaks [6, 7] .

There is also evidence that vomiting and the resultant aerosols are important in transmitting the infection. People close to vomiting events, either by being close to the person who initially vomited, or by occupying the same area some time after the initial vomiting event, have a higher infection risk. [8] [9] [10] [11] . However, these analyses are based on single outbreaks or events that led to subsequent infections. Improved understanding of how norovirus spreads in closed environments could lead to better infection control procedures.

The aim of our study was to assess how spatial proximity to a norovirus case is associated with risk of acquiring norovirus gastroenteritis. Our hypothesis was that patients sharing bays (small self-contained areas within wards) with patients with symptomatic norovirus infection were more likely to become infected compared to those who were in another bay or part of the affected ward.

We carried out enhanced surveillance of norovirus outbreaks from all in-patient wards in five tertiary care hospitals serving two cities in England, with a combined catchment of approximately two million people.

We collected data during outbreaks from individual patients on date of onset of illness, symptoms (diarrhoea and/or vomiting), last date of illness for each patient, location on the ward at the time of the patients' symptoms onset (recorded as bed number and bay number) and also the ward type.

For two hospitals, information was recorded on specially designed forms that were completed 

We obtained ward plans for two of the five hospitals, which assisted in locating patients in the ward if only part of the information on patient location was recorded in the outbreak reports. Outbreaks were defined as two or more cases of diarrhoea and or vomiting of infectious origin on a ward occurring within two days of the first case suspected or confirmed to be due to norovirus. A bay is a small self-contained area within a ward. Usually bays contain between two to eight beds. Bays are not the same as individual single bed occupied rooms. Proximity was defined as patients who share a bay.

The analysis is based on a probabilistic reconstruction of chains of transmission (trees) based on the dates of illness onset for patients affected in outbreaks. It makes use of methods developed for SARS transmission and later applied to norovirus [12] [13] [14] [15] . If we knew with certainty who acquired infection from whom it would be straightforward to quantify the role of proximity in norovirus outbreaks, for example, by using regression analysis. However, in practice, transmission events are unobserved, so instead we consider all possible infection trees consistent with the data. We used a previously described approach to calculate the probability, π ij , that patient i was infected by patient j for each pair of infected patients in each outbreak based on onset times and the serial interval distribution (the serial interval is the time from onset of symptoms in case i to case j), without using proximity data [13, 14] .

We then used the matrix of π ij values to simulate 1000 possible infection trees for each outbreak, by assigning the infector of patient i to be patient j with probability π ij.

In these simulations, we assumed that the case with the earliest onset time was the index case and had no infectors on the ward. If more than one patient had the earliest onset date in a given outbreak, we selected the index case from these patients with equal probability in each simulation. For each outbreak k, we used these 1000 simulations to produce a proximity metric, P k , defined as where s ijkl is equal to 1 if patient i was infected by patient j in simulation l of outbreak k and is zero otherwise. The p ijk terms measure proximity between patients i and j in outbreak k. In this application, we consider this to be a binary variable equal to 1 if patients i and j occupied the same bay at the time of first symptom onset of these patients. An overall proximity metric, P, is obtained by summing the P k values.

If people in the same bay pose a greater risk of infecting each other this will tend to lead to larger values of the proximity metric (P). We compared this observed metric with values obtained if proximity was not associated with transmission. This distribution was derived by performing random permutations of the bays of the patients in each outbreak and calculating P k as above for each outbreak. These values were again summed to give an overall proximity metric, S, when proximity was by assumption not an important factor. We repeated this for 1000 random permutations of the patient bays to obtain 1000 sampled proximity metrics.

These 1000 S values therefore represent a sample from the distribution of proximity metrics that would be expected if proximity played no role in spreading the disease during the outbreak. By comparing the 1000 sampled values of S with the observed value P we can evaluate whether transmission is more (or less) likely to occur between patients in close proximity. If proximity is unimportant the observed value of P would be unlikely to be in the tails of the distribution of S. If proximity leads to increased transmission the observed P value would tend to be greater than most of the sampled S values. If proximity leads to decreased transmission (which could occur as a result of enhanced hygiene measures, for example) the observed P value is likely to be smaller than most of the sampled S values. Formally, we can perform a two-sided hypothesis test with a null hypothesis that proximity is not important where the p-value is given by the proportion of sampled S values which are the more extreme than the value observed, P.

A key input for constructing the transmission trees is the serial interval. Our best estimate came from the observed distribution of the difference between first and second onset dates for each outbreak. Often, more than one patient was ill on the first day of the outbreak, so we used the first date of illness onset in the next patient(s) for calculating the serial interval. This gave a mean serial interval of 1.86 days (median 1 day, 95% C.I. 1.6 -2.2 days, obtained by bootstrapping).

We also performed sensitivity analyses using different assumptions. First, we used an estimate from a study of a community outbreak of norovirus at a scouting jamboree, giving a mean serial interval of 3.6 days, with an assumed gamma distribution [13] . We then considered gamma distributions with the same variance (4.1) but with the mean serial intervals varying between 0.5 and 5 days in half day increments. Data were analysed using R [16] . Figure 2 shows the observed proximity metric and the distribution of proximity metrics obtained under the assumption that proximity was not associated with transmission (from the simulated permutations). This shows how the proximity metrics observed relate to the distribution of proximity metrics if distance were not important. The dashed line indicates the observed proximity metric (P) and the bars indicate the distribution of proximity metrics from the simulated permutations. For the model using the serial interval taken from the observed onset dates, the observed metric is outside of the range of the simulated distributions and is highly statistically significant (P = 153.34, p <0.001). With serial intervals of less than 2 days proximity is either outside or at the extreme right of the simulated proximity metrics and the p values ranged from < 0.001 for serial intervals of 0.5 days to 0.01 at a serial interval of 2 days. If we increase the assumed serial interval, the proximity metric moves to within the range expected from the simulated values, and at 3 days the p value was 0.2 (figure 2). Using the gamma probability distribution derived from a community outbreak by Heinje et al [13] (mean serial interval 3.06 days), the proportion of observed proximity values fell within the range that would be expected if proximity were not important.

The results show that the proximity metric (P) was larger than would be expected by chance under the null hypothesis (that proximity is not important) up to a serial interval of 2.5 days (p=0.05). outbreaks on hospital wards. We also performed sensitivity analysis using a serial interval distribution derived from a study of norovirus in children [13] . However, because the degree to which this generalizes to a hospital setting is unclear (intuitively the high contact rates in hospitals would be expected to lead to shorter serial intervals) [17] we explored serial intervals from 0.5 days to four days, whilst constraining the variance. Our results show that for serial intervals of less than 2 days the observed effect of proximity (sharing a bay with someone else who was ill) is very significant (p < 0.001) and for serial intervals up to 2.5 days remained significant at the 5% level. This pattern was similar whether using the observed serial interval distribution from the outbreak data or using a parametric probability distribution.

Our study has some limitations. Although data collection were standardised it is often difficult to assess the accuracy of the date and place that patients were when they became ill.

Specifically, accurate information on patients' positions on a ward was available for 47 percent of the outbreaks. The spatial analysis was undertaken on 65 outbreaks. In addition to the sensitivity analysis we also analysed the data by including outbreaks where onset dates of illness were complete but data on patient location were incomplete (where fewer than 10% of patient data on position was incomplete, 85 outbreaks). We dealt with missing values by allocating a completely separate bay for patients with missing data on location at time of onset. This approach is conservative in that it would underestimate the impact of proximity.

Secondly, we removed the patients from the outbreaks if positional information was missing.

Despite this limitation, the additional models indicated that that the results are robust to 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59  60   F  o  r  p  e  e  r  r  e  v  i  e  w  o  n  l  y   different assumptions about missing data which is evidenced by slightly higher probabilities   obtained when using records with complete information only (Table 1 and figure 3 appendix 1, supplementary information). As a check to demonstrate that the results were not an artefact of the statistical methods, we also ran the models on data where patient position was randomly assigned. This showed no pattern and the proximity measures were not significant for any of these models.

We used more than one approach to modelling the infection trees because of the lack of data on serial interval in norovirus outbreaks. Heinje et al's method used data from child siblings at home. This was a useful starting point but is unlikely to be applicable to transmission in a hospital setting. Therefore, we derived gamma distributions for serial intervals from half a day to four days. The average incubation period for norovirus is considered to be between 24 hours to 48 hours [4, 18] . In our analysis the serial intervals of up to 2.5 days is likely to be a more appropriate time period than the analysis from Heinje et al.

Molecular analysis of stool samples could more definitively link outbreaks, which can help to reveal transmission networks [19, 20] . For example, in this study we have assumed that each ward outbreak was distinct, i.e. all cases within a ward were part of a chain of transmission, but this may not necessarily be true. It is possible for multiple introductions to occur, and some outbreaks may have spread from one ward to another. Genetic characterisation of samples from each ward during possible multiple outbreaks of norovirus would shed light on transmission events and lead to further insight about the direction of transmission, including the possibility that the virus can be moved around the hospital.

Our study focused on patients rather than staff. Our hypothesis was that symptomatic patients who vomit are most likely to contaminate the area close to them and other patients in their vicinity. Obtaining data on staff movements is much more complicated and would only really be practical in a detailed prospective study. The importance of spatial proximity in propagating transmission is consistent with other recent studies [15, 21] . One study which used similar methods to calculate the infection trees [15] suggests that symptomatic individuals are likely to be the drivers of outbreaks of norovirus in hospital settings. Furthermore, the effective reproductive number was significantly higher for symptomatic patients compared to that for symptomatic staff.

Norovirus transmission between people in close contact during sport, both within and between teams, has also been shown to occur [22] as well as airborne transmission through explosive vomiting [23] . One study demonstrated that successive staff working on an aircraft in which a member of the public had vomited also became sick [11] .

Norovirus has a low infectious dose [4, 24, 25] shedding virus occurs during episodes of vomiting, where the virus can become aerosolized and expose others in the vicinity.

Therefore, closing the bay quickly, preventing movement to and from that bay, and immediately paying attention to cleaning areas nearby to initial vomiting events are likely to be effective in preventing further spread. The index of suspicion for patients who become ill should be high and implementing infection control interventions should not be delayed until the results of sampling are received, because this would increase morbidity and prolong the outbreak. New guidelines on controlling outbreaks of norovirus in hospitals and care homes recently released in the U.K.

[26] move away from the need to close wards and operate on a ""manage within bays"" principle. Our study has shown that patients in close proximity to symptomatic patients are at increased risk of becoming infected by these patients.

We have shown a clear role of spatial proximity in the transmission of norovirus in hospital outbreaks. Increasing barriers to movement between bays by closing affected bays promptly would be effective in preventing further spread. 

We would like to thank the infection control staff at the NHS hospitals for providing the data used in this study.

Enhanced surveillance of norovirus outbreaks between November 2009 and November 2011.

Data were gathered during 149 outbreaks of norovirus in hospital wards from five hospitals in two major cities in England serving a population of 2 million. We used the time between the first two cases of each outbreak to estimate the serial interval for norovirus in this setting.

This distribution and dates of illness onset were used to calculate epidemic trees for each outbreak. We then used a permutation test to assess whether proximity, for all outbreaks, was more extreme than would be expected by chance under the null hypothesis that proximity was not associated with transmission risk.

Sixty-five outbreaks contained complete data on both onset dates and ward position. We estimated the serial interval to be 1.86 days (95% confidence intervals 1.6-2.2 days), and with this value found strong evidence to reject the null hypothesis that proximity was not significant (p < 0.001). Sensitivity analysis using different values of the serial interval showed that there was evidence to reject the null hypothesis provided the assumed serial interval was less than 2.5 days.

Our results provide evidence that patients occupying the same bay as patients with symptomatic norovirus infection are at an increased risk of becoming infected by these patients compared with patients elsewhere in the same ward. Norovirus is the commonest cause of gastrointestinal infection worldwide [1] . There are between two and three million cases occurring each year in the United Kingdom [2, 3] .

Norovirus commonly presents as outbreaks of diarrhoea and vomiting and are frequently reported in hospitals, care-homes, schools and cruise ships [4, 5] . Outbreaks in hospitals are disruptive, often leading to ward or bay closures, staff sickness and cancelled operations [6] . [5] . In observational studies early ward closure has been shown to shorten the mean duration of outbreaks [6, 7] .

There is also evidence that vomiting and the resultant aerosols are important in transmitting the infection. People exposed to vomiting events, either by being close to the person who initially vomited, or by occupying the same area sometime after the initial event, have a higher infection risk. [8] [9] [10] [11] . However, these analyses are based on single outbreaks or events that led to subsequent disease. Improved understanding of how norovirus spreads in closed environments could lead to better infection control procedures.

We carried out enhanced surveillance of norovirus outbreaks from all in-patient wards in five tertiary care hospitals serving two cities in England, with a combined catchment of approximately two million people.

We collected data during outbreaks from individual patients on date of onset of illness, symptoms (diarrhoea and/or vomiting), last date of illness for each patient, location on the ward at the time of the patients' symptoms onset (recorded as bed number and bay number) and also the ward type. 

We obtained ward plans for two of the five hospitals, which assisted in locating patients in the ward if only part of the information on patient location was recorded in the outbreak reports. 

The analysis is based on a probabilistic reconstruction of chains of transmission (trees) based on the dates of illness onset for patients affected in outbreaks. It makes use of methods developed for SARS transmission and later applied to norovirus [12] [13] [14] [15] . If we knew with certainty who acquired infection from whom it would be straightforward to quantify the role of proximity in norovirus outbreaks, for example, by using regression analysis. However, in practice, transmission events are unobserved, so instead we consider all possible infection trees consistent with the data. We used a previously described approach to calculate the probability, π ij , that patient i was infected by patient j for each pair of infected patients in each outbreak based on onset times and the serial interval distribution (the serial interval is the time from onset of symptoms in case i to case j), without using proximity data. The serial interval distribution tells us the probability of durations of 0,1, 2,… days between onset in a case and onset in secondary cases infected by this case. Given multiple possible sources for a case, we can use knowledge of this distribution to tell us how likely each is to be the true source. Full technical details are described in Wallinga & Teunis (2004) [12] .

We then used the matrix of π ij values to simulate 1000 possible infection trees for each outbreak, by assigning the infector of patient i to be patient j with probability π ij. In these simulations, we assumed that the case with the earliest onset time was the index case and had no infectors on the ward. If more than one patient had the earliest onset date in a given outbreak, we selected the index case from these patients with equal probability in each simulation. For each outbreak k, we used these 1000 simulations to produce a proximity metric, P k , defined as where s ijkl is equal to 1 if patient i was infected by patient j in simulation l of outbreak k and is zero otherwise. The p ijk terms measure proximity between patients i and j in outbreak k. In this application, we consider this to be a binary variable equal to 1 if patients i and j occupied the same bay at the time of first symptom onset of these patients. An overall proximity metric, P, is obtained by summing the P k values.The value of P (and of P k for individual outbreaks) should be interpreted as a measure of how much transmission occurs between patients in the same bay.

If people in the same bay pose a greater risk of infecting each other this will tend to lead to larger values of the proximity metrics, P, and P k. We compared this observed metric with values obtained if proximity was not associated with transmission. This distribution was derived by performing random permutations of the bays of the patients in each outbreak and calculating P k as above for each outbreak. These values were again summed to give an overall proximity metric, S, when proximity was by assumption not an important factor. We repeated this for 1000 random permutations of the patient bays to obtain 1000 sampled proximity metrics. These 1000 S values therefore represent a sample from the distribution of proximity metrics that would be expected if proximity played no role in spreading the disease during the outbreak. By comparing the 1000 sampled values of S with the observed value P we can evaluate whether transmission is more (or less) likely to occur between patients in Formally, we can perform a two-sided hypothesis test with a null hypothesis that proximity is not important where the p-value is given by the proportion of sampled S values which are the more extreme than the value observed, P.

A key input for constructing the transmission trees is the serial interval. Our best estimate came from the observed distribution of the difference between first and second onset dates for each outbreak, and our primary analysis made use of this empirical serial interval distribution. Often, more than one patient was ill on the first day of the outbreak, so we used the first date of illness onset in the next patient(s) for calculating the serial interval. This gave a mean serial interval of 1.86 days (median 1 day, 95% C.I. 1.6 -2.2 days, obtained by bootstrapping).

We also performed sensitivity analyses using different assumptions. First, we used an estimate from a study of a community outbreak of norovirus at a scouting jamboree, giving a mean serial interval of 3.6 days, with an assumed gamma distribution [13] . We then considered gamma distributions with the same variance (4.1) but with the mean serial intervals varying between 0.5 and 5 days in half day increments. Data were analysed using R [16] . 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 The results show that the proximity metric (P) was larger than would be expected by chance under the null hypothesis (that proximity is not important) up to a serial interval of 2.5 days (p=0.05).

We have detected a strong association where patients who are in the same bay as patients who become ill have a higher probability of themselves becoming ill compared to patients in a different bay. In other words, transmission of norovirus infections is more likely to occur among patients sharing a bay, compared to transmission among patients in different bays.

Whilst this might at first seem an obvious finding, there are competing theories about the transmission of the virus in complex healthcare settings. For example transmission might occur through staff transferring virus on their hands or patients touching infected surfaces with their hands when moving around the wards or the hospital. The strength of our conclusion is sensitive to the assumed serial interval distribution. We used values derived from the dates of onset of illness in patients during outbreaks on hospital wards. We also performed sensitivity analysis using a serial interval distribution derived from a study of norovirus in children [13] . However, because the degree to which this generalizes to a hospital setting is unclear (intuitively the high contact rates in hospitals would be expected to lead to shorter serial intervals) [17] we explored serial intervals from 0.5 days to four days, whilst constraining the variance. Our results show that for serial intervals of less than 2 days the observed effect of proximity (sharing a bay with someone else who was ill) is highly F o r p e e r r e v i e w o n l y significant (p < 0.001) and for serial intervals up to 2.5 days remained significant at the 5% level. This pattern was similar whether using the observed serial interval distribution from the outbreak data or using a parametric probability distribution.

Our study has some limitations. Although data collection were standardised it is often difficult to assess the accuracy of the date and place that patients were when they became ill.

Specifically, accurate information on patients' positions on a ward was available for 44 percent of the outbreaks. The spatial analysis was undertaken on 65 outbreaks. In addition to the sensitivity analysis we also analysed the data by including outbreaks where onset dates of illness were complete but data on patient location were incomplete (where fewer than 10% of patient data on position was incomplete, 85 outbreaks). We dealt with missing values by allocating a completely separate bay for patients with missing data on location at time of onset. This approach is conservative in that it would underestimate the impact of proximity.

Secondly, we removed the patients from the outbreaks if positional information was missing.

Despite this limitation, the additional models indicated that that the results are robust to different assumptions about missing data which is evidenced by slightly higher probabilities obtained when using records with complete information only (Table 1 and   figure_1_supplement ). As a check to demonstrate that the results were not an artefact of the statistical methods, we also ran the models on data where patient position was randomly assigned. This showed no pattern and the proximity measures were not significant for any of these models. In our analysis the estimation of Pk depends upon outbreak size. However we are not interested in the absolute values of P, only in how the value of P calculated with real proximity data compares with the value calculated with randomly generated proximity data (based on a permutation of the bay identities) which will be affected in the same way by outbreak sizes. We also performed a sensitivity analysis, normalising Pk by dividing it by the number of branches in the transmission tree for each network. This gives equal weight to 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59  60   F  o  r  p  e  e  r  r  e  v  i  e  w  o  n  l  y each outbreak and allows Pk to be interpreted as the probability that two linked cases were in the same bay. This did not change the results of the analysis; the P metric still fell well outside of the measure one would expect from the random simulations (p = 0.004, data not shown).

We used more than one approach to modelling the infection trees because of the lack of data on serial interval in norovirus outbreaks. Heijne et al's method used data from child siblings at home. This was a useful starting point but is unlikely to be applicable to transmission in a hospital setting. Therefore, we derived gamma distributions for serial intervals from half a day to four days. The average incubation period for norovirus is considered to be between 24 hours to 48 hours [4, 18] . In our analysis the serial intervals of up to 2.5 days is likely to be a more appropriate time period in a hospital setting, than the analysis from Heijne et al.

Molecular analysis of stool samples could more definitively link outbreaks, which can help to reveal transmission networks [19, 20] . For example, in this study we have assumed that each Our study focused on patients rather than staff. Our hypothesis was that symptomatic patients who vomit are most likely to contaminate the area close to them and other patients in their vicinity. Obtaining data on staff movements is much more complicated and would only really be practical in a detailed prospective study.

The importance of spatial proximity in propagating transmission is consistent with other recent studies [15, 21] . One study which used similar methods to calculate the infection trees [15] suggests that symptomatic individuals are likely to be the drivers of outbreaks of norovirus in hospital settings. Furthermore, the effective reproductive number was significantly higher for symptomatic patients compared to that for symptomatic staff.

Norovirus transmission between people in close contact during sport, both within and between teams, has also been shown to occur [22] as well as airborne transmission through explosive vomiting [23] . One study demonstrated that successive staff working on an aircraft in which a member of the public had vomited also became sick [11] .

Norovirus has a low infectious dose [4, 24, 25] [26] move away from the need to close wards and operate on a ""manage within bays"" principle. Our study has shown that patients in close proximity to symptomatic patients are at increased risk of becoming infected by these patients.

We have shown a clear role of spatial proximity in the transmission of norovirus in hospital outbreaks. Increasing barriers to movement between bays by closing affected bays promptly would be effective in preventing further spread. 

We would like to thank the infection control staff at the NHS hospitals for providing the data used in this study.

Effectively Communicating the Uncertainties Surrounding Ebola Virus Transmission,"The current Ebola virus outbreak has highlighted the uncertainties surrounding many aspects of Ebola virus virology, including routes of transmission. The scientific community played a leading role during the outbreak-potentially, the largest of its kind-as many of the questions surrounding ebolaviruses have only been interrogated in the laboratory. Scientists provided an invaluable resource for clinicians, public health officials, policy makers, and the lay public in understanding the progress of Ebola virus disease and the continuing outbreak. Not all of the scientific communication, however, was accurate or effective. There were multiple instances of published articles during the height of the outbreak containing potentially misleading scientific language that spurred media overreaction and potentially jeopardized preparedness and policy decisions at critical points. Here, we use articles declaring the potential for airborne transmission of Ebola virus as a case study in the inaccurate reporting of basic science, and we provide recommendations for improving the communication about unknown aspects of disease during public health crises.","The current Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak due to Ebola virus (EBOV) infection continues to affect the West African nations of Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Guinea. This outbreak has highlighted the uncertainties surrounding many aspects of ebolavirus virology, including how the virus is transmitted. High mortality and historical case fatality rates, combined with graphic descriptions of the pathology of EVD caused by Ebola virus, have stoked public panic, and a lack of available clinical and public health expertise in treating EVD has led the media to turn to infectious disease scientists for information. This represents a significant involvement in public health efforts by the virology and infectious disease community, on par with the severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak of 2002-2003 and the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic [1, 2] .

A majority of the information presented to news sources has been accurate and factual, helping to inform the public about EVD. However, a small subset of information discussed by scientists has fanned flames of panic among the public, government officials, and policy makers. As professionals with expertise and knowledge, scientists' position of power over the general public (and media) generates a responsibility to convey accurate information [3] . Particularly in areas of scientific inquiry that can be reasonably expected to create a significant public panic-such as commentary on the spread of EVD-scientists must take extra care to convey the radical uncertainty that often surrounds knowledge of emerging infectious diseases.

""Airborne"" Ebola: Potential Pandemic or Tempest in a Teacup?

A particularly concerning lapse in accurate reporting lies in EBOV's transmission. In September 2014, an op-ed piece published in the New York Times (NYT), titled ""What We're Afraid to Say About Ebola,"" [4] asserted that the virology community writ large was ""loath to discuss openly but are definitely considering in private: that an Ebola virus could mutate to become transmissible through the air."" Recent studies have examined the mutation rate of the outbreak and determined that the current strains do not have increased rates of mutation compared to previous outbreaks and that these mutations have no apparent effect on virulence [5] [6] [7] . The claims of the op-ed were repeated in February 2015: an article published in the journal mBio [8] provided a thorough review of the questions still remaining for the current EBOV outbreak. Toward the conclusion of the article, the authors state:

It is very likely that at least some degree of Ebola virus transmission currently occurs via infectious aerosols generated from the gastrointestinal tract, the respiratory tract, or medical procedures, although this has been difficult to definitively demonstrate or rule out, since those exposed to infectious aerosols also are most likely to be in close proximity to and in direct contact with an infected case [8] .

Both articles were syndicated widely, with the NYT piece being covered internationally [9] [10] [11] and the mBio article receiving extensive coverage within the United States [12] [13] [14] . While a number of agencies questioned and critiqued the claims [15, 16] , large media outlets circulated the claims of the op-ed and paper with little to no accompanying criticism.

The mBio article, in particular, draws conclusions that eschew distinctions between aerosolized droplets and airborne droplet nuclei, to dramatic effect. Aerosol transmission involves any transmission mediated by aerosol droplets. Droplets are typically large in size (>5 μm) and cannot travel beyond the immediate vicinity of an infected individual, and they typically are only present in the later stages of EVD [17] . EBOV aerosol transmission is not a given, however, with studies in animal models providing conflicting evidence about the likelihood of transmission [18] [19] [20] . Even less can be said about the airborne transmission of EBOV between humans-that is, transmission that involves droplet nuclei (<5 μm) that can remain suspended in the air for prolonged durations. To date, there have been no studies conclusively demonstrating EBOV aerosol transmission. This is an obvious knowledge gap that needs to become an investigative priority for future response efforts.

Osterholm et al. note these distinctions in the body of their review, yet their conclusions do not match the nuances of aerosol transmission. Moreover, a key claim of theirs-that there is a series of unexplained transmission events in the epidemiological data collected on Ebola virus-does not entail conclusive evidence of novel transmission. There are a number of other plausible reasons for these unexplained events; the most obvious of these is that a self-report of contact history can be unreliable. We don't discount the importance of these points in the context of a scientific review; rather, the reasons for questioning EBOV's transmission mechanisms do not entail the claim that airborne transmission of aerosolized respiratory droplets is likely (or worth considering yet as a matter of public policy).

While the science supporting or refuting the aerosol transmission of EBOV remains unclear, the word ""aerosol"" carries significant weight in public discourse. It is far from clear whether media coverage of these articles has articulated the speculative nature of the claims made by Osterholm et al. Moreover, attempts to push back against these claims after the fact are likely to be met with suspicion; public trust in science is at an all-time low [21, 22] . Given what ""aerosol"" means to members of the public without an infectious disease background, merely suggesting aerosol spread as a route of EBOV transmission without further definition is misleading.

To date, evaluations of the effectiveness of scientific communication during the current EBOV outbreak have been focused on the larger organizations (e.g., WHO, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], etc.) and their shortcomings [23] . However, the basic science community has had a large input into the public discussion surrounding EBOV. The lay public, policy makers, and officials all turn to basic scientists at times of uncertainty, and that creates a difficult situation that should be managed with caution.

Matters of uncertainty are particularly fraught for scientific communication. Low probability events-or even logically or biologically possible events that cannot have probabilities assigned to them, such as a change of EBOV's transmission characteristics-are likely to cause confusion and panic. There is a well-established literature on the psychology of human decisionmaking, suggesting that humans assign higher subjective probabilities to events of great significance [24] . In these circumstances, possibilities become probabilities, and probabilities become likelihoods.

The upshot of this is clear. Simply articulating that we should not assume that an event won't happen becomes a tacit endorsement that the event could happen, along with all the psychological baggage that entails. The startling panic that has occurred in the context of the current Ebola virus disease outbreak is evidence of what does happen when the mere possibility of something occurring provokes a disproportionate response.

The responsibility to communicate well can be derived from a number of sources; for our purposes, the central concern is the vulnerability of others to misunderstandings brought about by an improper communication of risk. Scientists, particularly in infectious disease, generate claims and evidence that are probabilistic in nature. Those scientists, presumably, have gained the skills to interpret scientific evidence and understand what the information doesand doesn't-tell us about the world. These skills, when applied to a broad public forum, generate a responsibility for scientists to do their part to prevent misinformation from spreading; unfortunately, they can do as much harm as good without responsible communication practices.

When communicating more broadly-and in a world of open-source publications, ""broadly"" should be taken as a given-different strategies are required to discharge the responsibility to communicate accurately. The first is epistemic humility: probabilistic claims should be couched in terms that emphasize the risks of false-positives and false negatives. This is particularly important when we are unable to determine the likelihood of our claims being right-or wrong. When there are no probabilities to assign, this lack of knowledge should be emphasized.

Second, language should be chosen to demonstrate relative, rather than absolute, credence in certain claims. In the context of the mBio paper, it would be more useful to make claims about the likelihood that unexplained transmissions were due to errors in reporting, or recall, rather than a new mode of transmission. It is true that we can't demonstrate that these transmissions weren't airborne, but it is likely that we can make a partial ordering of scenarios and identify airborne transmission from within a range of possibilities.

Fortunately, the current EBOV outbreak has not threatened the target audience of these opinions (e.g., United States, Canada, and Mexico), thus limiting the political will to engage in expensive or controversial (e.g., enforced quarantine) public health practices in the name of combating an airborne EBOV. Nonetheless, these commentaries have tremendous potential to impact public health policy and emergency planning moving forward. The potential of EBOV spread via aerosol routes drastically changes health care and public health interventions.

The impact of an airborne EBOV on public health and clinical medicine would entail large structural changes in contact tracing, the use of PPE, and patient isolation. It could also deter people from seeking medical treatment due to concerns about increased transmissibility, which would disrupt efforts to diagnose and treat infected individuals early. Our best response to an Ebola virus outbreak involves rapid contact tracing; a decrease in help-seeking behavior could fuel an outbreak if transmission chains are hidden from public health authorities. Given the immense costs and the possibility of public panic, it is imperative that more research is done before decisions are made. Until then, the life sciences must ensure that when public statements are made to the media, policy makers, and the general public, the most accurate depiction of scientific knowledge-including uncertainty-is conveyed. The potential impact of the Ebola virus transmission articles that we've discussed is illustrated by the public panic that surrounds the articles and the Ebola virus disease more generally. It is up to the scientific community as a whole to ensure that science drives discussions of emerging infectious disease and outbreak management in the future, and that it does so responsibly.

Enhanced Hygiene Measures and Norovirus Transmission during an Outbreak,"Control of norovirus outbreaks relies on enhanced hygiene measures, such as handwashing, surface cleaning, using disposable paper towels, and using separate toilets for sick and well persons. However, little is known about their effectiveness in limiting further spread of norovirus infections. We analyzed norovirus outbreaks in 7 camps at an international scouting jamboree in the Netherlands during 2004. Implementation of hygiene measures coincided with an 84.8% (95% predictive interval 81.2%-86.6%) reduction in reproduction number. This reduction was unexpectedly large but still below the reduction needed to contain a norovirus outbreak. Even more stringent control measures are required to break the chain of transmission of norovirus.","G astroenteritis is one of the most common causes of illness (1) . Recent fi ndings indicate norovirus is the most common cause of gastroenteritis (2, 3) . Of all gastroenteritis outbreaks reported in the Netherlands during 2002, 54% were caused by norovirus (4) . Norovirus is predominantly transmitted through the fecal-oral route, either indirectly through contaminated food or surfaces or directly from person to person (5) . It can be transmitted through small infectious droplets (aerosols) after a vomiting episode (6, 7) and can survive for a very long time in the environment (5, 8) . Most norovirus outbreaks are seen in settings where clusters of vulnerable, susceptible persons live closely together, such as nursing homes, hospitals, and daycare centers (4) , and in settings in which turnover of susceptible persons is high, such as hotels and cruise ships (9, 10) .

Norovirus infection can cause serious medical complications, such as dehydration, in persons with underlying illness (11) . No antiviral treatment exists for norovirus infection, and although norovirus vaccines are in development (12) , none are available yet. Early studies suggested that norovirus outbreaks could be contained by rapid implementation of enhanced hygiene measures, such as washing hands, thoroughly cleaning contaminated surfaces, avoiding contact between sick and healthy persons, and requesting caretakers and cleaning staff to wear gloves and aprons (13) (14) (15) (16) . However, in nursing homes or on cruise ships, norovirus can cause consecutive outbreaks, even after implementation of strict hygiene protocols (9, 17, 18) . No quantitative estimates exist of the results of such enhanced hygiene measures on reducing further transmission of norovirus. To our knowledge, the effect of enhanced hygiene measures has not been investigated in randomized controlled trials or in statistical analyses of outbreaks.

We investigated the effect of enhanced hygiene measures on reducing norovirus transmission during an outbreak. We measured the effectiveness of enhanced hygiene measures as the relative reduction in the reproduction number-defi ned as the average number of secondary cases caused by 1 typical case-in the absence of and after enhanced hygiene measures. The value of this reproduction number provides crucial information about transmission potential: if the reproduction number exceeds the threshold value of 1, the number of new cases will increase over time; if it is <1, the number of new cases will decline over time, and eventually the chain of transmission will break.

The time course of the reproduction number during an outbreak can be inferred from the epidemic curve (19, 20) .

We obtained a detailed epidemic curve of a norovirus outbreak at an international scout jamboree in the Netherlands from July 26 through August 10, 2004 . This outbreak was ideally suited to estimating the effects of enhanced hygiene measures because the date enhanced hygiene measures began was recorded. Moreover, because the scouts were divided into 7 camps, the jamboree provided a natural experiment in which the camps could be regarded as ""experimental units,"" with varying durations between introduction of the virus and implementation of enhanced hygiene measures.

An outbreak of norovirus infection occurred at an international scout jamboree in the Netherlands during the summer of 2004 (21) . Approximately 4,500 persons from 32 countries attended this event. At the start of the scout jamboree on July 26, 2004, two participants became ill with symptoms of gastroenteritis. The outbreak affected at least 326 persons with typical, generally mild symptoms of gastroenteritis (case-patients). Most ill persons experienced vomiting (258) and/or diarrhea (195). Ninety-two ill persons visited a local fi rst aid tent; another 54 were admitted to a local hospital for rehydration.

The jamboree was held on a large site, ≈600 m × 1,000 m. Jamboree participants were divided into 7 camps according to age: 3 camps each for participants 11-14 and 15-17 years of age and 1 camp for staff >18 years of age. The 7 camps were situated around a central fi eld for joint activities; most activities were organized within the camps. The camps were labeled A-G, according to the day the fi rst participants became sick. For 296 (91%) of 326 casepatients, the camp label was known ( Figure 1 , Table) .

On July 29 (day 3 of the jamboree), the Municipal Health Service ""Hart voor Brabant"" in 's-Hertogenbosch provided advice on enhanced hygiene measures (22) , instructed participants about proper hand hygiene and use of soap pumps and disposable paper towels, and assigned separate toilets for sick participants. In addition, the Municipal Health Service provided guidelines for cleaning toilets and contaminated surfaces with a 1,000-ppm chlorine solution. Sick participants were instructed to go to a fi rst aid tent. Sick participants were not allowed to prepare food until 3 days after their last symptoms. Persons working in the jamboree's fi eld hospital were instructed to wear gloves, aprons, and surgical masks and to minimize the number of patients per nurse. The scout jamboree ended on August 5.

Norovirus was epidemiologically implicated as the causative agent (21) of the outbreak and was confi rmed in stool samples through a standard reverse transcription-PCR protocol (23). Typing of 7 samples from case-patients in whom symptoms fi rst developed 7-9 days after the outbreak began resulted in 3 norovirus genotypes: 2 samples typed as norovirus genotype GI.4, 1 sample typed as genotype GI.5, and 4 samples typed as genotype GII.4-2004. We did not detect any multiple infections.

During the outbreak, the Municipal Health Service assessed the number of new cases from typical gastroenteritis symptoms self-reported by participants and staff. After the jamboree, participants and staff were given a questionnaire asking them to report to the Municipal Health Service whether gastroenteritis had developed within a week after departure. The questionnaire asked the date of symptom onset, symptoms, camp label, and hospital admission.

We estimated the reproduction number for every case during the norovirus outbreak at the jamboree. Using the date of symptom onset for each case, we applied statistical methods to reconstruct likely patterns of who infected whom (online Technical Appendix 1, available from www. cdc.gov/EID/content/15/1/24-Techapp1.pdf). We fi rst calculated the difference in day of symptom onset for all combinations of case pairs. To calculate the probability of transmission between any pair of cases, we needed information from the distribution of generation times (defi ned as the time between day of symptom onset in a secondary case and day of onset in its primary case) (19, 24) . To estimate the generation time distribution for norovirus infections, we used observations of generation times from several large norovirus outbreaks in child daycare centers in Sweden during 1999 (25) . These generation times were well described by a gamma distribution ( distribution of generation times was used to assign a likelihood of transmission for any pair of cases, allowing estimation of the transmission probabilities. We then used a powerful statistical sampling algorithm to generate a large sample of plausible transmission patterns (for technical details, see online Technical Appendix 1). The expected value of the reproduction number for a specifi c case was the sum of all transmission probabilities of outgoing infectious contacts to all other cases in the outbreak. For cases in which symptoms began the same day, we calculated the mean minimum and maximum values of the reproduction number. For the entire sample of transmission probabilities, we obtained the 0.025 and 0.975 quantiles for these 3 metrics as predictive intervals.

We incorporated additional information about the camp label of almost all case-patients and the pathogen genotype for 7 case-patients into the estimation procedure by adding a ""weight"" to the transmission probabilities between pairs of cases. Here we considered 2 extreme cases for mixing between camps. The fi rst extreme case was homogeneous mixing between all participants of the jamboree, as we assumed in the analysis described above; to achieve this, we assigned a weight of 1 to any pair of cases. The second extreme case was mixing within camps only and no mixing between camps. In this instance, the transmission probabilities for pairs of case-patients that stayed in different camps were assigned a weight of 0, and the transmission probabilities for pairs of case-patients that stayed in the same camp were given a weight of 1. The transmission probabili-ties for pairs of cases with known different genotypes were assigned a weight of 0, and the transmission probabilities for pairs of cases with known identical genotypes were assigned a weight of 1.

If the enhanced hygiene measures resulted in a sudden decline in transmission, the expected decline of the reproduction number would be gradual. Four factors determined the expected time course: the day enhanced hygiene measures began, the cumulative frequency distribution of generation times, the reproduction number without enhanced hygiene measures, and the relative reduction of the reproduction number attributed to hygiene measures. We express the reproduction number as a function of these 4 factors (online Technical Appendix 1) and fi tted this function to every sampled time course of the mean reproduction number for days 0-5, with least squares regression to obtain point estimates and 95% predictive intervals for the parameters describing the reproduction number in the absence of hygiene measures and relative reduction of the reproduction number resulting from the hygiene measures.

We tested the estimation procedure by simulating epidemic curves with known reproduction numbers. The interval estimates for reproduction numbers covered the actual values for days 0-7. We detected a slight downward bias for the estimated value of reproduction numbers and a slight downward bias for the estimated realtive reduction of reproduction numbers after implementation of 26 Emerging 

The estimated reproduction numbers decreased over time as the norovirus outbreak spread through the international scout jamboree (Figure 3 ). We estimated an initial reproduction number of 7.26 secondary cases per primary case (95% predictive interval 5.26-9.25); 5 days after the enhanced hygiene protocol began, the estimated reproduction number dropped below 1 (Figure 3, black diamonds) . Under the hypothesis that transmission potential decreased abruptly when enhanced hygiene measures began, we estimated a reproduction number of 14.05 secondary cases per primary case (95% predictive interval 9.96-17.98) without enhanced hygiene measures and a reproduction number of 2.13 secondary cases per primary case (95% predictive interval 1.88-2.40) with enhanced hygiene measures ( Figure  3 , black solid line). This decrease corresponded to a relative reduction in reproduction number of 84.8% (95% predictive interval 81.2%-86.6%).

The disease attack rate varied among different camps, from 2.3% to 10.7%; overall attack rate was 7.2% (Table) . For camps A and B, the estimated time course of reproduction number was initially high for the 2 index case-patients ( Figure 4, black diamonds) . Repeating the analysis with additional information about the host population structure and pathogen genotypes resulted in similar point estimates of the reproduction numbers (Figure 4 , gray boxes) but with narrower predictive intervals. The value of the initial reproduction number in each camp followed a time course consistent with 85% reduced transmission when enhanced hygiene measures were implemented (Figure 4 , black solid lines), indicating the time course of the reproduction num-bers did not depend on the time of introduction of norovirus in the camp-because this differed between camps-but on the time the enhanced hygiene protocol began, which was identical for all camps.

We have shown that during an outbreak of norovirus, implementation of enhanced hygiene measures coincided with an 85% reduction of norovirus transmission, from 14.05 secondary cases per primary case before enhanced hygiene measures to 2.13 secondary cases per primary case after enhanced hygiene measures. This estimate is consistent with the time course of reproduction numbers in different camps in which infection was introduced at different times. Our estimates confi rm the alleged high epidemic potential of norovirus and suggest that the enhanced hygiene measures were not suffi cient to reduce the reproduction number below the threshold value of 1. This estimate explains why the number of new cases per day continued to increase and why norovirus infection spread to new camps, even after implementation of enhanced hygiene measures. It is tempting to speculate that our fi ndings could be extrapolated to other hygiene measures to explain the typical pattern in several subsequent norovirus outbreaks on cruise ships and in hotels (9, 26, 27) . The estimation procedure for the time course of the reproduction number has several limitations. It requires a frequency distribution for the generation time, which may be unknown for many diseases that are less well studied than norovirus. The procedure also requires reporting of symptom onset of case-patients over intervals on the order of the mean generation time or smaller. Here, because the mean generation time was 3.6 days, we cannot use weekly reports of time of symptom onset. The procedure also requires a large outbreak so the effects of chance events on the course of the epidemic are minimized. Small outbreaks would lead to estimates of reproduction numbers that are highly uncertain and have questionable value for making generalizations about transmission.

Our main result is that the observed decline in the reproduction number coincided with implementation of enhanced hygiene measures. This extrapolation is highly suggestive of a causal relationship, which implies that hygiene measures can effectively reduce transmission of norovirus. However, several alternatives can explain the declining reproduction number, as discussed below.

First, the decrease in reproduction number may be due to chance events. Here we explicitly estimated the reproduction numbers from times of symptom onset and the generation time distribution for norovirus infections, whereas earlier work relied on transforming epidemic curves to reproduction numbers (19, 20) . The tests of our explicit estimation procedure indicate that the interval estimates cover the actual values of reproduction numbers and the reduced reproduction numbers after the implementation of hygiene measures. The predictive interval for the relative reduction of 81.2%-86.6% clearly shows the change is statistically signifi cant because it excludes the null hypothesis of a change of 0%. The tests also indicate a slight bias in the estimated values toward lower values, which suggests that the estimated 85% reduction after enhanced hygiene measures began should be treated as a conservative estimate. Therefore, the reduction in transmission is highly unlikely to be due to chance.

Second, it might be that jamboree participants differed in susceptibility, and the pool of highly susceptible persons was depleted during the fi rst days of the outbreak. However, preexisting immunity for the genotypes involved seems highly unlikely: GI.5 and GI.4 rarely are detected in Europe, and the GII.4-2004 genotype caused a large epidemic during the winter after the jamboree (28) . The number of persons infected before implementation of enhanced hygiene measures was smaller than the total number of case-patients, and the total number of case-patients was smaller than the number of jamboree participants. Depletion of susceptible persons or different susceptibility is highly unlikely to explain the sudden decrease in transmission around day 3 of the outbreak.

Third, the decline in reproduction number could be because many infections were asymptomatic and many symptomatic cases were not reported. The request to report any symptoms might not have reached all participants because of the event's large size and because participants came from many different countries. During norovirus outbreaks, asymptomatic cases occur; in almost half of the outbreaks in the Netherlands during 2002, stool samples from >1 healthy persons tested positive for norovirus (4) . Volunteer and outbreak studies demonstrate that 30% of collected stool specimens of exposed, asymptomatic persons were positive for norovirus (29) (30) (31) . However, both the proportion of asymptomatic infections and the reporting rate, as long as they remain constant, do not infl uence the value of the reproduction number because the reproduc- 28 Emerging tion number is estimated as the ratio of the number of secondary cases to the number of primary cases: both the proportion of asymptomatic infections and the reporting rate affect both the numerator and the denominator of this ratio, thereby canceling out in this calculation. Therefore, how the proportion of asymptomatic infections or the reporting rate would have resulted in a similar decline in reproduction number in the different camps is diffi cult to imagine. Fourth, different genotypes of norovirus could have spread at different times during the outbreak. From genotyping data of 7 cases of the norovirus outbreak during the jamboree, we know that 3 different norovirus genotypes circulated during this outbreak from genogroup I and II. Recent work (32) showed fi rst signs of a different viral load, which could indicate different transmissibility and different generation times between genogroup I and genogroup II. However, all genotyped strains were found during days 7-9 of the outbreak; although we cannot rule out the possibility that genotype replacement occurred, the most transmissible type is highly unlikely to have dominated during the fi rst 3 days before giving way to less transmissible types.

Finally, a change of the generation time distribution during the outbreak could explain the decline in reproduction number. The method we used to estimate the time course of reproduction number depends crucially on a correct specifi cation of the generation time distribution. Here we obtained this distribution from a study of a norovirus outbreak in child daycare centers in Sweden (25) and estimated that the generation time distribution peaked at 2.6 days ( Figure 2 ). This estimation agrees with results from volunteer studies in which adults showed a peak in virus shedding at 1-3 days postchallenge (31) . Further, this peak agrees with the time between exposure and symptom onset of 2 days in primary-school children during a norovirus outbreak after a vomiting event (6) , whereas 80% of case-patients reported vomiting during the scout jamboree. Overall, the most plausible explanation for the decrease in reproduction number is implementation of enhanced hygiene measures.

We have quantitatively estimated the effectiveness of enhanced hygiene measures in containing an outbreak of norovirus. Because the reproduction number did not fall below the threshold value of 1, implementation of the hygiene measures was not suffi cient to effectively break the chain of person-to-person transmission of norovirus during this outbreak. To contain an outbreak of norovirus, more rigorous interventions are required. These might range from better compliance with hygiene protocols to strict isolation of case-patients and quarantine of their contacts. We recommend quantifying the effectiveness of interventions against norovirus to provide the necessary evidence to justify use of existing hygiene protocols during outbreaks and to direct the development of better intervention measures. Although such quantifying would require analysis of more norovirus outbreaks with different sets of intervention measures, it would enable identifi cation of the best possible intervention strategies to control the spread of one of the most common pathogens of humans.

Internal versus external determinants of Schistosoma japonicum transmission in irrigated agricultural villages,"Currently schistosomiasis transmission has been suppressed to low levels in many historically endemic areas of China by widespread use of praziquantel in human and bovine populations and application of niclosamide for snail control. However, re-emergent transmission has signalled the need for sustainable interventions beyond these repeated chemical interventions. To take advantage of ongoing investment in rural infrastructure, an index of schistosomiasis transmission potential is needed to identify villages where environmental modifications would be particularly effective. Based on a retrospective analysis of data from 10 villages in Sichuan Province, an index linked to the basic reproductive number is shown to have promise in meeting this need. However, a lack of methods for estimating the spatial components of the proposed metric and for estimating the import of cercariae and miracidia from neighbouring villages leads to significant uncertainty in its estimation. These findings suggest a priority effort to develop methods for measuring the free-swimming forms of the parasite in surface waters. This need is underscored by the high cost and limited sensitivity of current methods for diagnosing human infection and mounting evidence of the inadequacy of snail surveys to identify environments supporting low levels of transmission.","Rural areas of China have recently benefited from increased governmental expenditures in disease control programmes, particularly in the wake of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) experience. These benefits have extended to the control of human infections owing to Schistosoma japonicum, where expanded programmes have continued to rely on the treatment of human and bovine populations with praziquantel and the use of the molluscicide niclosamide, but with substantially intensified use of both. Overall, these efforts have suppressed transmission intensity, often below the detection levels of routine surveillance [1] . However, re-emergent transmission in areas formerly meeting the Chinese government's criteria for transmission control or interruption has signalled the need for a more comprehensive approach, which includes environmental changes of the sort already taking place, often for unrelated reasons [2] [3] [4] . In order to influence rural development priorities for disease control purposes at least a semi-quantitative understanding of the effects of environmental modification on disease transmission is needed. The objective here is to address this practical need by synthesizing over 15 years of collaborative research on the factors controlling the intensity of transmission of schistosomiasis in irrigated agricultural environments of southwestern China.

Previously, our group defined three principal determinants of the intensity of the disease transmission cycle within a village. They were termed internal potential, gating effects and connectivity [5] . The first two of these determine the ability of a village isolated from external parasite inputs to sustain transmission between resident humans and snails. Connectivity acknowledges that villages seldom exist in isolation, but are connected at some level to their neighbours and the broader environment by a variety of pathways, notably hydrological connections and human and animal pathways that can transport the parasite into and out of the village. Indeed, a fundamental issue addressed here is whether these connections are sufficiently strong to demand that schistosomiasis transmission, and hence its control, must be viewed in this environment from a metapopulation perspective [6, 7] . In that context, the populations are those of parasites which colonize hosts, both molluscan and mammalian, who constitute patches that are distributed geographically in villages. Viewed from either the metapopulation or the disease control perspective, a central question is one of scale. In a village, to what extent is transmission driven by internal versus external factors? If transmission is dominated by external factors, attention must be focused at a scale larger than that of a single village, one which includes the sources of these imported parasites and the mechanisms by which they are dispersed. An early example from among the villages analysed here was the very rapid and extensive re-infection observed over a 1 year period following thorough and comprehensive praziquantel treatment of all residents. This occurred in a village with major irrigation water input from an upstream village in a different county in which no interventions were known to have been conducted in the recent past. External inputs were thought to be responsible for the rapid re-infection and these were expected to maintain transmission at high levels, with or without continued internal control activities, unless the upstream village(s) was also included in the control programme. A goal of the study reported here was to explore the validity of that interpretation of events in a focused analysis and on a broader scale.

Through the lens of the foregoing concepts, an early but comprehensive dataset on disease transmission in 10 villages in the years 2000 -2002 is revisited. The first objective is to assess the adequacy of field data typically collected in endemic rural villages in identifying the internal determinants transmission intensity. The second objective is to explore the necessity of the metapopulation perspective in understanding the distribution of endemic disease. There is little doubt that a metapopulation approach is necessary to understand the dynamics of re-emergent transmission. Anticipating that the field data analysed here, which are at the upper limit of what is routinely available, will be found inadequate to resolve either issue definitively, a key question is how these inadequacies can be addressed through the development and deployment of improved methods to inform the final effort to achieve sustainable interruption of schistosomiasis transmission in China.

The villages discussed here are located in Xichang County in southwestern Sichuan Province. They are irrigated agricultural villages typical of the hilly and mountainous classification of schistosomiasis transmission ecologies used in China. The amphibious snail Oncomelania hupensis robersoni is the intermediate host of the parasite and lives mainly in irrigation ditches. Exposure to humans occurs in either agricultural or domestic activities involving contact with ditch water. Conversely, snails are exposed, also mainly in the ditch environment, to miracidia which hatch from schistosome eggs, many of which are distributed into the village environment via the use of human and animal waste for crop fertilization. In earlier studies, we found that the determinants of human infection were principally related to the agricultural characteristics of the village of residence and, secondarily, to one's occupation within the village.

Neither age, gender, or kinship appeared to be significant determinants of individual risk within a village nor did the small resident domestic animal populations appear to be important in sustaining endemic levels [8, 9] . Many of the foregoing findings were made possible because of the very limited control activity in these villages in at least the 5 years prior to the initial surveys in 2000. Hence, the situation as found in that year was assumed to represent steady-state or near steady-state transmission, which is also assumed in the analyses described here.

Fundamental to the analysis presented below is that these villages were originally selected because they were known to present a range of endemic disease transmission from low to high intensity. The initial studies were concerned with identifying the internal determinants of these different levels of disease transmission. Hence, spatially contiguous villages were excluded because their parasite-related connections with their immediate neighbours were not the focus of interest at the time. For present purposes, however, a qualitative picture of the setting of these villages can be gained from the map included in the electronic supplementary material while noting that the farmland surrounding virtually all of these villages is immediately adjacent to that of other villages not shown.

A differential equation model of the type extended and popularized by Anderson & May [10] , but incorporating pathogen import/export terms, was used both to develop an index of internal transmission intensity and to explore the balance of internal versus external determinants of the endemic level of disease in these villages. The modelling approach taken here acknowledges the network structure implied by the import and export of larvae between communities while, as will be seen, remaining compatible with the available data on such exchanges. While current research has begun to address patterns of movement of humans and bovines [11] as well as hydrological transport of the parasite between villages, the focus here is on quantitative evidence of the relative importance of these connections to sustaining endemic disease transmission.

The version of the model used here, equations (2.1), is parametrically complex because it was developed to incorporate site-specific descriptors of the infection cycle. It also includes acquired immunity as well as the aforementioned gating and connectivity effects although the effects of immunity have only modest impacts on the results of this analysis [12] . The state variables are village mean worm burden in humans, w(t), mean village density of infected snails, z(t) and the mean level of an index of acquired immunity among the human population, I(t). Connectivity is represented within the quantities in square brackets in the first two equations, which are the sum of the internally generated and imported cercariae and miracidia, respectively. Both of these free-swimming forms of the parasite are found in the village irrigation Local factors S. japonicum transmission R. C. Spear 273 system where mammalian and snail exposure takes place.

The constant parameters of the model are defined individually in table 1, but there are several phenomenologically important inputs and parameter types:

-external inputs of cercariae and miricidia, C E (t) and M E (t), respectively, represent the spatially averaged sum of all sources of each of the two forms of the parasite which may be imported into a village and potentially infect either resident snails or mammalian hosts. Either form may be present in irrigation water entering the village or, for miracidia, faecal inputs from infected bovines or reservoir hosts may be deposited and hatch within the village environment. Assuming no internal losses, the export of cercariae and miracidia from the village at any time t is a function of the sum of the two terms in the square brackets of equations (2.1) times the volumetric flow rate of total discharge from the village, although that does not figure into the analysis below; -time delays, t w and t z ; the development time of the parasite to an adult worm in the human host and the environmentally driven development time of the parasite in the snail from infection to cercarial release; -time-variable or gating parameter aggregations; a 12 (t 2 t w ) and a 21 (t 2 t z ), which include seasonal water contact of humans, temperature-dependent infectivity of cercariae and miracidia and uninfected snail density. Both are scaled to vary between zero and unity and are discussed in detail by Remais et al. [13] ; and -site-specific constant parameters, where a site is defined as a natural village, and site-invariant constant parameters which are assumed at least regionally invariant. Each constant parameter is so classified in table 1.

The nonlinear functions F(w,k), f (w,k) and h(I ) describe, respectively, worm mating probability, densitydependent worm establishment in vivo and acquired immunity. Following Anderson & May [10]:

Fðw; kÞ ¼ 1 À ð1 À gÞ 1þk 2p ð 2p 0 1 À cos u ð1 þ g cos uÞ 1þk du; ð2:2Þ

where g ¼ w/w þ k and: All three nonlinear functions assume a negative binomial distribution of worms in the human population and this is implicit in the foregoing functions. The function H(I,k) is described in Wang [12] for individuals and a community-level example is shown graphically in the electronic supplementary material under the negative binomial assumption with dispersion parameter k ¼ 0.45, which describes a highly right-skewed distribution.

In an earlier analysis of the determinants of the transmission of S. japonicum, a distinction was drawn between site-specific and site-invariant factors [14] . Here, the objective is to determine if an index of the village-specific internal transmission potential arising from that distinction is a useful index of the level of endemic steady state within a village, the rate of re-infection after praziquantel treatment, and of the balance between internal and external sources of the parasite. To derive that index, consider an isolated village in which only internal transmission of the parasite occurs. This case is defined for system (2.1) by the condition C E (t) ¼ M E (t) ¼ 0. In a stationary environment, the time-variable gating parameters a 12 (t) and a 21 (t) are annually periodic. It follows that a non-zero endemic steady-state level of system (2.1) is that in which the state variables are also annually periodic with constant time-weighted average values from year to year. There are two stable steady-state levels of system (2.1), the endemic state and the zero state. For infectious disease transmission systems, the basic reproductive number of the system, R 0 , refers to a stability criterion that, for a given parameter set, determines which of these two states the system will approach over time. However, system (2.1) is nonlinear and time-variable with development delays, one of which is itself time-variable being based on a degree-day model of parasite development in the snail. Hence, to derive a necessary and a sufficient criterion for stability of the zero state, a genuine R 0 , is a formidable mathematical challenge and beyond the scope of the present study. Given that the objective is to derive an index of the strength of internal transmission, a relative rather than absolute index is sufficient, although a close linkage to the genuine R 0 is desirable. Hence, an approximate index will be derived based on stability criteria for an averaged system in which both the gating parameters and the time-variable external inputs are replaced by their annual time-weighted average values. The averaged system is:

ð2:4Þ

Approximating the steady-state conditions of system (2.1) by equilibrium values of system (2.4) involves products of average values versus average values of time-variable products (see the electronic supplementary material). In distinction to system (2.1), the equilibrium states given by the solutions of the algebraic equations resulting from setting the left-hand side of equations (2.4) to zero can be determined as a function of the constant parameters and stability conditions can be established. Recalling that the operating hypothesis is that the Xichang villages were at or near steady-state in 2000, the accuracy of this approximation, given the parameter values and gating functions for the Xichang region, will be assessed by simulation of equations (2.1) in comparison with the values predicted by equations (2.4) in the context of both the 2000 steady state and the 2002 re-infection studies discussed below. The success, or lack thereof, is intended to point to key data insufficiencies as well 

ð2:5Þ

As noted above, the constant parameters occurring in the foregoing equations are divisible into site-invariant and site-specific subsets as specified in table 1. As suggested by equation (2.5), it is convenient to aggregate these subsets into two functional groups. The site-specific group is defined as:

ð2:6Þ

As indicated in table 1, S m and g relate to human water contact, X m to uninfected snail density, bng o to parasite-contaminated fertilizer use and A h and A s the area of snail habitat and surface water in the village, respectively. Values for S,A h , A s , X m and n for the 10 villages studied here are given in table 2 and g 0 is available from the literature [8] . b is the fraction of human faeces recycled for fertilization internally in the village. Environmental factors also include temperature and irrigation profiles that alter the long-term average values of the gating parameters a 12 (t) and a 21 (t). Generally, irrigation profiles will vary between villages, but are here treated as site-invariant because of a regional pumped irrigation system. In general, however, being site-specific, P s is an index which allows for comparison of the intensity of transmission between villages with the same site-invariant parameter subset, P b . The latter is defined as:

The site-invariant parameter estimates listed in table 1, including those pertaining to acquired immunity, are based on calibration calculations reported in earlier work [12, 14, 16] . Here, a value of P b ¼ 2.3 Â 10 22 is used. It should be noted that the estimates of the spatial parameters derived below are conditioned on the value of P b as well as on the degree to which the average value of the gating functions adequately captures their impact on the time-variable system. Hence, while there is uncertainty in the value of this parameter aggregation and the gating parameters, the assumption of invariance across these villages leads to consistent relative rankings based on P s .

Using the parameter aggregations and defining L ¼ P s P b , equation (2.4) may be simplified to LFð w; kÞf ð w; kÞH ð w; kÞ ¼ 1:

ð2:8Þ

By definition, the nonlinear functions F, f and H are all less than or equal to unity, which leads to the conclusion that L must be greater than 1 for an endemic equilibrium to exist. That property and its specific functional dependence on the system parameters indicate that L is essentially the basic reproductive number of the averaged system in the absence of the effects of the density-dependent nonlinearities [10] . Note that equation (2.8) can be solved for L given the values F, f and H, which depend only on the equilibrium state, w and the village-specific aggregation constant of the negative binomial distribution, k. Equations (2.6) and (2.8) produce a second estimate of L based on the remaining system parameters, which results in two estimates based on different parameter groups. Both will be used below.

Turning first to the qualitative aspects of equation for the wide range of endemic levels of worm burden observed epidemiologically over quite small geographical areas [8] .

The initial cross-sectional survey data to be used for parameter estimation were obtained in 2000 and covered 20 villages of which the 10 discussed here were followed up in 2002. The year 2000 survey data used here are given in table 2 together with the 2002 re-infection worm burden in humans and results of the 2002 snail survey [13] . The data collection methods and full results are given in Spear et al. [8] . While all of the field data are subject to some degree of measurement error, estimates of the infected snail density are based on snail surveys and are particularly problematic because the infection rate in snails, even in highly endemic villages, exceeds 2 per cent only rarely. For example, in only nine of the original 20 villages were any infected snails found in 2000, yet human prevalence in the 11 without infected snails ranged from 3 to 34 per cent. In five of the 10 villages followed up here, between zero and five infected snails were found in samples of between 500 and 1500 total snails. For the villages on the low end of the spectrum, the ratio of the lower to the upper 95% binomial confidence intervals on the infection fraction exceeds an order of magnitude. Hence, in these five villages, the steady-state levels of the infected snail density are poorly estimated and, coupled with the probable levels of within-season variation of infected snail density, the estimates of village mean values are imprecise at best.

Estimates for most of the site-specific parameters are available from the field data (table 2) . Further, good estimates of the two time-variable parameters, and hence their average values, exist for the interval 2000 -2002 [13] . However, no estimates based on field data are available for the parameters g and j, which represent exposures that differ from the village mean owing to spatial heterogeneity in the interaction between cercarial density and human water contact (leading to human infection) and between miracidial density and snail contact (leading to snail infection), respectively. In general, neither cercariae nor infected snails are homogeneously distributed across the village irrigation system [8] . Seto et al. [15] make a compelling case that g is generally an important descriptor of human exposure. As the only remaining unassigned parameters necessary to estimate the index of internal transmission, P s , the values of g and j are important in that they determine the balance between internal and external sources of the parasite. The exceptions are where the infected snail density is zero, in which case only external cercarial inputs are possible, or if a village is classified as isolated, in which case all transmission is internal by assumption. Hexing 1 and Tuanjie 2 are examples of the former, and Shian 5 and Xinlong 7 of the latter. For the remaining six villages, the balance is uncertain. However, for the two isolated villages, it is possible to solve the equilibrium equations of the averaged system for g and j using the field data in 2000 from table 2 together with the observed values of the equilibrium states wð2000Þ and zð2000Þ. For Shian 5, the mean worm burden was 90.8 with the aggregation parameter of the negative binomial distribution estimated to be k ¼ 0.45 [17] . For Xinlong 7, the worm burden was 110.4 also with k ¼ 0.45. These values result in estimates of 1.03 and 1.11 for g and 1.83 and 1.89 for j, respectively.

For the remaining six villages with infected snails, but which cannot be assumed to be isolated, the data are simply inadequate to estimate these spatial parameters and, therefore, the internal/external balance in any direct way. However, some insight can be gained by determining plausible ranges for g and j. Again, the equilibrium equations of the averaged system were used, with the constraint that both C E and M E be greater than or equal to zero, to derive upper bounds on both g and j for each village. These upper bounds correspond to setting both C E and M E equal to zero and imply that all transmission is internal. Further, the similarity of the estimates of g and j for the two isolated villages suggests that those values may serve as reasonable central estimates for all villages in the region with similar irrigation systems and agriculture. Proceeding on this assumption, normal distributions were assumed to describe the variability of these parameters among such villages with means set to the average of the two isolated villages, g ¼ 1:05 and j ¼ 1:85, and variances of 0.33 and 0.54, respectively, truncated, if necessary, to insure that the upper bounds were not violated. Given the values of g and j so generated, estimates of the distribution of L for each of the six non-isolated villages with infected snails were then calculated from the equilibrium equations.

For any one of the six villages, a random draw from the g and j distributions allows the calculation of C E , M E and L from the equilibrium equations of the averaged model. The final complication is that C E and M E are uniquely determined by the values of g and j, but L is a function of their product. Hence, for any values of g and j, there are many possible values of L and conversely. While the equilibrium values are invariant at constant L, simulation experiments using the time-variable system, equations (2.1), showed that the 2 year re-infection rates in human residents of Xinmin 7, for example, varied by 5 -10% over the range of values of C E and M E for a given L (see the electronic supplementary material). The 2 year re-infection rates in snails, in contrast, varied over a twofold range. Hence, the lack of specific knowledge of these external inputs leads to greater uncertainty in the re-infection predictions in contrast to the equilibrium values. In the simulation studies discussed below, the 50th percentile L from the Monte Carlo runs was used with the g and j values corresponding to C E and M E at the approximate median of the range of sampled values for that L.

Local factors S. japonicum transmission R. C. Spear 277 To determine the adequacy of approximations based on the averaged system, equations (2.4), the time-variable system including the time-variable developmental delay in snails, t z , were simulated using MATLAB v. 7.7, for eight villages first to assess the match of the equilibrium conditions to those observed in 2000. The two villages with no infected snails in 2000 were not simulated. For the re-infection predictions, the 2002 field data showed that uninfected snail density had declined markedly from the density in 2000. Therefore, for the 2 year re-infection simulations, the uninfected snail density was changed to the average of the 2000 and 2002 snail survey data and simulated over the period from 1 January 2001 to 1 January 2003. For both runs, the initial conditions on worm burden were set to 5 per cent of those in 2000 reflecting an assumed 95 per cent effective rate of praziquantel treatment and 100 per cent coverage of those infected. The same L, g, j, C E and M E values were used as in the steady-state estimating simulations for each of the eight villages. Table 3 contains the 2.5, 50 and 97.5 quantile estimates from the sample distribution function of L, using the Quantile routine in R, based on 300 Monte Carlo replications together with mid-range values of C E and M E for the six villages where both internal and external parasite sources are possible. To place these numbers in context, figure 2 shows the range of C E and M E values that are consistent with the sampled values of g and j at the 50th percentile of L for each village. As a benchmark, in the 2000 data, model-based estimates of the internally generated cercariae in the highly endemic isolated village Xinlong 7 averaged about 70 cercariae m 22 surface water and 1000 miricidia m 22 during the transmission season. Jianxing 6 is clearly an outlier in that the miracidial input at the midpoint of the curve in the figure is about three times that of any other village. With that exception, the ranges of the external inputs for the other villages seem plausible in the light of the Xinlong 7 benchmark also shown in the figure. Xinmin 7 (XM7), for example, is the village with the highest external cercarial input and substantial miracidial input. It is also the village mentioned earlier which was thought to have substantial parasite input from an immediately upstream endemic village in Zhaojue County.

Also shown in table 3 is the upper binomial confidence limit on the probability that L . 1.0. This condition is a conservative index of the probability that the village can support endemic transmission without external inputs. Minhe 1 is the only village of the eight non-isolated villages where this analysis suggests that an endemic level supported mainly by internal transmission is a possibility. Solely internal transmission is a possibility given the topographic and hydrologic setting of Minhe 1. However, on the basis of the present analysis, confidence in this result is low because of the low infected snail density. On the other hand, the observed worm burden of 16.9 appears to 278 Local factors S. japonicum transmission R. C. Spear be on the lower edge of stable endemic levels suggested to be possible by figure 1 and serves to illustrate the low steady-state worm burdens that can apparently occur in this environment. Overall, this analysis suggests that at least seven of these 10 villages received parasite inputs from external sources and, further, none of these appear likely to have sustained internal transmission without these inputs. The re-infection trajectories of worm burden, w(t), infected snail density, z(t) and acquired immunity, I(t), for the two isolated and six non-isolated villages over 15 years post-treatment are shown for the 50 percentile value of L in the electronic supplementary material. Since the intent was to determine if the 2000 conditions were consistent with the equilibrium values of the averaged model, it is the steady-state value determined by simulation that is compared with the equilibrium value of the averaged model. Hence, these trajectories assume an unchanged environment based on the 2000 data. This is the case because no system parameters are altered by praziquantel treatment nor was the uninfected snail density assumed to have been changed in these simulations. 1. It appears that the low observed endemic level in that village makes it particularly sensitive to the small external input used in this simulation as suggested by further simulations, which showed a very good fit for no external input, but with similar g and j values. The major discrepancies are in the 2002 reinfection data in the three villages with high external inputs, as shown in figure 2 . The three villages, those lying well above the 1 : 1 line in figure 3a , indicate that the model produces much higher rates of re-infection than indicated by the field data. This can be seen by comparing the re-infection rates in the villagespecific simulations of the isolated Shian 5 versus that of Xinmin 7, shown in the electronic supplementary material. The time to near equilibrium in Shian 5 is about 12 years and in Xinmin 7 about 4 years, the latter having high external inputs. The higher predicted re-infection levels may also be due to the fact that the external inputs are treated as constants in both versions of the model whereas that is unlikely to be the case in the field. Whatever the reason, the clear message is that field data are needed on the external inputs, and g and j in order to further explore the adequacy of the modelling approach or the other data on which parameter estimates are based.

In contrast to the worm burden predictions in figure 3a, figure 3b shows that the snail density in the isolated villages is overestimated in 2000 and underestimated in 2002 by the g and j parameters produced by the averaged model. Jianxing 6 is clearly an outlier as suggested by its external input profile in figure 2 . However, all other villages show higher predicted than observed snail densities consistent with recent field data, collected using the same snail sampling protocols, which showed no infected snails in 35 of 36 re-emerging villages with human infections [1] . The model results, the original field data, and the more recent field data all indicate that these standard protocols have a limit of detection of infection prevalence in snails above that where continued human transmission occurs.

Recalling that the results shown in figure 3 were obtained without curve fitting or village-by-village optimization, the use of the average model and its site-specific parameter set, P s , provide a reasonable index of the environmental capacity of a village and its residents to support transmission of schistosomiasis when adjusted for external inputs and with at least approximate estimates of internal spatial parameters. This index is simple and its control implications are easily understood. However, with the current data limitations, it leads to marginally useful short-term re-infection estimates for villages suspected of having substantial external inputs. All of these results were obtained based on the assumption of steady-state transmission in these villages in 2000 as well as the fortuitous inclusion of two isolated villages in the dataset. Given the widespread recent use of praziquantel in China, steady-state data are unlikely to be available in other settings for the foreseeable future. Hence, direct data from the field on C E (t), M E (t) and the two spatial parameters will generally be needed to achieve quantitative assessments of local transmission intensity. Moreover, the foregoing results suggest that, regardless of the value of L, external inputs are likely to contribute to the endemic level in a stationary environment and they are very likely to increase the re-infection rate as well.

From a strategic perspective, however, the most notable result of these analyses is that only three of the 10 villages, and a good argument can be made that it is three of the 20 original villages, appear to be able to sustain transmission without external inputs of cercariae or miracidia. This observation provides a compelling argument for the importance of connectivity, that is, a metapopulation perspective, in both endemic and re-emergent circumstances. A metapopulation perspective is supported by theoretical studies of Watt et al. [7] . In retrospect, some of the earliest investigations of our group using historical data collected in this area suggested the importance of connectivity although it was not appreciated at the time [18] . Additional support for the importance of hydrological connectivity, in particular, was provided by Xu et al. [19] who carried out large-scale simulation studies of schistosomiasis transmission in this region. Guararie & Seto [20] have shown theoretically that a network of hydrologically and socially connected villages can support endemic transmission without any of the individual villages on the network doing so if they were not connected. Hence, the results presented here, based on field data, lend support to the contention that connected networks of villages are the crucial unit for the purposes of both risk assessment and sustainable transmission control. While the crucial scale of this connectivity remains unclear, if correct, this interpretation suggests the need for the analogue of the air pollution control district, common in the USA, which is based on the characteristics of the airshed and of the source characteristics and distribution within it. These districts often cut across local political jurisdictions as would be necessary in the present case.

A second strategic point, also related to connectivity, arises from the observation that the lack of direct data from the field on C E (t), M E (t) and the two spatial parameters are the major limitation in assessing the sources driving transmission in a single village. A major step forward in addressing this need would be a sensitive, cheap and robust water monitoring procedure for the measurement of the parasite concentration in surface waters. For example, measuring total parasite concentrations in influent irrigation waters would allow estimation of the sum of C E (t) and M E (t). Similar measurements at various locations within the village would allow estimation of g and j although the usefulness of both sets of measurements would be greatly enhanced by the development of advanced methods to distinguish cercariae from miracidia. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods have been published for detection of the parasite [21, 22] and preliminary work has been carried out in investigating field sampling methods with detection using qPCR methods [23] . These preliminary results hold the promise of circumventing the longstanding difficulty of cercarial monitoring of water [24] .

Further motivation for the development of environmental sampling procedures for the detection of the free-swimming forms of the parasite is offered by circumstances now occurring in China. The extensive recent use of praziquantel and the molluscicide niclosamide has suppressed transmission levels difficult to detect by continued reliance on acute schistosomiasis case reports and episodic surveys for S. japonicum-infected humans and/or snails. For example, in 28 villages which had previously attained control status and were not known to currently support transmission, thorough surveys showed that human prevalence ranged from 0 to 27.8 per cent. Moreover, only one of 7515 snails collected in these villages was found to be infected despite extensive surveys at the time, these human infections were diagnosed [1] . Precedence for the importance of environmental surveillance has also been reported and shown to be effective for other waterborne pathogens, notably in the case of polio virus also in circumstances, as with schistosomiasis in Sichuan, where human case reports had previously provided the first warning of renewed transmission [25] .

Quantifying the transmission potential of pandemic influenza,"This article reviews quantitative methods to estimate the basic reproduction number of pandemic influenza, a key threshold quantity to help determine the intensity of interventions required to control the disease. Although it is difficult to assess the transmission potential of a probable future pandemic, historical epidemiologic data is readily available from previous pandemics, and as a reference quantity for future pandemic planning, mathematical and statistical analyses of historical data are crucial. In particular, because many historical records tend to document only the temporal distribution of cases or deaths (i.e. epidemic curve), our review focuses on methods to maximize the utility of time-evolution data and to clarify the detailed mechanisms of the spread of influenza.","Influenza epidemics are observed around the world during the wintertime and with a strong seasonal component in temperate regions [1, 2] . Influenza is a disease caused by the influenza virus, an RNA virus belonging to the Orthomyxoviridae [3] . Many features are common with those of the paramyxovirus infections of the acute upper respiratory tract. Typical symptoms of the disease are characterized by fever, myalgia, severe malaise, non-productive cough, and sore throats. The disease spreads when an infected individual coughs or sneezes and sends the virus into the air, and other susceptible individuals inhale the virus. The virus is also believed to be transmitted when a person touches a surface that is contaminated with the virus (e.g., door knob, etc.) and then touches the nose or eyes. Infected individuals can transmit the virus almost within a day following infection (i.e. latent period). Although it is generally believed that infected individuals can pass the virus for 3-7 days following symptom onset, there is some uncertainty on the duration of the infectious period. The generation time (i.e. sum of latent and infectious periods) for influenza, reported and assumed in the literature, ranges from 3 days [4] [5] [6] to about 6 days [7, 8] .

Individuals that are infected with influenza are believed to become permanently immune against the specific virus strain. Hence, the virus is able to persist in the human population through relatively minor (single point) mutations in the virus composition known as drifts. Influenza (sub)types A/H3N2, A/H1N1 and B are currently co-circulating in the human population [9] . Major changes in the virus composition via recombination or gene reassortment processes (known as genetic shifts) can lead to the emergence of novel influenza viruses with the potential of generating dramatic morbidity and mortality levels around the world [3] .

The 1918/19 influenza pandemic known as the Spanish influenza caused by the influenza virus A (H1N1) has been the most devastating in recent history with estimated worldwide mortality ranging from 20 to 100 million deaths [10, 11] with a case fatality of 2-6 percent [12, 13] . The worldwide 1918 influenza pandemic spread in three waves starting from Midwestern United States in the spring of 1918 [14, 15] . The deadly second wave began in late August probably in France while the third wave is generally considered as part of normal more scattered winter outbreaks similar to those observed after the 1889/90 pandemic [14] . Subsequent pandemics during the 20th century are attributed to subtypes A (H2N2) from 1957/58 (Asian influenza) and A (H3N2) in 1968 (Hong Kong influenza) [16] .

The ability to quickly detect and institute control efforts at the early stage of an influenza pandemic is directly linked to the final levels of morbidity and mortality in the population [13] . To appropriately assess the disaster size of a probable future pandemic, we have to quantify the transmission potential (and its associated uncertainty). Although it is difficult to directly measure the transmissibility of a future pandemic, historical epidemiologic data is readily available from previous pandemics, and as a reference quantity for future pandemic planning, mathematical and statistical analyses of the historical data can offer various insights. In particular, because many historical records tend to document only the temporal distribution of cases or deaths (i.e. epidemic curve), we modelers have faced with a difficult need to clarify the mechanisms of the spread of influenza using such time-evolution data alone. In this paper, we review a number of mathematical and statistical methods for the estimation of the transmission potential of pandemic influenza, focusing on theoretical techniques to maximize the utility of the temporal distribution of influenza cases. The methods that have been incorporated in this review include the applications of epidemiologically structured epidemic models, explicitly duration-structured epidemic system, and stochastic processes (i.e. branching and counting processes). Whereas this review does not cover the spread of influenza in space, spatial heterogeneity in transmission and the growing interest in the role of contact networks are briefly discussed as the future challenge.

The basic reproduction number, R 0 (pronounced as R nought), is a key quantity used to estimate transmissibility of infectious diseases. Theoretically, R 0 is defined as the average number of secondary cases generated by a single primary case during its entire period of infectiousness in a completely susceptible population [17] . As the epidemic progresses, the number of susceptible individuals is decreased due to infection, and the reproduction number decays following R(t) = R 0 S(t)/S(0) where S(t) and S(0) are, respectively, the number of susceptible individuals at time t and before the epidemic starts; the latter is equivalent to the total population size N given that all individuals are susceptible before the beginning of an epidemic. Clearly, this definition only applies to (novel) emerging infectious diseases (e.g., the epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) from [2002] [2003] or re-emerging infectious diseases that had not circulated in the population in question for long enough to allow for residual immunity in the population to disappear due to births and deaths.

The reproduction number is directly related to the type and intensity of interventions necessary to control an epidemic since the objective is to make R(t) < 1 as soon as possible. To achieve R(t) < 1, one or a combination of control strategies may be implemented. For example, one of the best known uses of R 0 is in determining the critical coverage of immunization required to eradicate a disease in a randomly mixing population. That is, when vaccine is available against a disease in question, it is of interest to estimate the critical proportion of the population that needs to be vaccinated (i.e. vaccination coverage) in order to attain R < 1 [18, 19] . For example, in the U.S. prior to 1963, a vaccine against measles was not available and hence recurrent epidemics of measles were observed with approximately 3-4 million cases per year and a mean of 450 deaths. The introduction of the vaccine in the U.S. reduced the incidence by 98 percent.

The critical vaccination coverage, p c (in a randomly mixing population) can be estimated from the R 0 of the disease in question as follows [20] :

where ε is the efficacy (i.e. direct effectiveness) of vaccination [21] . p c given in (1) suggests that the disease could be eradicated even when all susceptible individuals are not vaccinated. The protection conferred to the population by achieving a critical vaccination coverage is known as herd immunity [22, 23] . A brief history of the theoretical developments on the basic reproduction number and its analytical computation via epidemic modeling is given elsewhere [23] [24] [25] . The mathematical definition and calculation of R 0 using nextgeneration arguments was described initially by Odo Diekmann and his colleagues [17, 26] , where R 0 is the dominant eigenvalue of the resulting next generation matrix. Further elaborations and reviews can be found elsewhere [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] . Classically, rather than the threshold phenomena, R 0 was used to suggest the severity of an epidemic, because the proportion of those experiencing infection at the end of an epidemic depends only on R 0 [34] (see Section 3).

Statistical methods to quantitatively estimate R 0 have been reviewed by Klaus Dietz [35] . Depending on the characteristics of data and underlying assumptions of the models, R 0 can be estimated using various different approaches [36] . In addition to the final size equation, R 0 of an epidemic of newly emerging disease can be estimated from the intrinsic growth rate [4, 6, 8, 18, 37, 38] , which is also referred to as the rate of natural increase, suggesting the natural growth rate of infected individuals in a fully susceptible population (discussed in Section 4). Moreover, for simple epidemic models with relatively few parameters, R 0 can be estimated with other unobservable quantities by rigorous curve fitting of model equations to the observed epidemic data (discussed in Section 3) [38] [39] [40] . Not only R 0 but also R(t) can be estimated from the temporal distribution of infectious diseases, reconstructing the transmission network or inferring the time-inhomogeneous number of secondary transmissions [41] [42] [43] [44] .

To estimate the basic reproduction number of endemic diseases, different approaches are taken. One would need first to carry out serological surveys to quantify the fraction of the population that is effectively protected against infection (i.e. age-and/or time-specific proportion of those possessing acquired immunity needs to be estimated). Through this effort, the force of infection, the rate at which susceptible individuals get infected, is estimated [45] . For example, this is the case for rubella, mumps and measles (that are still circulating in some regions of the world even when high effective vaccination coverage is achieved). Although the estimation of R 0 for endemic diseases is out of the scope of this review, methodological details and the applications to estimate the force of infection and R 0 can be found elsewhere [46] [47] [48] [49] [50] [51] [52] .

In practice, the reproduction number denoted simply by R and defined as the number of secondary cases generated by a primary infectious cases in a partially protected population might be useful. R can also be estimated from the initial growth phase of an epidemic in such a partially immunized population. In a randomly mixing population, the relationship between the basic reproduction number (R 0 ) and the reproduction number (R) is given by R = (1 − p)R 0 where p is the proportion of the population that is effectively protected against infection (in the beginning of an epidemic). Besides, for many recurrent infectious diseases including seasonal influenza, estimating the background immunity p in the population is extremely difficult due to cross-immunity of antigenically-related influenza strains and vaccination campaigns.

With regard to seasonal influenza, the reproduction number (R) over the last 3 decades has been estimated at 1.3 (SE 0.05) in the United States, France, and Australia with an overall range of 0.9-2.0 [53] . An R estimate of 1.5 has been reported for a single A/H3N2 season in France [54] , and some estimates have been reported in the range 1.4-2.6 for several consecutive influenza seasons in England and Wales [55, 56] . A particularly high estimate of R has been suggested for the 1951 influenza epidemic in England and Canada [57] .

Because influenza pandemics such as the Spanish flu from 1918/19 are associated to the emergence of novel influenza strains to which most of the population is susceptible, it might be reasonable to assume that the reproduction number R ≈ R 0 . Previous studies have estimated that R 0 of the 1918/19 influenza pandemic ranged between 1.5 and 5.4 [8,38-40,57-64] depending on the specific location and pandemic wave considered, type of data, estimation method, and level of spatial aggregation, which has ranged from small towns to entire nations with several million inhabitants. Table 1 lists estimates of R 0 in recent studies. The variability of R 0 estimates suggests that local factors, including geographic and demographic conditions, could play an important role in disease spread [65] [66] [67] . In the following sections, we review how these estimates are obtained and how we shall interpret the estimates, starting from a simple structured epidemic model proposed in 1927.

Mathematical models provide a unique way to analyze the transmission dynamics and study various different scenarios associated to the spread of communicable diseases in population(s) [18, 68, 69] . The history of the mathe-matical modeling of infectious diseases greatly remounts to the study of Sir Ronald Ross in 1911 [70] who invented a classic malaria model and also discovered the mosquito-borne transmission mechanisms of malaria. Employing a mass action principle for the spread of malaria, Ross explored the effects of controling the mosquito population using simple mathematical models [71] . Following his effort, Kermack and McKendrick introduced a classical SIR (susceptible-infectious-removed) epidemic model in 1927, which is most frequently utilized in the present day, given by the following system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations (ODEs) [72] :

where S(t) denotes susceptible individuals at time t ; I (t), infected (assumed infectious) individuals at time t ; and R(t), recovered (assumed permanently immune) individuals at time t ; β is the transmission rate; γ the recovery rate; and N is the total population size which is assumed constant for a closed population (i.e. a population without immigration and emmigration). Susceptible individuals in contact with the virus enter the infectious class (I ) at the rate βI /N . That is, homogeneous mixing between individuals is assumed. The basic reproduction number, R 0 , for the epidemic system (2) is given by the product of the transmission rate and the mean infectious period. That is:

Classically, R 0 has been known as a quantity to suggest severity of an epidemic [34] . Indeed, analytical expression of R 0 in (3) is derived simply by solving the above system (2). Replacing I (t) in the right-hand side of dS(t)/dt by

Integrating both sizes of (4) from 0 to infinity,

Since S(∞) = N − R(∞), and because we assume S(0) = N and R(0) = 0, Eq. (5) can be rewritten as

In the above Eq. (6), final size, i.e. the proportion of those experiencing infection among a total number of individuals in a community following a large scale epidemic, is defined as p := R(∞)/N . That is,

Therefore, the following final size equation of an autonomous SIR (or SEIR) model is obtained:

Eq. (8) can be analytically derived using both deterministic (models governed by ODEs or partial differential equations (PDEs)) [73] and stochastic models [74] . Despite the usefulness of (2), SIR assumptions given by ODEs are not always directly applicable to real data. One of the reasons include that there is no disease where an infected individual can cause secondary transmission immediately after his/her infection.

Accordingly, we have used slightly extended compartmental models in the previous studies to describe the transmission dynamics of the 1918/19 influenza pandemic and estimate the reproduction number [38, 39] . We now describe two different SEIR (susceptible-exposed-infectious-removed) models that have been used to estimate the reproduction number. The first model is the simple SEIR model, and the second model accounts for asymptomatic and hospitalized individuals.

The simple SEIR model classifies individuals as susceptible (S), exposed (E), infectious (I ), recovered (R), and dead (D) [18] . Susceptible individuals in contact with the virus enter the exposed class at the rate βI (t)/N , where β is the transmission rate, I (t) is the number of infectious individuals at time t and N = S(t) + E(t) + I (t) + R(t) is the total population for any t . The entire population is assumed to be susceptible at the beginning of the epidemic. Individuals in latent period (E) progress to the infectious class at the rate k (where 1/k suggests the mean latent period). We assume homogeneous mixing (i.e. random mixing) between individuals and, therefore, the fraction I (t)/N is the probability of a random contact with an infectious individual in a population of size N . Since we assume that the time-scale of the epidemic is much faster than characteristic times for demographic processes (natural birth and death), background demographic processes are not included in the model. Infectious individuals either recover or die from influenza at the mean rates γ and δ, respectively. Recovered individuals are assumed protected for the duration of the outbreak. The mortality rate is given by δ = γ [CFP/(1 − CFP)], where CFP is the mean case fatality proportion. The transmission process can be modeled using the system of nonlinear differential equations:

where C(t) is the cumulative number of infectious individuals. The basic reproduction number of the above system (9) is given by the product of the mean transmission rate and the mean infectious period, R 0 = β/(γ + δ).

A more complex SEIR model ( Fig. 1 ) classifies individuals as susceptible (S), exposed (E), clinically ill and infectious (I ), asymptomatic and partially infectious (A), diagnosed and reported (J ), recovered (R), and death (D). The birth and natural death rates are assumed to have a common rate μ (60-year life expectancy as in [38] ). The entire population is assumed susceptible at the beginning of the pandemic wave. Susceptible individuals in contact with the virus progress to the latent class at the rate β(I (t) + J (t) + qA(t))/N where β is the transmission rate, and 0 < q < 1 is a reduction factor in the transmissibility of the asymptomatic class (A). Since there is no explicit evidence estimating and proving the effectiveness of public health interventions, and because a high burden was placed upon the sanitary and medical sectors, diagnosed/hospitalized individuals (J ) are assumed equally infectious. Although it is difficult to explicitly evaluate the difference in infectiousness between general community and hospital, we roughly made this assumption since 78 percent of the nurses of the San Francisco Hospital contracted influenza [75] . A more rigorous assumption requires either statistical analysis of more detailed time-series data [76] or an epidemiological comparison of specific groups by contact frequency [77] . The total population size at time t is given by . We assumed homogeneous mixing of the population and, therefore, the fraction (I (t) + J (t) + qA(t))/N is the probability of a random contact with an infectious individual. A proportion 0 < ρ < 1 of latent individuals progress to the clinically infectious class (I ) at the rate k while the remaining (1 − ρ) progress to the asymptomatic partially infectious class (A) at the same rate k (fixed to 1/1.9 days −1 [8] ). Asymptomatic cases progress to the recovered class at the rate γ 1 . Clinically infectious individuals (class I ) are diagnosed (reported) at the rate α or recover without being diagnosed (e.g., mild infections, hospital refusals) at the rate γ 1 . Diagnosed individuals recover at the rate γ 2 = 1/(1/γ 1 − 1/α) or die at rate δ. The mortality rates were adjusted according to the case fatality proportion (CFP), such that δ = CFP 1−CFP (μ + γ 2 ). The transmission process can be modeled using the following system of nonlinear differential equations:

We assume the cumulative number of influenza notifications, our observed epidemic data, is given by C(t). Seven model parameters (β, γ 1 , α, q, ρ, E(0), I (0)) are estimated from the epidemic curve by least squares fitting as explained below. The reproduction number for model (10) is given by (see [38] ):

and the clinical reporting proportion is given by:

In the simplest manner, model parameters can be estimated via least-square fitting of the model solution to the observed data. That is, one looks for the set of parametersΘ whose model solution best fits the epidemic data by minimizing the sum of the squared differences between the observed data y t and the model solution C(t, Θ). That is, we minimize:

The standard deviation of the parameters can be estimated by computing the asymptotic variance-covariance AV(Θ) matrix of the least-squares estimate by [78] :

where n is the total number of observations,σ 2 is the estimated variance, and∇C are numerical derivatives of C. Estimates ofR 0 can be obtained by substituting the corresponding individual parameter estimates into an analytical formula of R 0 . Further, using the delta method [79] , we can derive an expression for the variance of the estimated basic reproduction numberR 0 . An expression for the variance of R 0 for the simple SEIR model (Eqs. (9) ) is given by:

This expression depends on the variance (denoted by V ) of the individual parameter estimates as well as their covariance (denoted by Cov).

Another method to generate uncertainty bounds on the reproduction number is generating bootstrap confidence intervals by generating sets of realizations of the best-fit curve C(t) [80] . Each realization of the cumulative number of case notifications C i (t) (i = 1, 2, . . . , m) is generated as follows: for each observation C(t) for t = 2, 3, . . . , n days generate a new observation C i (t) for t 2 (C i (1) = C(1)) that is sampled from a Poisson distribution with mean:

The corresponding realization of the cumulative number of influenza notifications is given by . . , n. The reproduction number was then estimated from each of 1000 simulated epidemic curves to generate a distribution of R estimates from which simple statistics can be computed including 95% confidence intervals. These statistics need to be interpreted with caution. For example, 95% confidence intervals for R derived from our bootstrap sample of R should be interpreted as containing 95% of future estimates when the same assumptions are made and the only noise source is observation error. It is tempting but incorrect to interpret these confidence intervals as containing the true parameters with probability 0. 95 . Fig. 2 shows the temporal distributions of the reproduction number and the proportion of the clinical reporting obtained by the bootstrap method after fitting the complex SEIR epidemic model to the initial phase of the Fall influenza wave using 17 epidemic days of the Spanish Flu Pandemic in San Francisco, California.

In addition to the estimation of R 0 , it is of practical importance to evaluate time-dependent variations in the transmission potential. Explanation of the time course of an epidemic can be partly achieved by estimating the effective reproduction number, R(t), defined as the actual average number of secondary cases per primary case at time t (for t > 0) [41, 42, 44, 81, 82] . 1 Although effective interventions against Spanish influenza may have been limited in the early 20th century, it is plausible that the contact frequency leading to infection varied with time owing to the huge number of deaths and dissemination of information through local media (e.g., newspapers). R(t) shows timedependent variation with a decline in susceptible individuals (intrinsic factors) and with the implementation of control measures (extrinsic factors). If R(t) < 1, it suggests that the epidemic is in decline and may be regarded as being under control at time t (vice versa, if R(t) > 1). 

To appropriately understand the theoretical concept of R(t), let us firstly consider an explicitly infection-age structured epidemic model. Whereas Kermack-McKendrick model governed by ODEs (i.e. SIR and SEIR models as discussed above) has been well-known, Kermack and McKendrick had actually proposed an infection-age structured model in their initial publication in 1927 [72] , the mathematical importance of which was recognized only after 1970s [83, 84] . Let us denote the numbers of susceptible and recovered individuals by S(t) and U(t). Further, let i(t, τ ) be the density of infectious individuals at time t and infection-age τ (i.e. time since infection). The model is given by

where λ(t) is referred to as the force of infection (foi) (i.e. as discussed in Section 2, foi is defined as the rate at which susceptible individuals get infected) which is given by:

and γ (τ ) is the rate of recovery at infection-age τ . It should be noted that the above model has not taken into account the background host demography (i.e. birth and death). In a closed population, the total population size N is thus given by:

It should also be noted that, although i(t, τ ) is referred to as density, it is not meant to be a normalized density (i.e. integral of i(t, τ ) over t and τ does not sum up to 1). Rather, we use density to mathematically refer to the absolute frequency in the infection-age space.

The system (17) can be reasonably integrated

and j 0 (τ ) suggests the density of initially infected individuals at the beginning of an epidemic. In the following arguments, we call j (t) as incidence of infection (i.e. new infections at a given point of time t ). It is not difficult to derive (17)-(21). Thus, the subequation of i(t, 0) in system (17) is rewritten as

Taking into account the initial condition in (20) , Eq. (23) is rewritten as

Considering the initial invasion phase (i.e. initial growth phase of an epidemic), we get a linearized equation

Eq. (26) represents Lotka's integral equation, where the basic reproduction number, R 0 , is given by

Thus, the epidemic will grow if R 0 > 1 and decline to extinction if R 0 < 1. The above model can yield the same final size equation as seen in models governed by ODEs [17] .

Assuming that the infection-age distribution is stable, we get a simplified renewal equation

where A(τ ) is the product of ψ(τ ) and S(0). Moreover, assuming that we observe an exponential growth of incidence during the initial phase (i.e. j (t) = k exp(rt) where k and r are, respectively, a constant (k > 0) and the intrinsic growth rate), the following relationship must be met

Replacing j (t − τ ) in the right-hand side of (28) by (29), we get

Removing j (t) from both sides of (30), we get the Lotka-Euler characteristic equation:

Further, we consider a probability density of the generation time (i.e. the time from infection of an individual to the infection of a secondary case by that individual [85] ), denoted by w(τ ):

Using (32), Eq. (31) can be replaced by

Eqs. (29)- (33) are what Wallinga and Lipsitch discussed in a recent study [6] , reasonably suggesting the relationship between the generation time and R 0 . Accordingly, the estimator of R 0 using the intrinsic growth rate is given by:

where M(−r) is the moment generating function of the generation time distribution w(τ ), given the intrinsic growth rate r [6] . 2 Eq. (34) significantly improved the issue of estimating R 0 using the intrinsic growth rate alone, because (34) permits validating estimates of R 0 by various different distributional assumptions for w(τ ). The issue of assuming 2 In the original study of Wallinga and Lipsitch [6] , the notation R 0 is not used for Eq. (34) and rather document (34) as the estimator of R. Most likely, there are two reasons for this. First, we cannot assure if all individuals are susceptible to pandemic influenza before the start of epidemic (as discussed in Section 2). Second, we cannot assume that infection-age distribution is stable during the initial growth phase, which is highlighted in (20) . Thus, it should be remembered that the above discussion is mathematically tight in theory, but there are certain number of assumptions to apply the concept to observed data. Since writing R alone is always confusing (as it is unclear if R is concerned with time or immunity status), here we use R 0 instead. explicit distributions for latent and infectious periods has been highlighted in recent studies [86] [87] [88] [89] [90] and indeed, this point is in part addressed by (34) , because the convolution of latent and infectious periods yields w(τ ). Moreover, since the assumed lengths of generation time most likely yielded different estimates of R 0 for Spanish influenza by different studies [60] , Eq. (34) highlights a critical need to clarify the generation time distribution using observed data.

Here we briefly show a numerical example. Fig. 3 shows the daily number of influenza deaths during Spanish influenza pandemic in a suburb of Zurich, 1918 [91] . Since the non-linear phase is difficult to analyze, our interest to estimate R 0 with this dataset is limited to the initial growth phase only (right panel in Fig. 3) . Even though the data represent deaths over time (i.e. not infection events with time), we can directly extract the same intrinsic growth rate as practised with onset data, assuming that death data are a good proxy for morbidity data (see our discussions in Section 6). Assuming exponential growth in deaths as shown in (29), the intrinsic growth rate r is estimated to be 0.16 per day. Supposing that w(τ ) is arbitrarily assumed to follow a gamma distribution with mean G and coefficient of variation, CV = √ Var(G)/G, R 0 is given by

Although there is no concensus regarding the generation time of Spanish influenza, we assume it ranges from 2-5 days. Assuming further that CV = 0.5, R 0 is estimated to range from 1.36 (for G = 2 day) to 2.07 (for G = 5 days).

In the following, let us consider the non-linear phase of an epidemic. Derivation of R 0 given by (34) assumes an exponential growth which is applicable only during the very initial phase of an epidemic (or, when the transmission is stationary over time), and thus, it is of practical importance to widen the utility of above-described renewal equations in order to appropriately interpret the time-course of an influenza pandemic. Let us explicitly account for the depletion of susceptible individuals, as we deal with an estimation issue with time-inhomogeneous assumptions (i.e. non-linear phase). Adopting the mass action assumption, we get:

where A(t, τ ) should be interpreted as the reproductive power at time t and infection-age τ at which an infected individual generates secondary cases. We refer to the latter part of Eq. Using Eq. (36) , the effective reproduction number, R(t) (i.e. instantaneous reproduction number at calendar time t ) is defined as:

Following (37), we can immediately see that R(t) with an autonomous assumption (i.e. where contact and recovery rates do not vary with time) is given by:

which is shown in [17] . In practical terms, Eq. (38) suggests that time-varying decrease in transmission potential as well as decline in the epidemic reflects only depletion of susceptible individuals. This corresponds to a classic assumption of the Kermack and McKendrick model. However, as we discussed in the beginning of this section, we postulate that human contact behaviors (and other extrinsic factors) modify the dynamics of pandemic influenza, assuming that the decline in incidence does reflect not only depletion of susceptibles but also various extrinsic dynamics (e.g., isolation, quarantine and closure of public buildings). Thus, instead of the assumption in (36), we shall assume time-inhomogeneous ψ(t, τ ); i.e. (39) 

To derive simple estimator of R(t), it is convenient to assume separation of variables for A(t, τ ) (implicitly assuming that the relative infectiousness to infection-age is independent of calendar time) [92] . Under this assumption, A(t, τ ) is rewritten as the product of two functions φ 1 (t) and φ 2 (τ ):

Arbitrarily assuming a normalized density for φ 2 (τ ), i.e.

then, it is easy to find that

suggesting that the function φ 1 (t) is equivalent to the effective reproduction number R(t). Another function φ 2 (τ ) represents the density of infection events as a function of infection-age τ . Accordingly, we can immediately see that φ 2 (τ ) is exactly the same as w(τ ), the generation time distribution. That is, the above arguments suggest that A(t, τ ) (i.e. the rate at which an infectious individual at calendar time t and infection-age τ produces secondary transmission) is decomposed as:

Inserting (43) into (39) yields an estimator of R(t) [92] :

The above Eq. (44) is exactly what was proposed in applications to SARS [41] and foot and mouth disease [93] ; i.e. discretizing (44) to apply it to the daily incidence data (i.e. using j i incident cases infected between time t i and time t i+1 and descretized generation time distribution w i ), (45) R(t i ) = j i n j =0 j i−j w j was used as the estimator. However, it should be noted that the study in SARS implicitly assumed that onset data c(t) at time t reflects the above discussed infection event j (t). That is, supposing that we observed c i onset cases reported between t i and t i+1 , R(t) was calculated as

where s j is the discretized serial interval which is defined as the time from onset of a primary case to onset of the secondary cases [94, 95] . The method permits reasonable transformation of an epidemic curve (i.e. temporal distribution of case onset) to the estimates of time-inhomogeneous reproduction number R(t). Employing the relative likelihood of case k infected by case l using the density function of serial interval s(t); i.e.

.

Using (47), expected value and variance of R(t i ) are given by the following

where n t is the total number of reported case onsets at time t [96] .

In the present day, only by using the above described methods (or similar concepts with similar assumptions), we can transform epidemic curves into R(t) and roughly assess the impact of control measures on an epidemic. However, whereas Eqs. (45) and (46) are similar in theory, we need to explicitly account for the difference between onset and infection event. In fact, when there are many asymptomatic infections and asymptomatic secondary transmissions, serial interval is not equivalent to the generation time, and thus, directly adopting the above methods would be inappropriate. Since this point is particularly important in analyzing influenza data, we discuss this issue in Section 6.

In the previous sections, we discussed several different methods to estimate R 0 either by (i) employing detailed curve fitting methods assuming a structured epidemic model or (ii) using the intrinsic growth rate (or doubling time [97, 98] ). Summarizing the above discussions, we believe that the readers should benefit from memorizing R 0 = 1/M(−r) for the use of the intrinsic growth rate r in estimating R 0 [6] and remembering the final size equation R 0 = − ln(1 − p)/p, suggesting the severity of an epidemic as the theoretical concept. Indeed, estimators using either the intrinsic growth rate or final size relations have played an important role in discussing R 0 of pandemic influenza [63] .

However, it should be noted that deterministic models do not permit incorporating stochasticity explicitly (e.g., standard error for R 0 is determined by measurement of errors alone), as the models argue only average number of secondary transmissions within the assumed transmission dynamics. That is, our arguments given above explore only the time-evolution of influenza spread in the mean field. To address the issue of variation in secondary transmissions, full stochastic models are called for [99] .

From a viewpoint of data science, the discrete-time branching process, which is also referred to as Galton-Watson process, can reasonably assess individual heterogeneity in secondary transmissions [100, 101] . As we discussed the initial growth phase of the deterministic model, let us consider the same epidemic phase where we observe a geometric increase in the number of cases by generation [23] . We denote the initial number of infected individuals by C 0 in generation 0. Then, during the first generation, C 1 cases are produced by secondary transmissions of C 0 . Similarly, let C n be the number of infections in generation n. The branching process of this type assumes that every infected individual has an independently and identically distributed stochastic random variable ρ (n) i representing the number of secondary cases produced by case i in generation (n), and that environmental stochasticity and immigration/emigration can be ignored. Supposing that the pattern of secondary transmission follows a discrete probability distribution p k with k secondary transmission(s); i.e. (49) . .) then, the expected number of secondary transmissions and the variance are given by

In other words, the concept of probability distribution p k reflects offspring distribution in population ecology, and this permits explicit modeling of variations in secondary transmissions in infectious diseases [102, 103] . This approach is particularly important during the initial phase of an epidemic, because the number of infectious individuals is small in this stage, and thus, it is deemed essential to take into account demographic stochasticity, i.e. variation in the numbers of secondary transmissions by chance. Indeed, the model has been applied to observed outbreak data where we observed the extinction before growing to a major epidemic [104, 105] .

Let us briefly discuss the variation in secondary transmissions and an estimation method of R 0 using the discretetime branching process, deriving analytical expressions of the expected number of infected individuals in generation n, M n = E(C n ) and the variance V n = Var(C n ). It is impossible to avoid using the probability generating function (pgf) to discuss the branching process. The above described ρ (n) i characterize positive and discrete number of secondary transmissions, and thus, is a non-zero discrete random variable. The pgf of ρ, g ρ (s) is given by

There are two basic properties concerning g(s) in relation to the epidemic process. First, R 0 is by definition the mean value of secondary transmissions (Eq. (50) ) and, thus given by g (1) . Second, the probability that an infected individual does not cause any secondary transmissions p 0 = Pr(ρ = 0) is given by g(0), which is useful for discussing threshold phenomena and extinction [101] . If we note that C 0 = 1 (i.e. only one index case), the Galton-Watson process has the following pgf identity:

g n+1 (s) = g n g(s) = g g n (s) .

Even when there are C 0 = a cases in generation 0 (where a > 1), we just have to assume that there are a different independent infection-trees and thus g C 0 (s) = s a , (53) g C n (s) = g n (s) a .

From the above discussions, the expected number of cases in generation n, M n , and the variance V n is

The process grows geometrically if R 0 > 1, stays constant if R 0 = 1, and decays geometrically if R 0 < 1. These three cases are referred to as supercritical, critical, and subcritical, respectively. However, unlike the deterministic model, it should be remembered that critical process does not permit continued transmissions, and rather, the process becomes extinct almost surely (i.e. probability of extinction given R 0 = 1 is one) [101] . Mathematically, demographic stochasticity in transmission is represented by a Poisson process, which has been practiced in the application of branching processes to epidemics [17] . Assuming that mean value of secondary transmissions is a constant R 0 , the conditional distribution of observing C n+1 cases, given C n cases, follows a Poisson distribution:

Supposing that we analyze influenza data documenting the generations of cases from 0 to n in which we observed geometric growth, the likelihood of estimating R 0 is proportional to

Here we apply the above model to the Spanish influenza data in Zurich (Fig. 3) . Assuming that the generation time of length τ , w(τ ), is given by the following delta function with the mean length 3 days, Since we assumed exponential growth during the initial 16 days in the previous section, here we similarly assume a geometric increase up to the 6th generation. Applying (56) to the above data, maximum likelihood estimate of R 0 (and the corresponding 95 percent confidence intervals) is 1.51 (1.24, 1.81) . The model is simple enough to estimate R 0 , and indeed, a slight extension of the discrete-time branching process has been employed to estimate R 0 as well as the proportion of undiagnosed cases in the analysis of SARS outbreak data [106] .

It should be noted that the discrete-time branching process assumes a homogeneous pattern of spread. A technical issue has arisen on this subject during the SARS outbreak. Usually, we observe some cases who produce an extraordinary number of secondary cases compared with other infected individuals, which are referred to as superspreaders. Because of this, observed offspring distributions for directly transmitted diseases tend to be extremely skewed to the right. Empirically, it has been suggested that Poisson offspring distribution is sometimes insufficient to highlight the presence of superspreaders in epidemic modeling [107] . For example, if non-zero discrete distribution of secondary cases follows a geometric distribution with mean R 0 , the pgf is given by a geometric distribution with mean R 0 :

Moreover, if the offspring distribution follows gamma distribution with mean R 0 and dispersion parameter k, the pgf g(s) follows negative binomial distribution [108] :

We still do not know if pandemic influenza is also the case to warrant the skewed offspring distributions. To explicitly test if superspreading events frequently exist in influenza transmission, it is necessary to accumulate contact tracing data for this difficult disease, the cases of which often show flu-like symptoms only (as discussed in Section 1).

In addition, it should be noted that we cannot attribute the skewed offspring distribution to the underlying contact network only. To date, there are two major reasons which can generate superspreaders: (i) those who experience very frequent contacts (social superspreader) or (ii) those who are suffering from high pathogen loads or those who can scatter the pathogen through the air such as the use of nebulizer in hospitals (biological superspreader). From the offspring distribution only, we cannot distinguish these two mechanisms.

With regard to the estimation of R 0 using final size, we briefly discuss another method based on a stochastic process. As we discussed above, let S(t), I (t) and U(t) be the numbers of susceptible, infectious and recovered individuals at time t, respectively. Further, let β and 1/γ denote the transmission rate and the mean duration of the infectious period, respectively. Supposing that K(t), the number of individuals who experienced infection between time 0 and time t, is given by K(t) = S(0) − S(t), the two processes K(t) and U(t) are increasing counting processes where the general epidemic is explained by:

where Z t denotes the σ -algebra generated by the history of the epidemic {S(u), I (u); 0 < u < t} andS(t) = S(t)/n (where n is the size of the susceptible population at time 0). The latter is equivalent to assuming density-independent transmission (i.e. also referred to as true mass action or frequency dependent assumption [109] ). Based on Eq. (61), two zero-mean martingales [110] are defined by:

From the martingale theory [111] , a zero-mean martingale is given by

Thus, the estimatorθ =β/γ is given by

wherep is the observed final size (= 1 − S(T )/n) at the end of the epidemic at time T . Furthermore, the variance of the zero-martingale is given by

From the martingale central limit theorem [112] , the estimator θ is approximately normally distributed in a major outbreak in a large community. The standard error is then consistently estimated by:

Consequently, the estimator and standard error of R 0 are given by: More detailed mathematical descriptions can be found elsewhere [74, 113, 114] .

Here we show a numerical example. Let us consider a large epidemic of equine influenza (i.e. influenza in horses) as our case study. In 1971, a nationwide epidemic of equine-2 influenza A (H3N8) was observed in Japan [115] . For example, in Niigata Racecourse, 580 influenza cases were diagnosed with influenza among a total of 640 susceptible horses. The final size p is thus 90.6 percent (95 percent CI: 88.4, 92.9) . From this data, we calculate R 0 and its uncertainty bounds. Usingp = 0.906 and total number of infected U(T ) = 580 in Eq. (64) ,θ is estimated as 0.00408. Therefore, the estimate of R 0 = 2.60 is given by Eq. (67) . Moreover, from Eq. (66) where S(T ) = 639 − 579 = 60 and S(0)(= n) = 639 (we assume one case was already infected at time t = 0), we obtain s.e.(θ) = 0.000126. Here,θ is assumed to follow normal distribution. Therefore, the 95 percent confidence interval for R 0 is given as

When applying the final size equation, it should be remembered that (i) we assume all individuals are initially susceptible (in the above described model) and (ii) we assume β and γ are independent of time (i.e. constant), and thus, that any extrinsic factors should not have influenced the course of the observed epidemic.

In the above described models, we always assumed that the pattern of influenza transmission is homogeneous, which is clearly unrealistic to capture the transmission dynamics of influenza. Since the last century, it has already been understood that the transmission dynamics are not sufficiently modeled by assuming homogeneous mixing. However, because more detailed data are lacking (e.g., epidemic records of pandemic influenza with time, age and space), what we could offer has been mainly to extract the intrinsic growth rate from the initial exponential growth, and estimate R 0 using the estimator based on a model with the homogeneous mixing assumption.

One line of addressing heterogeneous patterns of transmission using the observed data is separating household transmission from community transmission. In other words, it is of practical importance to distinguish between individual and group R 0 [116] . From the beginning of explicit modeling of influenza [117, 118] , a method to separately estimate the transmission parameters has been proposed, which has been partly extended in a recent study [92] or applied to further old data of pandemic influenza [119] . Indeed, an important aspect of this issue was highlighted in a recent study which compared estimates of R 0 between those having casual and close contacts [63] . To estimate key parameters of household and community transmissions of influenza, or to simulate realistic patterns of influenza spread, such a consideration is fruitful.

Mathematically elaborating this concept, there are several publications which proposed the basis of analyzing household transmission data employing stochastic models [120] [121] [122] . Moreover, a rigorous study has been made to estimate parameters determining the intrinsic dynamics (e.g., infectious period) using household transmission data with time [123] .

Future challenges on the estimation of R 0 include the application of such theories to the observed data with some extension. For example, as we discussed above, knowing the generation time would be crucial to elucidate a robust estimate of R 0 [6, 89, 90, 92] . However, we do not know if the generation time varies between close and casual contacts; this should be the case, because, as long as the generation time is given by coevolution of latent and infectious periods, close contact should lead to shorter generation time than casual contact. In future studies, influenza models may better to highlight the increasing importance of considering household transmission to estimate the transmission potential using the temporal distribution of infection events.

Except for our approach in Section 3, mathematical arguments given in this paper are not particularly special for influenza. In other words, we modelers have employed similarly structured models which describe the population dynamics of other directly transmitted diseases, and such models are applicable not only for influenza but also for many viral diseases including measles, smallpox, chickenpox, rubella and so on [18] . However, influenza has many different epidemiologic characteristics compared to other childhood viral diseases. For instance, following the previous efforts in influenza epidemiology [124] [125] [126] and modeling [127, 128] , we should at least note the following: 1. Detailed mechanisms of immunity have yet to be clarified. Since influenza virus has an wide antigenic diversity (i.e. unlike other childhood viral diseases, antigenic stimulation is not monoclonal), this complicates our understanding in the fraction of immune individuals, cross-protection mechanisms and evolutionary dynamics [129] [130] [131] [132] . 2. Flu-like symptoms are too common, and thus, we cannot explicitly distinguish influenza from other common viral infections without expensive laboratory tests for each case. Because of this character, it is difficult to effectively implement usual public health measures (e.g., contact tracing and isolation). 3 . Although explicit estimates are limited [133, 134] , a certain fraction of infected individuals does not exhibit any symptoms (following infection). This complicates not only the eradication [135] but also epidemiologic evaluations of vaccines and therapeutics [136] . 4 . Looking into the details of the intrinsic dynamics [4, 123] , it appears recently that the generation time and infectious period are much shorter than what were believed previously. Therefore, despite the relatively small R 0 estimate, the turn-over of a transmission cycle (i.e. speed of growth) is rather quick. The incubation period of Spanish influenza is as short as 1.5 days [137] , complicating the implementation of quarantine measures [138] .

Thus, depending on the characteristics of observed data (and the specific purpose of modeling), we have to highlight these factors referring to the best available evidence. This is one of the most challenging issues in designing public health interventions against a potential future pandemic.

In addition to the above described issue, we, of course, must remember what the reported data is. In many studies, the compartment I (t) or relevant class of infectious individuals of the SIR (or SEIR) model was fitted to the observed data. Indeed, in the majority of previous classic studies, R(t) (i.e. removed class; denoted by U(t) in our discussion) of Kermack and McKendrick model was fitted to the data, assuming that the removed class highlights observed data as the reported cases no longer produce secondary cases. However, the observed epidemiologic data is actually neither I (t) nor U(t). Always, what we get as the temporal distribution reflects case onset or deaths with time which is mostly accompanied by some reporting delay.

We believe this is one of the most challenging issues in epidemic modeling. Except for rare examples in sexually transmitted diseases, infection event is not directly observable, and thus, we have to maximize the utility of reported (observed) data, explicitly understanding what the data represents.

In this case, back-calculation of the infection events is called for. Let c(t) denote the number of onsets at time t , this should be modeled by using incidence j (t) and the density of the incubation period of length τ , f (τ ):

Further, supposing that b(t) is the number of reported cases at time t and the density of reporting delay of length σ is h(σ ), observed data is modeled as:

That is, only by using the observed data b(t) and known information of the reporting delay h(s) and incubation period distributions f (τ ), we can translate the observed data into infection process j (t).

In some cases, only death data with time, d(t), is available [60] . Similarly, this can be modeled using the backcalculation. Let q denote the case fatality of influenza which is reasonably assumed time-independent, and further let m(u) be the relative frequency of time from onset to death, d(t) is given by:

Even when using onset data with delay or death data, it should be noted that the intrinsic growth rate is identical to that estimated from the infection event distribution. Assuming that the incidence j (t) exhibits exponential growth during the initial phase of an epidemic, i.e. j (t) = k exp(rt), Eqs. (68) and (70) can be rewritten as

Thus, the growth terms exp(rt) (i.e. which depends on time) of b(t) and d(t) are still identical to that of incidence j (t).

In other words, mathematically Eqs. (71) and (72) could be a justification to extract an estimate of the intrinsic growth rate from cases with reporting delay or deaths with time. However, we should always remember that the infection-age distribution is not stable during the initial phase, and moreover, this method cannot address individual variation in the secondary transmissions (e.g., superspreaders, as we discussed in Section 5).

In this way, it is not an easy task to clarify the infection events with time. A similar application of the convolution equation has been intensively studied in modeling HIV/AIDS. Since AIDS has a long incubation period, and because AIDS diagnosis is certainly reported in the surveillance data (at least, in industrialized countries), backcalculation of the number of HIV infections with time using the number of AIDS diagnoses and the incubation period distribution has been an issue to capture the whole epidemiologic picture of HIV/AIDS [139] [140] [141] [142] . In the current modeling practice using the temporal distribution of onset events, we are now faced with a need to apply this technique to diseases with much shorter incubation periods. Now, let us look back at a method to estimate R(t), which was proposed by Wallinga and Teunis [41] . Whereas the method has a background of mathematical reasoning (as shown in (46), Section 4.2), the estimator was derived implicitly assuming that observed data exactly reflects infection events. If asymptomatic infection and transmission are rare, this assumption might be justifiable as the lengths of the serial interval and generation time become almost identical. However, as long as we cannot ignore asymptomatic transmissions, which is particularly the case for influenza, the assumption s(σ ) = w(τ ) might be problematic [85] .

Since R(t) of this method was given by summing up the probability of causing secondary transmissions by an onset case at the onset time of this case t , we should rewrite the assumption using a modified onset-based renewal equation as follows [60] :

For simplicity, we ignore reporting delay in the observed data, roughly assuming that the observed data reflects c(t). Translating Eq. (73) in words, it is implicitly assumed that secondary transmission happens exactly at the time of onset, and based on this assumption, R(t) in the right-hand side of (73) can be backcalculated.

To understand the assumptions behind the above equation, let us assume that incidence j (t) is given by (74) 

where β(σ ) is the transmission rate at disease-age σ (i.e. the time since onset of infection [143] ) and (σ ) is the survivorship of cases following onset. It should be noted that Eq. (74) ignores secondary transmissions before onset of illness. As we discussed above, c(t) is given by j (t) and the incubation period distribution f (τ ), (75) 

Replacing c(t) in the right-hand side of (74) by (75), we get

where s represents infection-age (i.e. time since infection), and φ(s) is given by

which represents generation time distribution. From Eqs. (76) and (77), we can find that R(t) is given by

Eq. (78) can be further reduced to R(t) = R 0 S(t)/S(0) which represents Kermack and McKendrick's assumption. Replacing j (t) in the right-hand side of (75) by (74), we get (79) 

where ψ(t, σ ) denotes the serial interval distribution of calender time t and disease-age σ :

Eq. (80) is difficult to solve as it includes S(t − τ ) in the right-hand side. However, in the special case, e.g., let us say when we can assume β(τ ) (τ ) = kδ(τ ) (where k is constant and δ(·) is delta function),

Inserting (81) back to (79) ,

which is onset-based renewal equation which was presented in (73) . What to be learnt from (82) is, the assumption that secondary transmission happens immediately after onset suggests that the incubation period distribution is identical to the serial interval distribution as shown above, which is a bit funny conclusion. Maximizing the utility of observed data has still remained an open question.

In addition to modeling the temporal distribution, explicit modeling of asymptomatic infection is also called for [135] . Provided that there are so many asymptomatic transmissions which are not in the negligible order, we need to shift our concept of transmissibility; e.g., rather than R 0 , a threshold quantity of symptomatic infection is required. In such a case, application of type-reproduction number T might be useful [144, 145] , and it has already been put into practice [146] .

In this review, we focused on the use of the temporal distribution of influenza to estimate R 0 (or R(t)) and the relevant key parameters. It must be remembered that our arguments, almost necessarily, employed the homogeneous mixing assumption, as we cannot extract information on heterogeneous patterns of infection from a single stream of temporal data alone. Presently, more information (e.g., at least, spatio-temporal distribution) is becoming available for influenza. In this section, we briefly sketch what can be (and should be) done in the future to quantify the transmission dynamics of pandemic influenza.

It is not a new issue that heterogeneous patterns of transmission could even destroy the mean field theory in infectious diseases. For example, in a pioneering study of gonorrhea transmission dynamics by Hethcote and Yorke [147] , an importance of contact heterogeneity was sufficiently highlighted. Since a simple model assuming homogeneous mixing did not reflect the patterns of gonorrhea transmission in the United States, Hethcote and Yorke divided the population in question into two; those who are sexually very active and not, the former of which was referred to as core group. Compared with the temporal distribution of infection given by a model with homogeneous mixing assumption, the simple heterogeneous model with a core group revealed much quicker increase in epidemic size, showing rather different trajectory of an epidemic. Given that the variance of sexual partnership is extremely large (i.e. if the distribution of the frequency of sexual intercourse is extremely skewed to the right with a very long right tail), the estimate of R 0 is shown to become considerably high. The finding supports a vulnerability of our society to the invasion of sexually transmitted diseases. Following this pioneering study, considerable efforts have been made to approximately model the heterogeneous patterns of transmission using extended mean field equations [18, 26, 148, 149] .

In addition to such an approximation of heterogeneous transmission, recent progress in epidemic modeling with explicit contact network structures suggests that variance of the contact frequency plays a key role in determining the threshold quantity, and in some special cases, the concept of threshold phenomena could be confused [150] [151] [152] [153] . In Section 4, we defined the force of infection as (83) 

In deterministic models given by simple ODEs (which ignores infection-age), λ(t) is equivalent to βI (t). These are what classical mean field models suggest.

Let us account for an epidemic on networks, whose node-connectivity distribution (i.e. the distribution of probabilities that nodes have exactly k neighbors) follows some explicit distribution P (k). The force of infection λ c , which yields R 0 = 1, in a static contact network is given by (84) 

Here k denotes the average connectivity of the nodes. Assuming that P (k) follows a power law of the form P (k) = ck −v (where c is constant),

Given that v 3, λ c = 0, and in such a case, R 0 even becomes infinite. This implies that the disease spread will continue for any mean estimate of R 0 . Such a network structure is referred to as scale free [154] , complicating disease control efforts in public health [155, 156] . The importance of the network structure would also be highlighted for v > 3. For sexually transmitted infections, contact frequency is countable (unlike airborne infection or transmission through droplets), and v is estimated to be around 3 or a little larger [157] . Following such a finding, many non-sexual directly transmitted diseases are also modeled in the present day assuming the scale-free network [150] . However, it should be noted that the pattern of contact does not necessarily follow scale-free for all directly transmitted diseases. Indeed, there is no empirical evidence which suggests that the contact structure of any droplet infections follows the power law (i.e. we do not know if the above described contact heterogeneity is the case for diseases except for sexually transmitted diseases). A typical example of confusion is seen in the superspreading events during the 2002/03 SARS epidemics [158] , where we cannot explicitly attribute the phenomena either to contact network or biological factors (as long as contact and infection event are not directly observable). We still do not know how we should account for the distribution P (k) for influenza and other viral respiratory diseases (i.e. power law or not) which remains to be clarified for each disease in future research.

Methodological developments have been made to account for the network heterogeneity with data [159] . An approximate approach to address this issue is highlighted particularly in spatio-temporal modeling, an excellent account of which is reviewed by Matt Keeling [160] .

Even though it is difficult to quantify the transmission dynamics with an explicit contact network with time, there are useful analytical approximations to capture the dynamics of influenza (and other respiratory transmitted viral diseases) and estimate the transmission potential. For example, the force of infection with a power law approximation is reasonably given by: (86) λ(t) = βI (t) 1+α S(t) 1+Ψ .

In (86), α and Ψ characterize the epidemic dynamics; e.g., initial growth (i.e. if α is less than 0, the modified form acts to dampen the exponential growth of incidence) and endemic equilibrium (i.e. when Ψ is greater than 0, densitydependent damping is increased). A model of this type was actually validated with measles data in England and Wales, comparing the prediction with that of employing the mass action principle [161] .

Another approximation might be a pair-wise model [162] , which can explicitly account for the correlation between connected pairs. The model reasonably permits deriving the force of infection λ using the number of various connected pairs, which implies wide applicability to the epidemiologic data of sexually transmitted infections. Incorporating spatial heterogeneity in an approximate manner would shed light on further quantifications [163, 164] , and thus, simple and reasonably tractable models which permit spatio-temporal modeling of influenza are expected (e.g., [165] ).

Summarizing the above discussions, we have presented modeling approaches that can quantify the transmission potential of pandemic influenza. As we have shown, temporal case distributions have been analyzed in many instances, and previous efforts have come close to maximize the utility of temporal distributions (i.e. epidemic curve). However, at the same time, we have also learned that we can extract almost the intrinsic growth rate alone from a single timeevolution data. Accordingly, we are now faced with a need to clarify heterogeneous patterns of transmission and more detailed intrinsic dynamics of influenza [166] [167] [168] . With regard to the latter, primitive epidemiologic questions (e.g., probability of clinical attack given infection) remain to be answered for Spanish, Asian and Hong Kong influenza. Let us summarize what we need to clarify theoretically about pandemic influenza in list:

1. Acquired immunity. 2 . Evolutionary dynamics. 3 . Multi-host species transmission. 4 . Asymptomatic transmission. 5 . Attack rate (i.e. Pr(onset | infection)). 6 . Case fatality (i.e. Pr(death | onset)). 7 . Generation time and serial interval. 8 . Latent, incubation, infectious and symptomatic periods with further data. 9 . Transmission potential with time, space and antigenic types. 10 . Transmission potential with time and age.

These issues highlight the importance to quantify the transmission of influenza using not only cases (i.e. those followed onset of symptoms) but also some hint suggesting the infection event. For example, the majority of the above listed issues could be reasonably addressed by implementing serological surveys (e.g., antibody titers of individuals and, preferably, time-delay distribution from infection to seroconversion). Since the proportion of those who do not experience symptomatic infection (i.e. probability of asymptomatic infection) is not small for influenza [64, 146] , case records can tell us little to address the above mentioned issues, and thus, historical data of Spanish influenza may hardly offer further information. By maximizing the utility of observed data, we have to clarify the dynamics of influenza further, and identify key information which characterize the specific mechanisms of spread.

Selective Bottlenecks Shape Evolutionary Pathways Taken during Mammalian Adaptation of a 1918-like Avian Influenza Virus,"Graphical Abstract Highlights d HA diversification arising during initial ferret adaption of avian flu virus is maintained d Low-frequency transmissible polymerase variants arise subsequently d Transmission bottleneck selects specific HA variants d Mammalian transmission can evolve through multiple genetic pathways SUMMARY Avian influenza virus reassortants resembling the 1918 human pandemic virus can become transmissible among mammals by acquiring mutations in hemagglutinin (HA) and polymerase. Using the ferret model, we trace the evolutionary pathway by which an avian-like virus evolves the capacity for mammalian replication and airborne transmission. During initial infection, within-host HA diversity increased drastically. Then, airborne transmission fixed two polymerase mutations that do not confer a detectable replication advantage. In later transmissions, selection fixed advantageous HA1 variants. Transmission initially involved a ''loose'' bottleneck, which became strongly selective after additional HA mutations emerged. The stringency and evolutionary forces governing between-host bottlenecks may therefore change throughout host adaptation. Mutations occurred in multiple combinations in transmitted viruses, suggesting that mammalian transmissibility can evolve through multiple genetic pathways despite phenotypic constraints. Our data provide a glimpse into avian influenza virus adaptation in mammals, with broad implications for surveillance on potentially zoonotic viruses.","Human pandemic influenza viruses can emerge unpredictably from avian reservoirs. Moncla et al. trace the evolutionary path of an avian-like H1N1 virus as it adapts to mammals. They find that initial adaption involves a loose bottleneck, which becomes selective as adaptation progresses, with mammalian transmission evolving via multiple genetic pathways.

In 1918, a novel H1N1 influenza virus, at least partially avian in origin, emerged and killed $50 million people worldwide (Taubenberger et al., 2001 (Taubenberger et al., , 2005 Vana and Westover, 2008; Worobey et al., 2014) . Influenza viruses can quickly generate within-host genetic diversity due to their high mutation rates, rapid replication, and large population sizes, facilitating adaptation to new environments and host species (Baccam et al., 2006; Drake and Holland, 1999; Lauring and Andino, 2010; Nobusawa and Sato, 2006; Parvin et al., 1986; Sanjuá n et al., 2010) . Defining how natural selection and genetic bottlenecks shape avian influ-enza virus adaptation to mammals is critical for understanding how pandemics occur and identifying potentially zoonotic viruses in nature.

Transmission bottlenecks can define subsequent viral evolution. We showed that positive selection for specific hemagglutinin (HA) variants caused a strong bottleneck during evolution of ferret-transmissible reassortant H5N1 viruses (incorporating avian virus HA in a human H1N1 virus backbone) (Wilker et al., 2013) . Another study showed that founder effects, random nonselective processes, drive bottlenecks during mammaladapted seasonal influenza virus transmission in ferrets and guinea pigs (Varble et al., 2014) . The evolutionary forces acting as fully avian-derived influenza viruses evolve toward mammalian transmission have not been assessed.

Recently, members of our team (Watanabe et al., 2014) examined the potential for a virus resembling the 1918 strain to reemerge from wild bird reservoirs by generating an avian-derived reassortant virus with close sequence identity to the 1918 pandemic virus. In ferret passage, this ''1918-like'' virus acquired substitutions in HA and polymerase associated with altered tissue tropism, enhanced replication, and efficient transmissibility (Watanabe et al., 2014) . Here, we use deep sequencing to evaluate the evolutionary processes by which these viruses adapted to replication and transmission in mammals. No new transmission experiments were conducted for the present work, and all ferret nasal swabs were collected prior to the gain-of-function research pause.

Transmissible HA Variants Arise in Ferrets 1918-like avian viral replication was limited in directly inoculated animals, and neither virus nor specific antibodies were detected in contact ferrets (Watanabe et al., 2014) . Introducing the mammal-adapting substitution PB2 E627K enhanced replication (Figures S1A, S1B, and S1E), but not transmission. To assess the impact of known mammalian-adapting mutations in HA on transmission of this virus, HA E190D and G225D (H3, mature peptide numbering) were introduced into the 1918-like avian/ PB2 E627K virus, generating what we will term the ''avian-like'' ''HA190D225D'' virus. Deep sequencing showed that both HA E190D and G225D arose naturally before being introduced: each was detectable in one animal 5 days after inoculation with the 1918-like avian virus ( Figures 1A and 1B) . HA E190D became dominant in all three animals inoculated with the 1918-like avian/PB2 E627K virus ( Figure 1C ). The HA190D225D virus was transmitted in 1 of 3 ferret pairs (Figures S1C and S1F). To characterize mutations occurring in HA190D225D, we analyzed RNA isolated from stock viruses and from nasal secretions from all three index animals and the infected contact. We included stock viruses in this analysis both to define ''input'' viral populations and because even viruses created by reverse ge-netics can accumulate mutations during passage in culture. We enumerated all SNPs occurring at R1% frequency in each virus sequenced; we previously established that this conservative cutoff ensures that only bona fide mutations are considered (Wilker et al., 2013) .

Sequencing revealed that two additional HA mutations arose and were transmitted. HA G400A, encoding serine-to-asparagine at amino acid 113 (S113N), was present in 3% of viruses in the HA190D225D stock and rose to 46%-75% in all three index animals by 3 days post-inoculation, declining on day 5 (Figure 1D , solid traces). S113N was detected in 63% of viruses in the contact soon after transmission ( Figure 1D , broken trace). The second mutation, HA A868T, encoded aspartate-to-valine at position 265 (D265V). D265V was not detectable in the virus stock above 1% but increased in frequency in all three index animals and was present in 40% of viruses transmitted to the contact ( Figure 1E ). Both S113N and D265V are located near the base of the HA globular head ( Figure 1F ). Cloning and sequencing of full-length HA from day 5 showed that S113N and D265V were linked in a small fraction of viruses (2/20 [10%] clones in index and 1/32 [3.125%] in contact; Figures  S2A and S2B ). Viruses were next isolated from the contact animal's nasal wash at day 9 post-contact and amplified on MDCK cells to produce the ''Mut'' stock virus, which was used to inoculate another three ferret pairs (Watanabe et al., 2014) . The Mut virus exhibited similar replication kinetics and pathogenicity to human-derived 1918 viruses and was transmitted in 2/3 pairs (Figures S1D and S1F) (Watanabe et al., 2014) . HA S113N and D265V were maintained at frequencies comparable to those in the inoculum (Figures 1G and 1H, solid traces) . Another novel HA mutation, HA T634C, arose, encoding isoleucine-to-threonine at position 187 (I187T) near the receptor-binding pocket ( Figure 1F ). Present at 4% in the Mut stock virus, I187T rose to 32%-41% in all three index animals by day 5 post-inoculation and was fixed after transmission in contact animal 1 ( Figure 1I ). I187T was not transmitted to contact animal 3 but arose on day 9 post-contact. The rapid increase of I187T in all index animals and its independent re-generation in contact animal 3 strongly suggest that this mutation is advantageous. Indeed, all 17 publicly available human 1918 sequences have 187T, as do 310/338 full-length avian H1N1 HAs (Reid et al., 1999 (Reid et al., , 2003 Sheng et al., 2011; Taubenberger et al., 1997) . S113N, D265V, and I187T were not all transmitted together. S113N was fixed in contact animal 3 after transmission, while D265V and I187T were undetectable (Figures 1G-1I, light blue broken traces). By contrast, D265V and I187T were fixed after transmission in contact animal 1, and S113N was undetectable ( Figures 1G-1I , dark blue broken traces). Cloning and Sanger sequencing showed that S113N and D265V were linked at % 33% frequency in Mut index animals 1 and 3 (Figures S3C and S3D); we cannot determine from these data why S113N and D265V were not transmitted together. Our results suggest that in this genetic context, HA 190D and 225D may benefit transmission, but multiple other SNPs may also bestow increased transmission efficiency.

Selection Maintains HA Polymorphism HA G225D is associated with a switch from a-2,3to a-2,6-linked sialic acid receptor binding in H1N1 viruses (Tumpey et al., 2007; Lakdawala et al., 2015) . Introducing HA190D and 225D into the 1918-like avian virus in the laboratory likely affected the evolutionary pathway these viruses followed, and we cannot know how evolution would have proceeded in their absence. Once introduced, HA 225D remained at or near fixation in all HA190D225D-infected animals ( Figure S3A ). Although G225D was present in 97% of the Mut stock virus, its frequency decreased to 72%-87% by day 5 post-inoculation in all three index animals ( Figure 1J , solid traces). Sequencing at day 5 revealed glycine at position 225 (225G) in 9%-15% of viruses . Also, an asparagine (225N) was now encoded by 8%-13% of viruses in index animals 1 and 3 (Figures S3B-S3D). HA 225D was fixed after transmission in both contacts, but its frequency declined to 93% in contact 3 by day 9 (Figure 1J) . Indeed, by day 5 viruses encoded a mixture of 225D/ 225N in contact 1 and 225D/225N/225G in contact 3 ( Figures  S3B and S3C ). Thus, G225D may be favored during transmission between hosts, but polymorphism at 225 seems to be tolerated within a host.

The upper respiratory tract contains a mixture of cell types with different sialic acid receptors (Chandrasekaran et al., 2008; Jayaraman et al., 2012; Matrosovich et al., 2004; Thompson et al., 2006) . Various anatomical sites and cell types may exert differing degrees of selective pressure favoring a-2,3or a-2,6-tropic viruses (Lakdawala et al., 2015) . HA 225N was identified in severe human infections during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic (Kong et al., 2014; Mak et al., 2010; Matos-Patró n et al., 2015; Wu et al., 2013) . It enables binding to both a-2,6 and a-2,3 receptors and increases binding to non-sialylated glycans (Matos-Patró n et al., 2015) . Diversity at position 225 may therefore be maintained due to balancing selection, which preserves multiple beneficial alleles in a population. Alternatively, increasing diversity at site 225 could be due to relaxation of selection, but this hypothesis would not explain the significant increase in nonsynonymous nucleotide diversity we observed in this region, as described below.

The inverse frequencies of S113N and D265V could similarly be explained by balancing selection. S113N was shown to compensate for a loss of HA heat stability due to substitutions E190D and G225D (Watanabe et al., 2014) , a phenotype associated with transmissibility in other influenza viruses (de Vries et al., 2014; Imai et al., 2012; Linster et al., 2014) . D265V is located proximal to S113N ( Figure 1F ) and may serve a similar function in modulating heat stability. We hypothesize that during the early stages of mammalian adaptation, selective pressures (e.g., diverse receptor profiles, temperatures, and host factors) may promote accumulation and maintenance of a large number of mutations in HA that later can be selected by the new host environment (Lauring et al., 2012; Parrish et al., 2008) .

Viral genome analysis revealed that two novel mutations arose in the polymerase complex. In one of the animals inoculated with HA190D225D, a G-to-A mutation occurred at PA nucleotide 781, encoding valine-to-methionine at amino acid 253 (V253M). PA V253M was present in only 9% of viruses on day 5 in the index animal but was detected at 73% in the contact shortly after transmission ( Figure 2A) .

A C-to-A mutation at PB2 nucleotide 2,078 encoded alanineto-aspartate at amino acid 684 (PB2 A684D). PB2 A684D was never detectable in the transmitting index animal ( Figure 2B ) but was present in 75% of the contact's viruses shortly after transmission ( Figure 2B ). We cannot exclude the possibility that PB2 A684D was transmitted at very low frequency, but these data suggest that it likely arose de novo in the contact animal.

PA V253M and PB2 A684D were maintained at high frequencies in the Mut virus ( Figures 2C and 2D) . We also identified a mutation encoding threonine-to-isoleucine at position 232 of the nucleoprotein (NP) in contact animal 3 ( Figure 2E , broken trace). This mutation was not detectable in index animal 3 before transmission, indicating that it likely arose early after transmission. Interestingly, neither PA V253M nor PB2 A684D were found to enhance polymerase activity when introduced into the 1918like avian virus backbone (with or without PB2 E627K) either separately or together (Watanabe et al., 2014) . Thus, airborne transmission can greatly alter the viral population, allowing even minor variants to become dominant in subsequent generations despite lacking a measurable fitness benefit. Further, new variants can rapidly emerge de novo after transmission.

To more directly measure selection during mammalian adaptation, we calculated p, the nucleotide diversity of viral populations in all index animals . p quantifies the average number of pairwise differences per nucleotide site among a set of sequences. Comparing the frequencies of synonymous (silent) and nonsynonymous (amino-acid-changing) polymorphisms, denoted pS and pN, respectively, allows us to evaluate the impact of natural selection. pS > pN indicates that, on average, purifying selection is acting to remove deleterious mutations, while pN > pS indicates that diversifying selection is favoring new mutations. Effectively equal levels of pN and pS suggest that allele frequencies are determined primarily by genetic drift. The influenza genome in index animals infected with the HA190D225D and Mut viruses is generally under purifying selection: pS was significantly greater than pN for almost every viral gene, except for NS2/NEP in the Mut index animals (p < 0.01 or p < 0.001, Tables 1 and S2). Strikingly, the exception to this pattern was the 344-codon HA1 region of HA. pN/ pS ratios for HA1 were >1 at every time point in each index animal (range = 1.128-3.077, Table S2 ), likely primarily due to high-frequency SNPs in codons 113, 187, 225, and 265, although there were also 6-7 nonsynonymous HA1 SNPs present between 1%-13% (Table  S3) . Average HA1 pN/pS > 1 in HA190D225D and Mut index animals when all time points are combined (mean pN/pS = 1.718 and 2.007, respectively; p < 0.001, Table 1 ). These data provide further indication that diversification in HA1 is strongly favored in index animals.

To assess whether selection was promoting polymorphism across the entire HA gene, or acting at a few discrete sites, we re-calculated pN and pS using a sliding window of 150 nucleotides (50 codons) and a step size of 3 nucleotides (1 codon). In all index animals, HA1 had several prominent pN peaks (Figures 3A, 3B, and S4A-S4C) near S113N, I187T, G225D, and D265V (Figures 3C and 3D) . Similar peaks were also apparent in several viruses at PA V253M and PB2 A684D ( Figures 3A, 3B , and S5A-S5C). These data suggest that selection favors accumulation of mutations at a few specific sites during avian virus replication in mammals.

pN peaks also occurred in HA2 in HA190D225D index animals ( Figures 3A and 3C ). These peaks result from low-frequency nonsynonymous SNPs (between 1% and 10% in the population) (Table S2 ). This signal disappears after the first transmission event. We speculate that diversification may be favored in the HA190D225D HA stalk domain as a means of modulating stability. Once additional HA mutations accumulate, as in the Mut virus, diversification may no longer be favored. The functional impact of these HA2 mutations is not clear, but these data further support the hypothesis that the early stages of mammalian adaptation are marked by HA diversification.

Our analyses thus far have considered individual mutations in isolation, but complex traits like receptor binding are likely to be conferred by combinations of mutations. We use the term ''haplotype'' to denote a set of mutations that co-occur on the same DNA molecule. If a given set of mutations is beneficial, we would expect the frequency of haplotypes containing those variants to increase. To test whether selection favored specific HA haplotypes, we used LinkGE, a computational tool we developed and validated previously (Wilker et al., 2013) , which enumerates combinations of nucleotides at specified sites in deep sequencing data. We assessed all polymorphic sites in HA1 detected more than once, resulting in a final query of 12 sites (see Supplemental Experimental Procedures and Tables S4 and S5) . Haplotype diversity expanded dramatically during viral replication. Two haplotypes were present during initial HA190D225D infection in the index animal, but five were present by day 5 ( Figure 4A ). Similarly, 3-5 HA haplotypes were present in the Mut virus on day 1, rising to 9-10 on day 3, and 12-14 on day 5 (Figures 4B and 4C) . By day 5, no HA haplotype was pre-sent above 30% in index animals. In agreement, Shannon entropy in HA dramatically increased over time in index animals ( Figures 4E and 4F ).

The number and diversity of viruses founding infection provide the starting point for further within-host evolution. Transmission of only a few virions would result in a founder effect, with reduced diversity across the entire viral genome; this effect does not necessarily involve natural selection. Selection favoring transmission of specific variants might be observed as a reduction in diversity localized to the selected region or gene segment. Fixation of advantageous alleles by selection and the resulting reduction in linked nucleotide diversity is called a selective sweep (Nielsen, 2005) . Strong selection during transmission could favor the emergence of mammalian-transmissible viruses, while strong founder effects might impose a barrier to host switching. To differentiate among these processes, we calculated pN and pS across the viral genome at time points surrounding transmission. As we cannot know the exact day on which contact animals became infected, we evaluated viruses in the contact animal at the first time point at which virus was detectable and the corresponding time point in the index animal. To ensure that this choice did not significantly impact our results, we also performed these analyses using the index animal day 3 viruses.

Transmission of HA190D225D resulted in a slight reduction in both pN and pS across most of the genome (Figures 5A, S5A , and S5D) that was significant overall (F 10, 22 = 2.50, p = 0.035 for pN; F 10, 22 = 3.32, p = 0.009 for pS). The mean difference in pN between index and contact animals was significantly greater for HA2 than for all other genes (Dunnett's test, 5% family error rate; Figure 5B ), most likely due to the loss of a large number of low-frequency SNPs in HA2 present in the index animal before transmission. Selection may favor diversification in HA2 during viral replication, but the loss of low-frequency SNPs suggests that they are not favored for transmission.

The two most prevalent HA haplotypes in the HA190D225D index animal were present after transmission in the contact (Figure 4A) , and there was only a minimal reduction in haplotype diversity (entropy = 1.27 versus 0.922, Figure 4D ). These data together suggest that HA190D225D transmission involved a loose genetic bottleneck. This could indicate that infection in the contact was founded by a large viral inoculum. The relatively low transmission efficiency of HA190D225D may also suggest that no one variant was most fit for mammalian transmission and that a larger, heterogeneous population of ''less fit'' viruses may have been required to found airborne infection.

Patterns of selection in the HA190D225D contact animal were similar to those observed in the index. pN/pS ratios in the contact remained <1 in almost all genes except HA1, which retained its signature of diversifying selection throughout infection (Table  S2 ). However, differences in mean pN and pS values did not attain statistical significance except in PB1, NP, and M2, where pS > pN, perhaps due to low sample numbers (Table 1) . Consistent with these findings, HA entropy increased over time in the contact, surpassing haplotype diversity levels present in the index before transmission ( Figure 4D ). Together, these data show that much of the genetic diversity in the HA190D225D virus was maintained through transmission and that selection continued to promote HA1 diversification afterward.

During the next set of experiments, transmission frequency increased to 2/3 ferret pairs. Although these sample sizes are low, this suggests that the Mut virus may have evolved increased fitness for mammalian infection. Patterns of viral sequence diversity were strikingly different during Mut transmission. In Mut pair 1, pN and pS were higher or only slightly reduced across the majority of the genome after transmission (Figures 5C, S5B , and S5E). In contrast, HA1 experienced a reduction in pN that was significantly larger than the reduction in the rest of the genome; mean pS changes were not significantly different between index and contact animals (F 10, 22 = 0.27; p = 0.982; Figure 5D ). Accordingly, we detected only one HA haplotype shortly after transmission ( Figure 4B ), and entropy was drastically reduced ( Figure 4E ).

In Mut pair 3, unlike pair 1, transmission reduced diversity in multiple gene segments. However, similar to Mut pair 1, the most striking reduction occurred in HA1 (Figures 5E, S5C , and S5F), in which pN was 86% lower after transmission. Mean pN A B C

Haplotypes were defined using LinkGE to query 12 nucleotide positions corresponding to amino acids 113, 145, 159, 187, 189, 190, 192, 225, and 265 . Each color represents a unique, arbitrarily numbered haplotype. Numbers above each bar indicate number of haplotypes detected in that time point. Due to limits on read length, sites were queried with two overlapping windows. Window 1 data are shown; see Tables S4 and S5 for more difference was significantly greater in HA1 than in other genes (F 10, 22 = 7.56; p < 0.001; Dunnett's test, 0.1% level; Figure 5F ). Again, there were no significant differences in the change in pS across genes (F 10, 22 = 0.29; p = 0.976; Figure 5F ). As in pair 1, only a single HA1 haplotype was detectable immediately after transmission, and entropy dropped from 3.06 to 0 ( Figure 4F) . Notably, different haplotypes were transmitted in pairs 1 and 3: HA D265V and I187T were fixed in pair 1 while HA S113N became fixed in pair 3 ( Figures 4B and 4C ). The transmitted haplotype in pair 1 was present in only 5% of the viral population in the index animal on day 3 ( Figure 4B ), underscoring our previous finding (Wilker et al., 2013) that variants present at very low frequencies in a source host can be transmitted by respiratory droplets. Analysis of pN and pS in viruses infecting Mut contact animals revealed that all the gene segments, including HA1, are under purifying selection after transmission. One exception was in pair 1, where pN/pS was 1.471 in PB2 on day 5, after which the entire genome remained under purifying selection for the duration of infection. In pair 3, a signal of diversifying selection is only detectable on day 5 in HA1 (pN/pS = 1.520, Table S2 ), the effects of which are apparent in an expansion of HA haplotypes and increase in entropy on day 9 (Figures 4C-4F) .

Elucidating the evolutionary processes that allow certain viruses to cross species barriers is critical for evaluating the pandemic potential of avian influenza viruses. It is becoming increasingly clear that transmission bottlenecks can have a strong impact on influenza virus evolution. One recent study showed that bottleneck stringency was primarily determined by transmission route and that droplet transmission was characterized by non-selective founder effects (Varble et al., 2014) . That study used a human-adapted virus containing synonymous barcodes, minimizing the potential role of selection. In contrast, H5N1 virus transmission between ferrets involved a selective bottleneck favoring mutations in HA1 (Wilker et al., 2013) . Transmission of H7N9 viruses involved tight, attenuating bottlenecks, although the contributions of founder effects versus selection were unknown (Zaraket et al., 2015) .

Replication and transmission of the HA190D225D and Mut viruses in this study can be conceptualized as modeling the progressive adaptation of an avian-like H1N1 virus in mammals. Here we observed two different types of bottlenecks. Much of the genetic variation in HA190D225D was transmitted, and selection continued to favor HA diversification in the contact animal. In contrast, Mut virus transmission involved reductions in genetic diversity that were sharpest in HA1. Patterns of diversity in both Mut pairs suggest that selection for HA1 variants occurred during transmission; the genome-wide reduction in diversity in Mut pair 3 may be a consequence of the combined action of selection on HA1 and a smaller infecting dose than in pair 1. Importantly, the data we observe in the Mut pairs cannot be explained by a founder effect. The increase or maintenance of diversity across the rest of the genome strongly suggests that multiple virions were transmitted, each of which harbored a single HA haplotype packaged with different variants of the other 7 gene segments. Our data therefore indicate that Mut virus transmission involved a selective sweep acting on HA1. We postulate that founder effects could have occurred in this study but that selection for HA1 variants had a greater impact on genetic diversity.

Successful replication and transmission in a novel host is likely accompanied by selection on processes including receptor binding, membrane fusion, interaction with host proteins, escape from restriction factors, and modulation of immune responses. We have shown that selection reduces HA nucleotide diversity during H5N1 reassortant virus transmission in ferrets (Wilker et al., 2013) , similar to what we observe during transmission of the Mut virus. Although the H5N1 viruses we studied previously had an avian HA, the rest of their genome was derived from a 2009 H1N1 human pandemic isolate, limiting our ability to assess selection acting outside of HA. The present work afforded the opportunity to characterize selection across the entire avian-like influenza genome. An important caveat is that three amino acid substitutions were artificially introduced into the transmissible HA190225D virus. Although both HA E190D and G225D arose naturally before their introduction, PB2 E627K did not, and it is unknown whether these mutations would have become fixed had evolution proceeded organically. The timing of mutation emergence, the identity of adaptive substitutions, and the number of rounds of replication required may have been different if the evolutionary pathway of this particular virus had been completely unaltered. Despite these caveats, we find that selection is primarily confined to HA1, where diversification is strongest at a few sites encoding amino acids in the globular head (113 and 265) and near the sialic acid binding pocket (187, 190, and 225) .

The lack of positive selection in the rest of the genome suggests that once the virus is able to replicate efficiently, e.g., once PB2 E627K is introduced, receptor binding and host cell entry may be the most substantial barriers to efficient mammalian transmission. Mammalian adaptation is likely a multi-factorial process and may proceed along different pathways in different genetic backgrounds, but the early, independent generation of HA E190D and G225D and the strong diversifying selection on HA1 observed here are consistent with this hypothesis. Selective sweeps on attachment proteins have been observed in transmission of other viruses, including hepatitis C virus (Brown et al., 2012) and HIV (Edo-Matas et al., 2012) ; positive selection on the SARS coronavirus surface glycoprotein may facilitate transmission from palm civets to humans (Chinese SARS Molecular Epidemiology Consortium, 2004; Song et al., 2005; Zhang et al., 2006) . Diversification of receptor binding proteins followed by fixation of advantageous variants may be a common pathway by which viruses evolve transmissibility in new hosts.

Two polymerase mutations arose and became fixed during our study. PB2 A684D was first detectable immediately after transmission ( Figure 2B ), suggesting that it arose de novo in the contact animal. PA V253M, present in only 9% of viruses in the index animal on day 5, was at 73% in the contact immediately after transmission (Figure 2A) . We cannot conclusively determine whether PA V253M was transmitted as a minor variant or arose de novo afterward. What is clear is that these two polymerase mutations drastically changed in frequency during the first transmission event and became fixed for the rest of the study, even though previous functional analyses suggested that these substitutions reduce the processivity of the 1918-like avian polymerase (without PB2 E627K) in vitro (Watanabe et al., 2014) . In the presence of PB2 E627K, these mutations did not alter polymerase activity, suggesting that PB2 E627K was the primary deter-minant of improved viral replication. Viruses reached similar titer in vivo whether PB2 A684D and PA V253M were at low frequency (HA190D225D index animals) or nearly fixed (Mut index animals; Figure S1E ). These mutations could confer an advantage that we did not directly test (e.g., RNA stability, RNA folding, codon bias). Given our phenotypic data and the known potential for bottlenecks to alter diversity in populations without selection (Hamilton et al., 2012; Varble et al., 2014) , perhaps these mutations hitchhiked to high frequency during transmission. These data underscore that fixation of nonsynonymous variants after transmission is not in itself evidence that they are advantageous and agree with a recent study showing that tight bottlenecks during H7N9 virus transmission allowed deleterious variants to remain at high frequency (Zaraket et al., 2015) . Together, our data suggest that for an avian virus to cross species barriers, overcoming the stochastic fluctuation of mutations during transmission bottlenecks may be just as essential as generating a constellation of mammalian-adapting mutations. Fixation or maintenance of non-or maladaptive mutations during airborne transmission may be a previously unappreciated barrier to influenza crossspecies transmission.

Although HA S113N, I187T, and D265V are all transmitted, there is no single viral genotype that is shared among all three transmitting pairs. Therefore, in the presence of HA 190D and 225D, there are multiple available evolutionary pathways to mammalian transmission. For any virus lineage, evolving human transmissibility may not require convergence on one specific set of amino acid substitutions. We propose that, because within-host selection appears to maintain polymorphism at a few potentially adaptive sites in HA, the viral population is able to simultaneously explore multiple evolutionary pathways toward a transmissible phenotype. Transmission then selects for beneficial variants, allowing different variants to fix in different hosts.

Our study is limited to a small number of transmission events with one avian-like H1N1 virus lineage evolving in ferrets. Synthesizing our data and previous studies, we offer the following conceptual framework to explain our observations, acknowledging that expanded studies are necessary to confirm its broader application. We propose that the stringency of transmission bottlenecks and the main evolutionary forces driving them may change throughout the host adaptation process. We speculate that at earlier stages of host adaptation, there may not be one ''most fit'' virus that is able to outcompete the rest of the population after transmission to localized regions of the respiratory tract (Karlsson et al., 2015; Lakdawala et al., 2015; Matrosovich et al., 2004) . A non-mutually exclusive hypothesis is that a larger inoculum may be required to found infection in the absence of a single highly fit variant. These hypotheses could explain the surprising finding that the first transmission bottleneck was loose, even though relatively few ''avian-like'' viruses would be expected to be fit for transmission in mammals. Indeed, we speculate that viruses that are well adapted for transmission in a particular host species would again exhibit loose transmission bottlenecks, as most variants would be of similar transmission fitness; the recent observation of loose genetic bottlenecks in transmission of seasonal influenza viruses among human household contacts supports this hypothesis (Poon et al., 2016) .

Acquisition of advantageous alleles during the course of initial infection may generate a highly fit variant upon which selection can act during transmission. A tight bottleneck could result from numerous mechanisms, including a small founding population or the ability of a particularly fit variant to outcompete other transmitted virions very early after infection. Initial localized infection by one or a few variants in the contact animal (Karlsson et al., 2015) could also allow for the early dominance of a particular HA variant that then spreads through the upper respiratory tract. Airborne transmission involves numerous steps that impact the makeup of the viral population in the contact: to found infection, virions expelled by the source host must remain viable in a droplet, be inhaled in the contact, and then successfully replicate. Selection could act on any or all of these stages to influence the bottleneck we observe. Should these hypotheses be supported by future investigations, then defining within-host selection and transmission bottlenecks occurring in a spillover infection could be a way to assess the pandemic potential of emerging viruses: tight bottlenecks that include mammal-adapting variants would be expected to characterize viruses undergoing a transition to efficient transmissibility. It is also plausible that the size and stringency of influenza transmission bottlenecks vary widely due to chance alone, rather than progressive host adaptation. Multiple productive exposures, different routes of transmission, and/or differing infectious doses could have this effect without involving selection. We find this scenario less likely for our data given the signatures of selection in both contact animals in the second transmission event, but it too remains a possibility that merits further exploration.

No new transmission experiments were performed for this study. All samples from ferrets infected with 1918-like avian influenza viruses were generated prior to the gain-of-function research pause. This study used viral RNA isolated from nasal wash samples collected from index ferrets on days 1, 3, and 5 postinoculation and from contact ferrets on days 5, 7, and 9 post-contact as part of a previously described study (Watanabe et al., 2014) . See Supplemental Experimental Procedures for more details.

Viral RNA was extracted from nasal wash samples using the RNeasy mini kit and RNase-free DNase set (QIAGEN). RNA was reverse transcribed using the one-step SuperScript III one-step RT-PCR kit (Invitrogen) and amplified by segment-specific PCR (primers listed in Table S1 ) using Phusion high-fidelity DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs). PCR products were purified from a 1% agarose gel using the QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (QIAGEN) and eluted in water. Cleaned PCR product was quantified with the Qubit dsDNA HS Assay Kit (Invitrogen) and diluted in DEPC-treated water to a concentration of 0.2 ng/ ml, reverse transcribed, amplified, and prepared for sequencing using the Nextera XT Sample Preparation kit. Samples were processed on the Illumina MiSeq with a 500-cycle kit as an 8 pM library with 1% PhiX control.

Fastq files were imported into CLC Genomics Workbench Version 6 (CLC Bio) for analysis. Reads were trimmed using a quality score threshold of Q30 and a minimum length of 100 bases. All reads were mapped to a reference sequence comprised of the cDNA plasmid sequences from the original 1918-like avian stock virus. Variant calling was performed using a frequency threshold of 1% and required a minimum coverage of 100 reads and a central base quality score of Q30 or higher. The average sequence depth acquired for each gene in this dataset was 7,680 ± 6,074.

The p statistic for measuring nucleotide diversity was calculated using two different methods. The first, as displayed in the manuscript (Figures 3 and 5  and Tables 1 and S2) , calculated the synonymous (pS) and nonsynonymous (pN) nucleotide diversity using SNPGenie , which adapts Nei and Gojobori's (1986) method of estimating synonymous and nonsynonymous substitutions for next-generation sequencing data (Bailey et al., 2014; Nei and Gojobori, 1986; Wilker et al., 2013) . pN and pS were also independently estimated using PoPoolation version 1.2.2 for comparison (Kofler et al., 2011) , which is shown in Table S2 and Figures S5A-S5C . Statistical analyses were performed in Minitab or Prism 6.0b for Mac (GraphPad, www. graphpad.com).

Haplotypes were enumerated using the LinkGE software as previously described (Wilker et al., 2013) . We queried a total of 12 nucleotide positions (400, 507, 550, 634, 640, 644, 648, 653, 747, 748, 749, and 868) , which correspond to 9 amino acid positions (113, 145, 159, 187, 189, 190, 192, 225, and 265) . We used our haplotype data to calculate a measure of Shannon entropy as previously described (Rogers et al., 2015) . Entropy, H, for a given time, t, and a given segment, s, was calculated as:

Hðt; sÞ = À X n i = 1 f i ðt; sÞ log 2 ½f i ðt; sÞ;

where n is the total number of haplotypes for time t for segment s. f i is the frequency for haplotype i at time t. This analysis was performed only for HA in the transmitting pairs.

Tissue tropism and transmission ecology predict virulence of human RNA viruses,"Novel infectious diseases continue to emerge within human populations. Predictive studies have begun to identify pathogen traits associated with emergence. However, emerging pathogens vary widely in virulence, a key determinant of their ultimate risk to public health. Here, we use structured literature searches to review the virulence of each of the 214 known human-infective RNA virus species. We then use a machine learning framework to determine whether viral virulence can be predicted by ecological traits, including human-tohuman transmissibility, transmission routes, tissue tropisms, and host range. Using severity of clinical disease as a measurement of virulence, we identified potential risk factors using predictive classification tree and random forest ensemble models. The random forest approach predicted literature-assigned disease severity of test data with mean accuracy of 89.4% compared to a null accuracy of 74.2%. In addition to viral taxonomy, the ability to cause systemic infection was the strongest predictor of severe disease. Further notable predictors of severe disease included having neural and/or renal tropism, direct contact or respiratory transmission, and limited (0 < R 0 � 1) human-to-human transmissibility. We present a novel, to our knowledge, comparative perspective on the virulence of all currently known human RNA virus species. The risk factors identified may provide novel perspectives in understanding the evolution of virulence and elucidating molecular virulence mechanisms. These risk factors could also improve planning and preparedness in public health strategies as part of a predictive framework for novel human infections.","The emergence of novel infectious diseases continues to represent a threat to global public health. Emerging pathogens have been defined as those newly recognised infections of humans following zoonotic transmission or those increasing in incidence and/or geographic range [1] . High-profile examples of emerging pathogens include the discovery of the novel Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus from cases of respiratory illness in 2012 [2] and the expansion of the range of Zika virus across the South Pacific and the Americas [3] . The emergence of previously unseen viruses means that the set of known human viruses continually could not be assigned a disease severity rating and were excluded from all analyses (hepatitis delta virus, which is reliant on hepatitis B virus coinfection, and primate T-lymphotropic virus 3, which may be associated with chronic disease like other T-lymphotropic viruses but has not been known in humans long enough for cohort observations). Disease severity differed between viral taxonomic families (Fisher's exact, 1,000 simulations, p < 0.001), with Arenaviridae, Filoviridae, and Hantaviridae having the highest fractions of severe-rated virus species (Fig 1) . Although 55 of 172 viruses considered zoonotic were rated 'severe', we note that only 3 of 40 nonzoonotic viruses were rated as causing severe disease (hepacivirus C and human immunodeficiency virus [HIV] 1 and 2). Fatalities were reported in healthy adults for 64 viruses and in vulnerable individuals only for an additional 26 viruses, whilst eight viruses rated 'nonsevere' had severe strains, six of which belonged to the family Picornaviridae.

To find predictive risk factors for virulence, we first divided the 212 virus species into a single training (n = 181) and test set (n = 31) partition based on taxonomy and severity to minimise potential biases from trait imbalances between sets. Using this training set, we then constructed a single classification tree that aimed to optimally classify viruses in virulence based on their ecological traits. The final pruned classification tree included variables relating to transmissibility, tissue tropism, and taxonomy (Fig 2) . Severe disease was predicted by the model for four generalised groups: i) viruses with a neural or systemic primary tropism with limited human-to-human transmissibility (excluding orthomyxoviruses, phenuiviruses, and reoviruses); ii) viruses known to have a renal tropism (primary or otherwise); iii) hantaviruses; and iv) retroviruses with sustained human-to-human transmissibility.

Although the illustrated classification tree identified several risk factors, this represents one of many possible trees because tree structure is dependent on the exact sampling partition between training and test data. We therefore constructed a random forest model containing 5,000 individual trees, each built using a bootstrapped sample of the training data and a randomly restricted subset of predictors, and repeated this approach over 200 alternative training/ test set partitions. Averaging over these bootstrapped random forests, the most informative predictor variables for classifying virulence were taxonomic family and primary tissue tropism (Fig 3) . However, primary transmission route, human-to-human transmissibility level, and having a known neural or renal tropism were also relatively informative, broadly mirroring the risk factors observed in the single tree. Host range predictors were generally uninformative. To identify whether virulence risk factors might differ for non-human-adapted viruses, we repeated our machine learning analysis for only those viruses with known or suspected zoonotic transmission. For zoonotic viruses, the most informative predictors were similar (Fig 3) , though transmission route variables (primary transmission route, having known vector-borne transmission) appeared to increase in relative importance.

To quantify the effects of the most informative risk factors, averaged partial dependence was extracted from the random forests, describing the marginal predicted probabilities of severe virulence associated with each virus trait (Fig 4, S2 Table) . Averaging across other predictors, viruses having tissue tropisms within neural or renal systems or systemic across multiple organ systems presented the highest risk of severe virulence, whilst respiratory and gastrointestinal tropisms presented the lowest risk. An increased probability of severe virulence was also observed for viruses transmitted by direct contact or respiratory routes and those with known but limited human-to-human transmissibility. When restricted to zoonotic viruses, patterns of partial dependence were mostly similar to those observed for all human viruses (Fig 4) .

Although the single classification tree model predicted its training set well, it did not appear generalisable to novel data within its test set. The single tree correctly predicted virulence ratings from literature-based criteria for 24 of 31 viruses in its test set, giving a resulting accuracy of 77.4% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 58.9%-90.4%), no evident improvement on the null model assigning all viruses as nonsevere (null accuracy = 74.2%). The random forest approach gave better predictive performance, correctly predicting virulence with a mean accuracy of 89.4% across all training/test partitions (95% CI: 72.0%-97.0%), significantly greater than the null accuracy (one-tailed one-sample proportion test, p = 0.041). The random forest approach also achieved superior performance when considering sensitivity, specificity, true skill statistic, and the negative predictive value as a performance measure prioritising correct classification of 'severe'-rated viruses ( Table 1 ). The random forests also outperformed the classification tree in area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) ( Table 1 , Fig 5) .

Nineteen of 139 viruses featured in test set partitions were misclassified from averaged random forest predictions (S1 Table) : seven viruses rated as severe from literature protocols that were predicted to be nonsevere and 12 nonsevere viruses predicted to be severe. Misclassifications from the random forest occurred most frequently within the flaviviruses and orthohantaviruses (S1 Table) , though misclassifications did not appear to occur disproportionately between genera (Fisher's exact, 1,000 simulations, p = 0.930).

The observed predictor importance and risk factor directions were robust to constructing random forest models for subsets of viruses, removing those with low-certainty data or data Variable importance from random forest models. Importance of each variable in predicting virulence in random forest models applied to all known human RNA viruses and zoonotic viruses only, calculated as the average decrease in Gini impurity following a tree split based on that predictor and scaled against the most informative predictor within each random forest to give a relative measure. from serological evidence only (S1 and S2 Figs), and similar performance diagnostics were obtained (S3 Table) , though transmission route predictors appeared less informative when considering only viruses with at least 20 known cases. Redefining our virulence measure to integrate information on known fatalities and differences with subspecies or strains in an Partial dependence from random forest models in predicting severe virulence. Predicted probability of classifying virulence as 'severe' for each of the most informative risk factors in random forest models applied to all known human RNA viruses and zoonotic viruses only (primary tissue tropism, any known neural tropism, any known renal tropism, level of human-to-human transmissibility, primary transmission route, and any known vector-borne transmission). Predicted probabilities are marginal, i.e., averaging over any effects of other predictors. Boxes denote distribution of probabilities across 200 random forest models with alternative training/test partitions, with heavy lines denoting median probability. Dashed line denotes raw prevalence of 'severe' virulence rating among the respective training datasets. Colour key denotes predictor variable type as in Fig 3, ordinal ranking system (S4 Table) did not improve predictive performance (S5 Table) . Using alternative virulence measurements, the most informative variables and virus traits predicting severity showed good agreement with those of the main analysis (S3 and S4 Figs).

We present the first comparative analysis of virulence across all known human RNA virus species to our knowledge. We find that disease severity is nonrandomly distributed across virus families and that beyond taxonomy, severe disease is predicted by risk factors of tissue tropism and, to a lesser extent, transmission route and level of human-to-human transmissibility. In both classification tree and random forest models, viruses were more likely to be predicted to cause severe disease if they caused systemic infections, had neural or renal tropism, transmitted via direct contact or respiratory routes, or had limited capability to transmit between humans (0 < R 0 � 1). These risk factors were robust to alternative modelling methods, alternative definitions of virulence, and exclusions of poor-quality data.

Primary tissue tropism was the most informative nontaxonomic risk factor (Fig 3) and the first split criteria in the classification tree (Fig 2) , with specific neural tropism and generalised systemic tropism predicting severe disease (Fig 4) . Few studies have directly predicted how tissue tropism should influence virulence. The identified risk factor tropisms could be explainable as a simple function of pathology occurring in sensitive or multiple tissues, respectively, increasing intensity of clinical disease. However, it has been suggested that an excessive, nonadapted virulence may result if infections occur within nontarget tissues that do not contribute to transmission [30] , although the evolutionary determinants of tissue tropism are not wellunderstood [31] . Tissue tropism should be a key consideration for future comparative and evolutionary modelling efforts. We also found viruses primarily transmitted by direct contact and respiratory routes to have a higher predicted probability of severe virulence than viruses transmitted by vectorborne or faecal-oral routes. Contrastingly, previous comparative analyses pooling several microparasite types, including a limited range of viruses, have shown positive associations between virulence and vector-borne transmission [17] or environmental survivability [18] . Ewald [17] suggested virulence has fewer costs to pathogen fitness if transmission can occur independent of host health and mobility, e.g., through arthropod vectors or contaminated water, though we did not observe support for this hypothesis in our analysis.

The relationship between virulence and transmissibility appears more complex. Firstly, random forest models suggested a lower risk of severe virulence for viruses with sustained human-to-human transmissibility (level 4) than self-limited transmissibility (level 3) (Fig 4) . This appears consistent with hypothesised virulence-transmissibility tradeoffs [21, 32, 33] and suggests that the adaptation necessary to develop efficient human-to-human transmissibility could result in attenuation of virulence in RNA viruses. Sustained transmissibility appeared to positively predict severe disease for a specific subset of four viruses in the single classification tree (Fig 2) , all retroviruses causing chronic syndromes (HIV 1 and 2 and primate T-lymphotropic virus 1 and 2), which are likely subject to different evolutionary dynamics-if disease occurs after the infectious period, virulence brings fewer costs to pathogens from host mortality, essentially 'decoupling' from transmission [23] . We note only three nonchronic level 4 viruses rated severe: severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus, yellow fever virus, and Zaire ebolavirus.

Although cross-species infections incapable of onward transmission (sometimes termed 'dead-end' infections) can result in high virulence because without coevolution, viral phenotypes within the novel host will be nonadapted-i.e., a 'coincidental' by-product [23, 24] -we did not observe viruses incapable of human-to-human transmission (level 2) to be comparatively more virulent. This may suggest that if virulence is entirely unselected in dead-end infections, phenotypic levels of virulence could just as easily turn out to be 'coincidentally' low.

Taxonomic family being a highly informative predictor in the random forests implies that there is a broad phylogenetic signal to virulence, but it is also highly likely that the explanatory power represents a proxy for many other phylogenetically conserved viral traits that are challenging to implement in comparative analyses of this scale, such as variation at the proteomic, transcriptomic, or genomic level or further data beyond simple categorisations, e.g., specific arthropod vector species. Untangling these sources of variation from different scales of traits will be a critical next step in predictive modelling of viral virulence.

We acknowledge several limitations to the quality of our data, as with any broad comparative analysis. Risk factor data were problematic or missing for certain viruses, e.g., natural transmission route for viruses only known to infect humans by accidental occupational exposure and tissue tropism for viruses only known from serological evidence. However, the consistency of findings between alternative, stricter definitions of virulence and data subsets removing viruses with suspected data quality issues suggests scarcity of data does not bias our analyses.

Virulence also exhibits substantial variation at the subspecies level, i.e., between strains or variants. For example, severity of Lassa virus disease superficially varies with infection route and geography, though this appears to be driven by variation between genotypes [34] . Confirmatory analyses at a finer resolution would validate our identified risk factors, e.g., phylogenetic trait models of individual genera or species. Furthermore, clinical symptoms are also subject to traits of the host individual, e.g., immunocompetence, age, and microbiome [35, 36] . Our risk factor analysis brings a novel, to our knowledge, top-down perspective on virulence at the broadest level, though caution must be exerted in extrapolating the risk factors we find to dynamics of specific infections.

The value of predictive modelling as an inexpensive and rapid tool for risk assessments during early emergence is increasingly recognised [16] . Instances in which machine learning model predictions do not match outcomes could indicate likely candidates for outcome class changes, e.g., future reservoir hosts for zoonotic disease [37] , and we note severe virulence was predicted for 12 viruses rated 'nonsevere' from literature protocols (S1 Table) .

However, our models have restricted function in predicting the virulence of a newly identified virus, particularly if human infections are not yet recognised. Taxonomy may be easily accessible and applicable to give simple virulence estimates. However, the most informative nontaxonomic predictors, tissue tropism and transmission route, are not likely to be identified with confidence before clinical observations of virulence. One way to address this information gap would be use of available data from animal infections, assuming that tissue tropism and transmission route do not differ between human and nonhuman hosts. Alternatively, predictor data might be imputed from the nearest-related known virus, particularly for traits that appear highly phylogenetically conserved such as tissue tropism [31] .

A more powerful future approach lies in the potential predictability of tissue tropism based on cell receptors and, more challengingly, of cell receptors based on viral proteomics or sequence data [38] , an increasingly accessible information source during early emergence following advances in genomic sequencing methods [39] . The exact links between tissue tropism, cell receptors, and nucleotide sequences are currently a critical knowledge gap and a potentially informative focus for future predictive efforts. A further key area requiring development is the possibility of inferring virulence directly from aspects of sequence data, e.g., genome composition biases, which have recently demonstrated the potential to predict reservoir host taxa and arthropod vectors via machine learning [40] .

More widely, our analysis brings a novel, to our knowledge, focus that complements comparative models predicting other aspects of the emergence process such as zoonotic transmission [8, 9, 37, 41] , propagation within humans [10, 11] , or geographic hotspots [42, 43] . After continued calls for model-informed strategy, predictive studies are now beginning to shape surveillance and prevention with respect to emerging zoonoses [16, 44] , with virulence being been suggested as a factor to direct viral surveillance [45] , albeit in nonhuman hosts. The virulence risk factors we identify suggest that broadly targeting direct contact or respiratory transmission interfaces within ecological systems and/or tailoring detection assays towards certain virus families (e.g., Hantaviridae) or tissues (e.g., neural tissue) could contribute to a viable strategy to detect future virulent zoonoses.

This work adds to the comparative and predictive modelling efforts surrounding emerging infectious diseases. Here, we contribute a novel, to our knowledge, focus on ecological predictors of virulence of human RNA viruses, which can be combined in holistic frameworks with other models such as those predicting emergence dynamics. As a predictive model, the featured random forests offer valuable inference into the evolutionary determinants of virulence in newly emerging infections. We propose that future predictive studies and preparedness initiatives with respect to emerging diseases should carefully consider potential for human virulence.

For each of the 214 recognised human-infective RNA virus species, following standardised data compilation efforts and critical assessment protocols [5] , data on virulence and potential risk factors were collected via a systematic search and review of clinical and epidemiological literature. The following were consulted in turn: clinical virology textbooks [46] [47] [48] ; references from the data set described by [5] ; and literature searches using Google Scholar (search terms:

Searches 3 and 4 were carried out only when fatality or tropism data, respectively, were not already found from previous sources. Data collection and virus name search terms included the full species name, any synonyms or subspecies (excluding vaccine strains), and the standard virus abbreviation as given by ICTV Online Virus Taxonomy [49] .

Although many possible measurements of virulence have been proposed [50, 51] , even simple metrics like CFR have not been calculated for the majority of human RNA virus species. Therefore, virulence was rated using a simple two-category measure of severity of typical disease in humans. We rated viruses as 'severe' if they firstly had �5% CFR when data were available (159/214 viruses, including those with zero CFR); otherwise, we rated viruses as 'severe' if they had frequent reports of hospitalisation, were associated with significant morbidity from certain conditions (haemorrhagic fever, seizures/coma, cirrhosis, AIDS, hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, HTLV-associated myelopathy), or were explicitly described as 'severe' or 'causing severe disease' (S1 Table) . We rated viruses as 'nonsevere' if none of these conditions were met. We note that this led to 'nonsevere' ratings for some viruses with clinically severe but rare syndromes; e.g., dengue virus can cause haemorrhagic dengue fever, though this is much rarer than typical acute dengue fever [46, 47] . To address this, data were also collected on whether the virus has caused fatalities in vulnerable individuals (defined as age 16 and below or 60 and above, immunosuppressed, having comorbidities, or otherwise cited as being 'at-risk' by sources for specific viruses) and in healthy adults and whether any 'nonsevere' virus has atypically severe strains (e.g., most infections with viruses within the species Human enterovirus C cause mild disease; however, poliovirus, which causes severe paralytic disease, is also classified under this species). These were examined both individually and within a composite six-rank system (S4 Table) .

Data were compiled for four main risk factors: transmission route(s) and tissue tropism(s), sourced from literature search exercises as described, and extent of human-to-human transmissibility and host range, sourced directly from [5] . Although previous studies also predict virulence to vary with other traits, e.g., environmental survivability [18] , paucity of data or nestedness within taxonomic family prevented their inclusion in our analysis. Firstly, primary transmission route was categorised as the dominant route the virus is transmitted by: vectorborne (excluding mechanical transmission), direct contact, faecal-oral, or respiratory transmission. Primary tissue tropism was similarly categorised as the dominant organ system the virus typically infects or targets, specified as neural, gastrointestinal, hepatic, respiratory, circulatory, vascular, or 'systemic' (typical infection within multiple organ systems with no clear, single dominant tropism). However, many human viruses are known from isolation from blood or serum, with no further evidence of specific tissue tropisms (n = 69). Therefore, we also included an additional 'viraemia' category in the primary tissue tropism predictor to indicate only blood presence was known.

Secondly, binary variables were also constructed, denoting whether viruses had ever been observed to utilise a) multiple transmission routes/tissue tropisms and b) each individual transmission route and tropism, including additional categories that were never among the primary routes/tropisms (food-borne and vertical transmission; renal, cardiac, joint, reproductive, sensory, skin, muscular, and endocrine tropism). We accepted isolation of the virus, viral proteins or genetic material, or diagnostic symptoms of the virus (such as characteristic histological damage) as evidence of infection within an organ system but did not accept generalised symptoms such as inflammation.

Human-to-human transmissibility was specified using infectivity/transmissibility levels, based on previous conceptual models and a systematic compilation and review of evidence [4, 5, 12] . Level 2 denotes a virus capable of infecting humans but not transmitting between humans (R 0 = 0), level 3 denotes a virus with limited human-to-human transmissibility (0 < R 0 � 1), and level 4 denotes a virus with sustained human-to-human transmissibility (R 0 � 1). Host range was specified as either 'narrow' (infection known only within humans or humans plus nonhuman primates) or 'broad' (infection known in mammals or animals beyond primates) [5] . Binary variables were also sourced as to whether infection was known within a) humans only, b) nonhuman primates, c) other mammals, and d) birds.

To identify potential differences in risk factors between adapted and nonadapted viruses, we also categorised whether each virus was zoonotic. We considered a virus to be zoonotic if it had transmissibility level 2 or 3 or had transmissibility level 4 and was known to infect nonhuman hosts (excluding anthroponotic viruses, e.g., measles morbillivirus). We also conservatively considered viruses to be zoonotic if zoonotic potential was suspected but data-deficient, e.g., rotavirus A-C. All virulence and risk factor data pertained to natural or unintentional artificially acquired human infection only, and data from intentional human infection, animal infection, and in vitro infection were not considered. Viral taxonomy was included in analyses by specifying both genome type and taxonomic family as predictors. All virulence and risk factor data are available via figshare: 10.6084/m9.figshare.7406441.v3 (https://figshare.com/ articles/Data_and_supporting_R_script_for_Tissue_Tropism_and_Transmission_Ecology_ Predict_Virulence_of_Human_RNA_Viruses/7406441/3).

Firstly, the 212 retained virus species were split into a training set for model fitting and a test set for model evaluation. In order to avoid bias from an imbalance between types of viruses assigned to training and test sets, our selection was based on random sampling, stratified by genus-severity rating combinations. We sampled at a ratio of 75:25, i.e., for the four known severe viruses in the genus Ebolavirus, three were randomly assigned to the training set and the remaining one assigned to the test set. If a genus-severity combination contained less than four viruses, all defaulted to the test set. Comparative risk factor analyses were firstly carried out by constructing a classification tree using the R package 'rpart' v4.1-11 [52] . Classification trees are a simple form of machine learning models that aim to optimally classify data points into their correct category of outcome variable based on a structure of binary predictor splits. Tree-based methods are well-suited for comparative analyses in which confounding often results from taxonomic signal or suites of otherwise co-occurring traits because their high structure can intuitively fit complex nonlinear interactions and local effects.

A tree model was fitted to the training set to predict virulence ratings by 'recursive partitioning', the repeated splitting of the data set using every possible binary permutation of each predictor, and retaining the split that minimises the Gini impurity [53] , defined as 1 À P n i¼1 pðx i Þ 2 for outcome variable x with n possible ratings and p(x i ) denoting proportion of data with rating i, which is equal to zero for perfectly separated data. To prevent overfitting, the tree was pruned back to the optimal branching size, taken as the most common consensus size over 1,000 repeats of 10-fold cross-validation. To validate the predictive power of the classification tree, predictions of virulence rating were generated when applied to the test set. Tree accuracy was then calculated, comparing the proportion of correct predictions compared to literature-assigned ratings (assuming these to be 100% accurate as the 'gold standard' or 'ground truth'). Because virulence ratings were imbalanced (i.e., only a minority of viruses cause severe disease, so correct nonsevere classifications are likely to be achieved by chance), accuracy was directly compared to the null model, i.e., a model with no predictors that predicted 'nonsevere' for all viruses. Additional diagnostics of interest (sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value, and true skill statistic [54] ) were also obtained. Although classification trees have the advantage of presenting an interpretable schematic of risk factor effects and directions, individual tree structures may be sensitive to particular data points and have no intuitive measures of uncertainty. We therefore generated a further 200 partitions of our data into alternative training/test sets using the random stratified sampling procedure described. Then, for each partition, we constructed a random forest, an ensemble collection of a large number of bootstrapped classification trees [55] . Having many predictor variables compared to the relatively limited and fixed number of human-infective RNA virus species, random forests handle such 'large p, small n' data architecture much more easily than traditional regression frameworks [56] . Missing data in all predictors were imputed using the R package 'missForest' v1.4 [57] . Using the R package 'randomForest' v4.6-12 [57] , random forests were created containing 5,000 individual trees, each built using a bootstrapped sample of training data and restricted to a randomly selected subset of predictors (k = 5) at each branching split. The predictive power of the random forest approach was evaluated by averaging over the test set predictions from all partitions. Receiver operating characteristic curves were visualised and area under curves calculated to directly compare to the classification tree methodology.

Because of their high structuring, random forest models cannot give a simple parametric predictor effect size and direction (e.g., an odds ratio). Instead, potential virulence risk factors were evaluated using two metrics: variable importance and partial dependence. Variable importance is calculated as the mean decrease in Gini impurity following tree splits on the predictor and can be considered as how informative the risk factor was towards correctly predicting virulence. Partial dependence is calculated as the mean relative change in log-odds of predicting severe virulence, which were converted to predicted probabilities of severity associated with each risk factor. Partial dependence describes marginal effects averaging across any influence of other predictors, and, as such, point estimates may not reflect any complex risk factor interactions. Therefore, to test hypotheses regarding virulence risk factors, we present both averaged random forest partial dependence and the less robust but more accessible single classification tree for its ease of interpretation in risk factor structure and directly compare the statistical validity of both methods by plotting receiver operating characteristic curves.

"Contact Heterogeneity, Rather Than Transmission Efficiency, Limits the Emergence and Spread of Canine Influenza Virus","Host-range shifts in influenza virus are a major risk factor for pandemics. A key question in the study of emerging zoonoses is how the evolution of transmission efficiency interacts with heterogeneity in contact patterns in the new host species, as this interplay influences disease dynamics and prospects for control. Here we use a synergistic mixture of models and data to tease apart the evolutionary and demographic processes controlling a host-range shift in equine H3N8-derived canine influenza virus (CIV). CIV has experienced 15 years of continuous transfer among dogs in the United States, but maintains a patchy distribution, characterized by sporadic short-lived outbreaks coupled with endemic hotspots in large animal shelters. We show that CIV has a high reproductive potential in these facilities (mean R 0 = 3.9) and that these hotspots act as refugia from the sparsely connected majority of the dog population. Intriguingly, CIV has evolved a transmission efficiency that closely matches the minimum required to persist in these refugia, leaving it poised on the extinction/invasion threshold of the host contact network. Corresponding phylogenetic analyses show strong geographic clustering in three US regions, and that the effective reproductive number of the virus (R e ) in the general dog population is close to 1.0. Our results highlight the critical role of host contact structure in CIV dynamics, and show how host contact networks could shape the evolution of pathogen transmission efficiency. Importantly, efficient control measures could eradicate the virus, in turn minimizing the risk of future sustained transmission among companion dogs that could represent a potential new axis to the humananimal interface for influenza.","Respiratory pathogens that emerge as the result of host-range shifts can cause serious epidemics in humans, livestock, and wild animals [1] [2] [3] [4] . Two recent pandemics in humans -Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003 and H1N1 influenza in 2009 -involved host-range shifts in respiratory zoonotic viruses [5, 6] , while the recently documented Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) has similarly emerged from an animal reservoir to pose a growing risk to the human population [7] . Importantly, however, cross-species transmission events do not always lead to pandemics. Rather, zoonoses emerging in new host species tend to have patchy and dynamic prevalence patterns in space and time. As a result, the probability that an emerging zoonosis will take hold in a new host population has been difficult to assess a priori, which limits our capacity to use targeted interventions to avert pandemics before they happen [8] .

A variety of host-pathogen interactions may follow a species jump, and revealing their determinants is essential to understanding the process of zoonotic emergence. First, the emerging pathogen may be poorly adapted for replication and onward transmission in the new host population. This leads to inefficient transmission, where many potentially infectious contacts between susceptible and infected individuals fail to spread the disease, due for example to a low pathogen load in the infected individual. In this case, the disease will have a lower basic reproductive number (R 0 -the number of secondary infections caused by a typical infected individual in an entirely susceptible population) in the recipient host than its recent ancestor in the donor host. Inefficient transmission following a spillover event may lead to ''stuttering chains'' of infection marked by patchy patterns of disease prevalence interspersed with stochastic fadeouts. Even if a pathogen has R 0 above 1 (a necessary but not sufficient condition for self-sustaining spread), values of R 0 that are only marginally above 1 are associated with a higher probability of stochastic extinction. The probability that a pathogen will establish itself (in a large homogeneously mixed population of susceptible hosts) following the introduction of n infected individuals is given by 12(1/R 0 ) n [9] .

The heterogeneity in prevalence of emerging pathogens may also reflect the demographic variability inherent to host populations. In smaller host populations random variation in the timing and frequency of births, deaths, immigration, emigration, and contacts between infected and non-infected individuals, as well as in the timing of individual infections, can have profound effects on epidemic dynamics [10] [11] [12] . Emerging pathogens that result from spillover into new hosts are by definition initially confined to a small population, in the sense that the first infected individual(s) will have limited numbers of potential contacts to whom they can spread the disease. This, in turn, makes the epidemic dynamics of emerging pathogens inherently stochastic [13, 14] .

Finally, evolutionary change in emerging pathogens can affect both their basic reproductive number, and their response to demographic variability. Pathogen evolution can result in R 0 increasing toward or above 1.0 after repeated spillover events from the reservoir population, or during a chain of transmission in the new host, either of which could result in the emergence and selection of host-adaptive mutations. The occurrence of multiple outbreaks over time may also increase the likelihood that the pathogen evolves toward a point when it can be self-sustaining in the new host [12] . Recent analytical frameworks that unite the ecological and evolutionary dynamics of host-pathogen interactions can help identify the processes that drive epidemiological and phylogenetic patterns during and after host-range shifts [11, 12, 15] .

Here we study the population dynamics and evolution of equine-H3N8 derived canine influenza virus (CIV) in the US, and use the results to propose control strategies. CIV emerged following the transfer of a single H3N8 equine influenza (EIV) to dogs from horses around 1999. Direct descendants of that virus have been circulating continuously in dogs since that time [16] [17] [18] . CIV was first recognized as the cause of disease in greyhounds in a training facility in Florida in 2004 and was transferred to various states in the US with the racing greyhounds, eventually spreading to other breeds [16] . The hemagglutinin (HA) sequence of CIV was genetically distinct from EIV by 2004, forming a separate monophyletic group from EIV in phylogenetic trees [16] . Notably, there is no evidence of CIV transfer back to horses, onward to humans, nor of reassortment involving CIV and other influenza viruses [19] . Furthermore, although some other H3N8 EIV spillovers from horses into dogs have been reported, these only comprised single infections or small outbreaks that rapidly faded out [20] .

Although CIV can readily transmit among dogs its prevalence remains patchy: it is enzootic in some regions of the US, but has thus far failed to establish outside of these enzootic regions [21] [22] [23] [24] . The overall seroprevalence of CIV in the companion (pet) dog population appears to be low (,3% or less depending on the region), with visits to canine daycare a risk factor [22, 24] . CIV enzootic regions are typically associated with large animal shelters [25] , and the movement of the virus to different parts of the US is most likely associated with the transport of infected shelter dogs to facilities in other regions where they may be more readily adopted [26] .

In contrast to CIV, its recent ancestor, H3N8 EIV, has been circulating widely in horses since before 1963 when it was first reported in Florida, having most likely been introduced with horses from South America [27] . The virus appears to spread continuously within and between many parts of North and South America, Europe, and Asia [28] [29] [30] [31] . EIV has been introduced into countries that were previously free of the virus, including Australia and South Africa, causing significant outbreaks that extended over large distances, although these were controlled and the virus eradicated [28, 32] . Data from an outbreak in an unvaccinated population of racehorses places R 0 for EIV at 10.18 (95% confidence interval: 9.57-10.89) in that context. In contrast, the reproductive number of EIV in vaccinated populations of racehorses has been estimated to be between 1.4 and 2.3 [33] . EIV has experienced marked evolution in all gene segments since it emerged, with evidence of antigenic variation in the HA gene, including phylogeographic patterns in HA variation, with distinct clades in Europe versus the US, and among US states [28, 34, 35] .

Although CIV and EIV are closely related, their epidemiology and evolutionary dynamics differ, with EIV seemingly more successful, and less heterogeneously distributed. Moreover, EIV continues to spread despite active control measures (particularly vaccination) whereas CIV retains a patchy distribution in the absence of significant control measures. An analysis of the phylogenetic history and ecology of CIV since its recent emergence from EIV may therefore reveal how host demography, disease dynamics, and pathogen evolution can combine to determine the prevalence patterns and risk posed by emerging zoonotic pathogens.

Here we combine individual-level data on the intake, output, and transfer rates of dogs among US animal shelters of different sizes, with CIV gene sequence data and available seroprevalence estimates, to identify the processes controlling disease dynamics in emerging zoonoses at the human-animal interface. We hypothesize that CIV persists through the presence of transmission

Influenza virus infects a range of vertebrate hosts, including domesticated animals as well as humans. Some of the most serious influenza pandemics in humans have involved host range shifts, when an influenza virus jumps from one host species to another. Importantly, however, host range shifts do not always cause pandemics. Rather, epidemiological patterns tend to be unpredictable in new host species, causing disease patterns that change over space and time. In this paper, we analyze epidemiological and evolutionary dynamics of canine influenza virus (CIV), which jumped to dogs in the late 1990s from an equine strain (EIV) prevalent in horses. We show that the epidemiology and evolution of CIV is strongly influenced by heterogeneous patterns of infectious contact among dogs in the US. A few large populations in metropolitan animal shelters serve as reservoirs for CIV, but the virus cannot be maintained for long in smaller facilities or in the companion dog population without input from the larger shelters, which represent disease hotspots. These hotspot dynamics give a clear picture of what can happen in the time between the beginning of a host range shift and the onset of a possible pandemic, allowing more targeted strategies for control and eradication.

hotspots, which rescue chains of transmission that fade out in other populations. The putative hotspots are large animal shelters in major metropolitan areas. After estimating R 0 from all available data we ask: are the population sizes of small shelters small enough to make fadeout significantly more likely than in large shelters? And do large shelters have good prospects of maintaining CIV in an enzootic state?

We then use the parameters from our analyses to determine what control measures would result in eradication of the virus. CIV is a prime target for eradication because it has both the potential to cause significant disease burden, and it is currently confined to a small subset of its host population. Effectively controlling CIV would improve conditions in metropolitan animal shelters, as well as minimizing the risk of zoonotic human infection posed by CIV, before it has the opportunity to evolve higher transmissibility in the companion dog population. A possible future scenario of sustained CIV transmission amongst companion animals would represent the evolution of a potentially significant new axis to the human-animal interface for influenza.

To put the CIV sampled from animal shelters in a wider geographical context, and to reveal movement of the virus on a continental scale, we determined the HA1, M and NP gene sequences of recent CIV isolates, and conducted a phylogenetic analysis of these sequences combined with homologous sequences available on GenBank as well as the Influenza Research Database. Viruses or sequences were sampled from the US states of Colorado, New York, Pennsylvania, Florida, California, Kentucky, Wyoming, Philadelphia, South Carolina, Virginia, Vermont, Connecticut, Texas, and Iowa.

The most striking result of this analysis is that CIV exhibits a marked geographical clustering by US state with distinct clades being observed in New York (and nearby states), in Pennsylvania, and in Colorado, which also represent our largest sampling sets ( Figure 1 ). This geographical clustering was confirmed in Association Index (AI) and Parsimony Score (PS) phylogeny-trait association statistics [36] , with significantly more clustering by US state of origin than expected by chance alone across the data set as a whole (p,0.001). Similarly, the Maximum Clade (MC) statistic reveals significant (p,0.001) clustering in the individual states of Colorado, New York, Pennsylvania, Vermont and Wyoming. In addition, many of the viruses from the northeastern states of Vermont, Connecticut, New Hampshire clustered with the viruses that are circulating continuously in New York (also in the northeast), suggesting that those viruses were derived from the New York enzootic hotspots.

Next, we investigated the demographic and epidemiological dynamics of CIV at the local scale in animal shelters. Here we used individual-level records of dog arrival and departure from 13 animal shelters of varying size across the US, comprising a total of 124,519 dogs, as well as published seroprevalence estimates from a large shelter [25] , coupled with a stochastic epidemic model. The epidemic model was an SIR-type model incorporating empirical rates of arrival and departure from the shelter as well as CIV infection and removal dynamics, and implemented at the level of individual dogs using the Gillespie algorithm [37] .

The majority of animal shelters in the US house relatively small populations of dogs-the median dog population size in our sample of shelters is 43-but a few shelters are much larger, housing hundreds of dogs. In precise terms, the distribution of dog population sizes in our data is close to a negative binomial distribution with mean 71.23 and standard deviation 82.24 (Figure 2A) , which indicates significant overdispersion in population sizes relative to a homogeneous Poisson model. This overdispersion in host population size is a potentially important characteristic for the epidemiology of CIV because it indicates the presence of a few extraordinarily large shelters where a pathogen might persist more easily than in a host population of average size. Large well-connected populations are more favorable environments for emerging pathogens because variance in vital rates (e.g. the rate of arrival of new susceptible individuals) decreases predictably with population size. All else being equal, this makes large host populations more stable for sustained pathogen transmission.

Shelters with larger populations are fueled primarily by higher intake rates ( Figure 2B ), as the median residence time of dogs does not vary significantly among shelters of different sizes ( Figure 2C ). The residence time of dogs in a shelter is roughly exponentially distributed with a mean of 9.88 days and a standard deviation of 8.22 days ( Figure 2D ). Transfer rates among shelters appear relatively low-among the eight shelters in our demographic data for which there was transfer information the median proportion of dogs whose stay at a shelter ended with a transfer is 0.067 and the mean is 0.1. Transfer probability is not correlated with dog population size in our data (data not shown).

Most dogs arriving to shelters are susceptible to CIV [22, 25] . The arrival rate of susceptible dogs places an upper limit on CIV prevalence by continual dilution with uninfected individuals, which leads to a saturating relationship for prevalence as a function of R 0 ( Figure 3A ). We estimated a posterior distribution for R 0 given seroprevalence data and demographic data by using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method based on a stochastic SIR model parameterized with the demographic data (see Methods). Point estimates of seroprevalence are normallydistributed about the long-term equilibrium value given by the mean-field model in our simulations ( Figure 3B ), and a seroprevalence estimate of 0.42 [25] from a large shelter where CIV is enzootic, combined with the demographic data on dog intake and outcome rates, yield a mean estimate for R 0 of 3.9 for CIV in large animal shelters. The posterior distribution of R 0 has a median of 3.3, and a highest probability density (HPD -the central 95% of the posterior distribution) interval extending from 2.0 to 8.9 ( Figure 3C ).

Moving from estimating the reproductive potential (R 0 ) of CIV in animal shelters to estimating the effective spread rate in the general population from genetic data, we employed phylodynamic birth-death models to analyze HA1 sequence data collected across the US to determine the rate of spread of the virus in the wider dog population. Our estimates for the effective reproductive number (R e ; the average number of secondary infections produced by a typical infected individual at a given time, in a population where not all potential hosts are necessarily susceptible) show considerable temporal variation ( Figure 3D ,E). At the time when CIV was first recognized in 2004 the posterior distribution of R e roughly matches that of R 0 , consistent with the initial, exponential phase of the epidemic. During the period 2004-2008 R e drops to a value of approximately 1.0. A similar pattern was observed in the New York data set. Across the USA as a whole the mean estimate of R e is currently 1.02 (95% HPD = 0.79,1.26), with a similar number found in New York (R e = 1.06, 95% HPD = 0.72, 1.47) ( Figure 3 ). The low R e observed toward the present suggests that CIV spread has now reached an equilibrium, where stochastic fadeouts often associated with outbreaks are balanced with new infections, which usually occur in the large animal shelters where it is enzootic.

Using the shelter demography data and the stochastic epidemic model, we simulated CIV outbreaks in shelters of a realistic distribution of sizes, intake rates and output rates, and for varying levels of R 0 . From these simulations we estimated the probability that a shelter (of a given population size, N) infected with a CIV virus (of a given R 0 ) could maintain the virus for 100 days. The response surface for this experiment yielded a cut-off curve in the N-R 0 plane, below which fadeout was almost certain and above which persistence was almost certain ( Figure 4A , shaded surface).

Interestingly, the posterior distribution for R 0 (estimated by MCMC as described above), and the empirical distribution of shelter population sizes from the demographic data, suggest that CIV straddles the border between persistence and stochastic fadeout. That is, the demographic and seroprevalence data indicate that CIV cannot persist in the majority of shelters, because the median of the posterior distribution of R 0 is below the cutoff for persistence in a shelter of median size. But CIV can persist in existing shelters that are larger than the median size, because the posterior distribution for R 0 , combined with the distribution of shelter sizes from the demographic data, has significant density at R 0 -N combinations that would allow persistence ( Figure 4A , points). This suggests that CIV persists on the brink of extinction-its current transmission efficiency is only sufficient to persist in large, high-throughput populations, but not yet to invade more widely.

More generally, for CIV in animal shelters the stochastic epidemic simulations parameterized with demographic data reveal that the impact of demographic stochasticity is considerable; the majority of shelters are too small to maintain the virus in the long term at its present rate of transmission. Thus variation in contact rates among host subpopulations, rather than inherent limitations on the evolved transmission efficiency of the pathogen, is sufficient to explain observed heterogeneity in prevalence in CIV, since the virus has been shown to transmit efficiently in large shelters and under laboratory settings [23] .

We then used the parameterized epidemic model and demographic data to simulate the impact of control strategies for CIV. The purpose of this analysis is to test how the observed hotspot dynamics are predicted to interact with potential eradication strategies, and to estimate, given available demographic and epidemiological data, the degree of control efficacy required to eliminate CIV from animal shelters where it is persisting, allowing for the complete eradication the virus from the canine population. Figure 4B shows the effect of a generic control measure applied to a single shelter, that reduces the inflow of susceptible dogs to a proportion 1/,R 0 . = 0.26 of current levels, where ,R 0 . = 3.9 is the mean of the posterior distribution for R 0 , as above. This generic control measure has the effect of reducing the effective reproductive number in a single shelter to unity. Consistent with theory [38] this is a reduction in the susceptible portion sufficient to eradicate the disease from a large isolated shelter.

We then simulated a control program across multiple shelters connected by the transfer of dogs. The simulated control measure applied to the metapopulation is represented in the model as a vaccination program, but the results apply to any control that achieves the same reduction in the force of infection. A possible strategy (but to our knowledge untested; see below) that might be used is a live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) that is able to generate an interfering response (possibly through generation of interferon) which prevents infection by wildtype CIV.

We find that such a control program could eradicate CIV within 1-2 months if it is applied to dogs immediately upon arrival to the shelter, and removes them from the chain of transmission within 24 hours with 85% probability ( Figure 5A) . A control strategy that has an efficacy of 75% might also efficiently eradicate CIV from isolated shelters, but transfers of dogs between shelters at the observed mean rate will allow CIV to persist through connected chains of outbreaks ( Figure 5B ). Control strategies with efficacies of 65% or less would reduce the prevalence of the infection, but are not predicted to lead to CIV eradication in every case ( Figure 5C ). In addition, without appealing to models it is clear from the demographic data that turnover rates in most shelters are too high for an inactivated vaccine to be effective, because those vaccines take more than a week to generate protective immunity. Since the expected residence time of a dog in an animal shelter is around 10 days, most dogs would have been part of the chain of transmission by the time an inactivated vaccine given at intake took effect, and then they would leave the shelter.

We therefore suggest one possible approach for control is the development of an LAIV administered at intake of dogs into shelters, which may provide suppression of the wild type virus infection by direct competition for the target tissues, as well as through stimulation of innate immune responses. This potential approach requires further research. In addition we note that the LAIV performance required to eradicate CIV is higher than what has been typically observed in other live influenza vaccines, and there is still much uncertainty about the rate at which protection would be acquired during the time that dogs spend in shelters (typically 1-2 weeks) [39] . However, other control measures (e.g. quarantine, decrease in population size, changes in population structure, or anti-viral drugs) or combinations that removed dogs from the chain of transmission with similar efficiency would also have qualitatively equivalent effects in a control strategy.

The key result is that a net control efficacy of ,85% is required for eradication of CIV from its reservoir in a network larger animal shelters, even though a net efficacy of ,75% would probably be sufficient for eradication from a single shelter. Thus another interesting feature of the control simulations in a metapopulation framework is the sensitivity to migration parameters ( Figure 5 ). In particular, we show that there are efficacious control strategies that would cause the virus to go locally extinct but that would fail to achieve global eradication. These include scenarios where the expected global prevalence approaches 0, but where the virus would persists through connected chains of stochastic outbreaks ( Figure 5B ).

We also used our epidemic model to explore the passage of CIV from an infection in one large shelter to other shelters through the transfer of dogs ( Figure 6A ). The hotspot dynamics predicted by our model show regularities in the way CIV spreads outward from a single shelter. Large shelters are predicted to receive the infection earlier, as well as maintaining it for longer, creating a wave in the population size-time-of infection plane ( Figure 6B ). The probability that a single infection introduced to a susceptible shelter would start an epidemic that persisted for at least 100 days increases with population size ( Figure 6C ). For the median population size of 43 dogs the probability was approximately 0.5.

Since its emergence more than a decade ago, equine H3N8derived CIV has maintained a patchy distribution, occurring most often in sporadic and short-lived outbreaks in US animal shelters [21] . In contrast, strains of CIV's recent ancestor (EIV H3N8) have been commonly found in horses around much of the world since at least 1963. EIV thus transmits efficiently among horses, sometimes despite vaccination programs [33, 40] . Our study investigates heterogeneity in CIV transmission and prevalence to better understand the processes that determine how zoonotic pathogens spread following a host range shift, and how these processes affect the performance of control and eradication strategies.

Stuttering chains of infection in recently emerged zoonoses are caused by two distinct mechanisms that may operate in tandem. The first is poor adaptation of the pathogen to its new host species, causing lower within-host replication rates that may reduce pathogen shedding and lead to inefficient transmission [11] . Transmission is inefficient because many potentially infectious contacts between infected and susceptible individuals fail to spread the infection. The second mechanism that generates stuttering chains is variation in contact rates among different subsets of the new host population, which can increase the probability of stochastic fadeouts [13] . In this case the fadeouts are not caused by inefficient transmission but by exhausting the local supply of susceptible hosts.

Strikingly, host contact heterogeneity has received less attention as a potential driver of stuttering chains despite its fundamental role in disease dynamics. We found that contact heterogeneity plays a critical role in the patchy distribution of CIV. Demographic data indicate that most shelters are too small, and import susceptible individuals too slowly, to protect CIV from local stochastic extinction at its current reproductive rate. At the same time, the influence of contact heterogeneity on the spread of CIV would diminish if transmissibility were higher and the epidemiology of CIV (and similar zoonoses) generally represents an interaction between contact heterogeneity and transmission efficiency.

More evidence of contact heterogeneity appears at the intershelter scale. Observed transfer rates suggest that the majority of intakes and outputs are not associated with other shelters, so that shelter-to-shelter transfer has not created an effectively larger metapopulation of multiple shelters. While there are many millions of susceptible household dogs in the USA (around 80 million, about 25% the size of the human population), it is likely that they do not exhibit infectious contact patterns sufficient to maintain the virus in continuous transmission (see below). Hence, this work shows that apparent stuttering chains of transmission are not always driven by poor adaptation of an emerging pathogen to its new host. Rather, in the case of CIV, demographic variability in contact rates is alone sufficient to explain the fadeout in the disease in most situations.

The basic reproductive number for CIV is intriguingly close to the minimum value required to persist in a shelter of average size ( Figure 4A ). This suggests that transmission efficiency in CIV may have evolved to precisely the point of persistence. Yet, this average shelter size belies the high variance in shelter populations, with many small facilities balanced by a few extraordinarily large ones (roughly matching the distribution pattern of US city sizes; Figure 2A ). The process by which CIV currently persists is therefore to thrive in a few large populations with high rates of infected-susceptible contact (as mediated by a high arrival rate of new susceptibles, rather than by increase density), but failing to take hold in the general population ( Figure 4A ). By analogy with conservation biology, large populations thus function as refugia for the virus, protecting it from extinction and also limiting its distribution. These are also exactly the conditions to facilitate further evolution toward higher reproductive capacities, by facilitating repeated outbreaks outside the refugia, followed by selection for higher transmissibility [10, 12, 41] .

Our mean estimate of R 0 = 3.9 in the large animal shelters is lower than that estimated for EIV during outbreaks [42] , but close to the upper bound for estimates of human influenza transmission [43, 44] . It is also considerably higher than that of pandemic H1N1 influenza in humans in 2009 (R 0 = 1.4-1.6) which spread worldwide within weeks of its first recognition in humans [45] . Variation in R 0 among different viral strains and host species can be difficult to interpret because of the many factors that can affect transmission and removal rates in different settings. However, these comparisons do indicate that CIV has the biological capacity to spread relatively efficiently among dogs given the right conditions in the host population.

Although most of the parameters in the epidemic model were estimated from a large volume of host demographic data from animal shelters, there are currently few estimates of seroprevalence in shelters where CIV is endemic and as a result our estimate for equilibrium seroprevalence relies on data from a single shelter [25] . This introduces a risk of sampling bias because that individual shelter could exhibit individual characteristics that affect its equilibrium seroprevalence, and/or due to non-random temporal fluctuations in seroprevalence. While the scarcity of seroprevalence estimates adds uncertainty to R 0 estimates, the extant data would be difficult to explain with values of R 0 lower than our estimates. This is due to the rapid rate at which infected individuals are replaced by new arriving susceptibles in the high throughput shelters where CIV is enzootic. The low residence time of dogs in large, high-throughput shelters thus indicates (consistent with previous results [25] ) that individuals in shelters where CIV is enzootic must acquire the infection within a few days of arriving. This places a lower bound on probable values for R 0 by constraining estimates of the generation time of the infection, at least in the context of large shelters [44] . In other facilities that are smaller or where CIV is not enzootic, long-term average seroprevalence over time may be lower [26] due to stochastic fadeouts of the disease.

Phylogenetic analyses independently supports several key predictions of our analysis. First, these analyses confirm that CIV remains confined to endemic hotspots, with transfers to other regions causing outbreaks that are generally short-lived (and thus failing to establish new lineages outside of endemic locations). Moreover, the strong phylogeographic structure, with distinct viral clusters in New York, Pennsylvania and Colorado for each gene analyzed, is exactly what might be expected given our empiricallyparameterized epidemic model, which predicts geographic segregation. Each US state has only a few large cities that would have an animal shelter capable of supporting CIV in the long term, and with relatively infrequent transfers among cities.

Second, the mean and HPD interval for R e from the phylogenetic analysis in 2004 (when CIV was first detected and when infected greyhounds were being transported to many US states for racing) roughly matches the distribution of R 0 from the stochastic SIR model and demographic data. The initial phase of an epidemic is usually associated with exponential growth (corresponding to R e = R 0 ), and R e must always be less than or equal to R 0 by definition. This makes the phylogenetic estimate of R e in 2004 a conservative independent assessment of R 0 .

The third concurrence between the demographic and phylogenetic analysis involves the current estimate of R e , = 1. While R 0 The data for this figure were produced by simulating the metapopulation stochastic SIR model with 100 shelters for 100 days, starting with a single infection in the largest shelter. Population sizes were sampled with replacement from the shelter data. R 0 = 3.9. Transfer probability is set to the mean observed value of t = 0.1. (B) Large shelters tend to receive the infection earlier (and more often) following an outbreak at another shelter. (C) Probability that CIV will persist for 100 days in a shelter of a given size following the introduction of a single infected individual to an otherwise susceptible population. The plateau on the curve arises for populations sufficiently large that early depletion of susceptibles is not an important factor in the probability of an outbreak: rather than population size, this probability is determined by R 0 . doi:10.1371/journal.ppat.1004455.g006 in our analysis measures the reproductive potential of the disease where it is enzootic, the phylodynamic estimates of R e reflects the net spread rate of CIV across the US as a whole, including multiple shelters and the companion dog population. As such, R e , = 1 indicates that on balance CIV is currently failing to persist where it is not already enzootic, which is consistent with both epidemiological observations [21] and the predictions of the demographic analysis which showed that most shelters are too small to support CIV in an endemic state (see Figure 4) .

Targeted strategies for control and eradication depend on understanding the conditions under which an emerging enzootic pathogen can maintain itself in a new host population. Our simulations indicate that eradication may be possible, but will require relatively efficient control, and that success may depend on the rates at which dogs are transferred between animal shelters. For control measures with ,75% efficiency, CIV may be eradicated from most shelters but still persist overall through connected chains of outbreaks, with large shelters serving as focal points for staging new infections elsewhere. This suggests that control programs for CIV will be most successful if implemented across multiple shelters and that participating shelters should maintain control measures even after the virus has been eliminated locally.

Uncertainties in our analysis would be reduced by more information on CIV prevalence and additional CIV sequence data. A key area of uncertainty is transmission rates between companion dogs within and among households whose contact patterns would differ significantly from those of dogs in animal shelters. Working from first principles, if a proportion p of contacts between infectious and susceptible dogs result in the infection being transmitted, then the probability that an infected individual in the companion population will first transmit the infection on their kth contact with a susceptible dog is p(1-p) k21 , which gives an expected value for k of 1/p. Studies of CIV transmission in comingling trials estimate p = 0.75 [23] . This suggests that for a CIV lineage to avoid extinction in companion dogs, the average infected dog must contact k = 1.33 susceptible individuals during the time they are infected. Another approach that yields the same result is to recognize that if a proportion p of contacts produce secondary infections, then R 0 .1 requires k.1/p, again translating to approximately two contacts per week. It is evident from common experience that while some companion dogs are highly sociable, others do not frequently interact with other dogs. Therefore, some companion dogs probably achieve the minimum contact rate required to sustain CIV, but others probably do not. Many dogs with higher contact rates than this minimum would be necessary for CIV to actively spread among companion dogs, and to protect the virus from stochastic extinction in the general dog population, at its current transmission efficiency.

Conversely, if CIV had emerged with much higher transmissibility upon entry to the greyhound population, stuttering chains of transmission would not have been observed. Thus, the capacity for contact heterogeneity to control epidemic spread is facilitated by lower transmissibility. Furthermore, while endemic hotspots created by contact heterogeneity can theoretically increase the chances of evolving higher transmission efficiency, it is evident that not all cross-species transmission events will involve small stepwise gains in transmissibility in the new host. Indeed, a variety of adaptive models, involving differing numbers and fitness of mutations, can be put forward to explain the process of emergence [46] .

Despite these caveats, and limitations in the available data, our analyses provide a coherent view of the ecological and evolutionary dynamics of CIV. After approximately 15 years of continuous circulation among dogs in the US, CIV can be maintained only in relatively dense host populations with high inputs of susceptible individuals (essentially viral ''chemostats''), despite a relatively high reproductive potential in that context. These hotspots are weakly connected by migration, leading to geographic signatures in the CIV phylogenies. Most dog populations are too small or diffuse to independently support CIV at its current level of transmissibility, explaining its current modest reproductive rate (R e , = 1), and consistent with the epidemiology of CIV, which is characterized primarily by sporadic short-lived outbreaks outside of enzootic centers [21] . The demographic gradient between high-throughput populations where CIV is enzootic, and smaller or more diffuse populations where sporadic outbreaks can occur, creates hotspot dynamics that can facilitate pathogen evolution toward higher transmissibility [12, 41] . Our results therefore demonstrate one way that urbanization can increase the risk posed by emerging infectious pathogens [2, 47] . Although humans exposed to CIV appear not to be commonly infected (as shown by serological testing), the true risk of future human infection by either EIV or CIV is unknown as we do not understand the host barriers that restrict human infection, or the genotypic changes in the viruses that might overcome those barriers [19] . Our analysis can therefor inform a strategy for preemptive eradication of an influenza A virus that is well adapted to mammals, since if CIV did gain high transmissibility among companion dogs then much of the human population would be directly exposed to the virus.

Our analysis is based on an SIR framework that models changes over time in the number of dogs in a shelter who are susceptible (S), infected (I), or removed (recovered and thus immune; R). In what follows, we describe the model for a single shelter: below we expand the model to incorporate the dynamics of an control program that reduces the force of infection, and to consider control in multiple shelters linked through the transfer of dogs.

We assume dogs arrive at a shelter of a given size at a rate of m dogs per day. Dogs leave at a per-capita rate of d per dog per day, regardless of their state, so the mean residence time in a shelter is 1/d days. The number of dogs in a shelter, N = S+I+R, is equal to m/d at equilibrium. Arrival and departure rates are estimated empirically using individual-level records from 13 animal shelters of varying size across the US (see Supporting Information, Data S1). The records comprise a total of 124,519 dogs, recording the date each individual arrived and left the shelter. In 8 of the 13 shelters, the data included whether or not the departure of the dog represented a transfer to another shelter. Arrival rate, m, for a shelter was estimated as the median number of dogs arriving in that shelter per day. Departure rate, d, for a shelter was estimated as the inverse of the median length of stay of dogs in that shelter. When estimating arrival and departure rates we excluded dogs that were admitted to the shelter in response to a euthanasia request, as these dogs had systematically shorter residence times. We also excluded dogs whose length of stay was greater than 40 days, as these represented rare atypical cases (see Figure 2C ,D).

We assume that dogs in a shelter have a constant rate of contact per day with other dogs where the contact would be capable of spreading infection if one of the dogs were infected. An alternate hypothesis is that contact rate increases with population size, potentially leading to hotspot dynamics in large shelters in the absence of demographic stochasticity. Our assumption of constant contact rates is thus conservative with respect to the hypothesis that demographic structure drives hotspot dynamics in CIV.

Assuming that contact between any pair of dogs in the shelter is equally likely, the force of infection is given by l = bP, where b is the contact rate and P = I/N is the current prevalence of CIV in the shelter [48] . The rate of new infections is given by lS, and susceptible dogs contract the disease an average of 1/l days after entering the shelter. In this framework, the basic reproductive number of the disease is R 0 = b/(c+d), and the disease only persists in the long run if R 0 .1, in which case equilibrium prevalence is given by

which is bounded above by d/(c+d) as R 0 becomes large (see Supporting Information, Text S1, Section 1.6).

The infected class in our model represents the number of dogs with non-zero viral loads, rather than those exhibiting clinical symptoms. Thus, we avoid including latent or asymptomatic classes in our model. We set c = 1/7 because viral shedding continues for approximately seven days after inoculation [16] . Seroconversion for dogs infected with CIV also happens at approximately 7 days [16] . Equilibrium seroprevalence is then given by R/N (see Supporting Information, Text S1, Section 1.7).

Variation among individuals in time of infection, recovery, arrival, and departure causes variations in disease prevalence around the predicted long-term average. These excursions from mean prevalence carry with them the risk of visiting zero prevalence, leading to stochastic extinction of the disease. This demographic stochasticity becomes increasingly pronounced in smaller populations. However, the critical population size below which disease dynamics begin to significantly diverge from the long-term average through stochastic fadeouts depends upon R 0 , and upon the turnover rate in the population. We parameterize the stochastic SIR model with the demographic data to test the impact of demographic stochasticity on the spread and maintenance of CIV in animal shelters. We implement the model in continuous time at the level of individual dogs using the Gillespie algorithm [37] .

We estimated a posterior distribution for R 0 given seroprevalence data and demographic data by using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method, as follows. From the stochastic SIR model we simulated seroprevalence samples by observing the seropositivity of n randomly selected dogs from the population at a given time. Seroprevalence thus observed has the property of being normally-distributed about the long-term equilibrium value given by the mean-field model in our simulations ( Figure 3B ). We then seek the posterior distribution of an unknown equilibrium seroprevalence at an actual shelter, given a real point seroprevalence estimate there. We estimate this distribution by sampling from the Gaussian distribution of deviations between point seroprevalence estimates and equilibrium seropreovalence, using the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm [49] . We assessed convergence by visually examining within-and among-chain mixing. Convergence was determined to have occurred when the longterm variance in sampler state among chains was the same as the variance within chains. Convergence under this definition was easily achieved using 10 chains run for 10 5 steps each, with a burnin of 10%, and keeping every 100 th step. From the posterior distribution of equilibrium seroprevalence, we then map to a posterior distribution for R 0 by inverting Equation 1.

We represent control strategies by a vaccination program that reduces the force of infection (as described below), but the results apply to any control measure that provides a similar reduction in risk of infection and in infectiousness. In what follows we discuss control in the context of a LAIV administered to dogs upon arrival at the shelter.

The model with vaccination dynamics includes two more compartments, counting the number of dogs in each shelter who are vaccinated (V), and the number of dogs who are infected despite vaccination (W). Vaccination reduces a dog's susceptibility to infection by decreasing the probability that a virus population initially transferred through infectious contact will enter a phase of exponential growth, prerequisite to significant viral shedding and clinical symptoms [50] .

By reducing viral load and viral shedding, vaccination reduces the risk of infection in vaccinated dogs and reduces the infectiousness of a dog who becomes infected despite vaccination. Vaccinated dogs thus experience a reduced force of infection el, 0#e#1, and, if they become infected, contribute to the force of infection at a reduced rate 0#v#1, leading to an overall force of infection of l = b(I+vW)/N in population which has W vaccinated individuals who have nonetheless become infected.

Dogs transition from S to V at a rate of a per dog per day. Because a live vaccine is assumed to be administered to dogs immediately upon arrival, 1/a measures the average time after entry/vaccination that a dog experiences the vaccine-associated decrease in risk of infection from other dogs, and decreased infectiousness if they do become infected. Vaccination changes mean dynamics by reducing R 0 by a factor of 1-K, where K is effective vaccination coverage. K is given by (1-k)V/N, where k = ev expresses the failure rate of the vaccine, ranging from 0 for perfect vaccine, to 1 for an entirely ineffective one (see Supplementary material, section 1.4). We use a step function for k as a function of a, where k goes from 1 to its post-vaccine value at 1/a days.

We also model the effects of a generic control strategy equivalent to inoculating some dogs with a perfect vaccine, or to quarantine that partially or completely stops the flow of susceptible dogs into the shelter. We do this by replacing susceptible dogs with removed ones in the intake stream. Reducing the proportion of susceptible dogs in the intake stream to 0,h,1, while 1-h are already removed, has the same effect as reducing R 0 to hR 0 .

The metapopulation model expands the stochastic SIR model for a single shelter to describe multiple shelters whose dynamics are linked by the transfer of dogs. As above, the model is implemented at the level individual dogs using the Gillespie algorithm. Thus at each point in continuous time, each individual in the model has a disease state (S,I,R,V, or W) and a location in a given shelter. The metapopulation is composed of shelters that vary in dog population size, intake rate and output rate by sampling with replacement from the demographic data. Transfer probabilities are also based on the demographic data (see Supporting Information, Text S1, Section 2). Although the CIV phylogenies show geographic localization (see Figure 1 ), the metapopulation model is spatially implicit, consistent with level of detail in the demographic data we used. However, even without including spatial structure in transfer patterns, the metapopulation model reproduces hotspot dynamics, based on transfer hierarchies driven by differences in shelter size (see Figure 6 ).

We compiled all available CIV HA1, NP and M gene segment sequences from GenBank and the Influenza Research Database (www.fludb.org) and by sequencing samples provided by the Animal Health Diagnostic Center (AHDC) at Cornell University. For the sequencing of the virus samples obtained from AHDC we extracted viral RNA using Qiagen viral RNA mini kit and synthesized cDNA using Avian Myeloblastosis Virus (AMV) reverse transcriptase and influenza universal primer Uni12. Three gene segments, HA1, NP and M, were then amplified by PCR with gene specific primers (primer sequences are available upon request) for all samples. The PCR products were purified using EZNA Cycle-Pure Kit and sequenced by the Sanger method. All sequences derived here have been submitted to GenBank and assigned accession numbers KM359803-KM359864.

All sequences were aligned by MUSCLE v3.8.31 [51] using default parameters, followed by manual adjustment. Phylogenetic trees of each gene were then estimated using the maximum likelihood (ML) available in PhyML 3.0 [52] and assuming the general time-reversible reversible (GTR) model of nucleotide substitution and a gamma distribution of among-site rate variation with 4 rate categories (i.e. the GTR+I+C 4 model of nucleotide substitution) with SPR branch-swapping. The robustness of the phylogeny was estimated using 1,000 bootstrap replicates. Because of their greater availability, the analyses of evolutionary dynamics and phylogeography were only performed on the HA1 gene (see below).

To estimate R from the CIV sequence data we used a total of 94 HA1 sequences (alignment length = 1032 nt) sampled from various locations (states) in the US (Colorado, New York, Pennsylvania, Florida, California, Kentucky, Wyoming, Philadelphia, South Carolina, Virginia, Vermont, Connecticut, Texas, and Iowa) between 2003 and 2013. This data set included 40 sequences sampled from dog shelters in New York between 2005 and 2012, which were analyzed separately using the same protocols.

First, we estimated the mean (and credible intervals) of R in both data sets using the epidemiological birth-death method [53] available in BEAST v1.7.5 [54] . This analysis used the simpler Hasegawa-Kishino-Yano (HKY) model of nucleotide substitution and a gamma distribution of among-site rate variation (HKY+C 4 ). To account for temporal rate variation in the data an uncorrelated lognormal relaxed molecular clock model was employed. Using the Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) framework available in BEAST, 100 million steps were run, sampling every 10,000 and removing 10% as a burn-in. Second, temporal changes in R were estimated using the more complex serial-sampled birthdeath (SSBD) model [15] , available in BEAST v2.0 [55] , again using the HKY+C 4 but this time (to ensure statistical convergence) employing a strict molecular clock with a uniform distributed clock rate of 2610 23 (1610 23 -3610 23 ) nucleotide substitutions per site, as this was found to be best-fit to the data in epidemiological birth-death method. The MCMC was again run for 100 million steps, sampling in the same way as described above. Two independent runs allowed different R e values to be inferred from up to R e = 25.

To determine whether CIV was more clustered on the phylogenetic tree by US state of sampling than expected by chance alone, we employed the Association Index (AI), Parsimony Score (PS) and Maximum Clade size (MC) phylogeny-trait association statistics incorporated within the Bayesian Tipassociation Significance testing (BaTS) program [36] . Traits were defined as the US state of sampling. Phylogenetic uncertainty in the data was incorporated by basing estimates on the posterior distribution of trees obtained from the BEAST analysis (epidemiological birth-death method) described above. In all cases, 1000 random permutations of sampling locations were undertaken to create a null distribution for each statistic.

Seasonality and prevalence of respiratory pathogens detected by multiplex PCR at a tertiary care medical center,"Respiratory tract infections (RTIs) are a leading cause of mortality and morbidity. Seasonality has been reported for many viruses, including influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and the recently described human metapneumovirus (hMPV). We hypothesize that the availability of rapid, multiplex PCR diagnostics will provide better clinical care and new insights into the etiology and clinical spectrum of RTIs. We conducted a retrospective analysis of the incidence of respiratory pathogens at a 500-bed adult and 154-bed pediatric hospital tertiary care center. A total of 939 specimens from patients with an age range of 5 days to 91 years (median, 2 years) were tested by a multiplex respiratory pathogen PCR from November 14, 2011 to November 13, 2012. Sixty-five percent of specimens were positive for at least one pathogen. As the age of the patient increased, the positivity rate for the PCR decreased proportionately. Rhinoviruses/ enteroviruses (Rhino/Entero) were the most prevalent (34.3 %) followed by RSV (19.2 %) and hMPV (6.2 %). Twelve percent of the positive samples were positive for multiple analytes, with Rhino/Entero and RSV being the most common combination. The peak months were September and May for Rhino/Entero infections, January for RSV and February for coronavirus. hMPV peaked 2 months after RSV, as has been observed recently in other studies. Multiplex PCR provides rapid diagnostic information that can be used to make knowledgeable clinical decisions and potentially reduce the use of antibiotics. Active respiratory PCR surveillance could also predict seasonal respiratory epidemics to allow for adequate planning of additional infection control measures.","Acute respiratory tract illnesses are the most common illness in all age groups and are an important cause of hospitalization and mortality, especially in the winter months. For children less than 5 years of age, respiratory tract infections are the second leading cause of death [23] . Major causes of bronchiolitis and lower respiratory tract illnesses in children include respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza viruses, influenza virus, and human metapneumovirus (hMPV).

Understanding seasonal variations in these infections may allow optimal planning and utilization of resources in emergency departments, hospitals and clinics. Past epidemiologic studies used routine diagnostic methods such as culture for the detection of viral and bacterial respiratory pathogens [7, 38] . However, viral culture requires 3 to 5 days to detect most agents and detects rhinovirus or coronaviruses poorly or not at all. Multiplex reverse transcriptase PCR has been shown to be more sensitive than standard respiratory virus culture, bacterial culture, and antigen detection methods [5, 8, 18, 27] . Moreover, PCR is much faster. For the recently characterized hMPV, RT-PCR-based techniques are generally the method of choice for detection [35] . No antigen detection methods are commercially available for hMPV.

Expanded multiplex PCR panels now allow the detection of up to 14 different viruses along with influenza A subtyping and the detection of three common bacterial respiratory pathogens, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae and Bordetella pertussis in one hour [30, 31] . The high sensitivity and the expanded capability of these tests, therefore, may affect our understanding of the epidemiology of respiratory tract infections. This study explores the seasonality and prevalence of respiratory viral pathogens at a tertiary care medical center using the multiplex PCR respiratory pathogen panel.

Testing took place from November 14, 2011 to November 13, 2012 on nasopharyngeal specimens (NPS) originally sent to Georgia Health Sciences University (GHSU; its name was recently changed to Georgia Regents University) clinical microbiology laboratory (Augusta, GA) from the 500-bed adult and 154-bed pediatric hospital at GHSU for respiratory pathogen PCR assay by the FilmArray Respiratory Panel (RP) (BioFire Diagnostics, Inc., Salt Lake City, UT). NPS specimens were obtained from patients with symptoms of a respiratory infection, collected from the patients using standard technique, and placed in viral transport medium (Remel MicroTest M4RT Viral Transport tube). Specimens were tested as soon as possible after collection. The project was approved by the institutional review board of our institution; informed consent for the project was waived. Demographic data, such as initial symptoms, chief complaint, age, gender, and secondary diagnosis were obtained for each specimen tested.

The FilmArray assay was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. In brief, 1 mL of purified water included in the kit was injected into the FilmArray pouch to rehydrate the reagents. Then, 300 ll of the viral transport medium that had contained the NPS specimen was mixed with 500 ll of sample buffer and injected into the sample port of the pouch. The pouch was then placed into the FilmArray instrument, and a respiratory PCR panel program was started. The first stage of the program consists of a multiplexed PCR, followed by an individual nested second-stage real-time PCR contained within a microarray chip. The FilmArray RP includes two internal controls: an RNA process control and controls for every step inside the pouch. Results are analyzed using melting curve data.

The organism/viruses detected by the FilmArray included adenovirus, influenza A virus (FluA), influenza B virus (FluB), parainfluenza virus 1 (Para 1), parainfluenza virus 2 (Para 2), parainfluenza virus 3 (Para 3), parainfluenza virus 4 (Para 4), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), coronavirus 229E (CoronaV 229E), CoronaV NL63, CoronaV HKU1, CoronaV OC43, human metapneumovirus (hMPV), Bordetella pertussis, Chlamydophila pneumoniae and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. Due to genetic similarity between the human rhinoviruses and enteroviruses, a positive result with PCR primers to these viruses was listed as Rhino/ Entero. Rhinovirus A, B and C and enterovirus A, B and C are detected in the assay. Both RSV subtypes A and B are detected in the assay, though not specifically assayed.

The FluA viruses could also be subtyped as FluA/H1, FluA/H3 or FluA-2009 if present.

A two-sample Student's t-test between proportions was performed to determine whether there was a significant difference between the viruses with respect to the percentage of initial clinical symptoms in both single virus infections and mixed infections [6] . Statistical analysis was performed using the software package StatPac for Windows (Pepin, WI).

Specimens from a total of 939 patients were analyzed by PCR. The age range of the patients was 5 days to 91 years of age (median, 2 years). The male:female ratio was 1.42. Rhino-and enteroviruses were the most prevalent (34.3 %), followed by RSV (19.2 %) and hMPV (6.2 %) ( Table 1) .

The data were divided according to age groups. The largest age group in our study was children B 2 years of age, followed by the age group 3-21 years of age ( Table 1) . The older age groups, 22-49, and C 50 years were small compared to the first two groups, with 24 and 52 patients in each group, respectively.

The highest rate of PCR positivity was observed in children B 2 years of age, with a rate of 71.6 % (Table 1) , followed by 62.5 % for the second-youngest age group, ages 3-21. The positivity rates for the 22-49 and C 50 age groups were much lower, at 33.3 % and 21.2 %, respectively.

The prevalence of specific viruses and bacteria also differed between age groups (Table 1) . Most viruses and bacteria showed the highest prevalence in children B 2, with the exception of Flu A, for which the highest number of infections was in the 3-21 age group (Table 1) . Rhino/ Entero viruses were the most prevalent viruses in all age groups except in the 22-49 age group, where there were equal numbers of Rhino/Entero cases and Para 3 cases, although there were only three cases in each group. No positive results were detected for B. pertussis during the study period.

All hMPV cases were detected in the B 2 and 3-21 age groups, except for two cases. One case was in a 50-year-old female day-care worker admitted for asthma exacerbation, and the second was a 58-year-old female with an underlying hematologic malignancy.

All RSV cases were also detected in the B 2 and 3-21 age group, except for two cases. One case of RSV was detected in a 33-year-male who also tested positive for Rhino/Entero, and a second case was detected in a 59-yearold male. The patient that tested positive for both Rhino/ Entero and RSV was the only patient above the age of 18 who tested positive for more than one virus.

The major initial clinical symptoms/diagnoses of the patients included respiratory distress, asthma/wheezing, pneumonia, fever or bronchiolitis. The percentages of the major initial symptoms/diagnoses for the more prevalent PCR results are presented in Fig. 1 .

When compared to RSV, patients with hMPV showed significantly less respiratory distress (10.9 %, p\0.05) as a presenting symptom, but more fever (28.2 %, p\0.05). There were no significant differences in the percentages of initial presentations with pneumonia, asthma/wheezing or bronchiolitis between RSV and hMPV.

When single RSV or hMPV infections were compared to single rhino/enterovirus infections, there was a significantly higher percentage that presented with pneumonia (18.4 %, p\0.001 or 21.7 %, p\0.05, respectively) or bronchiolitis (9.5 %, p\0.001; 6.3 %, p\0.05). Mixed coinfections with Rhino/Entero and RSV or hMPV showed a significant lower percentage that presented with pneumonia (3.0 %, p\0.05), but not with bronchiolitis (6.5 %).

There was a significant increase in the number of patients that presented with respiratory distress with a mixed coronavirus and RSV or hMPV co-infection (61.5 %, p\0.01). There were only 13 cases for comparison, however. There were only two co-infections with both RSV and hMPV, one as part of a quadruple infection with two coronaviruses and one RSV and hMPV co-infection. The patient with the quadruple infection was admitted to pediatric intensive care with severe respiratory distress. The coinfection RSV and hMPV was an outpatient case seen for asthma exacerbation. All three cases of M. pneumoniae involved co-infections ( Table 2) . Two of the cases were co-infected with Rhino/ Entero, and the third was a triple infection with adenovirus and Rhino/Entero. With all three cases, the initial symptom was asthma/wheezing. One of the two C. pneumoniae cases was a co-infection with Rhino/Entero with an initial symptom of respiratory distress. The pure infection with C. pneumoniae had an initial diagnosis of pneumonia.

Analysis of multi-analyte-positive samples Sixty-five percent (65 %) of all specimens were positive for at least one viral or bacterial organism. Of the 610 positive specimens, 12 % (73/610) were positive for more than one analyte ( Table 2 ). The majority (72/73) of multianalyte-positive samples were from patients B 18 years of age. The most common viruses detected in multi-analytepositive specimens were Rhino/Entero and RSV, which comprised 88 % of all multi-analyte-positive samples (64/ 73). Individually, Rhino/Entero and RSV were detected in all multi-analyte-positive samples, 75 % and 53 % of the time, respectively (Fig. 2 ). There were four triple-positive samples and two quadruple-positive samples ( Table 2) .

Additional viruses found in multi-analyte positive samples included hMPV, Para 3 and CoronaV (HKU1, NL63, OC43). The majority of the hMPV multi-analytepositive samples were in conjunction with Rhino/Entero. There were only two samples in which hMPV was detected together with CoronaV (HKU1) or CoronaV (HKU1, NL63) and RSV. Also, the majority of the Para 3 multianalyte-positive samples were also positive for Rhino/Entero. There were only two Para 3 positives that were positive for RSV.

Seasonal prevalence of respiratory pathogens from November 14, 2011 to November 13, 2012 The prevalence of Rhino/Entero remained relatively high throughout the year, with several incidence peaks, the highest occurring in August/September, with two minor peaks in May and December (Fig. 3) . A distinct peak in RSV cases occurred in January, followed by a peak in total coronavirus cases in February, and a peak in hMPV cases in March. A distinct peak for Para 3 cases was observed in May.

The eight cases of Para 1 and seven cases of Para 2 all occurred in the fall, in September-November (data not shown). The one case of Para 4 was detected in November. The eleven cases of adenovirus occurred both in the spring and the fall months. Four cases of FluA type H1-2009 were detected February-April 2012. Two cases of FluA type H3 were detected March 2012, and eight cases were detected November 2012. One case of Flu B was detected February The number in parentheses is the total number of cases in the group 2012. No seasonal variation was noted for the eleven adenovirus cases. All three M. pneumoniae cases occurred in September, and the two C. pneumoniae cases occurred in January and November.

In our study, 939 specimens were analyzed over the course of a year using a respiratory pathogen multiplex PCR that yielded a positivity rate of 65 % with multiple analytes detected in 12 % of specimens, especially in children. As the age of the patient increased, the positivity rate for the PCR decreased proportionately. Other multiplex respiratory PCR studies have reported lower positivity rates for adults [9, 11] . Studies have shown that older adult patients shed lower titers of viruses, which demands the use of a highly sensitive methodology such as RT-PCR over conventional culture or DFA [36] . It is possible that the multiplex PCR assays now available may still not be sensitive enough to detect the lower titers of virus shed by older adult patients. It is also possible that adult patients may have other bacterial infections causing the respiratory infections that are not detected by the PCR, such as Legionella or Streptococcus pneumoniae. We noted a seasonal variation of the number of viral infections. Rhino/Entero was the most prevalent viral infection, with demonstrated peaks in the number of cases in May and September. The September peak appears to correspond to the start of school sessions. RSV was the second most prevalent virus, with a very large number of cases in January, followed two months later by an increased number of cases of hMPV.

Rhino/Entero was the predominant virus for all age groups and was superseded only by RSV from December to March. Brittain-Long et al. similarly observed that rhinovirus was the most common finding in the respiratory tract in their study, at 38.0 %, and was the predominant virus regardless of season [11] . Although the rhinoviruses are the most perennial of all the seasonal viruses, peaks of rhinovirus illness are well documented in September, after school starts, and again in the spring [24, 28, 39] .

RSV and hMPV were the second-and third-most common causes of respiratory infections in our study. The majority of the RSV and hMPV infections in our study occurred in children. Recently, in a study of over 3,000 children less than 5 years of age, the burden of hMPV was determined to be 6 % in hospitalized children and 7 % of children in both outpatient clinics and emergency departments [14] . We also detected a similar positivity rate of 6.2 %.

RSV and hMPV PCR-positive cases were statistically much more likely than Rhino/Entero PCR-positive infections to initially present with pneumonia or bronchiolitis in our study. Huguenin et al. similarly showed that RSV was associated with more-severe disease in infants hospitalized for bronchiolitis [16] . RSV and hMPV are also known to cause severe respiratory infections in the elderly [17] . Some of these infections did occur in adults C 50 in our study [13, 25] . Epidemiologic peaks for hMPV occurring 1 to 2 months later than that observed for RSV epidemics have been described in a number of studies [3, 4, 15, 20, 34] . Our study certainly supports this seasonality.

The parainfluenza viruses tend to have different patterns of seasonal variation based on type. Para 3, which can be predominant in spring in temperate climates, increased in the month of May [22] . Both Para 1 and Para 2 cases in our study were seen only in the fall months in our study, the typical season for these viruses [24] . The epidemiology of Para 4 is largely unknown. The number of coronavirus cases peaked in February in our study, indicating a winter seasonality. There is some evidence, however, that the seasonality of the coronaviruses may be dependent on geographic location [32] .

There was an unusually low prevalence of influenza A virus (1.7 %) for the 2011-2012 season in our study. In a review of the 2011-2012 winter influenza season in the northern hemisphere by the WHO, the influenza season started unusually late in most of North America, the latest in nearly 30 years in the U.S. [1] . The season was remarkably mild in the U.S., where influenza A (H3N2) was the predominant virus circulating. Transmission remained low until the end of the year.

No B. pertussis cases were detected in our hospital setting. The state of Georgia has one of the lowest incidences of reported B. pertussis in the entire U.S., with an incidence of 2.7 per 100,000 [12] .

Multiple respiratory pathogens were detected in 12 % of the respiratory specimens in our study; 75 % of the time, the second analyte was Rhino/Entero. Recently, Rand et al. [28] detected 15.9 % co-infections in a study of 200 patients by multiplex respiratory PCR. Other studies have reported slightly lower rates of multiple-analyte-positive specimens of around 10 % and 8.7 % [9, 21] .

The significance of these multi-analyte-positive specimens is not clear, especially in conjunction with Rhino/ Entero. It is likely that many of the dual-positive results with RSV and Rhino/Entero samples are due to viral shedding from a previous Rhino/Entero infection [10] . Rhinovirus is often found at a higher frequency than any other respiratory virus in asymptomatic carriers [26] . There was a significant increase in the number of patients who presented with respiratory distress (61.5 %) with a mixed coronavirus and RSV or hMPV co-infection. It is possible that these may have represented true co-infections with coronavirus rather than viral shedding. However, the significance of this observation is limited by having only 13 patients in this group.

Some studies that have concluded that more-severe disease occurs in infants with bronchiolitis with co-infections with RSV and hMPV, of which we detected only two cases, one as part of a quadruple infection and one mixed infection with RSV and hMPV [29, 33] . The quadruple infection was a severe respiratory case requiring intensive care.

A possible limitation of the study is that the subjects are biased toward the younger age groups, with only a modest representation of adults. However, the population reflects current physicians' choice of using PCR for the diagnosis of respiratory symptoms. Young children may seek healthcare earlier in the course of disease, and the reasons for testing in young children may be different in adults compared to children and young adults.

Multiplex respiratory PCR has been used in some cases to reduce nosocomial infections during specific seasonal respiratory epidemics. For example, some investigators have advocated performing multiplex respiratory PCR on all symptomatic infants during the RSV season, recommending that the RSV-positive patients be cohorted and placed on gown and glove precautions, noting a reduction in nosocomial infection in newborn nurseries after putting such practices into place [19, 37] . Ideally, active respiratory PCR surveillance could help predict seasonal respiratory epidemics so that additional infection control measures can be instituted.

A distinct advantage of the rapidity of diagnosis with the multiplex PCR is the ability to quickly and specifically treat the respiratory pathogen and facilitate therapy. Some of the pathogens detected in the multiplex PCR have specific therapies [2] . The multiplex respiratory PCR detects three bacterial pathogens that can all be treated with specific antibiotics, including C. pneumoniae, M. pneumoniae, and B. pertussis. Adamantanes and neuraminidase inhibitors are available for the influenza viruses. Intravenous polyclonal immune globulin enriched against RSV and palivzumab, a monoclonal antibody against the RSV fusion glycoprotein, have been recommended for high-risk infants. Ribavirin has been also been approved for use with RSV and has had some apparent success in cases of infection with hMPV, adenovirus and parainfluenza viruses. Most conventional immunoglobulin preparations seem to contain sufficient amounts of neutralizing titers against hMPV.

In conclusion, molecular testing methods have significantly expanded our ability to diagnose respiratory infections because of their rapidity, sensitivity, and potential for the simultaneous detection of 15 or more respiratory pathogens. The use of a rapid and accurate diagnostic test enhances clinical decision making and safely promotes implementation of cost-effective treatment strategies, including limiting the unnecessary use of antibiotics.

Evolutionary and Transmission Dynamics of Reassortant H5N1 Influenza Virus in Indonesia,"H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses have seriously affected the Asian poultry industry since their recurrence in 2003. The viruses pose a threat of emergence of a global pandemic influenza through point mutation or reassortment leading to a strain that can effectively transmit among humans. In this study, we present phylogenetic evidences for the interlineage reassortment among H5N1 HPAI viruses isolated from humans, cats, and birds in Indonesia, and identify the potential genetic parents of the reassorted genome segments. Parsimony analyses of viral phylogeography suggest that the reassortant viruses may have originated from greater Jakarta and surroundings, and subsequently spread to other regions in the West Java province. In addition, Bayesian methods were used to elucidate the genetic diversity dynamics of the reassortant strain and one of its genetic parents, which revealed a more rapid initial growth of genetic diversity in the reassortant viruses relative to their genetic parent. These results demonstrate that interlineage exchange of genetic information may play a pivotal role in determining viral genetic diversity in a focal population. Moreover, our study also revealed significantly stronger diversifying selection on the M1 and PB2 genes in the lineages preceding and subsequent to the emergence of the reassortant viruses, respectively. We discuss how the corresponding mutations might drive the adaptation and onward transmission of the newly formed reassortant viruses.","The H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus was originally isolated from a farmed goose in Guangdong province of China in 1996 [1] , and soon spread to live-poultry markets in Hong Kong [2] , resulting in 18 cases of human infection in 1997, 6 of which were fatal [3, 4] . The first wave of H5N1 infection ceased after the depopulation of all poultry in Hong Kong, although the H5N1 virus was later found to circulate continuously in Southern China without causing apparent disease symptoms among infected poultry [5] . H5N1 outbreaks recurred in 2003, persistently affecting poultry farms in many Southeast Asia countries, such as China, Thailand, Vietnam, Indonesia and Cambodia. The viruses also spread outside Asia, including to some European countries. More importantly, occasional zoonotic transmissions to humans occurred in most of the affected Asian countries and the virus continued to pose a serious threat to global public health [6] .

H5N1 outbreaks in Indonesia were initially detected in poultry farms in December 2003 [7] . It was suggested that the H5N1 virus was first introduced to Java and subsequently spread to other parts of the country [8] . The virus rapidly became endemic in Indonesia [9, 10] , and continued to cause sporadic zoonotic transmissions to humans beginning in July 2005 [9] . Three clusters of H5N1 transmission among family members were identified in 2005, raising concerns of possible human-to-human transmission of the virus [11, 12] . As of April 8, 2008 , Indonesia had 132 confirmed human cases with 107 deaths [13] , the largest number of deaths among all affected countries.

Previous studies have shown that several H5N1 genotypes have emerged in Asia through reassortment between H5N1 viruses and other subtypes [14, 15] . One of these genotypes, Z, predominated the H5N1 outbreaks throughout 2003-2007, causing most H5N1 outbreaks in Asian countries, including Indonesia [16] . Moreover, a variety of antigenically distinct sublineages of Z genotype virus have been established [16] . Unlike Vietnam and Thailand, Indonesia was invaded by only a single sublineage of genotype Z virus. Previous phylogenetic analyses suggested that Hunan province of China may be the source of the initial H5N1 outbreak in Indonesia [17] , and classified the Indonesian H5N1 HPAI viruses into three groups [10] ; however, further statistical analysis is necessary to characterize and compare different aspects of their evolutionary histories. In this study, we examined molecular phylogeny of the most recent Indonesian H5N1 viruses isolated from avian and mammal hosts. A group of putative reassortant viruses was discovered and their genetic parents were identified. In addition, we investigated the evolutionary behaviors (including spatial migration, growth of genetic diversity, and evolutionary drift and selection) of the reassortant viruses and compare with those of the parental strain, thereby providing insights into the nature and impact of this emerging reassortant strain.

Phylogenetic trees of Indonesian H5N1 viruses were reconstructed from 12 separate gene datasets (Table S6) , using a maximum likelihood (ML) approach with bootstrapping analyses to assess clade robustness (Figures 1, S1-S3; computer files of dendrogram are available as Dataset S1). In all the phylogenies, viruses sampled from avian species during earlier years of outbreaks (predominantly 2003-2004) tended to cluster near the root as expected, but with a poorly resolved branching structure that is likely due to relatively low sequence divergence. In contrast, viruses sampled from recent infections (2005) (2006) (2007) from avian and mammalian hosts formed three well-supported lineages with bootstrap support (or posterior probabilities) over 90 (or 0.9) under neighbor-joining (NJ), ML and Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (BMCMC) methods. We denote these lineages as groups 1, 2, and 3 in the hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) phylogenies ( Figures 1A and S2C ). This structure was preserved in the phylogenies of other genes for which sufficient sequence data were available (viruses from group 3 were missing sequence data for the NP, NS, NS1, NS2, and PB2 genes). The group 3 lineage in the MP, M1, M2, and PB1 phylogenies was only represented by the A/Indonesia/6/05 strain.

It is important to recognize that our phylogenetic groupings (groups 1, 2, and 3) of Indonesian H5N1 viruses ( Figure 1 and Table S6 ) are slightly different to those by Smith and coworkers [10] who did not require the same level of clustering support for each group, leading to the inclusion of earlier viruses (predominantly 2003-2004) . We chose to be conservative, and did not include poorly supported branches (e.g., earlier viruses) in our viral group definition. Therefore, we did not define a group corresponding to the group B of Smith et al., because most of group B taxa are earlier viruses. Groups 1 and 2 in this study correspond to groups C and A defined by Smith et al. respectively, plus some more recent viruses. Smith did not report group 3, because the sequences were unavailable at that time.

We found previously unrecognized phylogenetic discordance between gene trees involving human and cat isolates (n = 25, denoted in red in Figures 1, S1-S3)-the main focus of our study-suggesting that they are reassortant viruses descending from group 2 and 3 lineages. In addition, the placement of two avian viruses isolates from Java (Ck/IDN/Semerang1631-62/07 and Ck/IDN/Magelang1631-57/07, shown in blue in Figures 1A  and S2C ) differed between HA and NA phylogenies, suggesting another reassortment event.

To further investigate the putative reassortant human and cat viruses, a selected dataset (n = 24) of manually concatenated full genomes (Figure 2A ; see Methods) of Indonesian H5N1 HPAI viruses were analyzed using more sophisticated analysis methods, including similarity plots, bootscan analyses and GARD analyses (genetic algorithm for recombination detection). In the similarity and bootscan plots ( Figure 2B and 2C), the putative reassortants (represented by a consensus sequence) showed a high degree of sequence similarity and phylogenetic clustering with the group 3 strain A/Indonesia/6/05 in the MP and PB1 segments, but not in other genomic regions, where they were more similar to the consensus sequence of group 2 viruses ( Figure 2B and 2C). Moreover, GARD detected two well-supported breakpoints near the boundaries of MP and PB1 segments in the concatenated genomes ( Figure 2D ), suggesting that the phylogenetic incongruence was significant between the three regions. In summary, all three analyses agreed that the newly reassortant strains had arisen from acquiring PB1 and MP genome segments from the group 3 lineage and the remaining segments from the group 2 lineage.

Based on the HA phylogeny ( Figure 1A ), we further classified the reassortant viruses into three subgroups (R1, R2, and R3) with bootstrap support of 80% or better, as shown in the phylogenies containing only reassortant viruses ( Figure S4 ). Similar groupings were observed in the NA phylogeny ( Figures S2C and S4B ), although here subgroup R3 clustered with subgroup R1, and two reassortant viruses isolated in 2007 (IDN/CDC1046/07, IDN/ CDC1047/07) moved to a different subgroup. These inferred clustering patterns can be explained by multiple reassortment events, or by a single reassortment followed by divergence due to mutation and selection in different populations. We note that some group 2 viruses also cluster inside the reassortant subgroups ( Figures 1A and  S2C ) and may indicate more reassortment events; however, most of them formed polytomies close to the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of the reassortant subgroups and had poor bootstrap support for their exact placement. As the divergence between the reassortant subgroups and other intercalating group 2 viruses are low, the three subgroups may actually be linked uninterruptedly, implying a single origin. Therefore, the times and number of reassortment events that generated the putative mosaic reassortant viruses remains elusive. We examine both the single and multiple origin hypotheses in subsequent analyses, excluding the intercalating group 2 viruses from the reassortant group.

To estimate the times of the reassortment events that generated the putative reassortant viruses, the times of the MRCA (tMRCA) of the three reassortant subgroups were estimated using BMCMC methods [18, 19] . Bayes Factors (BF) [20] were used to select Author Summary H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus emerged in China in 1996, and has spread beyond Asia since 2003. Following the first outbreak reported in Indonesian poultry farms in December 2003, the virus spilled over to 27 Indonesian provinces by June 2006, and became endemic in the country. In the following years, repeated sporadic human infections in Indonesia had been attributed to H5N1 HPAI viruses. Nonetheless, the viral evolution and transmission have not been fully understood. Here, we report phylogenetic evidence of a group of interlineage reassortant viruses isolated from human and cats in Java. Our comparative study of the reassortant viruses and one group of genetic parents found that although their rates of evolution were similar and both of their phylogenies were not geographically structured within mainland Java, the growths of genetic diversity were different. We also detected significant positive selection on the viral matrix and polymerase genes preceding and subsequent to the emergence of the reassortant viruses, which might correspond to viral adaptation. Based on our findings, we discuss the possibility of host switching in facilitating the emergence of the reassortant strain, and call for more extensive viral surveillances in the non-avian population in Indonesia. among strict and relaxed clock models of evolution [21] . The uncorrelated exponentially-distributed clock model (UCED) significantly outperformed the other models (lnBF.3) for most datasets, except for the NA gene of the reassortant viruses, for which the strict clock model was not rejected (lnBF,1; Table S4 ).

The results of tMRCA estimation are summarized in Figure 3C and 3D. In addition, sequence isolation dates were plotted against their genetic distance (units of substitutions/site) to their MRCA, to graphically show the accumulation of mutations through time ( Figure 3A and 3B). The tMRCA of all reassortant viruses (All- were isolated from central and east Jakarta (Table 1) . Parsimony reconstruction (see Methods) of binary ancestral geographical states (either Greater Jakarta or West Java) upon the HA and NA ML phylogenies suggested that the MRCA of all reassortants (and the MRCAs of each reassortant subgroup) likely originated from Greater Jakarta and surroundings (Table S2 ; result robust to random resolution of polytomies; see Methods).

The mean numbers of observed geographical state changes (GSC) of the reassortant and of the group 2 parental strains were estimated independently and compared with the null distribution of GSC values under the null hypothesis of completely unrestricted migration (i.e. panmixis; Figure S5 ) [22] . For the reassortant strain, the observed GSC value was not significantly lower than the GSC value expected under panmixis (Slatkin-Maddison test: p.0.2). Therefore the observed geographic structure is not significantly different to that expected by chance alone. For group 2 viruses, the observed GSC value for all geographical state pairs is significantly (p,0.0002) lower than the null value. However, the observed value of GSC within Java (i.e., migrations between Greater Jakarta and the rest of Java) and between the three islands (i.e. migrations between mainland Java, Sumatera and Sulawesi Selatan including Papua) are insignificantly (p.0.2) and significantly (p,0.0002) lower than the corresponding null values respectively, suggesting that the phylogeny of group 2 viruses is not geographically structured within Java, but is subdivided by island-to-island migrations. However, we could not address whether the viral migrations inside Sumatera and Sulawesi Selatan including Papua are panmictic or structured due to limited operative localities in our dataset to distinguish between different regions inside these islands. We also found that the migration of group 2 viruses from Greater Jakarta and surroundings to Sumatera and Sulawesi Selatan including Papua was more frequent than expected under the null hypothesis, and there is relatively little viral migration from the rest of Java to Sumatera and Sulawesi Selatan including Papua (Table S3 ). This observation suggests Greater Jakarta played a more salient role in dispersing group 2 viruses to other Indonesian islands than other parts of Java did. There is another family member (brother) who was confirmed with H5N1 infection (index #45, fatal); however, virus sequences are not available. f Numbers in parentheses are the unique references to the localities shown in Figure 4 . Numbers 1-6 were assigned to Greater Jakarta and surroundings; numbers 7-12 were assigned to West Java. n/a = Information not available. doi:10.1371/journal.ppat.1000130.t001

We used the Bayesian skyline plot (BSP) [23] to estimate the change of relative genetic diversity of the reassortant viruses and of the group 2 parental strain over time, as shown in Figure 3E -3H. For both the HA and NA datasets, the group 2 viruses consistently show a slow growth in relative genetic diversity over time which appears to follow a constant size or exponential growth model, whereas the reassortant viruses initially exhibited an abrupt rise in relative genetic diversity followed by stabilization, which visually resembles a logistic growth curve with two phases [24, 25] ( Figure 3E and 3F) . When the BSPs are superimposed upon the demographic results obtained under parametric growth models (i.e., constant, exponential and logistic growth; Figure S8 ), then a similar observation can also be made. However, BF tests (Table  S4) indicate there is insufficient statistical power to discriminate between the three parametric growth models (lnBF,2.99), suggesting a lack of strong demographic signal in these data. When the parametric demographic models were fitted to the data, the median estimates of growth rates for the reassortant datasets are generally higher than those estimated for the datasets of group 2 viruses (Table S1 ). However, the confidence intervals of some growth rate estimates are fairly large and overlapped among the reassortant and group 2 viral datasets.

Diversifying selection in the PB2 and M1 genes Using the Random Effects Likelihood (REL) method [26] we found sites under positive selection in the PB2 gene (codons 76, 534, 627, 677 and 740) and the PA gene (codon 409) of the reassortant viruses. The Fixed Effects Likelihood (FEL) method [26] was more conservative and only identified PB2 codon 534 as being positively selected. For the group 2 viruses, HA codon 129 (starting from HA1) and M1 gene codon 205 were the only selected sites identified by the FEL and REL methods, respectively. Using a lineage-specific selection model (see Methods), we identified elevated rates of diversifying selection, measured by the ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous substitutions (dN/dS), on the M1 gene in the lineage leading to the MRCA of the group 3 viruses and preceding the emergence of the reassortant viruses (highlighted in Figure 1B ). The dN/dS values for the M1 gene in this lineage (which we call the preemergence lineage) was estimated to be 1.514 (95% CI: 0.447-3.814; see Table S5 ), significantly higher (LRT p,0.002) than the mean estimates for other lineages (dN/dS = 0.077) in the Indonesian clade and for lineages in other H5N1 HPAI clades (e.g., Fujian, Qinghai, Thailand and Vietnam clades which have dN/dS ranging from 0.05 to 0.09). This lineage-specific elevation of dN/dS was not significant (LRT p.0.1) for other genes (i.e. HA, NA, M2, PB1; see Table S5 ). Four amino acid changes in M1 occurred along the pre-emergence lineage, including threonine to alanine at reside 37, arginine to lysine at reside 95, threonine to alanine at reside 137, glutamine to histidine at reside 249. Three (residue 37, 95, and 137) of them are located close to the electrostatic positive surface of the N-terminal domain of the M1 protein molecule ( Figure S7 ), and one (residue 249) is located in the remaining C-terminal fragment.

This study classified H5N1 HPAI viruses in Indonesia into three distinct viral lineages (groups 1, 2, and 3) and discovered a group of naturally occurring reassortant viruses that represent a newly emergent H5N1 HPAI strain in Java in 2006. Several phylogenetic methods concurred that two (MP and PB1) of the reassortant viruses' genome segments descended from the group 3 ancestral viruses, and the remaining six (PB2, PA, HA, NP, NA, NS) segments descended from the group 2 ancestral viruses. Although the majority of reassortant viruses (24/25) are human isolates, few of the associated human infections are epidemiologically linked (Table 1) , suggesting multiple sporadic zoonotic transmissions from birds. The phylogeographic results indicate that the parental viruses of the reassortants have been co-circulating in Java since 2005. Despite the identification of parental lineages, the exact number of reassortment events remains difficult to assess. Although the three fairly consistent phylogenetic subgroups (subgroups R1, R2, and R3 in Figure S4 ) formed by the reassortant viruses suggest three independent reassortments, the underlying uncertainty in our estimated phylogenies means that we cannot rule out the possibility of a single origin.

The hypothesis of three reassortments implies that the viruses have acquired exactly the same genome segments from the same group of parental viruses, which seems unlikely to occur by chance (probability = 0.0089, assuming panmixis and that exactly two genomic segments are swapped out). This probability might be increased if reassortments confer a selective advantage. We did detect a significantly stronger selection pressure on the M1 protein in the pre-emergence lineage of group 3 parental strain that led to the reassortant viruses (Table S5) . Previous reports suggested a few amino acid changes in M1 of influenza A and B viruses can confer a growth advantage in mouse lungs [27] [28] [29] . Although the M1 mutations identified in this pre-emergence lineage have not been functional characterized elsewhere in the authors' knowledge, one (residue 137, TRA) of them is close to a previously characterized mutation (residue 139, TRA) which controls the virulence in mouse model [27, 29] . Three of the inferred residue changes are located close to the electropositive surface of N-terminal domain of M1 protein ( Figure S7 ) that acts to bind viral RNA [30, 31] . The M1 matrix protein mediates encapsulation of viral RNAnucleoproteins into membrane envelope during packaging [31] , and has close contact with other viral proteins inside the viral particle. It seems possible that some of these changes may be involved in the adaptation of reassortant viruses, through promotion of structural interactions among viral proteins.

According to our analyses, the common ancestor of the reassortant viruses is dated to July 2005 (HPD: April-October), approximately 5 months prior to the first case of human infection caused by the reassortant virus (index case #15 defined by WHO; see Table 1 ). Our analysis of virus phylogeography suggests the ancestors of these reassortant viruses first arose in Greater Jakarta and surroundings, which agrees with the observation that the first two cases of human infection by the reassortant viruses occurred in Central and East Jakarta (index cases #15 and #16). The molecular dating and phylogenetic analyses suggest that nascent reassortant viruses might take several months to spread and expand their diversity in the local bird population, eventually leading to the exposure of human population. The subsequent spread of the reassortant strain seems to become more rapid and extensive, as human cases were reported outside Greater Jakarta one month later, and the reassortant virus spread to as far as the south and east of West Java in the following six months (Table 1 and Figure 4) . Commercial poultry transportation, as well as carriage by migratory birds, may facilitate the viral migration, but their tangible contributions need further studies. Our results suggest that the circulations of reassortant viruses and their genetic parent (group 2) were not restricted by geography within Java. The viral migration back to Greater Jakarta could be driven by the inter-province transfer of infected poultry, in particular the importation of live poultry or fresh poultry products to the densely human populated Jakarta from the remote provinces engaged in poultry-farming. Future studies on economic and social geography (e.g., addressing the modes of inter-provincial poultry transport) in Indonesia might help to further elucidate the effect on the viral dispersal by human, agricultural and industrial activities. In this study, we opted for a lower geographical resolution (i.e., four widely ranged geographical states instead of distinct geographical coordinate for each viral isolate) in our phylogeographic analyses because of the varying precision of the geographical data we have. Therefore, more complex hypotheses of viral origin and migration trajectory cannot be investigated here, but can be explored when more high-quality geographical data of Indonesian H5N1 viral samples is available.

The BSP analyses ( Figure 3E-3H) indicate that the reassortant viruses follow a logistic-like growth curve, which is typical for virus invasion and maintenance, especially in a structured population [24, 25] . In contrast, the group 2 viruses followed a more continuous and relatively slow growth in diversity. There was insufficient data in our samples to definitively discriminate between alternative population growth models and provide narrow confidence intervals for parameter estimates, but our results are suggestive and future sequencing will add to the needed statistical power.

What factors have contributed to the apparent difference in the growth of genetic diversity? Rates of molecular evolution between the two groups were similar ( Figure S6 ) and therefore are not likely to be the cause. Since our analyses could not resolve the temporal dynamics of population subdivision by geography, we cannot directly investigate how viral genetic variation is affected by the population structure. We expect future development of analysis methods will help to shed more light on the interaction between viral migration and genetic diversity.

Analysis of clinical records (Table 1) found that the mean duration from onset to death in those fatal human cases caused by Indonesian reassortant H5N1 viruses is 9.1 days (standard deviation [SD] = 3.9; n = 23) and those caused by other Indonesian H5N1 viruses is 7.7 days (SD = 2.7; n = 10), and their means are not significantly different (student t-test, p.0.25, two-tails). Therefore, based on the clinical records, the reassortant viruses did not kill human faster than other Indonesian H5N1 viruses did. However, we would recommend more experimental studies addressing the virulence, pathogenicity and immunogenicity of the reassortant viruses and the parent strains to verify this claim in the future.

Mechanisms of viral transmissions are sometimes correlated with genetic diversity dynamics. For example, hepatitis C viruses transmitted by drug injection or blood products have a faster rate of spread than endemic strains circulating in Asia and Africa [32] . It has also been suggested that mosquito susceptibility may affect the growth of dengue viruses [33] . Therefore, it is possible that a change of host species could generate the difference in the viral dynamics we observe. In our study, the majority of the reassortant viruses (24/25) were isolated from humans, whereas only a minority of the group 2 viruses were isolated from humans (10/57 and 10/41 in the HA and NA datasets, respectively).

It has been previously shown that the receptor binding specificity of hemagglutinin [34] and mutations in the viral polymerase (e.g., lysine at residue 627 of PB2) [35] [36] [37] can determine viral transmissibility and replication in different host species. None of the aforementioned HA mutations which confer recognition to human-type host cell receptors [34, 38] were found in the Indonesian reassortant viruses; however, our detection of positively selected sites in the PB2 gene of the reassortant viruses could potentially reflect adaptation to mammalian hosts, and requires further investigation. In particular, amino acid changes on two positively selected sites (threonine to methionine at reside 76, glutamic acid to glycine and alanine at reside 677) were found on the internal branches of the reassortant lineage, corresponding to molecular changes during sustainable transmissions. However, some of these positively selected changes may also result from the compensatory evolution as the mix of genome segments from different strains might alter their epistatic physiochemistry [39] . Although most of the human isolates in our datasets were epidemiologically unlinked, such linkage is theoretically possible if many asymptotic or mildly manifested human infections are not reported. Recently, some evidence of subclinical or asymptotic H5N1 infection in humans has been put forward [40, 41] ; however, the ability of the viruses to transmit from these infected individuals to other susceptible individuals remains unknown.

The possible role of other animal host species in the transmissions of reassortant viruses in Indonesia should not be neglected. In particular, one of the reassortant viruses was isolated from a dead cat in Jakarta, where H5N1 outbreaks in poultry and sporadic human infections have been reported [42] . Moreover, unusual high mortality of cats in the vicinity of H5N1 HPAI outbreaks has been reported [43] . An unofficial report also detected H5N1 HPAI sero-positivity in around 20% of 500 blood samples taken from stray cats near poultry markets in Java and Sumatera [44] . In addition to small cats in Germany [45] , Iran [46] , and Indonesia [42] , dogs and zoo tigers were also found infected with H5N1 HPAI viruses in Thailand [47, 48] . Furthermore, previous experimental studies have demonstrated that cats can be infected with H5N1 HPAI virus [49, 50] , and that cat-to-cat transmission is possible [49, 51] . Could cats, or other non-avian species, have played a role in spreading the reassortant viruses in Java? Similarly, could cats act as amplifying hosts facilitating viral expansion and cross-species transmission, as civets did in the SARS outbreaks [52] ? Future experimental studies on these reassortant viruses, that assess viral transmissibility between species, together with epidemiological studies, such as viral monitoring within Indonesian animal populations using serological tests and PCR detection, would give more clues to these questions. H5N1 HPAI viruses have been endemic and evolved into different genetic lineages that have spread across Indonesia. Areas where more than one lineage of virus is co-circulating, such as Jakarta, are most likely to generate novel viruses by inter-lineage reassortment. These reassortant viruses have distinctive evolutionary and transmission dynamics, as shown in this study. We suggest that more intensive and timely field surveillance and analysis of influenza viruses, including H5N1 HPAI and human H3N2, H1N1, and H1N2 epidemic strains, should be employed, so that bio-security can be undertaken promptly and appropriate strains can be selected for vaccine production whenever a novel reassortant strain emerges. The reassortant viruses reported in this study should be also added to the watch list for the future epidemiological surveillance.

Sequence data collection and alignment H5N1 influenza viruses isolated from avian and mammalian hosts in Indonesia during 2003-2007 were studied. Their genomic sequences (n = 807) were extracted from the Influenza Virus Resource [53] and the Influenza Sequence Database [54] in September 2007, and aligned using MUSCLE version 3.6 [55] . Columns with gaps were removed from the alignments, and sequences from the same virus strain (duplicated submission in the two databases) were filtered such that one copy was retained. Eight genome segment alignment datasets (PB2, PB1, PA, HA, NP, NA, MP, and NS), as well as four coding sequences (M1, M2, NS1, and NS2), were generated. Full details of our datasets can be found in Table S6 and S7.

Phylogenetic trees of 12 alignment datasets were reconstructed using the ML approach implemented in PhyML 3.412 [56] . The robustness of the ML tree topology was assessed by comparing the ML topology with the topologies sampled in the BMCMC analysis performed in MrBayes version 3.1.2 [57] , and with bootstrapping analyses of 1,000 pseudo-replicate datasets. ML and NJ trees were estimated from the bootstrap datasets using PhyML [56] and PAUP* version 4beta10 [58] , respectively. A general-time-reversal (GTR) substitution model with gamma distributed rate heterogeneity of 4 rate categories (C 4 ) and a proportion of invariable sites were used in all tree reconstruction methods. Phylogenies were rooted with the H5N1 HPAI strain A/Ck/HK/YU324/2003, which is genetically close to the newly reported Hunan strains [17] , and shares comparable genetic proximity to Indonesian clade.

Homologous recombination within each gene segment among Indonesian H5N1 isolates was extensively searched using Recombination Detection Program version 2 (RDP2) [59] , and the datasets are found to be free of homologous recombination. Putative reassortant viruses were preliminarily identified by their topological incongruity across the phylogenies of different gene segments. This was further investigated using a smaller set of Indonesian H5N1 virus isolates with full genome sequences, which included sequences of early viruses (n = 2), group 1-3 lineages (n = 12) and putative reassortant viruses (n = 10). The eight gene segment alignments were manually concatenated in the order of their length to generate a single alignment of complete genome sequences, and was further analyzed using 1) similarity plots and 2) bootscan analyses [60] implemented in SIMPLOT version 3.5.1 [61] , and 3) GARD [62] available via the Datamonkey website [63] . The hypothesis of reassortment was supported if the recombinant breakpoints were detected near the junctions where the genome segments were manually concatenated.

The geographic locations of virus isolation were either obtained from the sequence databases, or obtained through personal communication with Catherine Smith (from Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, USA), or inferred from their strain names (Tables 1 and S6 ). The locations of isolates were indicated on the map of main island of Java in Indonesia (Figure 4 ). Due to the limit of our geographical data, the localities of the isolates shown in the map (Figure 4 ) should be regarded as arbitrary within the province which is the highest precision level shared by all viral samples. Each of the reassortant viruses was assigned with a state of either Greater Jakarta (surroundings included) or West Java depending on its place of origin ( Table 1 ). The migratory history of the reassortant viruses (n = 25) between these geographical states were inferred based on the refined ML phylogeny of HA and NA ( Figure  S4 ) independently using two parsimony optimization methods, called ACCTRAN (accelerated transformation) and DELTRAN (delayed transformation) implemented in PAUP* software. The geographical states of all ancestral nodes in the tree were estimated to achieve minimum state changes in overall, and therefore the number of state changes and state of the MRCA of the reassortant was obtained. Polytomies were randomly resolved 1,000 times, and state changes were estimated separately for each resolution. The mean number of state changes was then calculated. To test against the null hypothesis of completely unrestricted migration between geographical states (panmixis), the mean number of observed state changes was compared with the frequency distribution of the mean number of expected state changes under the null hypotheses. The null distribution and critical values were generated by randomly shuffling the states of isolates 5,000 times (the Slatkin-Maddison test [22, 24, 64] ). The migratory history of group 2 viruses was also studied using the HA gene in a similar manner, while each group 2 virus was assigned to either of four widely ranged geographical states: Greater Jakarta and surroundings, the rest of Java, Sumatra, and Sulawesi Selatan, including Papua. This assignment scheme is comparable to that of reassortant viruses, as West Java is part of Java.

Parameters of codon-partitioned substitution rates, demographic functions, tMRCA and tree topologies were co-estimated from HA and NA gene datasets of reassortant and group 2 viruses separately in a BMCMC framework [18] using BEAST version 1.4.6 [65] . Substitution model HKY+C 4 with invariable site portion was used. Isolation dates were used to calibrate the molecular clock. Three clock models including strict clock, UCEN and UCLN relaxed clocks [21] were attempted independently, and the best-fit clock model was selected by comparing the BF calculated from their posterior distributions [20] . The Bayesian skyline plot [23] was used to estimate population dynamics, in terms of relative genetic diversity. Less complex parametric demographic models (constant size, exponential growth and logistic growth) were applied independently, and the best-fit models selected by BF tests were used to quantitatively estimate the growth rate and other demographic parameters. The BMCMC analyses contained 2610 8 states, with sampling every 1,000 states, and the first 10% of each chain was discarded as burn-in. Convergences and effective sample sizes of the estimates were checked using Tracer v1.4 [66] .

Positively selected sites were detected using random effect likelihood (REL) and fixed effect likelihood (FEL) methods [26] via the Datamonkey website [63] . Bayes factors larger than 50 and pvalues smaller than 0.1 were used as thresholds for strong evidence of selection in REL and FEL, respectively. To test lineage-specific positive selection, the two-ratio branch model was used, which pre-specifies a single rate of synonymous substitution (dS) for the whole phylogeny and two rates of non-synonymous substitution (dN 1 and dN 2 ). The dN 1 was specified for the pre-emergence lineage (indicated as the ancestral branch connecting the group 3 MRCA; see Figure 1B ) for the group 3 viruses (including the reassortant viruses for M1, M2, and PB1 genes). The dN 2 was specified for other lineages across the phylogenies. The ML estimates of these rate parameters were performed in HYPHY version 0.99 [67] . The resulting likelihood score of the two-ratio model was then compared with that of the one-ratio model, which assumes the same dN and dS across the phylogeny, using the likelihood ratio test (LRT, with degree of freedom = 1). The substitution model MG94XGTR+C 4 was used.

The ancestral nucleotide sequences of all internal nodes were reconstructed using joint ML method [68] implemented in HYPHY. Amino acid changes along the pre-emergence lineage were determined, and were then mapped onto the three-dimensional structure of the N-terminal domain of M1 matrix protein molecule [30] available (PDB-ID: 1EA3) in RCSB Protein Data Bank.

Quantifying dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 transmission suggests that epidemic control and avoidance is feasible through instantaneous digital contact tracing,"Mobile phone apps implementing algorithmic contact tracing can speed up the process of tracing newly diagnosed individuals, spreading information instantaneously back through a past contact network to inform them that they are at risk of being infected, and thus allow them to take appropriate social distancing and testing measures. The aim of non-pharmaceutical infection prevention is to move a population towards herd protection, a state where a population maintains R 0 <1, thus making it impossible for a pathogen to cause an epidemic. Here, we address epidemiological issues that affect the feasibility of an algorithmic approach to instantaneous contact tracing; ethical and implementation issues are addressed separately. First we quantify the parameters of COVID-19 in a framework that is consistent with the renewal equation formulation of epidemic spread. Second, we use an analytical solution to application of first-degree contact tracing in the renewal equation model to explore combinations of efficacy that can induce herd protection (R 0 <1). With the emergence of the novel viral pathogen SARS-CoV-2, of clear potential for a global pandemic with high fatality rates and incapacitated health systems, the question of prevention has critical priority. We come to the conclusion that isolating symptomatic cases and tracing their contacts in a classical manner is not sufficiently fast to stop the spread of the epidemic and needs to be accompanied by measures of social distancing that are disruptive to a wide number of people. We show that first-degree instantaneous contact tracing, informing users when they can move safely or when to seek medical help and avoid vulnerable individuals, has the potential to stop the spread of the epidemic if used by a sufficiently large number of people with reasonable fidelity.

Human-to-human transmission was initially focused in the Hubei province of China, but has now seeded growing epidemics around the world. The virus is likely of bat origin, with a possible intermediate animal host, and most of the first documented cases were linked to environmental exposure in the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in early December 2019. The virus is sufficiently genetically similar to the 2003 SARS-CoV-1 virus that it is reasonable to expect some aspects of epidemiology to be similar, and then update these views as new data emerge. So far, new analyses indicate that SARS-CoV-2 is more infectious and less virulent than SARS-CoV-1, and could have greater epidemic potential due to greater difficulties in tracing mild or asymptomatic infections. No treatment is currently available, and while the development of a vaccine is proceeding as fast as possible, the need to test any candidates for safety in humans means that vaccines will not be available for several months at the earliest. The only tools that we currently have to stop the epidemic are those of classical epidemic control, like contact tracing, social distancing and quarantine. The aim of this paper is to explore the feasibility of achieving herd protection (R 0 <1) using isolation coupled to classical contact tracing by questionnaires and people versus algorithmic instantaneous contact tracing assisted by a phone app.

The biomechanics of transmission of betacoronaviruses are well understood in general terms: the virus can pass from one individual to another through exhaled droplets ( 1 ) , aerosol ( 2 ) , contamination of surfaces ( 3 ) , and possibly through fecal-oral contamination ( 4 ) . Rather than comparing transmission through these different physical routes, here we compare different transmission routes that are more closely aligned to their implications for prevention. Specifically we propose four categories. 1. Symptomatic transmission: direct transmission from a symptomatic individual, through a contact that can be readily recalled by the recipient. 2. Pre-symptomatic transmission: direct transmission from an individual that occurs before the source individual experiences noticeable symptoms. (Note that this definition may be context specific, for example based on whether it is the source or the recipient who is asked whether the symptoms were noticeable.) 3. Asymptomatic transmission: direct transmission from individuals who never experience noticeable symptoms. This can only be established by follow-up, as single time-point observation cannot fully distinguish asymptomatic from pre-symptomatic individuals. 4. Environmental transmission: transmission via contamination, and specifically in a way that would not typically be attributable to contact with the source in a contact survey (i.e. we exclude from this transmission pairs who were in extended close contact, but for whom in reality the infectious dose passed via the environment instead of more directly). These could be identified in an analysis of spatial movements. We acknowledge that boundaries between these categories may be blurred, but these broadly have different implications for prevention. These will be spelled out in future work on modelling different prevention approaches, and may be mapped to other modelling studies, some old and general ( 5 ) ( 6 ) and one more specific to COVID-19 ( 7 ) .

Evidence exists that each of these routes of transmission is possible: symptomatic ( 8 ) , pre-symptomatic ( 9 ) ; asymptomatic ( 10 ) ; and environmental ( 8 ) . For prevention, the crucial information is the relative frequency of different routes of transmission: finite resources must be divided between different intervention strategies.

Li et al ( 8 ) presented self-reported data on exposure for the first 425 cases in Wuhan. Some of these reported visiting the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market; the generalisability of transmission in that setting to other settings is highly uncertain, as this large-scale event seeded the epidemic in the absence of any knowledge about the disease. After closure of the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market on January 1st, of 240 cases with no exposure to any wet market, 200 individuals (83%) reported no exposure to an individual with respiratory symptoms. Inaccurate recall may explain some responses, but unlikely as much as 83% of them.

The situation in Singapore at first glance appears quite different. As of March 5th, 2020, there have been 117 cases, of which 25 were imported. By devoting considerable resources including police investigation, 75 of the 92 cases of local transmission have been traced back to their presumed exposure, either to a known case or to a location linked to spread (https://infographics.channelnewsasia.com/covid-19/coronavirus-singapore-clusters.html?cid=FBcna). However, linking two cases generally includes the possibility that one infected the other pre-symptomatically and only later became symptomatic; furthermore, linking cases via a location generally includes the possibility of environmentally mediated transmission. Therefore the large fraction of traceable transmission here does not contradict the large fraction without symptomatic exposure in Wuhan. A conservative reading of the Singapore data serves only as evidence against a large role of asymptomatic transmission.

The most accurate and robust quantification of the relative frequency of routes of transmission would be a well-designed prospective cohort study with detailed journal and phylogenetic investigations. However, the current global emergency requires timely estimates using imperfect data sources. We performed a detailed analysis of the timing of events in defined transmission pairs, derived the generation time distribution, and attributed a probability for each pair that transmission was pre-symptomatic. We also fit a mathematical model of infectiousness, through the four routes discussed above, over the course of infection. This allowed us to calculate the R 0 , estimate the proportion of transmission from different routes, and make predictions about whether contact tracing and isolation of known cases is sufficient to prevent a large-scale spread of the epidemic.

Exponential doubling time, T 2 . We calculated the exponential growth rate of the epidemic, r , from the early stages of the epidemic in China, such that the effect of control measures discussed later will be relative to the early stages of an outbreak, exemplified by baseline contact patterns and environmental conditions in Hubei during that period. We note that this assumption is implicit in many estimates of R 0 . The epidemic doubling time T 2 , equal to log e (2) / r , was previously estimated as 7.4 days (95% confidence interval (CI) 4.2 to 14) from data on the first 425 cases in Wuhan ( 8 ) , and independently as 7.2 days (95% credible interval 4.7 to 16.3) by phylodynamic analysis of 86 whole SARS-CoV-2 genomes ( http://virological.org/t/phylodynamic-analysis-129-genomes-24-feb-2020/356 ). We analysed the former data source together with the China Centre for Disease Control counts of daily confirmed cases (http://2019ncov.chinacdc.cn/2019-nCoV/), visually identified two periods of consistent early exponential growth, and obtained a more precise combined estimate of T 2 = 5.0 days (95% CI 4.3 to 6.2). See Figure  1 .

Numbers of people later reporting symptoms beginning that day, from the first 425 cases analysed by ( 8 ) , are shown for those reporting exposure to a wet market (red circles) and those reporting no exposure to any wet market (blue triangles). Also shown are numbers of people confirmed as cases each day (green squares) and number of deaths each day (purple plus signs) from China Centre for Disease Control data. Five visually identified periods of exponential growth have the best-fit linear model shown with a coloured line and 95% confidence intervals in grey shading. Two of these fits (blue and first green) were merged into a single best estimate of the epidemic exponential growth rate r (grey box). Counts of zero are shown on the x axis (log(0) being undefined).

The incubation period is defined as the time between infection and onset of symptoms. It is estimated as the time between exposure and report of noticeable symptoms. We used the incubation period distribution calculated by ( 11 ) . The distribution is lognormal with mean 5.5 days, median 5.2 days and standard deviation 2.1 days, and is included with our results in Figure 2 .

Generation time distribution. The generation time is defined for source-recipient transmission pairs as the time between the infection of the source and the infection of the recipient. Because time of infection is generally not known, the generation time is often approximated by the (clinical onset) serial interval, which is defined as the time between the onset of symptoms of the source and the onset of symptoms of the recipient. We did not take that approach here: we directly estimated the generation time distribution from 40 source-recipient pairs for whom direct transmission is suspected, and where time of onset of symptoms is known for both source and recipient. We combined dates of symptom onset with intervals of exposure for both source and recipient (when available) and the above distribution of incubation times, and inferred the distribution of generation times. The distribution is best described by a Weibull distribution with mean and median equal to 5.0 days and standard deviation of 1.9 days, shown in Figure  2 . We also show the results of sensitivity analysis to different functional forms, and compare to two previously published serial interval distributions -those of ( 12 ) and ( 8 ) . Our distribution is robust with respect to the choice of transmission events (Supplementary Figure 5) . The distribution of serial intervals for these pairs is shown in Supplementary Figure 3 . author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

The proportion of transmissions from before symptoms develop. For each of the 40 transmission pairs we estimated the posterior probability that transmission was pre-symptomatic, i.e. occurred before the onset of symptoms in the infector. We used a Bayesian approach with an uninformative prior (transmission before or after symptoms equally likely). The 40 probabilities inferred are shown in Figure  3 ; the mean probability is 37% (95% CI: 27.5% -45%), which can be interpreted as the fraction of pre-symptomatic transmission events out of pre-symptomatic plus symptomatic transmission events. This value does not depend significantly on the choice for the functional form of the distribution of generation times ( Supplementary Figures 6-7) , or on the choice of transmission events (Supplementary Figure 8) . A general deterministic mathematical model of infectiousness. We use a mathematical formalism ( 13 ) that describes how infectiousness varies as a function of time since infection, , for a representative cohort of infected individuals. This includes heterogeneity between individuals, and averages over those individuals who infect few others and those who infect many. This average defines the function ( ). Infectiousness may change with due to both changing disease biology (notably viral shedding) and changing contact with others. The area under the curve is the reproduction number R 0 .

We decompose ( ) into four contributions that reflect our categorisation above, namely asymptomatic transmission, pre-symptomatic transmission, symptomatic transmission, and environmental transmission. The area under the curve of one of these contributions gives the mean total number of transmissions over All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.

The top panels show absolute reproduction numbers: the four contributors to R 0 (from pre-symptomatic, symptomatic, asymptomatic and environmental transmission respectively, with the bin at 1.8 containing overflow) and R 0 itself. The bottom panels show the fractions of R 0 that each contribution represents.

For comparison with our analysis of pre-symptomatic transmission just within the 40 transmission pairs, the estimate of R P /(R P +R S ) obtained by this method is 0.55 (0.36 -0.72).

We define as the fraction of all transmissions that do not come from direct contact with a symptomatic individual:

. This corresponds to the of ( 5 ) in the case where there is only pre-symptomatic or /R 1 − R S 0 symptomatic transmission. From Table 2 this is 0.62 (0.50 -0.92). The value of observed during an exponentially growing epidemic will be distorted when the timing of the different contributions to transmission occur at different stages of the infection, due to over-representation of recently infected individuals. This effect can be calculated through use of the renewal equation, as was recently done to calculate the distribution of time from onset of COVID-19 symptoms to recovery or death ( 15 ) (see Supplementary Information) . We calculated the that would be observed with the early exponential growth seen in China as 0.68 (0.56 -0.93). The correction due to the epidemic dynamics is small compared to parameter uncertainties.

We developed our mathematical model of infectiousness into a web application where users can test the effect of alternative parameter combinations: https://bdi-pathogens.shinyapps.io/covid-19-transmission-routes

Interventions. Finally, we determined the combined impact of two interventions: (i) isolation of symptomatic individuals, and (ii) tracing the contacts of symptomatic cases and quarantining them. These interventions aim to stop the spread of the virus by reducing the number of transmissions from symptomatic individuals and from their contacts, while minimising the impact on the larger population. In practice, both these interventions are successful or possible only for a fraction of cases. The success rate of these interventions determines the long-term evolution of the epidemic. If the success rates are high enough, the combination of isolation and contact tracing/quarantining could bring R 0 below 1 and therefore effectively control the epidemic.

For classical contact tracing, results previously derived in ( 5 ) show that with any realistic implementation of contact tracing, epidemic control is not feasible. An algorithmic approach, embedded in a phone App or operating system, can make the contact tracing and notification instantaneous, and enables information to be spread to contacts whether recalled or not. This approach is mathematically solved analytically in Supplement Information for the case of algorithmic instantaneous contact tracing of first-degree (i.e. tracing and quarantining only contacts, not contacts of contacts).

The success rates of this isolation and instantaneous contact tracing in achieving herd protection from SARS-CoV-2 epidemic is shown in Figure 6 for different values of R 0 . The red line corresponds to a central estimate of R 0 =2; any successful intervention requires success rates above the red line. These values depend on the incubation period and generation time. We also estimated the growth rate of the epidemic as a function of the success rates of the interventions and of the value of R 0 prior to the interventions ( Supplementary Figures 9 -15 ).

The calculation shown in Figure 6 used our inference of the generation time interval, which is limited so far by the early availability of data on known transmission pairs with known timings. However the position of the epidemic control threshold (red line) should prove relatively robust to future data on the generation time interval, assuming that the estimates on the growth rate of the epidemic, r , do not increase. For example, shifts to shorter generation times would mean earlier intervention is required in each individual's infection, but for fixed r this would also imply a smaller value of R 0 and therefore a smaller fractional reduction would be needed.

Inevitable delays in isolating individuals after they show symptoms reduce the effectiveness of the intervention, moving the boundary for epidemic control (the red line in Figure 6 ) out to larger values. The same is true of delays in quarantining contacts, however delays from confirming a case to finding their contacts are not inevitable. Specifically, this delay can be reduced to zero through the use of spatial information coupled to case detection, in the form of a simple app: see Discussion.

Contours of constant R 0 on this plot show the different combinations of the two success rates that would be able to control the epidemic for an R 0 of that value. The solid red line is such a contour for our central estimate of R 0 for SARS-CoV-2, with the associated CIs in dashed red lines; these therefore show our best estimate of the required efficacy of case isolation and contact tracing.

In this study, we estimate key parameters of the epidemic and use an analytically solvable model of the exponential phase of SARS-CoV-2. Our results suggest that a large fraction of all transmissions occur before individuals develop symptoms. Isolating symptomatic cases and tracking their contacts through classical epidemiological methods is therefore likely to be too slow and resource-intensive to achieve All rights reserved.

The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.08.20032946 doi: medRxiv preprint epidemic control. We suggest that a simple algorithm for first degree instantaneous contact tracing in the form of a mobile phone app could dramatically reduce onwards transmission from contacts, to a level that is sufficient to reach herd protection and so stop the virus from spreading in a population.

Our estimate of R 0 is lower than most previous published estimates, for example ( 16 ) ( 17 ) ( 8 ) , which have assumed SARS-like generation times; emerging evidence for shorter generation times for COVID-19 results in a smaller R 0 . This means a smaller fraction of transmissions need to be blocked for herd protection, but there is a smaller window of time for each infected individual to prevent their onward transmission.

We provide estimates of key quantities intended to help inform intervention strategies. We provide two approaches suggesting that between a third and a half of transmissions occur from pre-symptomatic individuals. Our infectiousness model suggests that the total contribution to R0 from pre-symptomatics is 0.9 (0.2 -1.1). For SARS, the corresponding estimate was almost zero ( 5 ) , immediately telling us that different containment strategies will be needed for COVID-19. While preparing this manuscript, results supporting a large role for pre-symptomatic submission were shared: Tindale et al. found that serial intervals in Tianjin and Singapore were on average 2-3 days shorter than incubation periods ( https://github.com/carolinecolijn/ClustersCOVID19/blob/master/COVID_19_Singapore_Tianjin_analysi sSUPP-joined.pdf ), consistent with our estimate of a shorter generation time.

Cleaning and decontamination are being deployed to varying levels in different settings, and improved estimates would help inform this as a priority. For SARS, there were seemingly almost no asymptomatic infections ( 18 ) , whereas asymptomatic infection has been widely reported for COVID-19, e.g. ( 10 ) . We argue that the reports from Singapore imply that even if asymptomatic infections are common, onward transmission from this state is probably uncommon, since forensic reconstruction of the transmission networks has closed down most missing links. There is an important caveat to this: the Singapore outbreak to date is small, and has not implicated children. There is widespread speculation that children could be frequent asymptomatic carriers and potential sources of SARS-CoV-2 ( 19 ) , a finding that is being urgently explored.

Our model shows that the epidemic is highly unlikely to be contained by solely isolating symptomatic individuals. Published models ( 5 ) ( 20 ) ( 6 ) ( 7 ) suggest that in practice manual contact tracing can only improve on this to a limited extent.

We have developed a web interface to explore the uncertainty in our modelling assumptions https://bdi-pathogens.shinyapps.io/covid-19-transmission-routes . This will also serve as an ongoing resource as new data becomes available and as the epidemic evolves.

To control SARS-CoV-2 we need to reduce R 0 below 1; we do not need to stop all transmissions. Figure  4 , and its interactive web-interface, show the preventative potential of targeting different routes of transmission and different stages of the infection. Blocking transmission from individuals at early stages of their infection is generally more challenging. Contact tracing is made more effective by responding rapidly to an individual's first signs of symptoms, by instantaneously tracking down contacts of confirmed cases, and by general preventative population measures such as enhanced hand and respiratory hygiene, decontamination, and social distancing.

Digital contact tracing and quarantining could play a critical role both in reducing these delays and increasing success rates. Further modelling is required to compare the number of people disrupted under different scenarios consistent with herd protection. We do not agree with the assessment that a pandemic is inevitable, and recommend urgent exploration of means to reverse the current phase of exponential spread. ( 12 ) ; some we identified from other reports (see Supplementary Table) . The best fit among tested two-parameter distributions (lognormal, gamma, Weibull) was selected using the Akaike Information Criterion.

Probability of pre-symptomatic infection. The probability that infection occurred before onset of symptoms for the infector was estimated for each transmission pair using a Bayesian approach based on the best fit for the generation time distribution (see Supplementary Information) . This estimate assumes independence between generation time and incubation period, but takes into account the available information on period of exposure and onset of symptoms for each case.

Exponential growth rate. We identified the dates following consistent early exponential growth as December 28th -January 8th inclusive for Li et al.'s dates of symptom onset for cases not linked with any wet market, and January 18th -26th inclusive for the Chinese CDC dates of case confirmation, as illustrated with the blue and earliest green line in Figure 1 . We fit a single linear model to log(case counts) from both of these periods, constraining both sets of counts to have the same gradient (but different intercept, due to the delay between onset of symptoms and case confirmation).

Infectiousness model. Our model for infectiousness ( ) was solved first by fitting the shape of the pre-symptomatic + symptomatic contributions to our inferred generation time interval: these functions are proportional to each other when the transmission pairs analysed for the generation time distribution represent pre-symptomatic and symptomatic exposure in the proportion representative of overall epidemic spread. We make that assumption here. This assumption would be violated by biased selection of transmission pairs for sampling. For example if the infector being in a later, symptomatic stage of infection makes identification of the pair more likely, then a data set of identified pairs will be undersampled for pre-symptomatic exposure and will overestimate the typical generation time. The next step in solving the model was calculating the relative scaling constant of the environmental contribution to ( ) to give the required R E /R 0 , and finally the overall scaling constant of ( ) is determined to reproduce the observed exponential growth rate (see Supplementary Information) .

We drew 10,000 input parameter sets from the uncertainties shown in Table 2 . For the data-driven parameters, these uncertainties are likelihoods, which can be interpreted as posteriors if one's prior is an improper uniform distribution; we fit lognormal distributions to the 95% CIs and central estimates in order to obtain the full distribution. For the other parameters, the uncertainty distributions are pure priors.

To calculate the impact of contact tracing and isolation, we followed the mathematical treatment of ( 5 ) , explained in detail in the Supplementary Information. Specifically, we solved for the epidemic dynamics of the quantity Y(t, , '): the number of individuals at time t who were infected at a time t -by individuals who were in turn infected at time t -', subject to case isolation and contact tracing interventions. Both interventions are assumed to be immediate upon individuals showing symptoms, but both have efficacies that can vary continuously between 0 and 1.

Chikungunya Virus Fidelity Variants Exhibit Differential Attenuation and Population Diversity in Cell Culture and Adult Mice,"Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a reemerging global health threat that produces debilitating arthritis in people. Like other RNA viruses with high mutation rates, CHIKV produces populations of genetically diverse genomes within a host. While several known CHIKV mutations influence disease severity in vertebrates and transmission by mosquitoes, the role of intrahost diversity in chikungunya arthritic disease has not been studied. In this study, high-and low-fidelity CHIKV variants, previously characterized by altered in vitro population mutation frequencies, were used to evaluate how intrahost diversity influences clinical disease, CHIKV replication, and antibody neutralization in immunocompetent adult mice inoculated in the rear footpads. Both high-and low-fidelity mutations were hypothesized to attenuate CHIKV arthritic disease, replication, and neutralizing antibody levels compared to wild-type (WT) CHIKV. Unexpectedly, high-fidelity mutants elicited more severe arthritic disease than the WT despite comparable CHIKV replication, whereas a low-fidelity mutant produced attenuated disease and replication. Serum antibody developed against both high-and low-fidelity CHIKV exhibited reduced neutralization of WT CHIKV. Using next-generation sequencing (NGS), the high-fidelity mutations were demonstrated to be genetically stable but produced more genetically diverse populations than WT CHIKV in mice. This enhanced diversification was subsequently reproduced after serial in vitro passage. The NGS results contrast with previously reported population diversities for fidelity variants, which focused mainly on part of the E1 gene, and highlight the need for direct measurements of mutation rates to clarify CHIKV fidelity phenotypes. IMPORTANCE CHIKV is a reemerging global health threat that elicits debilitating arthritis in humans. There are currently no commercially available CHIKV vaccines. Like other RNA viruses, CHIKV has a high mutation rate and is capable of rapid intrahost diversification during an infection. In other RNA viruses, virus population diversity associates with disease progression; however, potential impacts of intrahost viral diversity on CHIKV arthritic disease have not been studied. Using previously characterized CHIKV fidelity variants, we addressed whether CHIKV population diversity influences the severity of arthritis and host antibody response in an arthritic mouse model. Our findings show that CHIKV populations with greater genetic diversity can cause more severe disease and stimulate antibody responses with reduced neutralization of low-diversity virus populations in vitro. The discordant high-fidelity phenotypes in this study highlight the complexity of inferring replication fidelity indirectly from population diversity.","(2). While the severity and chronicity of CHIKV-induced polyarthralgia varies, approximately 25% of affected individuals remain symptomatic for two or more months (3) . Host and viral factors that drive the severity and duration of disease are not well understood, although autoimmunity (4, 5) and antigen persistence (6, 7) have been implicated. For other RNA viruses, including other arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses), genetic diversity of the intrahost viral population has been associated with both disease progression (8) (9) (10) (11) and tissue tropism (12, 13) . However, the role of intrahost CHIKV genetic diversity in chikungunya arthritic disease is unknown.

CHIKV encodes a viral polymerase incapable of proofreading that, coupled with exponential population growth, generates genetically diverse viral populations in hosts (14) . RNA viruses like CHIKV are presumed to converge on a replication fidelity that optimizes either the trade-off between adaptability through genetic diversity and the accumulation of deleterious mutations (14, 15) or between replication speed and replication fidelity (16) (17) (18) . In support of this premise of optimized fidelity, laboratorygenerated fidelity-variant viruses replicating with either increased or decreased mutation rates compared to their wild-type (WT) progenitors typically exhibit reduced fitness and virulence (12, (19) (20) (21) (22) (23) (24) (25) (26) (27) (28) (29) (30) (31) (32) , although counterexamples have been reported. A highfidelity variant of foot-and-mouth-disease virus was reported to exhibit enhanced fitness in vitro (33) , and a low-fidelity variant of Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus exhibited virulence comparable to that of WT virus in mice (34) . Fidelity variant viruses allow for manipulation of intrahost diversity and can be harnessed to study phenotypic effects of intrahost diversity. For CHIKV, point mutations that arose during in vitro mutagen treatment in 2 viral nonstructural genes, nsP2 and nsP4, were shown to confer mutagen resistance and alter mutation frequencies of in vitro CHIKV populations in standard arbovirus cell lines (20, 21, 35) . High-fidelity CHIKV resulted from substitutions in nsP2 G641D and nsP4 C483Y (here termed double mutant high fidelity, or DM HiFi) (35) or nsP4 C483Y alone (high fidelity, or HiFi) (21) , while a low-fidelity phenotype was observed with nsP4 C483G (LoFi) (20) .

Previous studies characterized in vitro growth kinetics and mutation frequencies for fidelity-variant CHIKV (20, 21, 35) . Both DM HiFi (35) and HiFi CHIKV (21) exhibited replication kinetics similar to those of the WT, while LoFi produced higher levels of viral RNA than the WT but similar levels of infectious virions (20) . Mutation frequencies, measured by bacterial cloning methods, of viral populations 24 h postinoculation of hamster cells were reduced for DM HiFi (35) and HiFi (21) and elevated for LoFi (20) relative to the WT, leading to their designation as fidelity variants. CHIKV fidelity variant fitness was also assessed in neonatal C57BL/6 mice, in which HiFi CHIKV generated lower infectious virus levels in the blood and liver than WT CHIKV (21) and LoFi CHIKV generated lower CHIKV RNA levels in muscle, blood, brain, and liver than WT CHIKV (20) . DM HiFi has not been studied in vivo. Despite reversion in mosquitoes, the stability of the LoFi mutation in neonatal mice was not reported (20) . Together, these three studies provide evidence that intrahost CHIKV diversity can affect viral fitness in mice. However, since CHIKV-induced polyarthralgia in adult humans is of great public health relevance, evaluation of fidelity-driven modification of disease in an arthritogenic adult mouse model is needed. Additionally, the role of the genome-wide CHIKV mutant spectrum on infection dynamics and disease severity has yet to be defined; previous studies relied on Sanger sequencing of a portion of the CHIKV genome, which produces a lower breadth and depth of sequencing coverage than next-generation sequencing (NGS) approaches (20) .

In this study, we describe experimental infection of immunocompetent adult mice with fidelity-variant or WT CHIKV to assess the effects of intrahost CHIKV population diversity on arthritic disease and neutralizing antibody production. We used NGS to compare CHIKV populations between fidelity variants and tissues in infected mice. Inoculation of CHIKV in the footpads of adult mice produces localized arthritis and foot swelling, representing the best murine model of human arthritic disease (36) . An immunocompetent adult mouse model also allows for testing neutralizing antibody development, an important protective measure with implications for vaccine develop-ment. The high-fidelity mutations used in this study have been proposed as safety enhancers for CHIKV live-attenuated vaccines (LAV) based on the premise that lower mutability reduces the likelihood of reversion to virulence (37) .

Based on the rationale that WT CHIKV replication fidelity has evolved to maximize viral fitness, we hypothesized that both high-and low-fidelity CHIKV variants would exhibit reduced fitness, in the form of attenuated replication kinetics and restricted tissue tropism, and would elicit milder arthritic disease. Furthermore, we anticipated that both high-and low-fidelity CHIKV would stimulate lower serum-neutralizing antibody titers than the WT in adult mice. Surprisingly, our results show that the high-fidelity CHIKV variants replicate to titers comparable to those of the WT in adult mice and elicit more severe foot swelling, whereas low-fidelity CHIKV exhibits attenuated replication and foot swelling. NGS revealed that high-fidelity CHIKV populations are more diverse than WT populations in mice, an outcome which we then recapitulated by serial in vitro passage. We also found that mouse sera developed against both high-and low-fidelity CHIKV exhibit a diversity-dependent reduction in neutralization of WT CHIKV in vitro. Taken together, our findings suggest that the observed diversity of CHIKV populations depends on the cell or host environment they infect and highlight the complexity of inferring fidelity phenotypes from population diversity.

CHIKV fidelity variant phenotypes are supported in vitro by growth curves and bacterial cloning. The CHIKV fidelity variants (Fig. 1A ) used for this study were generated and characterized previously (20, 21, 35) . We first sought to confirm the established phenotypes in both BHK-21 and C6/36 cells. Both high-fidelity variants replicated to higher titers than the WT (P Ͻ 0.0001 by repeated-measures analysis of variance [ANOVA]), with the greatest differences observed 6 (P Ͻ 0.001 by Dunnett's post hoc test) and 12 (P Ͻ 0.01) h postinfection (hpi) ( Fig. 1B and C) . In both cell types, the specific infectivities (ratio of genome equivalents to PFU) (Fig. 1D) were lower for both high-fidelity variants and higher for LoFi than for the WT (P Ͻ 0.01 by Tukey's post hoc test). Mutation frequencies of each fidelity-variant virus and WT were quantified by bacterial cloning and Sanger sequencing, similar to methods originally used to establish these CHIKV mutants as fidelity variants. In BHK-21 cells, HiFi and DM HiFi CHIKV populations had 10% and 40% lower mutation frequencies, respectively, than the WT, and the LoFi CHIKV population had a 40% higher mutation frequency than the WT (Fig.  1E ). Similar relationships were observed in C6/36 cells, except for the DM HiFi mutant. Because this was unexpected, we measured the mutation frequencies of DM HiFi and the WT in C6/36 cells in 3 additional biological replicates, comprising approximately an additional 168,000 nucleotides (nt) sequenced. Each of the additional analyses showed that DM HiFi generated a lower mutation frequency than parallel WT replicates. A Grubbs' outlier test determined the initial elevated DM HiFi mutation frequency value was an outlier (P Ͻ 0.05), although no methodological differences across replicates explain the outlier. Given that the fidelity genotypes and phenotypes measured here were similar to those previously observed, we proceeded with an infection experiment in adult mice.

High-fidelity, but not low-fidelity, CHIKV elicits more severe foot swelling than WT CHIKV. Adult C57BL/6 mice were inoculated with 10 3 PFU WT or fidelity-variant CHIKV in the rear footpads to test effects of CHIKV fidelity on clinical disease, as determined by rear foot swelling (36, (38) (39) (40) . Mice infected with LoFi CHIKV exhibited significantly less foot swelling than mice infected with the WT ( Fig. 2A) (P Ͻ 0.05 by one-way ANOVA). Conversely, mice infected with either HiFi or DM HiFi exhibited more severe early footpad swelling than the WT at 3 and 4 days postinfection (dpi) (P Ͻ 0.01 by one-way ANOVA). CHIKV HiFi-infected mice also exhibited greater peak disease severity than those infected with the WT 7 dpi (P ϭ 0.003 by one-way ANOVA). We next evaluated the relationship between clinical disease and viremia (Fig. 2B ). Mean viremia titers were significantly reduced in LoFi-infected mice 1 and 3 dpi relative to the WT (P Ͻ 0.0001 by one-way ANOVA). Lower viremia titers were also observed for DM HiFi-infected mice 1 dpi (P Ͻ 0.001 by one-way ANOVA) (Fig. 2B) , despite elevated clinical disease at later time points. Mean viremias 5 and 9 dpi were not different across groups. These results demonstrate that the high-and low-fidelity mutations elicit more and less severe arthritic disease in adult mice, respectively, and the magnitude of peak CHIKV viremia correlates with disease severity.

Tissue CHIKV levels are attenuated in LoFi-but not HiFi-infected adult mice. Infectious CHIKV titers and CHIKV RNA levels in primary target tissues, muscle and ankle, and secondary tissues, brain and liver, were measured to determine whether clinical disease severity was associated with differential viral loads. Similar to viremia kinetics, LoFi CHIKV RNA and infectious virus titers in brain, liver, and muscle were significantly reduced relative to those of the WT 3 dpi (Fig. 3 ) (P Ͻ 0.05 by two-way ANOVA). In contrast, HiFi and DM HiFi CHIKV RNA and infectious virus levels were not different from that of the WT in any tissue (P Ͼ 0.05 by two-way ANOVA). At 9 dpi, low titers (Ͻ10 3 PFU/g) were detected in at least one mouse ankle for all variants, with significantly lower titers in DM HiFi-infected mice than WT-infected mice (P ϭ 0.04 by two-way ANOVA). These results indicate that the low-fidelity mutation reduces CHIKV RNA and infectious virus levels in mice but that the high-fidelity mutations do not.

Intrahost CHIKV mutant spectra vary by individual mouse and tissue. CHIKV populations from inocula and ankles of 3 mice per treatment group were wholegenome sequenced using Illumina NGS, while sequencing of calf muscle isolates was FIG 2 High-fidelity CHIKV produces more severe clinical disease than the WT in adult mice. Adult female C57BL/6J mice were bilaterally inoculated subcutaneously in the rear footpads with 10 3 PFU of either WT CHIKV, HiFi CHIKV, DM HiFi CHIKV, LoFi CHIKV, or virus-free cell culture supernatant (mock). (A) Bilateral foot swelling was measured as percent increase in dorsoplantar diameter of hind feet from day 0 preinoculation. Numbers of feet per group were the following: for CHIKV cohorts 1 to 3 dpi, n ϭ 32; 4 to 9 dpi, n ϭ 20; 10 to 11 dpi, n ϭ 8; for the mock-inoculated group, 1 to 3 dpi, n ϭ 16; 4 to 9 dpi, n ϭ 10; 10 to 11 dpi, n ϭ 4. (B) Adult mouse viremia titers were determined by qRT-PCR of CHIKV RNA in whole blood. Each symbol represents an individual mouse. LOD is the limit of detection. Error bars represent standard deviations. P values for both graphs were calculated by one-way ANOVA. a, P Ͻ 0.05; b, P Ͻ 0.01; c, P Ͻ 0.001; d, P Ͻ 0.0001; all other cases, P Ͼ 0.05. limited to the whole genome for 1 mouse and partial genome for the remaining 2 mice per group. Sequencing from LoFi-infected muscle was not possible due to poor PCR amplification. For all isolates, the mean depth of coverage postprocessing ranged from 1,126 to 2,622 (Table 1 ). Comparing mutant spectra of CHIKV isolates from ankles by specific nucleotide substitution frequencies, the only significant differences from the WT were greater frequencies of AϾC and GϾU substitutions in LoFi CHIKV populations (P Ͻ 0.01 and P Ͻ 0.0001, respectively, by two-way ANOVA with Dunnett's post hoc test) (see Fig. 5B ).

Shared SNPs detected in more than one mouse at Ͼ1% frequency were identified to characterize tissue-and variant-specific mutations ( Table 2 ). Four trends in the tissue distribution of shared SNPs were observed: (i) SNPs present in inocula and in both ankle and muscle, (ii) SNPs present in inocula and the ankle but not muscle, (iii) SNPs detected in only the ankle or muscle, and (iv) SNPs detected in both the ankle and muscle (Fig. 4) . None of the shared SNPs were consensus changes (Ͼ50% frequency). The only SNP restricted to a single CHIKV variant was a revertant SNP at nsP4 483, where the LoFi mutant reverted to WT. By 3 dpi in the ankles of LoFi-infected mice, nsP4 483G mutated to 93% G483C in one mouse, 48% G483C and 43% G483V in the second mouse, and 92% G483C and 6% G483V in the third mouse. Valine at nsP4 483 has been previously reported to confer WT fidelity (20) . In addition to the consensus changes at nsP4 483, four other consensus changes arose de novo in ankles of LoFi-infected mice, but none were detected in any other group of mice. The absence of shared SNPs or consensus changes in HiFi-and DM HiFi-infected tissues suggests that the differences observed in clinical disease and population diversity are unlikely to be the result of particular secondary or compensatory mutations. The four observed distribution patterns show that CHIKV populations are tissue dependent and that SNPs present in inocula can sometimes persist in different tissues.

High-and low-fidelity CHIKV diversify more than the wild type in adult mice. In addition to comparing mutant spectra, we also compared overall population diversity by number of SNPs (Fig. 5A ) and by two proportional diversity metrics, Shannon entropy ( Fig. 5C ) and root mean square deviations (RMSD) (Fig. 5D) . As a metric of virus population genetic variance, RMSD is skewed by high-frequency variants and therefore is useful for comparing high-frequency variants between groups. In contrast, Shannon entropy is maximized at a variant frequency of 0.5 and less biased by variant frequency, so it is better for comparing low-frequency variants between groups. More highfrequency (Ͼ5%) SNPs were detected in ankles of HiFi-, DM HiFi-, and LoFi-infected mice, although the differences were not statistically significant (P Ͼ 0.05 by chi-squared test) (Fig. 5A ). Unexpectedly, HiFi and DM HiFi populations in ankles and muscles were comparably or more diverse than WT populations. In ankles, the diversities of HiFi and DM HiFi populations were significantly elevated relative to that of the WT by Shannon entropy (P Ͻ 0.05 by one-way ANOVA) ( Fig. 5C ) but not RMSD (P Ͼ 0.05 by one-way ANOVA) (Fig. 5D ). Diversity of LoFi populations was significantly higher than that of the WT by RMSD (P Ͻ 0.001 by one-way ANOVA) ( Fig. 5C ) but not Shannon entropy (P Ͼ 0.05 by one-way ANOVA) (Fig. 5D ). In muscle, no differences in population diversities were observed between HiFi and DM HiFi populations relative to the WT by Shannon entropy or RMSD (P Ͼ 0.05 by one-way ANOVA) ( Fig. 5C and D) . The pCHIK and pCHIK-PCR sequencing controls had no SNPs at more than 1% frequency (Fig. 5A ) and low Shannon entropy and RMSD values ( Fig. 5C and D) , indicating that falsepositive mutations derived from library preparation and NGS had minimal effects on the diversity metrics of CHIKV populations. These results show that relative in vitro diversity calculated from mutation frequencies by bacterial cloning and Sanger sequencing does not parallel relative CHIKV population diversities in adult mice, as measured by NGS, or that mutation frequencies detected by these methods change as a function of host environment. High-fidelity CHIKV populations diversify more than the WT, as measured by NGS after single and serial passage in vertebrate cells. Despite corroborating HiFi and DM HiFi as high fidelity in vitro by bacterial cloning, the unexpectedly expanded diversity of HiFi and DM HiFi populations in vivo warranted further investigation. NGS was applied to measure the diversity of CHIKV populations after a single 24-h passage in BHK cells, as was done for bacterial cloning. Mutation frequencies were calculated by NGS across the whole genome and across the same E1 region used for bacterial cloning. We found that the differences in mutation frequencies established by bacterial cloning were not paralleled by our NGS observations (Fig. 6 ). Differences in mutation frequencies measured by NGS between both high-fidelity variants and the WT were not statistically significant (P ϭ 0.48 by one-way ANOVA) (Fig. 6B ). Only small differences were observed between NGS whole-genome and partial E1 mutation frequencies. The discordance in mutation frequencies measured by bacterial cloning and NGS called into question the attribution of these variants as fidelity variants and prompted further examination of mutation frequencies after serial passage in cell culture. We reasoned that 5 serial passages on BHK-21 cells would amplify real differences in population mutation frequencies. Over serial passages, the viral titers did not vary significantly between passages or virus variants (P ϭ 0.95 by two-way ANOVA) (Fig. 7A ). The populations from the first passage (p1) and fifth passage (p5) were sequenced by NGS and compared (Fig. 7B to E). The mean depth of coverage for each sample ranged from 2,084 to 2,645 (Table 3) . Over five passages, WT CHIKV developed more lowfrequency SNPs, while HiFi and DM HiFi developed more high-frequency SNPs (Fig. 7B ). RMSDs at p5 were marginally elevated for HiFi and significantly elevated for DM HiFi (P ϭ 0.0003 by two-way ANOVA with Tukey's post hoc test) (Fig. 7D ). In contrast, Shannon entropy was not significantly different across CHIKV variants at p1 or p5 (Fig.  7C ). The elevation in RMSD and accumulation of high-frequency SNPs in both highfidelity variants relative to WT CHIKV further indicate that HiFi and DM HiFi do not always produce less genetically diverse populations than WT CHIKV. Furthermore, there were no specific nucleotide substitutions in which HiFi and DM HiFi populations had significantly lower frequencies than the WT after p1 or p5 (by two-way ANOVA with Dunnett's post hoc test) (Fig. 8A ). After p1, the only significant difference from the WT was a greater GϾA frequency for DM HiFi (P Ͻ 0.05). After p5, HiFi populations exhibited greater frequencies of AϾG, GϾU, and UϾC substitutions (P Ͻ 0.05, P Ͻ 0.0001, and P Ͻ 0.01), and DM HiFi populations had greater frequencies of CϾA, CϾU, GϾA, GϾU, and UϾC substitutions (P Ͻ 0.0001, P Ͻ 0.01, P Ͻ 0.0001, P Ͻ 0.01, and P Ͻ 0.0001). For p5 populations of HiFi and DM HiFi, a trend of GCϾAU substitutions at a higher frequency than reciprocal AUϾGC substitutions was observed ( Fig. 8A and C). For both HiFi and DM HiFi, the GϾU/UϾG substitution ratios were significantly greater than those for the WT (P Ͻ 0.0001 and P ϭ 0.02, respectively, by two-way ANOVA with Dunnett's post hoc test) (Fig. 8C) , while the differences in GϾA/AϾG and CϾA/AϾC ratios were not statistically significant. To determine if the GCϾAU trend was genome wide, we evaluated the mutant spectra and GCϽϾAU ratios by frequency of mutated sites (Fig. 8B and D) . A mutated site was defined as any nucleotide position with evidence of a substitution regardless of frequency. By mutated site frequency, the observed GCϾAU trend is no longer evident (Fig. 8B) , and the GCϽϾAU ratios of p5 populations are similar between HiFi, DM HiFi, and the WT (P Ͼ 0.05 by two-way ANOVA with Dunnett's post hoc test) (Fig. 8D) . These results indicate that the CHIKV fidelity variants in this study did not show differences in mutation bias after 5 serial BHK-21 cell passages.

Fidelity mutant CHIKV impair serum neutralization of less diverse WT CHIKV in vitro. Since these high-fidelity mutations are being investigated as safety enhancers for CHIKV LAVs in our other projects, we tested the effect of CHIKV fidelity on neutralization of WT CHIKV populations of low and high relative population diversity. Sera from the four mice in each treatment group at 30 dpi were serially diluted and tested for neutralization of passage zero (p0) and p5 WT CHIKV by PRNT. Sera from WT-inoculated mice neutralized low-diversity p0 WT CHIKV inocula better than any of the fidelity- 

Journal of Virology variant sera (P Ͻ 0.01 by one-way ANOVA with Dunnett's multiple-comparison test) (Fig. 9A) . In contrast, no differences in neutralization of high-diversity p5 WT CHIKV were observed between any groups (P ϭ 0.62 by one-way ANOVA) (Fig. 9A ). The RMSD for the low-diversity p0 and high-diversity p5 inocula approximated the minimum and maximum RMSD for WT CHIKV isolated from mouse ankles at 3 dpi (Fig. 9B) . The differential neutralization of low-and high-diversity WT CHIKV by sera from fidelity variant-infected mice suggests that serum antibody developed against more diverse CHIKV populations impairs virus neutralization in a diversity-dependent manner.

This is the first study to address effects of CHIKV fidelity mutations on CHIKVinduced arthritic disease. We demonstrate that HiFi and DM HiFi CHIKV replicate faster in vitro and elicit more severe arthritic disease in adult mice than the WT while generating viral loads in tissues comparable to those of the WT. Furthermore, we show using NGS that HiFi and DM HiFi CHIKV produce populations with greater diversity than the WT in adult mice, and we reproduce this finding in cell culture. These findings contrast with previous studies reporting comparable in vitro replication, reduced mutation frequencies, and attenuated titers of HiFi CHIKV in neonatal mice subcutaneously inoculated in the dorsum (21, 35) . The apparent contradiction of high-fidelity CHIKV in vivo phenotypes between this study and previous work (21) may be explained in part by methodological differences, as we used adult mice instead of neonates and a 4-to 20-fold higher dose of CHIKV, and we inoculated mice subcutaneously in the rear footpads as opposed to the back. Initiating the infection with more virions and closer to primary target tissues in the foot and ankle joints may allow the virus to overcome transit and tissue barriers to establish infection, overwhelm innate immunity, and resist attenuation. For LoFi CHIKV, our demonstration of attenuated replication in adult mice agrees with the previous report of attenuated replication in neonates (20) , suggesting that attenuation of LoFi CHIKV is not host age dependent. Additionally, our observation of genotypic reversion of LoFi to WT in mice, along with the previous report of reversion in mosquitoes (20) , further indicates the strong selective pressure against the nsP4 LoFi mutation.

Our initial measures of mutation frequencies using bacterial cloning of in vitro populations aligned with the expectation of altered diversity based on the fidelity characterizations, but surprisingly, when we employed NGS, the mutation frequencies for HiFi, DM HiFi, and WT CHIKV were not statistically different after one cell culture passage. To clarify this discrepancy, we serially passaged the CHIKV variants in cell culture to amplify differences in population diversity. After 1 passage, decreased diversity was observed in all CHIKV populations relative to their highly diverse inocula, likely due to purifying selection. After 5 passages, HiFi and DM HiFi populations were more diverse than those of the WT. Furthermore, in vivo populations of HiFi and DM HiFi were also found to be more diverse than those of the WT. The increase in diversification of high-fidelity CHIKV populations observed here was counterintuitive but similar to a recent study reporting increased in vitro mutation frequencies in populations of Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus, a related alphavirus, bearing an nsP4 mutation analogous to CHIKV C483Y (HiFi) (34) . When measuring intrahost viral diversity, systematic errors (41) and host antiviral deaminases (42, 43) can alter the observed population diversity. To limit systematic errors, we equalized input titers prior to library preparation, prepared libraries in parallel, included CHIKV DNA plasmid libraries as controls for sequencing and reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) errors, and used a conservative quality filter with overlapping read error correction. The absence of called SNPs and relatively low FIG 8 Serially passaged high-fidelity CHIKV populations exhibit mutational biases in total mutations but not mutated sites. Mutant spectra for WT, HiFi, and DM HiFi CHIKV passaged in BHK-21 cells for five serial passages (p1 to p5).

Error bars in all panels show standard deviations from the geometric means. P values were calculated by two-way ANOVA. a, P Ͻ 0.05; b, P Ͻ 0.01; c, P Ͻ 0.001; d, P Ͻ 0.0001; absence of letter, P Ͼ 0.05. Three replicates were passaged, sequenced, and compared per group. One replicate was sequenced for each inoculum. diversity observed in our plasmid controls indicate that the contribution of falsepositive mutations from library preparation and sequencer error was minimal. To assess the potential contribution of genetic diversification by antiviral host deaminases, we evaluated mutant spectra for evidence of mutational biases. The mutant spectra of in vitro and in vivo CHIKV populations in this study lack evidence of specific mutational biases from APOBEC (CϾU) (43) or ADAR (AϾI) (42) deaminases that could explain the observed differences in population diversity. Instead, the spectra for the in vitro p5 populations exhibit an increased frequency of GCϾAU substitutions for HiFi and DM HiFi CHIKV. Host adaptation via matched virus-host nucleotide bias has been suggested for RNA viruses (44) , including CHIKV (45) . To explore this further, we examined the frequency of GCϾAU substitution at a nucleotide site level across the genome with the expectation that a shift in GCϾAU frequency would result in more G and C nucleotide sites being mutated. Instead, we observed a loss of the GCϾAU trend at the nucleotide site level, indicating there was no genome-wide trend but instead that measures of nucleotide bias were skewed by a few sites with high-frequency GCϾAU substitutions. In both in vitro and in vivo CHIKV populations, we observed a higher frequency of transition nucleotide substitutions than transversion substitutions, aside from GϾU transversions, as expected (46) . The elevated frequency of GϾU transversions may be explained in part by oxidative damage during NGS library preparation (47) . To assess whether GϾU substitutions biased our diversity metrics, we excluded all GϾU substitutions, recalculated the metrics, and found the relationships were maintained (data not shown). From these analyses, we conclude that our observed population diversity measurements are unlikely to have been biased by systematic errors, host deaminases, or differential host adaptation. While host adaptation via matched virus-host nucleotide bias is unlikely, we are unable to rule out other intrahost selective pressures that could have affected the observed CHIKV population diversity.

The initial attribution of fidelity phenotypes to the CHIKV nsP2 and nsP4 mutations relied on comparative analysis of mutation frequencies measured by Sanger sequencing and NGS approaches (20, 21, 35) . The incongruency in population diversity of high-fidelity CHIKV between this and previous studies highlights the difficulty of inferring replication fidelity from population diversity. To better evaluate potential fidelity-modifying effects of these mutations, future studies using cell-based Luria-Delbruck fluctuation tests (48, 49) and cell-free biochemical assays (50-52) are required to directly measure mutation rates. An additional advantage of these assays is the ability to study effects of the cellular or biochem-

Serum neutralization of wild-type CHIKV slightly impaired by fidelity mutation.

Journal of Virology ical environment on fidelity. The type of cell or host has been shown to affect the mutation rate of vesicular stomatitis virus (48) and cucumber mosaic virus (53, 54) and the mutant spectra of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) (55) . Further, the balance or availability of intracellular deoxynucleoside triphosphate (dNTP) pools affects the mutation rate of HIV-1 (56) and spleen necrosis and murine leukemia viruses (57) . In this and previous studies (20, 35) , cell type has been shown to alter mutation frequencies of CHIKV populations; Stapleford et al. specifically demonstrated that HiFi and DM HiFi replication complexes isolated from cell culture can adjust their replication speed to a greater degree than the WT and utilize low-concentration dNTP pools more efficiently. Whether CHIKV fidelity is determined, as suggested for poliovirus and HIV (18, 58) , by the kinetic proofreading model (59) (60) (61) (62) , which proposes a trade-off between replication speed and accuracy such that accuracy decreases as speed increases, has not been studied. Further studies into kinetic proofreading for CHIKV replication complexes and the effects of dNTP availability on the fidelity phenotype for the nsP2 and nsP4 mutations are warranted. While the incongruency in high-fidelity CHIKV population diversity casts uncertainty on the fidelity phenotypes, we clearly demonstrate that the nsP2 G641D and nsP4 C483Y mutations enhance CHIKV virulence in adult mice. For a high-fidelity variant of poliovirus, replication speed was suggested to drive attenuation of virulence more so than increased replicase fidelity (18) . It is possible that faster replication is driving the enhanced virulence observed here in HiFi-and DM HiFi-infected mice. Stapleford et al. previously showed that isolated HiFi and DM HiFi CHIKV replication complexes synthesize CHIKV subgenomic RNA faster than the WT (35) . Here, we demonstrate faster replication of HiFi and DM HiFi CHIKV than of the WT in BHK and C6/36 cells. Furthermore, attenuation of LoFi CHIKV in spite of early reversion to the WT genotype (which we first detected 3 dpi) suggests that robust replication early in infection (Ͻ3 dpi) is essential for maximizing peak viral titers and pathogenesis. In the HiFi-or DM HiFi-infected mice, elevated titers in blood early in the course of infection were not observed, but we are unable to compare early CHIKV replication near the inoculation site, as tissues were not collected prior to reaching peak CHIKV titers at 3 dpi. An alternative explanation for the increased virulence not addressed in this study is that the high-fidelity nsP4 C483Y mutation exerts phenotypic effects beyond altered replication speed or fidelity. Unlike CHIKV nsP2 and nsP3, evidence for extensive interactions of nsP4 with host proteins is limited (63) , although interactions with proteins of the unfolded protein response within the endoplasmic reticulum have been suggested to promote CHIKV replication (64, 65) . Whether nsP4 mutations can modulate the effects of these interactions on viral replication has not been studied. In addition to faster in vitro replication, the high-fidelity CHIKV variants counterintuitively produced populations with greater diversity than did the WT. Although the mechanism driving the enhancement in virulence of HiFi and DM HiFi CHIKV remains unclear, the high-fidelity CHIKV variants produce populations with altered diversity relative to those of the WT, a feature that maintains their utility for evaluating intrahost CHIKV evolution.

Our novel characterization of CHIKV population diversity in different tissues by NGS highlights that intrahost CHIKV evolution can be tissue specific. Eight SNPs shared by at least two mice were restricted to ankle or muscle tissues at 3 dpi, with most (6/8) detected in the ankle. Three of the tissue-restricted SNPs arose de novo, 2 were nonsynonymous mutations in E2, and 1 mutation was detected in the 3= untranslated region (UTR). Phenotypic characterization of these mutations by reverse genetics is warranted to elucidate their fitness effects. These findings emphasize the value in sequencing from multiple tissues to get a full picture of intrahost populations, as well as the importance of performing NGS on virus inocula to discern de novo and preexisting mutations. Our results parallel tissue-specific evolution of poliovirus (66) , indicating that tissue microenvironment as a driver of viral evolution is common across RNA virus families.

Use of an immunocompetent adult mouse model also serves as a platform for understanding how the fidelity mutations alter neutralizing antibody responses. Here, we demonstrate a diversity-dependent reduction in serum neutralization in vitro, in that CHIKV high-fidelity mutants impair serum neutralization of low-diversity WT CHIKV populations but not high-diversity populations of WT CHIKV. This observation suggests that serum neutralization of CHIKV is driven more by the depth than the breadth of the antibody response, although studies of the antibody repertoire would be required to confirm this idea. Additionally, the presence of specific neutralization-susceptible variants in the p5 WT CHIKV populations biasing serum neutralization titers cannot be ruled out, although the lack of consensus mutations in those populations suggests this is unlikely. Studies are ongoing to address whether the diversity-dependent impairment in neutralization observed here will limit the capacity of anti-high-fidelity CHIKV sera to protect against challenge with WT CHIKV in vivo, a better proxy than in vitro neutralization. Although the high-fidelity CHIKV populations accumulated greater genetic diversity in serial cell culture, the genetic stability of the nsP2 and nsP4 high-fidelity mutants in vivo, in contrast to the unstable low-fidelity nsP4 mutation, suggests they lower the risk of reversion for attenuating mutations, as has been proposed in the context of vaccine development (37) .

In summary, we show that the nsP2 and nsP4 high-fidelity mutations induce more severe arthritic disease in adult mice than WT CHIKV while producing more diverse virus populations and serum antibodies less able to neutralize low-diversity inocula in vitro. Furthermore, we demonstrate that intrahost CHIKV evolution can be tissue specific. Importantly, our findings highlight the need for direct measurement of replication fidelity to clarify the fidelity phenotype of the nsP2 and nsP4 mutations under different cellular contexts.

Infectious cDNA clones of WT, HiFi, and LoFi 2005 La Réunion CHIKV outbreak strain (06-049; GenBank accession number AM258994.1), generously provided by Marco Vignuzzi, Institut Pasteur, were previously described (20, 21) . The nsP2 G641D substitution was introduced by site-directed mutagenesis (QuikChange II site-directed mutagenesis kit; Agilent) in the HiFi CHIKV clone with a single point mutation (GGCϾGAC) to generate DM HiFi CHIKV. Genotypic integrity was verified by whole-genome Sanger sequencing for all clones. Infectious CHIKV was rescued from cDNA clones as previously described (15) . For rescued virus stocks and experiments described below, viral RNA and infectious virions were titrated in triplicate by quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) (CHIKV primers 6856, 6981, and 6919-FAM) and Vero plaque assays, respectively, as previously described (67, 68) . Baby hamster kidney cells (BHK-21; ATCC CCL-10) and African green monkey kidney cells (Vero; ATCC CCL-81) were maintained in high-glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM; Gibco, Thermo Fisher Scientific) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Gibco, Thermo Fisher Scientific) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin (P/S; Gibco, Thermo Fisher Scientific) at 37°C and 5% CO 2 . The Aedes albopictus cell line C6/36 (ATCC CRL-1660) was maintained in Schneider's insect medium (Caisson Labs) supplemented with 20% FBS and 1% P/S at 28°C and atmospheric CO 2 .

In vitro growth assays and serial passage. BHK-21 and C6/36 cells were inoculated with rescued stocks (p0) of each CHIKV fidelity variant or WT in triplicate at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1. Cell culture supernatants were harvested (1/20 total volume) and replenished after a 1-h absorption period and 6, 12, and 24 h postinoculation (hpi). To amplify differences in mutation frequencies, the WT and the high-fidelity CHIKV variants were inoculated and passaged 5 times in BHK-21 cells in triplicate at an MOI of 1. After 24 hpi, cell culture supernatant was collected and CHIKV RNA titers were used to estimate the PFU titer based on measured genome/PFU ratios at 24 hpi for each variant in the in vitro growth assay. Passaged CHIKV supernatants were adjusted to an MOI of 1 for subsequent inoculations.

Mutation frequencies by bacterial cloning. Mutation frequencies were measured from CHIKV populations harvested after the first 24-h passage described above. Viral RNA was extracted (Qiagen QiaAMP viral RNA minikit), and a 750-nt region (nt 10019 to 10768) of the E1 envelope gene was amplified by high-fidelity RT-PCR (Agilent Accuscript PfuUltra II RT-PCR kit). Bacterial cloning of E1 amplicon cDNA, Sanger sequencing, and mutation frequency calculations were performed as previously described (21) . At least 80 amplicons, representing Ͼ60,000 nt, were sequenced for each virus from both BHK-21 and C6/36 cells. Since the goal of this step was to validate established genotypes, mutation frequencies were measured by bacterial cloning for one biological replicate per virus in BHK-21 and C6/36 cells, except for WT and DM HiFi in C6/36 cells, where four biological replicates were used.

Mouse infections. All research animals were housed at animal biosafety level 3, and procedures were performed in accordance with University of California (UC) Davis IACUC protocol 19108. Six-week-old female C57BL/6J mice (The Jackson Laboratory) were used in this study. Only female mice were used, since the immunocompetent, adult mouse footpad model was described in female C57BL/6 mice only (36) , and no sex bias in clinical disease or pathology was reported following footpad inoculation of immunodeficient C57BL/6 adult mice (69) . Sixteen mice in each group were bilaterally inoculated subcutaneously in the rear footpads with 10 3 PFU CHIKV per footpad in 10 l of sterile 0.9% NaCl solution. Mock-treated mice were inoculated with virus-free cell culture supernatant diluted in 0.9% NaCl solution. Blinded hind foot height measurements were recorded daily by digital caliper operated by the same person. Blood was collected on 1, 3, 5, 9, and 30 dpi, with 30-dpi blood processed to harvest serum. Mice from each treatment group were euthanized on 3, 9, or 30 dpi, and the brain, liver, calf muscles, and ankle joints were collected. Tissues for virus titration by plaque assay were homogenized and stored at Ϫ80°C. Tissues for NGS and qRT-PCR were immersed in RNAlater (Thermo Fisher Scientific) at 4°C for 1 day prior to homogenization. RNA was extracted by a MagMax-96 viral isolation kit (AM1836; Thermo Fisher Scientific) on a MagMax Express-96 particle processor (Thermo Fisher Scientific).

PRNT. Neutralizing antibody levels from 30 dpi mouse sera were determined by plaque reduction neutralization tests (PRNT) using low-diversity p0 and high-diversity p5 BHK-21 cells with WT CHIKV. Mouse sera were heat inactivated at 56°C for 30 min. Neutralization assays with 2-fold dilutions of mouse sera (1:20 to 1:2,560) were performed using Vero cells as previously described (70) . The reciprocals of the highest dilution of sera that caused Ͼ80% reduction in plaque formation are reported.

Amplicon library preparation and next-generation sequencing. For in vitro serial passage isolates, all replicates were sequenced. For CHIKV from mouse tissues, 3 mice with tissue RNA levels at or near the median for each treatment group were selected for NGS. Target enrichment on equivalent quantities of viral RNA was performed by high-fidelity RT-PCR (Accuscript PfuUltra II) of nine cDNA amplicons spanning the CHIKV 5= to 3= UTRs (Table 4) . For calf muscle, sufficient whole-genome RT-PCR amplification was achieved for just one mouse in the WT, HiFi, and DM HiFi cohorts. For 2 mice in those cohorts, amplification was only achieved with primer set 7, which covered the 26S promoter to the 3= end of the envelope protein 2 gene (E2). Due to poor RT-PCR amplification, NGS was not performed for any LoFi-infected muscle isolates. Amplicons were fragmented with double-stranded DNA fragmentase (New England Biolabs), followed by KAPA pure bead (Kapa Biosystems) size selection targeting a mean length of 150 bp. Library preparations were performed with a NEBNext Ultra DNA library preparation kit and NEBNext multiplex oligonucleotides (New England Biolabs). Libraries generated from CHIKV infectious clone DNA with (pCHIK-PCR) or without (pCHIK) PCR amplification prior to library preparation were incorporated as controls for PCR and sequencing errors. Libraries were sequenced on a single flow cell lane using paired-end 150 Illumina HiSeq 4000 technologies at the UC Davis DNA Technologies Core.

Bioinformatics. Demultiplexed paired-end reads were quality (ϾQ35), adapter, and primer trimmed with Trimmomatic (v0.36) (71) . Overlapping paired-end reads were merged, and mismatched base calls were resolved by highest quality score with FLASH (v1.2.11) (72). Reference-guided alignment was performed with the Burrows Wheeler alignment tool (bwa mem, v0.7.5) (73) . To control for variance in within-genome and between-sample coverage depth, the aligned reads were downsampled with BBTools (v34.48; Joint Genome Institute) to ca. 2,500ϫ coverage. SNPs were called by LoFreq* (v2.1.2) (74) and annotated with SNPdat (v1.0.5) (75) . Shannon entropy was calculated in R (v3.4.3) via the diverse package (76) , while RMSD (77) and specific nucleotide substitution frequencies were calculated via in-house R scripts. A minimum coverage cut-off of 300 was used for all analyses to eliminate bias of low-coverage positions. These NGS and bioinformatics methods capture nucleotide substitutions but are biased against deletions and recombination events.

Statistical analysis. All statistical analyses were performed with GraphPad Prism 7 software (Graph-Pad Software, CA, USA). Statistical significance was ascribed to P values of less than 0.05.

Stability of Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus on Fomite Materials at Different Temperatures,"Indirect transmission of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) ensues when susceptible animals contact PEDV-contaminated fomite materials. Although the survival of PEDV under various pHs and temperatures has been studied, virus stability on different fomite surfaces under varying temperature conditions has not been explored. Hence, we evaluated the survival of PEDV on inanimate objects routinely used on swine farms such as styrofoam, rubber, plastic, coveralls, and other equipment. The titer of infectious PEDV at 4 • C decreased by only 1 to 2 log during the first 5 days, and the virus was recoverable for up to 15 days on Styrofoam, aluminum, Tyvek ® coverall, cloth, and plastic. However, viral titers decreased precipitously when stored at room temperature; no virus was detectable after one day on all materials tested. A more sensitive immunoplaque assay was able to detect virus from Styrofoam, metal, and plastic at 20 days post application, representing a 3-log loss of input virus on fomite materials. Recovery of infectious PEDV from Tyvek ® coverall and rubber was above detection limit at 20 days. Our findings indicate that the type of fomite material and temperatures impact PEDV stability, which is important in understanding the nuances of indirect transmission and epidemiology of PEDV.","Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is an Alphacoronavirus in the family Coronaviridae. This enveloped RNA virus causes highly contagious viral enteritis in swine [1, 2] . The virus was first identified in England in 1971 and then in other European countries [3] . From 1982, PEDV outbreaks were observed in Asian countries including Japan, Korea, Philippines, Vietnam, and China. Until 2009, PEDV strains in Asia were genotypically similar to those in Europe. Since 2010, however, PEDV has caused outbreaks in Asia with severe clinical signs and high mortality in suckling pigs, resulting in heavy economic losses to the pig farmers [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] . In May 2013, a PEDV strain, genetically related to a Chinese strain, was introduced in the US, possibly by importation of contaminated feed or contaminated feed tote bags [8, 9] . The virus spread rapidly across the country causing high mortality in piglets [10] . Over eight million pigs were killed during this outbreak, leading to an estimated loss of 1.8 billion US dollars [11] [12] [13] [14] .

Transmission of PEDV primarily occurs by the fecal-oral route, but indirect transmission can occur when an animal comes in contact with inanimate objects (fomites) contaminated with the feces of PEDV-infected animals. Disease outbreaks primarily occur in early fall and winter, but the rationale for seasonality remains unclear [15] . Previous studies indicate that PEDV is stable at 50 • C and at pH between 7.2 and 10.2 [16] [17] [18] [19] . A recent study found that the virus can survive for up to nine months at the center of manure lagoons [20] . We designed this study to evaluate the survival of PEDV on various fomite surfaces at both room temperature (RT) and 4 • C. Inanimate objects such as rubber boots, gloves, coveralls, and other equipment are routinely used on swine farms and have the potential of being contaminated with manure from PEDV infected animals, thereby helping the indirect mode of virus transmission.

A strain of PEDV (PEDV USA/Colorado/2013; GenBank accession number KF272920) was propagated on Vero 76 cells (ATCC CRL-1587, Manassas, VA, USA) using Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM) supplemented with 0.5 µg/mL TPCK-trypsin (Worthington Biochemical Corporation, Lakewood, NJ, USA) and 0.3% tryptose phosphate broth (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA). The virus was harvested three days post infection (d.p.i.) using one freeze-thaw cycle. After centrifugation at 500× g for 10 min, the supernatant was aliquoted and stored at −80 • C. Virus titration was performed on Vero 76 cells' monolayers contained in 96-well microtiter plates using serial 5-fold dilutions of samples. Virus titer was calculated by the Spearman-Kärber method [21] and expressed as 50% tissue culture infective dose (TCID 50 )/mL.

Circular pieces (approximately 1 cm 2 ) of various fomite materials were cut to fit into individual wells of Costar ® 24-well cell culture plates (Corning Inc., Corning, NY, USA). Materials used were Styrofoam, nitrile gloves, cardboard, aluminum foil, Tyvek ® coveralls, cloth, metal, rubber, and plastic. Cell culture-grown stock virus was applied on each type of material contained in triplicate wells (200 µL of virus containing 2.1 × 10 6 TCID 50 /mL). Virus applied on the bottom of 24-well plate without any fomite material served as control. The applied virus was air dried for 2 h in a biosafety cabinet (BSC). Sets of virus-contaminated fomites were stored at either at room temperature (~25 • C) or at 4 • C. At various times thereafter (0, 1, 2, 5, 10, 15, 20, and 30 days post application), the surviving virus was eluted from each material in 1 mL of 3% beef extract −0.05 M glycine buffer placed in 50 mL centrifuge tubes. After thorough mixing for 20 s on a vortexer (Scientific Industries Inc., Bohemia, NY, USA), the eluate was filtered through a 0.22 µM membrane filters (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) followed by virus titration on Vero cell monolayers. Virus stability on each fomite material was assessed as three independent replicates for all the time points tested. Separate fomite samples were used at every time point, and eluates were processed independently for quantification of infectious virus and viral RNA. To compare the survival of cell culture-adapted virus with that of virus contained in fecal material, a separate experiment was done. Fecal material obtained from PEDV negative pigs was spiked with 200 µL of cell culture propagated PEDV (2.1 × 10 6 TCID 50 /mL). After thorough mixing, contaminated fecal matter was applied in 200 µL amounts on fomite materials in triplicate. Virus was eluted and titrated as described above for cell culture derived virus.

Stability of viral RNA on fomites was also tested by real-time RT-PCR. Briefly, RNA was extracted from the eluates using MagMAX™ 96 Viral RNA isolation kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Primer pair was designed to amplify a portion of the PEDV S gene with the following sequences: Forward 1910: ACGTCCCTTTACTTTCAATTCACA and Reverse 2012: TATACTTGGTACACACATCCAGAGTCA. PCR amplification was quantified using a FAM labeled probe 1939: FAM-TGAGTTGATTACTGGCACGCCTAAACCAC-BHQ. The primer and probe were added to AgPath-ID™ One-Step RT-PCR reagents (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) along with 5 µL of extracted total RNA followed by amplification with 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR System (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) using the following conditions: reverse transcription at 48 • C for 10 min; denaturation at 95 • C for 10 min; 40 cycles of denaturation at 95 • C for 15 s; and annealing at 60 • C for 45 s.

Immunoplaque assays were performed monolayers of Vero cells contained in 24-well tissue culture plates. Duplicate wells were infected with 200 µL of 10-fold serially diluted sample eluate or stock PEDV (positive control). Plates were incubated for 1 h at 37 • C, and the inoculum was removed and replaced with infection medium with or without 1% agarose. At 24 h post infection (without agarose overlay) or 72 h post infection (with agarose overlay), the medium was removed from the wells and the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at 4 • C. All subsequent washes and incubations were done in PBS, containing 5% normal goat serum and 0.3% triton X-100. After three washes and blocking for an hour in buffer, plates were incubated overnight at 4 • C with one of the following primary antibodies: (i) mouse monoclonal antibody for PEDV spike protein (diluted 1:500; Clone 3F12, Median Diagnostics, Chuncheon, Korea); or (ii) mouse monoclonal antibody for PEDV spike protein (diluted 1:500; Clone S1D12, VMRD, Pullman, WA, USA). Wells were then washed three times with wash buffer and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with alkaline phosphatase conjugated anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody (diluted 1:200; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). After three washes in buffer, plates were incubated for approximately 20 min with 1-Step™ NBT/BCIP substrate solution (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Immunostained cells were observed under a light microscope (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan).

Results are presented as mean ± SEM of the three independent replicates of commonly used fomite materials on a farm. Virus sample eluted from each fomite replicate was processed independently by TCID 50 assay, immunoplaque assay, and real-time quantitative RT-PCR. An ANOVA was used to determine statistical significance between data sets using GraphPad Prism 7 software (Graphpad Software Inc., San Diego, CA, USA).

Infectious PEDV was recovered from fomite materials for up to 15 days post application at 4 • C; only 1 to 2 logs of virus were inactivated during the first 5 days post application ( Figure 1 ). Varying levels of virus loss were observed in different fomite materials used. After 10 days at 4 • C, rubber, nitrile gloves, and metal showed residual virus at or below the detection limit of the assay (≤2 × 10 2 TCID 50 /mL), while all other materials tested had ≥10 3 TCID 50 /mL of residual virus. Infectious PEDV was recovered after 15 days at 4 • C on Styrofoam, aluminum foil, Tyvek ® coverall, cloth, and plastic, with titers between 10 2 to 10 3 TCID 50 /mL. However, virus recovery from nitrile gloves, cardboard, metal, and rubber was below the detection limit of the assay (2 × 10 2 TCID 50 /mL) after 15 days at 4 • C.

On the other hand, PEDV survival decreased precipitously at room temperature within 1 to 2-days post application, losing 2 to 4 log titers within 24 h (Figure 1 ).

Infectious PEDV was not recovered from any fomite material after 2 days at RT. Virus recovery from surfaces of Styrofoam, nitrile gloves, aluminum foil, Tyvek ® coverall, metal, rubber, plastic, cardboard, and cloth showed no significant differences between the materials at RT, suggesting that storage temperature had a substantial influence on virus survival.

Virus survival on nine fomites at room temperature (RT) and at 4 °C. PEDV was applied on fomite materials or in control wells followed by storage at RT (▲) or at 4 °C (■). The surviving virus was eluted after various time periods and titrated. Decay of infectious virus was rapid at RT but delayed when stored at 4 °C. Black dotted line represents detection limit of TCID50 assay, which is 2 × 10 2 TCID50/mL. Data presented are average of three values (± SEM) obtained from independent assessments at each time point indicated.

We used a highly sensitive immunodetection method to identify PEDV positive plaques on Vero cells. The lower limit of detection by this method is 24 focus forming units (FFU)/mL. Positive plaques stain purple after immunostaining with an antibody to PEDV spike protein, followed by NBT/BCIP substrate ( Figure 2 ). This assay was performed at 24 h p.i. without using an agarose overlay, because the results obtained with or without agarose were similar.

Using the immunoplaque assay, we re-tested virus stability on certain fomite materials after 20 days of storage at 4 °C. Varying levels of viable PEDV were detected ( Figure 3 ). Titers of approximately 1 × 10 3 FFU/mL were observed in eluates from Styrofoam, metal, and plastic, representing a 3-log virus inactivation after 20 days. The surviving virus on Tyvek ® coverall and rubber surfaces was moderately above detection limit (24 FFU/mL). In contrast, no plaques were detected from fomite materials stored at RT for 48 h post application (data not shown).

The surviving virus on Tyvek ® coverall and rubber surfaces was moderately above detection limit (24 FFU/mL). In contrast, no plaques were detected from fomite materials stored at RT for 48 h post application (data not shown). To determine the amount of viral RNA remaining on fomites under different storage conditions, eluates were tested by quantitative RT-PCR. Viral RNA was detected after 2 days at RT and 20 days at 4 • C, although no infectious virus was detected at RT after 2 days ( Figure 4A ). In fact, all materials tested had cycle threshold (Ct) values similar to those of input virus (~16-17), with the exception of eluates from cardboard that showed a Ct value of 21 (Table 1) . Quantifiable viral RNA was detected in Styrofoam, Tyvek, and cardboard materials, although infectious PEDV titer decreased by 3 to 4 logs at 4 • C after 20 days. In fecal material spiked with cell culture grown virus, no infectious virus was detected by either TCID 50 or immunoplaque assay. In fact, eluates from fecal samples induced remarkable cell toxicity, making the infectious virus assays difficult to interpret. However, viral RNA was detected in these samples after 2 days at RT and 20 days at 4 • C; the RNA levels were similar to those of input virus indicating no significant changes in viral genome levels in feces ( Figure 4B and Table 1 ). To determine the amount of viral RNA remaining on fomites under different storage conditions, eluates were tested by quantitative RT-PCR. Viral RNA was detected after 2 days at RT and 20 days at 4 °C, although no infectious virus was detected at RT after 2 days ( Figure 4A ). In fact, all materials tested had cycle threshold (Ct) values similar to those of input virus (~16-17), with the exception of eluates from cardboard that showed a Ct value of 21 (Table 1) .

However, viral RNA was detected in these samples after 2 days at RT and 20 days at 4 °C; the RNA levels were similar to those of input virus indicating no significant changes in viral genome levels in feces ( Figure 4B and Table 1 ). 

Our study demonstrates that cell culture-grown PEDV remains viable for extended periods when dried and maintained in a cold environment. The virus remained viable at 4 • C for up to 20-days on Styrofoam, metal, and plastic, although viral titers decreased by 3 logs in 20 days. When stored at RT, PEDV decreased by 4 to 5 logs within 48 h, rendering it undetectable using infectious virus assays. This observation suggests that the storage temperature of the fomite material has a major impact on virus stability. It appears that low storage temperature delays virus degradation on fomite material. Generally, enveloped viruses are more vulnerable to environmental conditions [22] . However, PEDV was found to have higher stability when stored in spray dried bovine plasma, being stable for up to 3 weeks at 4 • C, 2 weeks at 12 • C, and 1 week at 22 • C [18] . In addition, other coronaviruses, like transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), were also found to be more stable at 4 • C, surviving for as long as 28 days at 4 • C and up to 5 days at RT [23] . We demonstrated in this study that the infectious virus decay rate on all fomites increased rapidly at RT. This temperature-sensitive feature of PEDV may be applied to routine procedures in the farms to help eradicate PEDV in the environment and prevent transmission via fomites [16, 24, 25] .

The type of fomite material also has implications on viral stability. For example, the survival of PRRSV (porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus) differed in different types of materials including solid, porous, and liquid substances [26] . We found that infectious PEDV survived at 4 • C on Styrofoam, metal, and plastic, retaining 3 logs of infectious virus (from~10 6 FFU/mL) at 20 days. The rate of loss in infectivity was uniform on Styrofoam, aluminum, plastic, and Tyvek ® coverall, whereas viral infectivity on metal, nitrile gloves, and rubber dropped rapidly after 5 days at 4 • C. Furthermore, at 0 days post application (i.e., post 2 h of air drying), there was decreased virus recovery from cardboard and cloth, indicating that the composition of the fomite and the porosity of the PEDV-contaminated materials may influence virus survival.

Our results are consistent with previous studies on virus survival on glass, stainless steel, and plastic for up to 10 days [26, 27] . Specifically, Styrofoam, metal, and plastic provided extensive PEDV stability. Feed totes made of polypropylene (commonly used in plastic material) allowed PEDV survival for 10 weeks [9] . In addition to storage temperature, porosity of fomite may also influence virus survival and hence virus transmission. Our data suggest that long-term persistence of PEDV on contaminated surfaces could have an epidemiological impact on disease outbreaks, given that >200 infectious virus units were recovered after 20 days at 4 • C on fomite material and that an infectious dose as low as 56 TCID 50 units infects 100% of animals [28] .

PEDV transmission appears to be relatively effective via transportation vehicles [29, 30] and feed [18, 20, 31, 32] . Our data showed that PEDV can survive on metal for up to 20 days at 4 • C, which may play a significant role in promoting the spread of PEDV. The longer survival of the virus at cold temperatures may also explain the increase in outbreaks during the winter season [15] . Furthermore, enveloped viruses generally survive better in the presence of organic material [33] . In fact, a large amount of lagoon manure possibly contributes to increased survivability of PEDV, in which the virus can remain infective for up to nine months after being shed by pigs [20] .

In this study, viral RNA copy numbers did not correlate with the cell-based assays. It is possible that PEDV infectivity is destroyed by factors that affect the integrity of the viral envelope without affecting RNA degradation at RT. In a recent study, it was shown that PEDV viral RNA steadily degrades over time at temperatures above 37 • C in cell culture medium, but the rapid decline of viral RNA that is detected by PCR occurs only at temperatures higher than 60 • C [34] . Although viral RNA degradation was not assessed in the present study, it is clear that the detection of the viral genome does not affect the infectious nature of the sample.

Besides temperature, the stability of PEDV on fomite is also dependent on presence or absence of other organic material and pH. Although we used both cell culture propagated PEDV and PEDV spiked fecal material on fomites to mimic actual situation in the field, we were unable to determine the survival of the virus in PEDV-spiked fecal material, since the eluates from fomites with feces were not suitable for infectious virus titer due to the cytotoxic effect of the fecal content.

In conclusion, our findings provide a new perspective on how fomite material and temperature impact viral stability over time, indicating the significance of understanding the nuances of indirect transmission in the epidemiology of PEDV.

Vaccination of influenza a virus decreases transmission rates in pigs,"Limited information is available on the transmission and spread of influenza virus in pig populations with differing immune statuses. In this study we assessed differences in transmission patterns and quantified the spread of a triple reassortant H1N1 influenza virus in naïve and vaccinated pig populations by estimating the reproduction ratio (R) of infection (i.e. the number of secondary infections caused by an infectious individual) using a deterministic Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR) model, fitted on experimental data. One hundred and ten pigs were distributed in ten isolated rooms as follows: (i) non-vaccinated (NV), (ii) vaccinated with a heterologous vaccine (HE), and (iii) vaccinated with a homologous inactivated vaccine (HO). The study was run with multiple replicates and for each replicate, an infected non-vaccinated pig was placed with 10 contact pigs for two weeks and transmission of influenza evaluated daily by analyzing individual nasal swabs by RT-PCR. A statistically significant difference between R estimates was observed between vaccinated and non-vaccinated pigs (p < 0.05). A statistically significant reduction in transmission was observed in the vaccinated groups where R (95%CI) was 1 (0.39-2.09) and 0 for the HE and the HO groups respectively, compared to an R o value of 10.66 (6.57-16.46) in NV pigs (p < 0.05). Transmission in the HE group was delayed and variable when compared to the NV group and transmission could not be detected in the HO group. Results from this study indicate that influenza vaccines can be used to decrease susceptibility to influenza infection and decrease influenza transmission.","Influenza in pigs is a highly contagious viral disease of the respiratory tract. Influenza is currently endemic in most swine populations around the world, and the virus tends to spread easily in susceptible populations [1] [2] [3] . Many factors contribute to the severity of the disease including age, viral strain, concurrent infections, and immune status of the animals [3] [4] [5] .

With the detection of new influenza subtypes in the last decade (i.e. H1N1, H1N2 and H3N2 triple reassortant viruses) [6] [7] [8] in pigs and the recent appearance of the 2009 pandemic H1N1, both human and animal health officials have paid greater attention to flu in pigs due to the role that pigs play in inter-species transmission [9] . The control of influenza in pigs is often accomplished by the use of vaccines [10] . Both inactivated licensed commercial vaccines and autogenous licensed inactivated vaccines are commonly used in pigs. Commercial vaccines confer protection against flu infection and disease presentation but often this protection is only partial [11] [12] [13] . Commercial vaccines usually include one or more isolates representative of the strains in a region but they may not always confer protection against the isolate infecting a specific farm or population. On the other hand, autogenous vaccines may be prepared with the isolate or isolates recovered from a specific production system and restricted to use in only that system. These vaccines have gained popularity in the US in the past few years. Although vaccination can result in the reduction of clinical signs and virus shedding, limited information is available on the effect that vaccination has on population susceptibility, the spread of infection and how vaccination may prevent transmission to other species [14] .

Transmission experiments and mathematical models have been used to quantify vaccine-induced reduction in the spread of Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae, pseudorabies virus, classical swine fever, Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV), foot and mouth disease (FMDV), porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), hepatitis E virus, and porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV-2) in pigs [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] . In order to quantify transmission of a pathogen, a key parameter is the reproduction ratio (R) of the infection which is defined as the average number of secondary cases caused by an infectious individual in a population during its entire infectious period [24, 25] . When R is greater than 1, an infection can spread in a population but if R is less than 1, the infection will die out within a population. The estimation of R can provide important information about the potential for transmission of infection, the dynamics of infection at the population level, and the impact of disease control strategies [15, 26, 27] .

The reproduction ratio has been assessed for influenza A virus in humans, birds, and horses [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] , but R has not been reported for influenza virus A in pigs. In this study, a deterministic SIR model (Susceptible-Infected-Recovered/Removed) was used to compare transmission parameters between a non-vaccinated population and vaccinated populations of pigs following the introduction of a non-vaccinated, infected pig with a triple reassortant H1N1 influenza A virus. The introduction of infected pigs into populations is one of the primary modes of influenza virus transmission in field settings and this study mimics a similar scenario. Specifically we aimed at assessing the effect of vaccination on pig susceptibility to infection. Since different vaccines containing inactivated viruses that were either homologous or heterologous to the challenge virus were used in this study, an additional comparison could be made between vaccine types. Results from this study provide relevant information on the use of vaccination to control influenza transmission, and highlight the implications of partial protection may have in transmission dynamics and risk of infection.

One hundred and ten, three-week-old cross-bred pigs from a specific-pathogen-free (SPF) herd were obtained. Pigs were free of infection with influenza virus, PRRS virus, and M. hyopneumoniae. The sows had not been vaccinated against influenza virus and all piglets were screened at the herd of origin for influenza antibodies using hemagglutination inhibition (HI) test and influenza A Multiscreen enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA, IDEXX FlockChek™ AI MultiS-Screen Ab Test Kit, IDEXX Lab., Westbrook, ME, USA) prior to the start of the study.

Pigs were randomly distributed into ten groups of eleven pigs each and placed in separate isolation rooms located at the University of Minnesota Animal Research Facility (St Paul, MN, USA). Pigs were assigned to 3 different treatment groups as follows: (i) non-vaccinated control (NV); (ii) vaccinated with a commercially licensed, heterologous vaccine (HE); and (iii) vaccinated with an experimental, homologous vaccine (HO). There were 3 replicates for the NV and the HO treatments and 4 replicates for the HE treatment. Space allowance was 6.3 square feet per pig (0.58 m 2 ) and the pigs were fed on the floor ad libitum and with free access to water. Pigs were cared for according to University of Minnesota IACUC protocol number 0908A71965.

Nasal swabs and blood samples were collected from all pigs upon arrival to the research facility and tested by real time reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR), and for antibodies by HI and influenza A Multiscreen ELISA. Pigs were also injected once with an antibiotic per label instructions in order to reduce bacterial contaminants prior to the start of the study (Ceftiofur crystalline free acid, 5.0 mg/kg body weight Excede ® , Pfizer Animal Health, NY, USA).

Twenty-four hours post arrival all pigs were vaccinated according to their treatment group. Pigs in the HE group received 2 mL intramuscularly (IM) of a commercial licensed influenza vaccine (FluSure XP ® , Pfizer Animal Health, New York, USA). Pigs in the HO group were similarly vaccinated with a homologous, inactivated vaccine containing the same viral isolate as the challenge virus. Each vaccination was repeated two weeks later. The pigs in the NV group were injected with 2 mL of sterile saline solution IM in the neck at 2 weeks interval. In each room 1 of the 11 pigs (designated ""seeder"") was left unvaccinated to be intratracheally and intranasally challenged with influenza and serve as a source of infection for the other pigs in the group.

Thirteen days after the second vaccination, nasal swabs and blood samples were taken from all pigs, and the seeder pigs were moved to a separate room for challenge. At 48 h post challenge, the seeder pigs were placed back to each room in contact with their original pen mates (1 seeder pig/group/replicate) until the termination of the study. To determine transmission, all pigs were sampled daily by taking nasal swabs and observed daily for presence of clinical signs consistent with influenza. The transmission experiment ended at 14 days post contact (dpc) or when all 10 contact pigs in a room became influenza virus positive. At that point, pigs were humanely euthanized with an intravenous lethal dose of pentobarbital at the prescribed amount of 100 mg/kg (Fatal-Plus Solution ® , 250 mL, Vortech Pharmaceuticals, Dearborn, MI, USA).

A triple reassortant H1N1 strain A/Sw/IA/00239/04 (IA04) belonging to the β cluster used in previous studies [34] [35] [36] and isolated from field samples at the University of Minnesota Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory was used for challenge. The IA04 influenza virus was grown in bulk quantities using Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells using standard procedures [37] .

For preparation of the homologous vaccine, the same virus IA04 was adjusted to an HA titer of 1:128/0.1 mL at the time of inactivation by the addition of formalin at a final concentration of 0.1%. The formalized virus was mixed with an adjuvant mixture of mineral oil (9 parts) and emulsifier (1 part; equal volumes of Span 85 and Tween 85) in a 1:1 ratio and sonicated at 25W for 2-3 min.

The heterologous vaccine contained three distinct inactivated influenza isolates and an adjuvant: A/Swine/ NorthCarolina/031/05 (H1N1), A/Swine/Missouri/069/ 05 (H3N2), and A/Swine/Iowa/110600/00 (H1N1). The H1N1 vaccine strains belonged to the γ and δ groups and were genetically distinct from the challenge strain. A/Swine/Iowa/110600/00 (γ) and A/Swine/North Carolina/031/05 (δ) shared 92.2% and 66.8% HA nucleotide similarity respectively, with IA04 (Mega 4 with Clustal W alignment, Nucleotide Kimura's). Serologic crossreactivity existed between the licensed vaccine strains and challenge strain but was variable [35] .

Seeder pigs were infected intratracheally and intranasally with a total of 2 mL of the IA04 H1N1 challenge virus at a titer of 1 × 10 6 tissue culture infectious dose (TCID)50/mL. Before the inoculation, all piglets were sedated by an intramuscular injection of a dissociative anesthetic at the recommended dose of 6.6 mg/kg (Telazol ® , Fort Dodge Animal Health, Fort Dodge, IA, USA).

Success of inoculation in the seeder pigs was confirmed by positive influenza A RT-PCR from nasal swabs at 24 h and at 48 h post inoculation. Viral isolation and titration was conducted from nasal swabs at 48 h post inoculation.

Researchers conducting the experimental infection wore N-95 respirator masks, protective glasses and gloves when performing this procedure and throughout the entire study when they were accessing the pigs.

Each transmission experiment consisted of ten susceptible (contacts) and one infectious pig (seeder) per group. The initial infectious seeder pig in all groups was unvaccinated and challenged intratracheally and intranasally with an H1N1 influenza virus. A pig was considered infected and infectious when the virus could be detected by RT-PCR from nasal swabs. Transmission experiments ended at 14 dpc with the seeder pig, or when all the contact pigs in a replicate became infected.

Nasal swabs were collected daily from individual pigs using rayon-tipped swab applicators with Stuart's medium (BBL CultureSwab™ liquid, Stuart single plastic applicator/Becton, Dickinson and Com., Sparks, Maryland 21152, USA). After sample collection, each nasal swab was suspended in 2 mL of minimum essential medium (MEM, Mediatech Inc., Manassas, VA, USA) supplemented with 4% bovine serum albumin (BSA, Sigma-Aldrich Co., St. Louis, MO, USA) prior to processing for RT-PCR. The viral RNA was extracted using the magnetic particle processor procedure (MagMAX™ Viral RNA Isolation Kit, Applied Biosystems, USA) and subsequently tested using the procedure provided by the USDA-NVSL for detection of influenza A virus Matrix gene by RT-PCR [38] . The minimum detection limit of influenza virus by this method is 10 1 TCID 50 /mL.

Virus isolation and titration was performed only from the nasal swabs collected from the seeder pigs prior to commingling, and from tissues at necropsy on MDCK cell monolayers [37] . Supernatants showing cytopathic effect (CPE) were titrated using ten-fold serial dilution and expressed as a log 10 TCID 50 /mL calculated by the Spearman-Kärber method [39] .

Blood samples were collected using venipucture of the jugular vein. After collection serum was separated and stored at -20°C. Sera were subsequently analyzed for the detection of influenza virus antibodies by HI and influenza A Multiscreen ELISA. HI tests were performed following standard procedures [40] . Samples were tested by HI against the challenge strain (IA04), the licensed commercial vaccine isolates γ and δ (A/Sw/IA/110600/ 00 and A/Sw/NC/031/2005, respectively), and H3N2 (A/ Sw/MO/069/2005 H3N2) at arrival, thirteen days after the second vaccine, and at necropsy. Additionally, all sera were tested using the Influenza A Multiscreen ELISA following manufacturer's protocols. The Influenza A Multiscreen ELISA measures antibodies directed against the nucleoprotein (NP) of influenza A viruses.

At necropsy, lung affected by pneumonia was recorded for each pig. Lesions were photographed, sketched on a standard diagram, and the proportion of affected lung assessed [41] . In addition, tissues from lung lobes of each animal were collected for viral detection by RT-PCR.

For histopathology, the tissues were fixed in 10% buffered formalin and paraffin-embedded by standard techniques. Tissue sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin and examined microscopically for histopathologic changes. Lung sections were examined for bronchiolar epithelial changes, and peribronchiolar and alveolar inflammation. Lung sections were given a score from 0-3 to reflect the severity of bronchial epithelial injury based on previously described methods [42] . The lung sections were scored according to the following criteria: 0, no significant lesions; 1, a few airways affected with bronchiolar epithelial damage and light peribronchiolar lymphocytic cuffing often accompanied by mild focal interstitial pneumonia; 1.5, more than a few airways affected (up to 25%) often with mild focal interstitial pneumonia; 2, 50% airways affected often with interstitial pneumonia; 2.5, approximately 75% airways affected, usually with significant interstitial pneumonia; 3, greater than 75% airways affected, usually with interstitial pneumonia. Additionally, the proportion of airways affected in ten microscopic fields at 20 X magnification was also recorded. A single pathologist examined all slides and was blinded to the treatment groups.

Clinical signs consistent with influenza were recorded from day 1 to day 4 post arrival, during the 3 days after the second vaccination, and daily from 0 dpc to the end of experiment (14 dpc). Clinical signs of cough, dyspnea, sneezing, nasal discharge and lethargy were recorded for a period of 10 min/observation day in each room. Rectal temperatures were recorded daily from 1 day prior to commingling until necropsy. Temperatures ≥ 40°C were considered a significant febrile response.

Results from clinical signs, antibody titers, and lung lesions were combined for each treatment group, resulting in 30 contact pigs in the control and homologous groups, and 40 contact pigs in the heterologous group. The seeder pig in each replicate was excluded from these analyses.

To compare antibody responses before exposure and at necropsy, log-transformed results (HI antibody titers) and influenza A Multiscreen ELISA mean values were analyzed using a paired t-test and results were considered statistically significant at p < 0.05. Clinical signs were evaluated as a binomial response (0 = absence/1 = presence) by a Fisher's exact test and by a Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) approach [43] . Presence or absence of each clinical sign for each pig on a daily basis was scored as 1 or 0 respectively, and analyzed as repeated measures for categorical data and clustered responses in each group. Clinical signs were compared between all pigs in the HE and NV groups via an odds ratio.

Means and standard deviations from macroscopic and microscopic lung lesion scores were analyzed using ANOVA. The response variables that had a statistically significant effect (p ≤ 0.05) by treatment group were further analyzed through pair-wise comparisons using the Tukey-Kramer test. The analyses were performed using SAS (SAS System, SAS Inst., Cary, North Carolina, v 9.2).

The cumulative percentage of contact pigs infected per day in each group was compared by Kaplan-Meier survival curves and log-Rank test using SAS and R (SAS System, SAS Inst., Cary, North Carolina, v 9.2 and R Development Core Team (2009), R: A language and environment for statistical computing. R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria). Differences between curves were further evaluated by pair wise comparison using the Tukey-Kramer test. Pigs remaining influenza PCR negative at the end of the study were censored.

The survival curves were also used to calculate the infectious period. The infectious period was defined as the time between the first and the last day that virus could be detected from nasal swabs in a pig. Differences in the infectious period and the average number of days between contact exposure and the first pig detected positive were calculated using the log-Rank test with significant differences considered at p value < 0.05.

The infection status of susceptible (S), infectious (I), and recovered/removed (r), was determined on a daily basis for all pigs. Transition of pigs from the S state to I state, and from I state to r state was described by a deterministic SIR model [44] . For each time interval Δt (the interval between two consecutive samplings (i.e. one day)), a pig was considered I if influenza virus was detected by RT-PCR on nasal swabs, and it was considered S if influenza virus was not detected positive by RT-PCR. When transmission occurred in a pen, S pigs decreased by one (S-1) whereas the number of I pigs increased by one (I+1). The transition from S to I occurs according to the probability given by γ = β S (t) I (t) Δt, with the infection or transmission parameter β denoting the rate at which a randomly chosen animal had infectious contacts in the interval Δt.

To estimate the transmission parameter β, a generalized linear model (GLM) with a complementary log-log link function and log I Δt/N as the offset variable (number of infectious pigs/total number of pigs) was used to calculate the estimates of the transmission parameter β by day (Δt = 1) [45] . Knowing the number of susceptible contact pigs and the number of infectious pigs at the start of each period Δt (S t-1 , I t-1 ), the number of new infections that appeared at the end of each period (C t ), and the total number of animals in each period (N), the probability that a pig became infected was 1-e -IβΔt/N and the number of animals infected during each time period was E(C)= S(1-e -IβΔt/N ) [18] . The logistic regression model cannot provide a direct estimate of the transmission rate β, but with an alternative transformation known as the complementary loglog we calculated β from the equation log [-log (1-E(C)/ S)] = log (β) + log (IΔt/N). This model is similar to the linear model as follows: log [-log (1-E(C)/S)] = βo + β 1 X where the intercept coefficient βo = log (β), with corresponding β 1 = 1 including the predictor X = log (IΔt/N) as a fixed offset. With the transformation of log (β), the transmission parameter β could be estimated. The model entails some assumptions: (i) all susceptible animals are equally susceptible; (ii) all infected animals are equally infectious; (iii) each infected pig poses an independent risk of infection to each susceptible pig. Differences between β values were compared using chi-square comparisons and differences were considered statistically significant at p < 0.05.

Using the daily transmission rate β and the infectious period of the contact infected pigs, the reproduction ratio R of the infection was calculated for each replicate in each group, as well as the overall R for each group of treatment after the replicates were combined. Statistically significant differences between R estimates were based on the existence of non-overlapping 95% confidence intervals (C.I.'s). If a pig died during the study, it was considered censored and N became N-1. All analyses were carried out in SAS (SAS System, SAS Inst., Cary, North Carolina, v 9.2).

In our study the GLM method was used because the NV group had zero susceptible animals when the infection process ended, and in that situation the effect of vaccination only can be tested by GLM analysis [25] . In addition, the GLM method can be used to analyze data of heterogeneous populations as is the case of our study since contact animals were vaccinated and inoculated animals were not.

A stochastic SIR model was developed using the transmission and recovery parameters obtained from the previously described deterministic model and experimental study (parameters listed in Table 1 ). For all stochastic models, the initial number of infectious, susceptible, and recovered pigs was 1, 10, and 0, similar to that of the experimental study. In the stochastic models two events could occur, transmission (S I) and recovery (I R) within the SIR model (S I R). The transmission rate (β) was obtained from the deterministic model and the recovery rate (γ) was obtained from the experimental study (the inverse of the infectious period). The rate at which transmission occurred was βSI and the rate at which recovery occurred was γI. Each replicate for which transmission occurred in the experimental study was modeled separately with 10 000 simulations using the parameters obtained from the experimental deterministic model. Each simulation was run until the infectious process ended and a final size of the outbreak could be assessed. The number of new cases (contact infected susceptible individuals) observed for each simulation, given the parameters listed in Table 1 , was assessed for each replicate with the initial number of infectious, susceptible, and recovered individuals at 1, 10, and 0, respectively. The proportion and cumulative proportion of 10 000 simulations by the number of new cases for each replicate was displayed in graph format. The direct method of Gillespie was used to model the random events of transmission and recovery [46] .

Pigs were both antibody and influenza virus negative at the start of the study. Table 2 shows the levels of HI antibody titers against the 4 selected flu strains prior to exposure to the seeder pigs and at necropsy. Two weeks after the second vaccination, the homologous vaccine induced robust HI titers against the challenge strain (IA04), but mean reciprocal titers in the HE group were below 1:20. In contrast, the HE group had reciprocal titers above 1:160 against the H1N1 and the H3N2 strains contained in the vaccine (IA00, NC05 and MO05), while the mean reciprocal titers in the HO group were below 1:40. At the end of the experiment, HI titers against the challenge virus remained at about the same levels in the HO group, and although a statistically significant increase in mean titers in the HE group was observed (p < 0.05), they still remained below 1:40. In the NV group, all pigs were seronegative (1< 10) before contact and at necropsy, and the lack of seroconversion at necropsy was most likely due to the limited time between infection and necropsy (less than 7 days) [36, 47] .

Mean influenza A Multiscreen ELISA s/n values (± SD) of the contact pigs two days prior to exposure to the seeder pigs were 0.874 ± 0.06 in the NV group, 0.538 ± 0.23 in the HE group, and 0.15 ± 0.05 in the HO group (cut-off: positive < 0.673, negative > 0.673) [48] . At necropsy, the mean s/n responses were 0.576 ± 0.26, 0.351 ± 0.26 and 0.162 ± 0.05 for the NV, the HE and the HO groups respectively. Differences between paired samples in both the NV and the HE groups before contact and at necropsy were statistically significant (p < 0.05), (Figure 1 ).

All seeder pigs were RT-PCR positive at 48 h post inoculation and prior to comingling with the contact susceptible pigs. At that time point, the virus titers from nasal swabs in those pigs ranged from 3 × 10 2 to 1 × 10 5 TCDI 50 /mL. All the contact pigs (100%) in the NV group were found RT-PCR positive by 5 dpc, while in the vaccinated groups, 15 out of 40 pigs (37.5%) in the HE group and none of the pigs (0%) in the HO group were positive by RT-PCR (Table 3) . Comparison of the cumulative percentages of contact pigs infected per day between treatment groups via the log-Rank test from the Kaplan-Meier survival analysis indicated that the percentage of infected pigs was significantly higher in the NV group than in the vaccinated groups (p < 0.0001), and the distributions did not overlap between 90% confidence intervals ( Figure 2 ).

The mean length of the infectious periods (i.e. time between the first and the last day that virus could be detected from nasal swabs (± SD)) in the seeder and in contact pigs are shown in Table 4 . The seeder pigs remained PCR positive for an average of 5.08 ± 0.6 days post infection (dpi) and no differences were observed among them. The average infectious period for the contact infected NV pigs was 4.5 ± 1.07 days and 3.50 ± 1.84 days for the contact infected pigs in the HE group. The infectious period was 1 day shorter in pigs vaccinated with the HE vaccine than in the NV pigs, but the difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.192). The infectious period for the contact infected pigs in the HO group was zero. In addition, the average number of days between exposure and the first pig detected positive was significantly longer in pigs from the HE group (6.87 ± 4.17) compared to the NV group (2.83 ± 1.14) (p = 0.0015).

A summary of the transmission parameter estimates for each replicate and treatment group are displayed in Table 1 . In the HE group, one pig was humanely euthanized at 11 dpc for reasons not related to influenza and was censored, yielding a total number of contact pigs in that replicate of 9.

In the NV group, all contact pigs became infected and R 0 (95% confidence interval) was estimated at 10.66 (6.57-16.46). In contrast, the estimate of R was 1.00 (0.39-2.09) in the HE group, and 0 in the HO group. A Before contact (-2 dpc) and at necropsy (i.e. + 7 dpc for the control group/+14 dpc for the vaccinated groups). a,b Statistically significant differences (p < 0.05). statistically significant reduction in R value was observed in the vaccinated groups (p < 0.05). The difference in transmission rate (β) was also statistically significant between the NV and HE groups (p < 0.0001). Transmission in the HO vaccinated pigs could not be detected in any of the replicates. Transmission in the HE group was observed in all replicates and although R was above 1 in two of the four replicates, R was not statistically significant below 1. However, there were statistically significant differences between HE transmission rate β replicates with differences observed between replicates 1, 2, 3 versus 4 (p < 0.001).

The number of new cases for 10 000 simulations was determined given the parameters listed in Table 1 and the starting values of S = 10, I = 1, and R = 0 for each replicate. The stochastic models first highlighted that within this small population, large outbreaks most commonly occurred given the parameters for all NV replicates (Figures 3 and 4) . At least 84% of the simulations for each NV replicate yielded 10 contact infected pigs. However, even with transmission and recovery parameters generating an R 0 estimate much greater than 1, simulations yielding no new cases or minor outbreaks also occurred in approximately 15% of the simulations. Stochastic simulations for the HE replicates (Figures 4 and 5) demonstrate that within this small population, major outbreaks were rare and the number of new cases was generally low compared to that of the NV replicates. For all HE replicates, at least 40% of the simulations yielded no new cases and a maximum of 7% of simulations yielded 10 new cases compared to at least 84% of the simulations for the NV replicates. The distribution of the number of new cases was also more variable for the HE replicates compared to that of the NV replicates in which the outbreak was either large or small.

Influenza-like clinical signs were mild in all pigs. No pigs died during the study due to influenza infection, and only one contact pig from the HE group had to be removed from the study due to arthritis. The odds of a pig displaying a clinical sign (fever, lethargy, coughing, sneezing, nasal discharge, or dyspnea) during the first week of exposure was significantly lower in the HE group than in NV pigs (OR = 0.37, 95% CI 0.21-0.65, p = 0.005). Macroscopic and microscopic lung lesions NV pigs had pneumonia with areas of lung consolidation at necropsy, and the mean (± SD) lung lesion score was 8.86 ± 7.1%. Thirty-one of the 40 pigs in the HE group and sixteen of the 30 pigs in the HO group had some degree of lung consolidation. The mean lung lesion score for the pigs in the HE group was significantly higher (p ≤ 0.05) than the mean for the pigs in the HO group (5% ± 8 vs. 1.7% ± 5.1) at necropsy.

Although the macroscopic lung lesions in the NV group were greater than in the vaccinated groups, comparisons were only performed between treatment groups with the same endpoints. The lung lesions of the NV pigs had moderate to severe bronchoalveolar pneumonia with attenuation, hyperplasia, moderate numbers of lymphocytes admixed with macrophages in the epithelium, within the intraluminal necrotic cellular debris, and extending into the alveolar spaces. Some lung sections contained occasional bacterial colonies. The overall microscopic lesion mean score was 2.6 ± 0.48 at necropsy indicating significant interstitial pneumonia and more than 75% of the airways affected with bronchial epithelial damage.

The lung lesions of the heterologous vaccine treatment pigs were highly variable ranging from absent to severe. Lesions included moderate numbers of lymphocytes within the hyperplastic epithelium, intraluminal cellular debris and occasional bacterial colonies. One pig had a large abscess in one tissue section and another pig had aspiration pneumonia. The lung lesions of the homologous vaccine treatment pigs were absent to minimal. The lungs of a few pigs had minimal to moderate epithelial attenuation and hyperplasia with small numbers of lymphocytes within and surrounding the epithelium. Many of the tissue sections from all three groups had slight to moderate increases in prominence of the peribronchiolar lymphoid tissue.

The severity of the lung lesions was scored at 1.41 ± 0.49 in the HO group, and at 1.16 ± 0.67 in the HE group, indicating no differences in the severity of the lesions between vaccinated groups (p = 0.09). However, differences were statistically significant (p < 0.05) between the vaccinated and non-vaccinated groups.

Understanding transmission of influenza and the factors that affect transmission is crucial for designing effective control strategies. Vaccination is by far the most common strategy to prevent flu infections. However, little is known on how vaccination affects transmission within pig populations. The objectives of this study were to quantify the spread of an H1N1 triple reassortant influenza virus in populations of pigs by calculating transmission parameters based on the outcome of transmission experiments, and to assess the effect of vaccine on susceptibility to influenza A virus infection in pigs vaccinated with either a homologous or a heterologous vaccine.

The reproduction ratio R, which is the expected average number of secondary infections caused by a typical infectious individual during its entire infectious period [24] , is a measure to quantify the transmission and spread of viruses in populations. When infection occurs in an entirely susceptible population, the reproduction ratio is named ""basic"" reproduction ratio or R 0 [24] . When R is greater than 1, an infection can spread in a population but if R is less than 1, the infection will die out within a population. R estimates can be used to assess the effect of vaccination or other control strategies in populations.

Under the specific conditions of this study and as expected, influenza virus spread quickly among non- vaccinated pigs, and the estimated R 0 in this population was high (10.66, 95% CI 6. 57-16.46) . The estimated R values in the vaccinated groups were significantly different from the values in the NV group. In the HO vaccinated group R was estimated at 0, and in the HE group R ranged from 0.32 to 1.8, with an overall estimate of 1 (95% CI, 0.39-2.09). However, R in the HE group was not statistically significant below 1. Furthermore, statistically significant differences could be observed in the transmission rates (β) between replicates, showing the variability of the pigs' response to influenza vaccination. Despite the fact that transmission was significantly reduced in the HE group, we cannot exclude the possibility that outbreaks of influenza could occur in heterologously vaccinated populations as evidenced by the results of the stochastic model in this study and the modeling estimates presented by de Jong et al. [49] . On the other hand, transmission of the virus could not be detected in the HO vaccinated pigs during the study and R values in all replicates were significantly below 1, suggesting that infection spread in a population vaccinated with a homologous vaccine could be prevented.

In our experiment, a SIR model (Susceptible-Infective-Removed (or Recovered)) was used to describe influenza transmission in pigs because the disease confers immunity against re-infection with a homologous strain [44] . Basically, three different methods have been used to calculate the infection parameters based upon experimental data: Generalized Linear Models (GLM) [45, 49] , Martingale Estimations [16] , and Maximal Likelihood Estimation based on the final size of an outbreak (FS) [32, 50] . The selection of one of the three approaches depends on the data available and the intensity of the sampling. We focused on quantifying the effect of vaccination on the susceptibility of contact pigs to influenza infection instead of evaluating the effect on infectivity of vaccinated pigs. Transmission depends on both the infectivity of the infected individuals and the susceptibility of the contact pigs. In our study, we predicted that vaccination of the seeder pigs would have influenced the number of excreted influenza A viruses as shown in previous studies [30, 35] , and therefore we would not have been able to replicate conditions of transmission relevant to field situations where introduction of shedding animals in vaccinated populations is common. Nevertheless further studies are needed to determine the effect of excretion on the infectivity of influenza vaccinated pigs.

Other experimental transmission studies with H7N7 avian influenza virus, PRRSV and Aujeszky's disease were not able to correlate the amount of virus excreted by infected pigs with increased values in the transmission parameter β [20, 31, 51] . In our study, the initial infectiveness was similar in all the groups due to the use of unvaccinated and experimentally inoculated seeder pigs under the same experimental conditions. Also, no statistically significant differences were observed in TCID 50 values at the time of exposure with the contact pigs and the infectious period was similar for all seeder pigs. Therefore, differences in transmission between groups can be attributed to the decrease in susceptibility of the contact pigs to become infected, and the length of the IP between groups. The infectious period was one day shorter in the HE group than in the NV group and that could play a role in the value of R and account for some of the differences observed between replicates. Overall, detection of influenza virus in the HE vaccinated population lasted longer than in the NV population which also highlights the role of partially immune populations as potential sustained reservoirs for influenza infections.

R 0 of influenza virus has been estimated previously in chickens and horses. R 0 was estimated at 1.6 to 3.5 and at 208 for H5N1 and H7N7 avian influenza strains respectively, and at 10.18 for an equine influenza strain [28, [30] [31] [32] . In these studies R was reduced to 0 in chickens vaccinated with an inactivated H5N2 strain against an H5N1, and it was also 0 in chickens vaccinated with two inactivated H7N1 and H7N3 strains against an H7N7 avian flu virus. In contrast, a recent study reported that transmission of a H5N1 was not affected by vaccination of broiler chickens and suggested that this might have been due to the interference of maternal immunity [33] . In horses, R was reduced to 2.4 for a homologously vaccinated population and to 4.9 for a heterologously vaccinated population. To our knowledge this is the first study that has calculated R 0 for influenza A virus in pigs and R 0 is within the reported values for influenza in other species. In addition, results from our study also suggest that vaccination of pigs can be used to reduce their level of susceptibility, although a degree of virus spread can still take place in populations with immunity.

The reproduction ratio estimates obtained from the deterministic model provide useful threshold values and rates, while stochastic models allow one to investigate estimated outcomes and probabilities such as the number of new cases. Stochasticity is important to consider when dealing with small populations, such as the population reflected in this experimental study. Stochastic models can also be used to complement deterministic models and to assess whether major inferences are comparable across the two different approaches.

From the deterministic models, R 0 estimates for the NV replicates ranged from 8.51 to 19.81. Therefore, following the introduction of one typical infected pig into a completely susceptible population, 9 to 20 secondary cases can be expected due to the typical infectious pig during its entire infectious period. The NV stochastic models reiterate this estimate by showing that major influenza virus outbreaks are likely to occur in small naïve populations following the introduction of one infected pig. The distribution of new cases was also similar across replicates for the NV group with either small or large outbreaks occurring. Once the initial infected pig transmitted the infection to a susceptible pig, the infection chain proceeded until all or nearly all animals were infected. These simulations likely describe high morbidity rates observed in field settings with susceptible animals. The NV stochastic models also clearly show that no new cases or minor outbreaks can also occur, albeit at low frequency, in a similar population even if R 0 values are high.

The R estimates obtained from the deterministic models for the HE groups were lower than that of the NV groups and ranged from 0.32 to 1.8. The resultant stochastic models again reiterate the values obtained in the deterministic models. The HE replicates with lower R values (0.32 and 0.51) yielded a higher proportion of stochastic simulations with no new cases. This finding is expected as a lower R estimate equates to fewer secondary cases due to a typical infectious individual during its entire infectious period. In all HE replicates, the proportion of simulations with major outbreaks was low. On the contrary, no new cases were observed in at least 40% of the simulations regardless of the HE replicate. The proportion of simulations in which no new cases were observed was greatest for those replicates in which the R value was lower.

The impact of vaccination can be assessed in this small population from results of the stochastic models by comparing the NV and HE groups. In small, naïve populations, the introduction of an influenza virus infected pig resulted in a major outbreak and infected all susceptible animals in greater than 84% of simulations. Following vaccination with a HE vaccine in a small population, the proportion of simulations in which all susceptible animals become infected following the introduction of an infected pig was very small (< 7%). However, in the presence of HE immunity, transmission of influenza virus to susceptible animals did occur and it was not prevented in as high as 60% of the simulations as seen in HE replicate 2.

Antibodies against the hemagglutinin protein have been correlated with strong immune response to influenza and with a decrease of the likelihood of becoming infected. However, the levels of protective HI titers against virus replication are not easily established due to the continuous antigenic drift of the virus and due to that reciprocal HI titers alone may not guarantee immunity or predict susceptibility [13, 52, 53] . Kyriakis et al. [52] , in an experimental study with pigs vaccinated with four different commercial vaccines and challenged with a heterologous H1N1 field isolate, found that pigs with reciprocal HI antibodies titers ≥ 20 against the field strain were virologicaly protected [52] . Van Reeth et al. determined that for complete virological protection against a heterologous strain, HI titers as high as 160 are required [13] . In those studies the viral protection was referred to individual virus titers from lung lobes at 3 to 4 days post experimental challenge and related to clinical signs, but not to transmission of the virus. In our study, two weeks after the second vaccine and before exposure to seeder pigs, pigs in the HO group had geometric mean HI titers of 295, while the geometric mean in the HE group was 14 against the challenge strain (maximum reciprocal titer was 80). The challenge virus demonstrated low serologic cross-reactivity with the antiserum induced by the heterologous vaccine and only nine of the forty pigs from the HE group had reciprocal HI titers of greater than 40 against the challenge strain before exposure to the seeder pigs. Of those, two pigs became infected and seven remained uninfected for the duration of the study. Therefore, HI titers against the challenge strain in HE pigs were not able to predict the infectious status of the pigs at the end of the study. The low immunogenicity against the challenge virus in the HE pigs was expected and is in agreement with other studies where pigs vaccinated with licensed inactivated vaccines became infected when challenged with heterologous influenza viruses [11, 12, 54, 55] . At the end of our study not all pigs that had seroconverted to the challenge strain shed virus. Eighteen of the 40 pigs in the HE group had positive HI titers against the challenge strain at necropsy, and in 8 of the 18 pigs with HI titers ≥ 40 the virus could not be detected from nasal swabs samples. Lack of detection could be due to protection and lack of virus replication, or due to the amount of virus excretion being below detectable levels.

Another point of consideration was that our definition in regards to ""homologous"" and ""heterologous"" was related to the HA genetic and antigenic clustering. The challenge strain belonged to the beta influenza H1 cluster and strains in the commercial vaccine were from the gamma and delta clusters which shared 92.2% and 66.8% HA nucleotide similarity respectively with the challenge strain. Although it is known that cross-reactivity may exist between those clusters, this is considered limited [35] which is likely to influence the degree of infection. Therefore the outcome on transmission dynamics may also be influenced by the degree of crossreactivity between clusters and further studies are needed to determine the extent of this.

Differences in transmission could also be due to differences in vaccine efficacy due to different antigen concentration, adjuvant used, or both factors [30, 56] . A study with equine H3N8 strains documented the crucial role of vaccine dose and adjuvant in protection against heterologous challenge [57] . In our study, the amount of antigen was not standardized between the homologous and the heterologous vaccines because the HE group was vaccinated with a commercial licensed vaccine and information on the antigen content was not available. The improved protection provided by the autogenous vaccine was most likely due to its preparation with the virus strain homologous to the challenge virus. It is well documented that strain-specific antibody is more effective than cross reactive-antibody in conferring protection against flu infection [55] . In our study, pigs that received the homologous vaccine had no detectable virus in nasal secretions, had a robust antibody response to the challenge virus, and had significantly lower macroscopic lung lesion scores compared with the pigs that received the licensed heterologous vaccine. There were no differences between microscopic lesions between vaccinated groups, and histopathology in the NV and HE group was compatible with previous influenza infection. Histopathology for the HO group indicated that although lesions were absent in most of the homologous pigs, a few pigs had minimal bronchiolar lesions that were consistent with recovery from influenza infection. Despite the fact that all RT-PCR results in the HO group were negative, we cannot conclusively rule-out the possibility that infection took place in a few pigs in the HO group. If infection had taken place, infection appeared limited to the lower respiratory tract and virus could not be detected with the methods used in this study.

In addition, clinical signs were relatively mild in all the infected pigs, which is similar to what has been reported in previous studies using the same influenza virus [12, 13, 36, 53] . In our study, both vaccines decreased the presence of disease and the impact of influenza infection. More importantly this study highlights the potential for influenza transmission despite the reduction of obvious clinical signs in partially immune populations and does not recommend the use of surveillance programs based on clinical signs in particular in partial immune populations. Moreover, as discussed previously, the virus can remain for extended periods of time in partially immune populations. Such a silent spread of influenza virus can lead to higher probabilities of transmission to other herds and people as also shown by Savill et al [58] .

Overall, an important consideration in regards to inactivated vaccines is whether viruses can replicate and transmit in the presence of some degree of immunity. Under those conditions, virus escape variants can arise and can lead to antigenic drift, loss of vaccine efficacy, and emergence of new strains. Subclinical infections with virus shedding can occur in vaccinated animals, particularly when there is a mismatch between the vaccine and field virus strains [12, 53] . In our study, virus replication and transmission was observed in the HE vaccinated group which suggest the potential role of vaccination in the establishment of enzootic infections and predisposition to virus change. However, whether virus changes happened as a result of vaccine immune pressure it is beyond the scope of this study and warrants future studies.

A limitation of our study is the inoculation dose of the seeder pigs that could lead to a higher shedding of influenza and subsequent overestimations of R compared to conditions that occur in the field. This study was also limited to one licensed vaccine and one autogenous vaccine and the results only reflect the transmission of a single H1N1 flu strain in a limited population. Therefore, transmission parameters in populations vaccinated with others vaccines and infected by different strains would need to be evaluated to further assess influenza transmission patterns in pigs. Additionally, the starting conditions of this study (S = 10, I = 1, r = 0) were designed to reflect a potential field scenario in which an infected pig was introduced into a pen of susceptible or vaccinated pigs. The parameters estimated in this study may not accurately reflect transmission parameters in differing population structures and settings.

In conclusion, transmission parameter estimates derived from this study can be used to further understand influenza transmission dynamics in naïve and immune swine populations. In our study, transmission to contact pigs was significantly reduced by vaccination but it could not be completely prevented when a heterologous vaccine was used. Virus transmission and replication was delayed and variable in the heterologous vaccinated group. On the other hand, transmission could not be detected in homologous vaccinated pigs. In the heterologous vaccinated group, active transmission took place even in the absence of clinical signs and presence of immunity, resulting in the silent spread of influenza virus which may contribute to the establishment of enzootic infected populations and increased probabilities of transmission to other herds. Such populations can in turn also be a risk for interspecies transmission and zoonotic infections. The results of the present study support field observations regarding the variability observed with influenza vaccines to affect transmission and spread of influenza virus.

Methods to infer transmission risk factors in complex outbreak data,"Data collected during outbreaks are essential to better understand infectious disease transmission and design effective control strategies. But analysis of such data is challenging owing to the dependency between observations that is typically observed in an outbreak and to missing data. In this paper, we discuss strategies to tackle some of the ongoing challenges in the analysis of outbreak data. We present a relatively generic statistical model for the estimation of transmission risk factors, and discuss algorithms to estimate its parameters for different levels of missing data. We look at the problem of computational times for relatively large datasets and show how they can be reduced by appropriate use of discretization, sufficient statistics and some simple assumptions on the natural history of the disease. We also discuss approaches to integrate parametric model fitting and tree reconstruction methods in coherent statistical analyses. The methods are tested on both real and simulated datasets of large outbreaks in structured populations.","Data collected during field outbreak investigations are essential to better understand the clinical and epidemiological features of an infectious disease. They can also provide useful insights for outbreak management and control. For example, evaluating the risk factors governing transmission is important to design efficient control measures, and identify those individuals that are most at risk of infection or are the main contributors of infection and should therefore be targeted first.

However, characterizing transmission from outbreak data can be challenging. First, the transmission process is usually imperfectly observed. For example, we may observe the date of symptoms onset of a case, but we rarely know where, when and by whom a case was infected. Inference, therefore, requires integrating over 'missing data', which may quickly become cumbersome. Over the last 15 years, data augmentation methods have been used to tackle this problem: data are augmented with missing data (e.g. dates of infection) that are needed to write down the likelihood; in a Bayesian setting, the joint posterior distribution of parameters and augmented data is explored usually via Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling [1] . This methodology is now well established in the field and has been successfully applied to analyse a range of complex datasets.

However, for relatively large outbreaks with detailed data, this approach may require very long computational times. Interested readers can, for example, read references [2 -11] .

The second challenge is that the type of dependency between observations that is typically observed in an outbreak (i.e. the risk of infection of an individual depends on the infection status of other individuals) is specific to communicable diseases and needs to be accounted for with dedicated methods. This usually requires that the statistical model used to analyse the data is explicitly based on a mechanistic model of disease spread [12] . Transmission parameters of interest, for example, the reproduction number (the number of individuals infected by a case), are usually mathematically defined in those models. Fitting such parametric mechanistic models to outbreak data can give useful insights on transmission [7, [13] [14] [15] , but is subject to the same limitations as parametric fitting in other fields. For example, although there are some exceptions [10] , the approach usually requires to predefine time intervals on which transmission rates are constant. This can sometimes be difficult to achieve in a non-ad hoc way.

An alternative approach that has become increasingly popular is to reconstruct the transmission tree and derive important summary statistics from it, for example, the temporal trends in the reproduction number [16 -18] . This may give greater flexibility (for example, there is no need to specify time intervals with constant transmission rates), potentially at the cost of larger variance of the estimates [15, 18] . However, since these methods generally only consider disease *Author for correspondence (s.cauchemez@imperial.ac.uk). cases rather than the uninfected, but potentially susceptible bulk of the population, they can say little about the risk factors for infection or provide estimates of transmissibility in different contexts (e.g. households, schools or as a function of distance between a susceptible and an infected individual).

Overall, the two methodologies (fitting of a parametric mechanistic model and tree-reconstruction methods) are largely complementary. Fitting a mechanistic model seems to be the only way to account for the depletion of susceptibles, the information on uninfected individuals leading to a quantification of relative risks; and it may ensure a better control of the variance of the estimates. Tree-reconstruction methods can provide further insights on what effectively happened during the outbreak with summary statistics on who was infected by whom, when and where and temporal change in the reproduction number. They can also provide a framework to detect abnormal features in the data that are not initially accounted for in a mechanistic model. It is therefore important that the two approaches can be integrated in a coherent way.

In this paper, we discuss strategies to tackle some of the ongoing challenges in the analysis of outbreak data. We present a relatively generic statistical model for the estimation of transmission risk factors, and discuss algorithms to estimate its parameters for different levels of missing data. We look at the problem of computational times for relatively large datasets and show how they can be reduced by appropriate use of discretization, sufficient statistics and some simple assumptions on the natural history of the disease. We also discuss approaches to integrate parametric model fitting and tree reconstruction methods in coherent statistical analyses. The methods are tested on both real and simulated datasets of large outbreaks in structured populations.

Assume that we observe the spread of a disease in a population of size N from day 0 to day T. For each individual i ¼ 1, . . . , N, let y T i ¼ 1; if individual i is infected between 0 and T; 0 otherwise. Each individual i is characterized by a vector of Q covariates z i (t) ¼ fz i 1 (t), . . . , z i Q (t)g such as age, gender, location, household ID, etc . . . that may vary with day t. We want to quantify the transmission risk factors.

We first consider the situation where day t i of infection of each case i is observed (by convention,

. This assumption is relaxed in §5.

For a directly transmitted disease, the first step to estimate transmission risk factors is usually to propose a model for transmission hazard l i!j ðtjQÞ from case i to subject j on day t, i.e. define l i!j ðtjQÞ as a function of the individual covariates z i (t) and z j (t) and a set of parameters Q. For example, the transmission hazard l i!j ðtjQÞ may depend on:

-the time lag t-t i between day t and the day of infection t i of case i since infectiousness of a case may vary during the course of infection. The functional form between l i!j ðtjQÞ and t-t i will depend on the assumed natural history of the disease; -the individual characteristics of subjects i and j. For example, some subjects may be more infectious while others are more susceptible; and -the type of interactions that exist between subjects i and j. The contact rate might, for example, depend on whether the subjects live in the same household or go to the same school, etc. It could also depend on the spatial distance between them.

Examples of specifications for the transmission hazard l i!j ðtjQÞ are given in § §6 and 7. The force of infection exerted on individual j on day t is then the sum:

l i!j ðtjQÞ:

The contribution to the likelihood of case j is:

where the first term is the probability of infection on day t, and the second term is the probability to escape infection up to day t (the link between the continuous time and discrete time transmission model is discussed in appendix A). The contribution of non-case j is:

The log-likelihood is therefore: the number of pairs of farms to be considered per calculation of the likelihood is over 10 8 [19] . Even with the recent increase in computational power, brute force exploration of the system, though feasible, is very time consuming. Fast and efficient algorithms are necessary to provide real-time support to decision making.

Here, we explore the extent to which the discretization of the transmission risk factors can reduce the computational burden associated with the evaluation of equation (2.3). Therefore, we now restrict our analysis to the situation where each transmission risk factor takes a finite set of values. We will then explore how the approach can be used to investigate continuous risk factors.

Assume that the transmission hazard between two individuals depends on K risk factors x ¼ fx 1 , . . . ,x K g and that the k-th risk factor x k (k ¼ 1, . . . , K ) takes a finite number (¼C k ) of values fv k 1 ; . . . ; v k C k g. The set C of possible values for risk factor vector x ¼ fx 1 , . . . , x K g has size Q K k¼1 C k . For example, the list of risk factors might include the (discretized) distance between the individuals (either spatial or social, e.g. members of the same household), the time lag since infection or individual characteristics, such as age.

We model the transmission hazard between a case and a susceptible individual in the population by:

where the specific effect of x k on the transmission hazard is measured by function b k ðx k ; u k Þ ! 0, and u k ¼ fu k 1 ; . . . ; u k L k g is a parameter vector of size L k . This expression makes the simplifying assumption that the effect of all risk factors on the hazard can be expressed as the product of the impacts of each factor. Parameters of the model are

Remembering that z i denotes data available for individual i, we assume here that risk factors for transmission from case i to individual j on day t are a function of triplet fz i , z j , tg: x ði;j;tÞ ¼ fx 1 ði;j;tÞ ; . . . ; x K ði;j;tÞ g, where for k ¼ 1, . . . , K, x k ði;j;tÞ ¼ g k ðfz i ; z j ; tgÞ. The transmission hazard l i!j ðt j jQÞ from case i to individual j on day t is therefore: l i! j ðtjQÞ ¼ bðx ði;j;tÞ ; QÞ:

The total hazard of infection for individual j on day t is then: where

Here d a,b is the Kronecker delta or identity function (¼1 if a ¼ b and 0 otherwise). M x counts the number of day-transmission events of type x, which might have occurred before time t but did not.

Equation (3.2) has important implications in terms of computational speed since it shows that the computational burden can be substantially reduced without loss of information. The first term of equation (3.2) only involves disease cases; the second term characterizes the probability of escaping infection up to time t. So, data needs for inference reduce to:

-'case data'; -table fM x g x[C of sufficient statistics that characterize the interaction of cases with any individual of the population. It can be pre-computed and stored once, given they do not functionally depend on the parameters.

Tree reconstruction [7, [16] [17] [18] is a useful complement to the likelihood-based estimates of the parameters derived from equation (3.2) . Here, we present and discuss different strategies to perform tree reconstruction and parameter estimation in a coherent statistical framework.

Given parameter Q and given that case j was infected on day t j , the probability that case j was infected by case i (t i , t j ) is simply (see appendix A):

A natural way to integrate tree reconstruction and parameter estimation in a coherent setting is to proceed sequentially. For example, in a Bayesian setting, a sample fQ m g m¼1;...;M can be drawn from the posterior distribution of Q via MCMC sampling relying on equation (3.2) . Then, for each parameter value in the sample m ¼ 1, . . . ,M, a source of infection r j can be drawn from its distribution f p i!j ðt j jQ m Þg i for each case j. This gives a sample of M transmission trees drawn from their predictive distribution. For example, we used this strategy when analysing detailed data from an influenza outbreak in a school [7] .

Here, we explore an alternative strategy where the two tasks are performed simultaneously. The method formalizes those introduced in work undertaken in 2001 on the UK FMD epidemic of that year [13] . The idea is that the source of infection r j for each case j is considered as 'augmented' data. The augmented loglikelihood is:

In many situations, where the force of infection exerted on individuals is relatively small, the likelihood simplifies to:

The analysis of the augmented likelihood can be performed in a frequentist or in a Bayesian setting. In the frequentist setting, it is straightforward to implement an expectation conditional maximization (ECM) algorithm [20, 21] to both derive maximum-likelihood estimates of the parameters of the model and reconstruct the transmission tree. The pseudo-code for this algorithm is given in box 1. In the common situation, where one is interested in relative risks (i.e. comparison with a reference group) and where the force of infection exerted on individuals is relatively small, no maximization routine is needed since the maximum value is simply a ratio of two sums (appendix A) [13] . Confidence intervals can be obtained from the Fisher information matrix derived at the maximum value for the incomplete log-likelihood (equation 3.2). The approach, therefore, requires that the second derivative of the log-likelihood with respect to Q exists.

Alternatively, inference can be performed in a Bayesian setting via MCMC [1] , with a pseudo-code presented in box 2. The key difference is in the way missing data are handled: in the Bayesian approach, one realization of the missing data is drawn from its expected distribution; by contrast in the EM algorithm, the whole expected distribution of the missing data is used in the expression of the augmented likelihood.

Often, the day of symptom onset s j of case j is observed but not the day of infection t j . As a consequence, Box 1. The EM algorithm when the days of infection are observed.

Assume that at the beginning of iteration n, parameter vector is Q n21 : -expectation step:

(i) for each case j, compute probabilities f p i!j ðt j Þg i given Q n21 (equation 4.1; see appendix A), and (ii) for x in C, compute the expected number of transmission events of type x :

other parameters being fixed (see appendix A):

Bayesian algorithm when the days of infection are observed.

At iteration n:

-update missing data: (i) for each case j, compute probabilities f p i!j ðt j Þg i given Q n21 (equation 4.1; see appendix A), (ii) for each case j, draw the source r j of case j from distribution f p i!j ðt j Þg i , and (iii) for x in C, compute the number of transmission events of type x:

-update parameters: (i) for k ¼ 1, . . . , K, and (ii) for j ¼ 1, . . . , L k : MCMC update u k j relying on the augmented likelihood L C (see appendix A):

Methods to infer transmission risk factors S. Cauchemez and N. M. Ferguson 459 likelihood as shown in equation (3.2) is no longer available. If the incubation period (time lag between the day of infection and the day of symptoms onset) has a known density f (s j jt j ), a common strategy to tackle the problem is to augment the data with the day of infection of each case. A particular computational burden is then that updating the day of infection of a single case may require re-calculation of the whole likelihood as the update may affect the risk of infection of all other individuals. In order to avoid this computational cost, we introduce the additional assumption: (H1) Given the day of symptoms onset s j , infectiousness over time is independent of the day of infection t j . This is, for example, the case if infectiousness starts with symptom onset. This assumption seems acceptable for a relatively wide range of diseases since infectivity is often triggered or influenced by symptoms. Under H1, there is no need to re-compute the whole likelihood each time a day of infection is updated.

It would be possible to extend the EM approach to the situation when the days of infection are unobserved. Inference would work as in the previous section except that one would have to take the expectation on both the contact tracing information and the day of infection. However, for this second application, it is no longer possible to easily derive the variance of the estimates. This is because, although maximum-likelihood point estimates could be derived from the likelihood for the 'complete' dataset, estimation of the variance of the estimates has to rely on the likelihood of the observed dataset (equation 3.2). This expression cannot be computed here since days of infection are not observed. The Bayesian approach does not suffer from this limitation and makes it possible to easily obtain Bayesian credible intervals (box 3). 

We explore how the discretization of risk factors and the algorithms introduced in §4 can reduce the computational burden of inference. For simplicity, farms are partitioned into three groups on the basis of the number of cattle n c and the number of sheep 3n s : cattle (cattle farm: n c ! n s ), sheep (sheep farm: n s . n c ) and small (small farm: n c þ n s , 100) [13] . We assume that the latent period of FMD is 3 days and that infectious farms remain so until the time of slaughter. The transmission hazard b between case farm i and susceptible farm j that is introduced in equation (3.1) is modelled as a function of the following characteristics:

-the type (cattle, sheep or small) of case farm i. We estimate the relative infectivity of sheep farms ðg sh I Þ and small farms ðg sm I Þ relative to cattle Box 3. Bayesian algorithm when only days of symptom onset are observed.

At iteration n:

-Gibbs sampling for missing data: (i) for each case j, compute probabilities f p j ðtÞg t for the day of infection of the case given Q n21 (see appendix A), (ii) for each case j, draw the day t j of infection of the case from distribution f p j ðtÞg t , (iii) for each case j, compute probabilities f p i!j ðt j Þg i given Q n21 (equation 4.1; see appendix A), (iv) for each case j, draw the source r j of case j from distribution f p i!j ðt j Þg i , and (v) for x in C, compute the number of transmission events of type x:

-update parameters: (i) for k ¼ 1, . . . , K, and (ii) for j ¼ 1, . . . , L k : MCMC update u k j relying on the augmented likelihood. The augmented likelihood is slightly different from the case when days of infection are known (equation 3.2). In particular, since days of infection of cases change during the inference procedure, it is no longer possible to pre-compile and store the contribution of cases to matrix fM x g (i.e. number of day-transmission events of type x that could have occurred but did not); but one can still pre-compile and store the contribution fMM x g of non-cases, which is usually the key computational burden. The augmented likelihood is:

farms. So the multiplicative term on the transmission hazard is g sh I ; if case farm is a sheep farm, g sm I if it is a small farm and 1 if it is a cattle farm; -the type (cattle, sheep or small) of susceptible farm j. We estimate the relative susceptibility of sheep farms ðg sh S Þ and small farms ðg sm S Þ relative to cattle farms; and -the distance d ij between farm i and farm j. Two models are considered: M1: discrete model. We assume that the transmission kernel is a step function with K þ 1 change points fd k g k¼0, . . . ,K and where the multiplicative term on the transmission hazard is g k D if d k21 , d ij d k . In practice, we take 18 change points f0, 0.5, 1, 1. ð6:1Þ where qða; bÞ ¼ 1= Ð 2000 d¼0 ð1 þ u=aÞ Àb du is a normalizing constant. Here, we introduce a discretized version of this kernel. Consider K þ 1 change points fd k g k¼0, . . . ,K . We define d k ; the mean distance between farms i and j satisfying d k21 , d ij d k :

The transmission kernel is the step function:

In For the ECM algorithm, we consider that convergence is achieved at iteration n if the relative change in parameter values between iteration n and iteration n þ 1 is smaller than 10 27 for all parameters. In the Bayesian implementation of the model, we specify the following priors for our parameters. Parameters g sh I ; g sm I ; g sh S ; g sm S ; g 1 D ; . . . ; g K D all have a gamma prior G(a, a) with a ¼ 10 22 . We also do a sensitivity analysis for a ¼ 10 21 , 1. For model M2, we specify a uniform prior U [0,100] for kernel parameters a and b and a   gamma prior G(a, a) for parameter c. The MCMC is run for 8000 iterations with a burn in of 500 iterations.

Transmission parameters are estimated for time interval 23rd February (when the national ban on animal movements was introduced) to 5th October 2001, conditional on the state of the epidemic on 23rd February. Computation times are given for single threaded code running on an Intel Xeon x5570 system.

We first use the ECM algorithm (box 1) to estimate model M1 (table 1) . Convergence is achieved in only 91 iterations (figure 1). Total computational time is 1 min 14 s with most of the time (58 s) spent reading the data and computing the table fM x g x[C of sufficient statistics (equation 3.2). In particular, there is no need to use maximization routines since there is an analytical solution to the conditional maximization step (see appendix A). Computational times are also very short (4 min 28 s) for the Bayesian algorithm (box 2).

Estimates of transmission kernel M2 are obtained in 6 min 41 s (table 2) . Those computational times contrast with those needed through brute calculation of the likelihood (equation 2.3). Replacing model M2 by the exact continuous parametric kernel (equation 6.1) and using equation (2.3) does not affect estimates (table 2); but computational times move to a month for the same number of iterations of the MCMC, on the same machine and with no serious attempt to optimize the code. While algorithmic optimization and parallel programming allows this to be reduced to a few days [19] , the algorithms presented here still give comparable estimates two orders of magnitude more rapidly than brute force approaches.

We simulate an epidemic in a city that is structured in households and hospitals and where community transmission can happen. Table 3 summarizes the structure of the city. We consider a city of size 400 000 with an average household size of 2.2 persons and with household demographics consistent with the 1999 French census [22] . The city has three hospitals with 2240 staff members and 800 beds each, a bed occupancy of 70 per cent outside the epidemic period for a duration of hospitalization of 10 days. We simulate the spread of a disease in this population and would like to assess how the techniques described above can be used to evaluate and monitor transmission in the different settings (community, hospital and household), infectivity and susceptibility of different types of individuals (here: children versus adults) along with the efficacy of the interventions that are put in place in the different settings. We are interested in a scenario like the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) rather than, for example, an influenza scenario; that is a disease for which it is possible to detect and identify a substantial proportion of cases.

We assume that the incubation period of the disease has a geometric distribution (with probability 0.3, truncated after 10 days); that individuals start to be infectious on the day of symptoms onset with an infectivity profile following that time which has an exponential shape with mean 3 days (truncated after 20 days). We assume that 20 per cent of cases are hospitalized with equal probability of hospitalization occurring 1 or 2 days after symptoms onset. We assume that children are 1.5-fold more susceptible and more infectious than adults. Following Cauchemez et al. [8] , we assume that the person-to-person household transmission rate is inversely proportional to the size of the household. The epidemic starts with five cases infected on day 0. Control measures targeting community, household and hospital transmission each with an efficacy of reducing transmission of 50 per cent are implemented on day 60 of the outbreak. We consider different scenarios for the proportion of cases that are detected in the population. Initially, we assume that all cases are detected. In alternative scenarios, we investigate the situations where 50 or 25 per cent of cases are randomly detected in the community/hospital, but where follow-up of households with detected cases is good (90%) and, last, the situation where detection of cases among household members is of the same quality as detection of cases in the community and in hospitals.

The transmission hazard b between case i and individual j that is introduced in equation (3.1) depends on the following characteristics:

-setting, i.e. whether individuals i and j are (i) members of the same household, (ii) have visited the same hospital or (iii) other (i.e. community transmission)-the multiplicative term on the transmission hazard is b Hous /n (n: size of the household), b Hosp /N Hosp (N Hosp : number of staff members plus average hospital occupancy outside an epidemic) and b Com /N Com (N Com : size of the city). We specify a gamma prior G(10 25 , 10 23 ) for b Hous , b Hosp and b Com ; -infectivity profile from symptom onset of case imodelled with a normalized discretized exponential distribution with a mean to be estimated. We specify a uniform prior U [1,10] for the mean value; -whether or not case i is a child-we estimate the infectivity of children relative to adults. We specify a lognormal prior distribution with log-mean 0 and log-variance 1 for the relative infectivity of children g I . This ensures that g I has the same prior as 1/g I ; -whether or not individual j is a child-we estimate the susceptibility of children relative to adults, g S , assuming a lognormal prior distribution with log-mean 0 and log-variance 1; and -efficacy of interventions implemented in the different settings (i.e. household, hospital and community). After implementation of the intervention (day 60), the transmission rate in the household, hospital and community is multiplied by parameter g Hous , g Hosp and g Com , respectively; where g Hous , g Hosp and g Com have the same prior as the relative infectivity and susceptibility of children. Figure 2 summarizes the data that would need to be collected during the outbreak with the age and dates of symptom onset of cases (figure 2a), a follow-up of households with cases and tracking of hospitalizations and more generally of hospital occupancy (figure 2b) and a follow-up of epidemics in hospitals (figure 2c). Inference also requires having information on the age distribution of the population. In the simulated outbreak, there were a total of 1842 cases with 631 (34%) child cases.

In the scenario, where all cases are identified, figure 3 shows how estimates change in real-time. On day 20, only 31 cases have been detected and credible intervals of parameters are therefore wide. The credible interval includes the true value for all parameters except the relative infectivity of children. On day 30, with 80 cases detected, posterior means are always relatively close to the true simulation value although credible intervals remain wide for some parameters like the relative infectivity and susceptibility of children and the mean generation time. On day 40 (182 cases detected), we would rightly conclude that children are more infectious and susceptible than adults although here again the credible intervals remain relatively wide. Properly characterizing the infectivity profile requires substantially more data (849 cases detected by day 60). Only 10 days after control measures are implemented, fairly accurate estimation of the efficacy of interventions in different settings becomes possible.

When only 50 per cent of cases in the community and in hospitals are detected, performance of the approach remains satisfying although as expected credible intervals are wider and it takes longer for accuracy to be acceptable (figure 4). When 25 per cent of cases in the community and in hospitals are detected, precision of estimates starts to break down (electronic supplementary material, figure S1 ). Although estimates of transmission rates in the community and the hospital are not strongly affected by under-reporting in those settings, this is not true of estimates of transmission rates in small closed settings such as households (electronic supplementary material, figure S2 ). The method also allows disaggregated monitoring of the reproduction number and the number of cases infected in different settings (figure 5).

In this paper, we have presented strategies to tackle some of the challenges associated with the estimation of transmission characteristics of infectious diseases and the risk factors affecting transmission patterns.

The dependency that is typically observed in outbreak data (i.e. the risk of infection for an individual depends on the infection status of other individuals) can potentially lead to long computational times. We showed that if risk factors are discretized, the inferential problem can be simplified to the analysis of (i) a dataset on cases only and (ii) a pre-compiled summary table on interactions between individuals of the population and cases. In the FMD application, discretization reduced the computational time from few weeks to few minutes with no change in the estimates of the transmission kernel. It is likely that with substantial effort and parallel programming, we could have reduced the computation time of brute force approach by one or two orders of magnitude. Even so, it seems unlikely that computational times could have gone much below few days. This has to be compared with the few minutes needed to run our algorithms on the FMD dataset. For small datasets, discretization may provide no computational gain if it takes longer to explore the set C of transmission risk factors than to sum over the pairs fcase i, individual jg. Discretization may be difficult to implement on particularly complex transmission models [19, 23] in which case brute force calculation of the likelihood may be needed.

We presented two strategies to perform parameter estimation and tree reconstruction in a coherent way. The first one is a sequential approach that we used to analyse data from an influenza school outbreak [7] . Here, we implemented an alternative strategy where transmission parameters and the transmission tree are estimated simultaneously. There are pros and cons for each of those strategies. A nice feature of simultaneous inference is that the information on the transmission For situations when the dates of infection are unknown, we presented models which assumed that infectivity depends on the time elapsed since symptom onset, and is independent of the time of infection. This assumption reduces the computational burden since it implies that the infection hazard an individual is exposed to solely depends on measured quantities plus the parameters of the model, rather than on the unobserved days of infection of other cases. In practice, assumption H1 seems acceptable for a relatively wide range of diseases since infectivity is often triggered or influenced by symptoms. However, where the assumption is invalid, more computationally intensive methods accounting for the unobserved times of infection become necessary [23] .

In the simulation study, we considered an epidemic for which it would be possible to detect and identify a substantial proportion of cases; this would therefore be more applicable to a SARS-like scenario rather than pandemic influenza. The simulation study showed that even in situations where under-reporting is substantial (e.g. 50%), it would still be possible to obtain informative estimates of key characteristics. We found that estimates of the transmission rate in the community and in the hospital were relatively robust to under-reporting in those settings. This can be explained by the fact that in a large population, the exponential growth rate of the epidemic is not affected by under-reporting. But estimates of transmission rates in small social units such as households were-as might be expected-strongly affected by under-ascertainment of cases. Estimates of relative infectivity were particularly sensitive to underreporting, with large variance and sometimes important bias. Estimating relative infectivity is in general quite challenging because it requires that one can compare the offspring of one group of individuals (e.g. adults) with that of another group (e.g. children) and this becomes very difficult as under-reporting increases. It is likely that estimates would be less robust to underreporting, if reporting rates changed over time, as probably happens in real epidemics.

Here, we have presented relatively simple approaches to reduce computational burden in the estimation of transmission parameters and to integrate parameter estimation and tree reconstruction in a coherent way. However, the analysis of outbreak data is subject to many other challenges. For example, it may be difficult to infer which parametric distribution should be used for the infectivity profile and the incubation period; data augmentation strategies may fail in a context when data are not missing at random or when there are false-positives or false-negatives [23] . A particular challenge in outbreak data is that they are rarely informative about the incubation period of the disease. In the simulations study, for example, we made the assumption that the distribution of the incubation period of the disease was known. If it was not the case, one would require extra data to estimate it. For example, in the past, data from outbreaks in an aeroplane [24] or in a bus [25] were used to estimate the incubation period of influenza.

A key practical challenge to implement the methods presented here in real time is the rapid collection and digitization of sufficiently detailed epidemiological data. However, recent experience demonstrates that it is possible to collect very detailed epidemiological data even during large outbreaks [10, [13] [14] [15] 25, 26] . Cleaning and processing those data so that they are ready for analysis close to real-time remain a huge challenge, but the recent examples of the 2001 FMD outbreak in the UK [13, 14] , the 2003 SARS epidemic [15, 26] and the 2009 H1N1 pandemic [25] show that this is increasingly feasible. However, reporting delays should always be expected and it will be important to account for those delays in future developments of the statistical method presented here.

Last, a key limit on the more widespread use of the type of methods presented in this paper is the relatively high technical hurdle to implement them, given there is currently no user-friendly statistical software package that allows easy implementation of this type of analysis. Developing such tools is therefore a priority.

We explain here the link between the continuous time and discrete time transmission models. At any (continuous) time point u during day t (i.e. u [ [t;t þ 1)), the instantaneous hazard of infection exerted on individual j is l Ã j ðuÞ ¼ l j ðtÞ for t u , t þ 1; where l j (t) is defined in the main text. So, we make the assumption that the instantaneous hazard of infection is a step function with daily steps. Conditional on the fact that individual j has not been infected up to day t, the probability that individual j is infected on day t is equal to

In the continuous time model, conditional on the (continuous) time of infection u j of case j with u j [ [t j ; t j þ 1), the probability that case i is the case source is: p Ã i!j ðu j jQÞ ¼ l i!j ðu j jQÞ P k:t k ,t j l k!j ðu j jQÞ ¼ l i!j ðt j jQÞ P k:t k ,t j l k!j ðt j jQÞ :

And we note that this probability is constant for u j [ [t j ; t j þ 1).

Conditional on the day t j of infection, the probability that case i is the case source given in equation (4.1) is:

u j ¼t j p Ã i!j ðu j jQÞPðu j jt j Þdu j and p i!j ðt j jQÞ ¼ l i!j ðt j jQÞ P k:t k ,t j l k!j ðt j jQÞ ð t j þ1 u j ¼t j Pðu j jt j Þdu j ¼ l i!j ðt j jQÞ P k:t k ,t j l k!j ðt j jQÞ :

"The complex associations of climate variability with seasonal influenza A and B virus transmission in subtropical Shanghai, China","High temperature only associated with influenza A occurrence. High diurnal temperature range (DTR) causes more influenza A cases. Low DTR causes more influenza B cases. High DTR and low temperature were the key drivers for influenza A and B separately. g r a p h i c a l a b s t r a c t X-axis: The value of climate variable; Y-axis: 2-weeks lagged cumulative relative risk (RR), indicating the number of times more likely to have influenza compared to reference value (Ref); Solid line: RR value; Grey shadow: 95% confidence interval (95% CI).","While vaccination can effectively prevent seasonal influenza, it remains epidemics and lead to approximately 3-5 million cases and 290,000 to 650,000 deaths annually worldwide (World Health Organization, 2018) . Generally, influenza peak once in the winter in temperate areas (Finkelman et al., 2007) , however, it seems that the seasonal patterns in tropical and subtropical zones are more complicated. Several previous studies reported that the peaking of seasonal influenza occurred once a year (in winter or spring/summer) in some subtropical areas (Cheng et al., 2012) , however, other studies found the peaks in subtropical regions were detected in both summer and winter (Iha et al., 2016; Liu et al., 2017) . Furthermore, the transmission patterns of seasonal influenza were very diverse in China by region (Du et al., 2012; Shu et al., 2010; Yu et al., 2013) . The seasonal patterns of seasonal influenza are driven by the complex interaction among influenza virus, climate factors and human activity patterns (Alonso et al., 2007; Surveillance and System, 2012; Tamerius et al., 2013) .

Recently, there has an increasing interest in the association between climate variables and seasonal influenza activity. Low temperature has been reported to favour the transmission of influenza in temperate and tropical climate (Huang et al., 2017; Soebiyanto et al., 2014; Tsuchihashi et al., 2011; Xu et al., 2013) , as well as to increase the mortality of influenza (Davis et al., 2012) . A decrease of temperature during the preceding three days was correlated to an increased risk of influenza infections in cold climate (Jaakkola et al., 2014) . Other climate variables, such as absolute humidity, relative humidity and rainfall have also been reported to be associated with seasonal influenza infections (Gomez-Barroso et al., 2017; Shaman and Kohn, 2009; Shaman et al., 2010b; Tamerius et al., 2013) . Moreover, the geographical variation of seasonal patterns of influenza indicates that climate factors may promote influenza infections with complex interactive effects, such as the significant interactive effect between temperature and relative humidity (Wang et al., 2017) . However, the majority of previous studies focused on tropical or temperate zones, little is known about the associations of multiple climate variables with different influenza types in subtropical regions.

Additionally, the transmission patterns of seasonal influenza can even be diverse in neighbouring regions sharing similar climate (Yu et al., 2013) . It is necessary to specifically assess the response of influenza to climate variables by location. Understanding the relationship between climate factors and influenza can be seen as a foundation for developing early warning systems based on climate factors for seasonal influenza. This study aims to examine the associations of multiple climate factors (mean temperature (MeanT), diurnal temperature range (DTR), relative humidity (RH), and wind velocity (Wv)) with seasonal influenza A virus (Flu-A) and B virus (Flu-B) in subtropical Shanghai, China.

This study was conducted in Pudong New Area, where is the largest district of Shanghai City, the one of the largest metropolis worldwide (Fig. 1) . To December 2017, there are more than 5.5 million population in the area (Government, 2017). Shanghai has a subtropical climate with four distinct seasons (Ye et al., 2019) . The vaccination of seasonal influenza has yet to be included in the national immunization programme (Feng et al., 2010) , the coverage rate of influenza vaccination of China and Pudong is below 2% and 1.4%, separately (Feng et al., 2010; Ye et al., 2019) .

Weekly laboratory-confirmed positive influenza virus data were collected from two sentinel hospitals between June 1st, 2012 and December 31st, 2018 in Pudong New Area. The detailed process of sample collection and laboratory testing were reported in our previous work, please see (Ye et al., 2019) . Weekly data on climate variables including MeanT (°C), RH (%), and Wv (m/s) were obtained from National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) . Moreover, we collected weekly maximum and minimum temperatures to calculated diurnal temperature range (DTR, DTR = maximum temperature-minimum temperature) (°C). We also calculated absolute humidity (AH) using relative humidity (RH) and temperature, based on Clausius-Clapeyron relation (Shaman and Kohn, 2009 ). 

Firstly, we used GLMs to initially fit the relationship between climate variables and Flu-A and Flu-B, separately (Limper et al., 2016) . Multicollinearity among climate variables was checked and avoid through performing Spearman correlation analysis and variance inflation factors (VIF). Only one of the highly-correlated variables (r > 0.6 or VIF > 5) was included in the model (Wu et al., 2015) . AH was excluded in our final model, as this factor strongly associated with MeanT (Peci et al., 2019; Shaman et al., 2010b) , with the Spearman correlation coefficient of 0.97 (p < 0.05) ( Table S1 ). GLM with a negative binomial distribution was assumed to allow over-dispersion . We developed GLMs including all climate variables to adjust the relationships between climate factors and seasonal influenza. The model used in our study was given as follow:

is the expected weekly count of positive Flu-A or Flu-B on week t; b 0 is the intercept; b 1 (MeanT t ), b 2 (DTR t ), b 3 (RH t ) and b 4 (Wv t ) denote the corresponding regression coefficients of MeanT, DTR, RH and Wv, respectively;

Week of year (WOY) was included in the model adjusting for seasonality; Holiday refer to a binary variable for public holiday to control the impact of public holidays ; e t is the error term.

To better assess the potential non-linear impacts of climate factors on seasonal influenza transmission with delayed effects, DLNMs were developed for Flu-A and Flu-B, respectively (Gasparrini, 2011; Wood, 2006) , with a negative binomial distribution to account for over-dispersion. The model were formulated as follow:

is the expected weekly count of positive Flu-A or Flu-B on week t; a is the intercept; cb(climate variables) represents the cross-basis matrix of climate factors to explore the potential cumulative and delayed effects with the corresponding df if applicable; WOY and Holiday represent indicator variables adjusting for seasonality and public holidays, separately. The function in the cross-basis was chose as a natural cubic spline function to capture the potential non-linear associations (Dai et al., 2018) . The maximum temporal lag was selected as 2 weeks, which based upon the potential lagged effects and the incubation period of influenza reported by previous studies (Dai et al., 2018) . In order to better develop the models and assess the robustness of the models, the best df (from 3 to 6 df) for both climate variables and lag space in the cross-basis was chosen by the smallest Akaike information criterion (AIC). In our final model, 4 df was selected for both climate factors and lag space.

Then, we calculated the relative risk (RR) with corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI), relative to pre-determined reference value. The reference value in this paper was defined as the lowest point in the curve of the fitted association using GLMs .

We developed regression tree models to identified the threshold values of the climate factors, which are most likely to be correlated to influenza infections . We used weekly climate variables at 2-week lag as the independent variables and weekly Flu-A and Flu-B as the dependent variables. The selection of the best tree size based on cross-validation by checking estimated prediction errors. The model with an estimated error rate within one standard error of the minimum and the smallest tree size was selected as the best model (Breiman, 2017) .

All data analyses were conducted by using R software (version 3.5.1; R Development Core Team, Boston, MA).

The total of 14,320 specimens were tested over the study period, with 2405 positive specimens (Table S2 ). Most of the positive cases were detected as Flu-A (1814, 75.4%). The mean weekly positive Flu-A and Flu-B were 5.2 and 1.7, separately. The statistical characteristics of weekly positive seasonal influenza viruses and climate variables were summarized in Table 1 . Fig. 2 showed that Flu-A had annual winter/spring peak with summer peak in several years. However, Flu-B generally peaked during winter/spring weeks.

The results indicated that MeanT and RH were negatively associated with Flu-A, DTR and Wv were positively correlated to Flu-A when we included all climate factors in the model (Fig. 3) . Moreover, MeanT, DTR and RH were negatively associated with Flu-B, Wv was positively correlated to Flu-B. Both the risk of Flu-A and Flu-B was peaking at 1.4°C with RRs of 5.89 (95%CI: 2.04-18.33) (Fig. 3a) and 4.61 (95%CI: 1.49-13.57) (Fig. 3e) , separately. However, there were inverse trends in the effects of DTR on Flu-A and Flu-B. The risks of Flu-A and Flu-B were significantly peaking at DTR of 15.8°C (RR: 3.52, 95%CI: 1.88-7.13) (Fig. 3b ) and 3.2°C (RR: 7.46, 95%CI: 3.66-16.72) (Fig. 3f) , respectively. Moreover, low RH increased the risk of seasonal influenza, the largest risks were found at 51.5% for Flu-A (RR: 1.032, 95%CI: 1.009-1.058) (Fig. 3c) and Flu-B (RR: 3.95, 95%CI: 2.00-6.98) (Fig. 3g) . Additionally, high Wv posted risk to seasonal influenza, the largest RR were observed at 3.5 m/s for Flu-A (RR: 1.68, 95%CI: 1.12-3.13) (Fig. 3d) and Flu-B (RR: 1.78, 95%CI: 1.04-3.02) (Fig. 3h) .

Apparent non-linear cumulative associations between climate variables with Flu-A and Flu-B were observed when we applied DLNMs (Fig. 4) . For MeanT, two peaks in the cumulative risk of Flu-A was found in the study, with the first peak at 1.4°C (RR: 14.88, 95%CI: 8.67-23.31) and second peak at 25.8°C (RR: 12.21, 95%CI: 6.64-19.83) (Fig. 4a) . Moreover, the peaking risk of Flu-B was at 1.4°C (RR: 26.44, 95%CI: 11.52-51.86) (Fig. 4e) . In term of DTR, high DTR of 15.8°C exerted the highest risk of Flu-A (RR: 23.05, 95%CI: 5.12-88.45) (Fig. 4b) , however, that of Flu-B was observed at low DTR of 3.2°C (RR: 38.25, 95%CI: 15.82-87.61) (Fig. 4f) . Additionally, both more Flu-A and Flu-B was observed at low RH (51.5%), with the RRs of 9.98 (95%CI: 4.03-26.28) (Fig. 4c) and 4.63 (95%CI: 1.95-11.27) (Fig. 4g) , separately. Furthermore, high Wv (3.5 m/s) posted the highest risks to both Flu-A (RR: 7.48, 95%CI: 2.73-30.04) (Fig. 4d) and Flu-B (RR: 7.87, 95%CI: 5.53-11.91) (Fig. 4h) .

Based on the findings above, we further analysed the lagged associations between climate variables at specific values and influenza by different time lag, relative to the reference values (Table 2) . For low MeanT (1.4°C, the highest point in Fig. 4a and e) exerted the highest risk of Flu-A at 0-week lag (RR: 8.13, 95%CI: 2.44-18.83), but, Flu-B at 1-week lag (RR: 11.32, 95%CI: 8.84-14.58). Regarding DTR, the highest risk of Flu-A at DTR of 15.8°C (the highest point in Fig. 4b ) was observed at the lag of 1-week (RR: 5.11, 95%CI: 2.06-12.66), similarly, that of Flu-B at DTR of 3.2°C (the highest point in Fig. 4f ) was found at 1-week lag (RR: 11.29, 95% CI: 8.06-15.13). In term of RH, low RH of 51.5% (the highest point in Fig. 4c and g) 1.48-3.74), separately. Moreover, Wv of 3.5 m/s (the highest point in Fig. 4d and h) at 0-week lag had the highest risk, with RRs of 6.10 for Flu-A (95%CI: 3.15-11.81) and 5.68 for Flu-B (95%CI: 2.69-12.02), separately. The details of RRs by time lag are shown in Table 2 . The trends of lag-response curves of Flu-A and Flu-B are illustrated in Supplementary Fig. S1 .

Fig. 5 demonstrated that the climate variables played different roles in the occurrence of Flu-A and Flu-B in the study setting. DTR was the first classifying factor in the model of Flu-A, which indicated that DTR played the most important role in the occurrence of Flu-A. The mean weekly Flu-A increased by over 3.1-fold (44/14) when DTR was 12°C. However, the most significant climate factor in the occurrence of Flu-B was MeanT, which was identified as the first classifying factor in the model. An increase over 4.5-fold (19/4.2) in the mean weekly Flu-B was observed when MeanT was <22°C, as well as Wv was 1.6 m/s and DTR was <8.7°C.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to assess the complex associations of multiple climate variables with different types of seasonal influenza viruses in subtropical China. Our study found that MeanT, DTR, RH and Wv were significantly associated with Flu-A and Flu-B by different time lags.

We found that MeanT was negatively associated with influenza, low temperature led to more influenza cases. This result is consistent with previous studies, cold temperature could lead to more influenza activity in China (Yu et al., 2013) . A decline of 1°C in temperature increased influenza infections risk by 11% in Finland (Jaakkola et al., 2014) . Moreover, 1°C decrease of temperature cased a rising of 8.55% in influenza cases in Hong Kong, and an increase of 32.14% in the UK (Wang et al., 2017) . Low temperature may lengthen the survival of influenza virus, and lead to increasing contact rates through more people indoor crowding (Cheng et al., 2016; Liao et al., 2005) . As a result, low temperature could contribute to the spread of influenza. It should be noted that another peak of RR in high temperature for Flu-A was observed in the study. This finding was supported by previous studies, which reported the semiannual epidemic in the summer in subtropical cities in China (Yang et al., 2018a; Yang et al., 2018b; Ye et al., 2019) . The potential reasons for this semiannual epidemic required further research.

DTR was significantly associated with seasonal influenza in the study, with a positive relationship with Flu-A, and a negative rela- Overall mean Flu-A=14

Overall mean Flu-B=4.2 tionship with Flu-B. In Beijing, an increased influenza cases in the elderly was associated with bigger DTR values (Lao et al., 2018) . A study in Hong Kong found that DTR had positive impact on laboratory-confirmed influenza cases, the mean increase in weekly cases was 5.01% per 1°C increase in DTR, however, this study reported that the effect of DTR only exerted in dry period (when vapour pressure is less than 20 mbar (mb)), and the effect was not modified by influenza types (Li et al., 2018) . The physiological mechanisms of DTR on the diseases were not elucidated, although there are several possible underlying mechanisms. Sudden temperature change may increase respiratory workload and induce the onset of a respiratory event (Imai et al., 1998) , as well as influence humoral and cellular immunity (Bull, 1980) . Our study indicated that decline in RH promoted influenza activity, and the result is consistent with previous studies. Several previous studies indicated that low RH can favour the transmission of influenza (Hemmes et al., 1960; Lowen et al., 2007; Schaffer et al., 1976; Sundell et al., 2016) . Low RH can allow influenza virus particles to remain in the air for longer time because of the smaller size and lower velocity of settling (Yang and Marr, 2011) . As a result, there is an increase of susceptibility to influenza infections (Eccles, 2002) . Additionally, low RH can also preserve the viability of influenza virus. The infectivity can keep as 70.6-77.3% when RH was less than 23% for 1 h, however, the number decreased to 14.6-22.2% at RH 43% (Noti et al., 2013) . Additionally, low AH could exert significant impact on influenza transmission. In China, the RR for influenza (H7N9) at low AH (5 mb) was 11.34 (95%CI: 8.72-14.74) when compared to high AH (20 mb) . Moreover, low AH may contribute to the onset and peak of influenza epidemics (Murray and Morse, 2011) . In the temperate regions of the US, AH was used to predicted the seasonal patterns of influenza (Shaman et al., 2010a; Shaman and Kohn, 2009) .

Additionally, high Wv was found to increase the risk of influenza infections in the study. High Wv could lead to increased infections of influenza, respiratory syncytial virus and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus (du Prel et al., 2009; Firestone et al., 2012; Yuan et al., 2006) . A field study indicated that an increased risk of influenza in horses was associated with Wv of >30 km/h (Firestone et al., 2012) . In India, Wv was positively correlated to an increase risk for influenza (H1N1) (linear regression coefficient: 1.02, p < 0.05) (Lopez et al., 2014) . This may due to the effects of high wind speed on the longer travel of air-borne aerosols, which contributed to the transmission of influenza virus (Ssematimba et al., 2012) .

There are different responses of influenza to climate factors in different climate zones. The area with temperate climate appeared to have greater risk in temperature and humidity, compared to subtropical regions (Wang et al., 2017) . The author reported that this may due to a lower mean temperature and humidity in temperate areas than that in subtropical regions. Influenza virus can survive longer in low temperature, and cold weather also causes increased opportunity of infection by indoor crowding (Cheng et al., 2016; Liao et al., 2005) . Furthermore, low outdoor temperature may lead to increased use of indoor heating facility, which would decline the indoor humidity and promote influenza infections (Chong et al., 2015) .

Additionally, our results indicated that climate factors posted different effects on Flu-A and Flu-B activity. The previous results for the effects on two influenza types were not conclusive. A study from German observed a negative association of temperature with Flu-A hospitalization, but not with Flu-B (du Prel et al., 2009) . The occurrence of Flu-B decreased when temperature increased in Hong Kong, however, no significant finding for Flu-A was reported in the study (Tang et al., 2010) . Flu-A virus seems to change the antigen more frequently than Flu-B virus (Bouvier and Palese, 2008) , which may influence the sensitivity to climate variability.

Moreover, the different associations of Flu-A and Flu-B with DTR may partially resulted from the age distribution of influenza infections. Our previous study in Shanghai and other studies on a global scale showed that Flu-A virus is more transmissible among elderly than young children FRANK et al., 1983; Longini et al., 1982; Ye et al., 2019) . It has been widely accepted that elderly people are more vulnerable to DTR (Lim et al., 2012; Qiu et al., 2013) , thus, Flu-A was positively correlate to DTR in the study. Additionally, the different seasonality of Flu-A and Flu-B may be another potential reason behind. Our previous work demonstrated that Flu-A peaked from December to January, while the peak of Flu-B can last to April (Ye et al., 2019) . The effect of DTR on different influenza type is less well studied, further studies are required to explore such impact.

The regression tree models identified that DTR and MeanT were the key classifying factor in the models of Flu-A and Flu-B separately. This difference may reflect the nature of types of seasonal influenza viruses. In general, the results illustrated that the models could provide the threshold values of the climate variables in seasonal influenza activity linking with official surveillance data.

There are several strengths in the study. First, it is the first attempt to investigate the complex and delayed relationships between multiple climate factors and different types of seasonal influenza viruses in subtropical China. Second, this study based on the data of two sentinel hospitals, which have high surveillance coverage in the study area with well-trained clinicians (Ye et al., 2019) . Third, our findings may also be relevant to the complex transmission patterns of influenza in other countries, especially for subtropical areas.

This study has several limitations. First, the accuracy of results might be impacted by age and sex, we hope can investigate such association by age and sex in our future work. Second, the data accuracy may influenced by the sample collection and processing approaches, as well as patient health seeking behaviour (Dowell, 2001; Lofgren et al., 2007) . Third, air pollutions, host susceptibility and viral migration may also affect the transmission of influenza (Dowell, 2001; Feng et al., 2016; Lofgren et al., 2007) .

The study found complex non-linear relationships between climate variability and seasonal influenza with different risky windows by type in subtropical China. The findings may provide important information for developing early warning systems based on climate factors for seasonal influenza. We suggest the careful use of meteorological variables in influenza prediction in subtropical regions, considering such complex non-linear associations in different types, which may facilitate government and health authorities to better minimize the impacts of seasonal influenza.

Buying Time-The Immune System Determinants of the Incubation Period to Respiratory Viruses,"Respiratory viruses cause disease in humans characterized by an abrupt onset of symptoms. Studies in humans and animal models have shown that symptoms are not immediate and appear days or even weeks after infection. Since the initial symptoms are a manifestation of virus recognition by elements of the innate immune response, early virus replication must go largely undetected. The interval between infection and the emergence of symptoms is called the incubation period and is widely used as a clinical score. While incubation periods have been described for many virus infections the underlying mechanism for this asymptomatic phase has not been comprehensively documented. Here we review studies of the interaction between human pathogenic respiratory RNA viruses and the host with a particular emphasis on the mechanisms used by viruses to inhibit immunity. We discuss the concept of the ""stealth phase"", defined as the time between infection and the earliest detectable inflammatory response. We propose that the ""stealth phase"" phenomenon is primarily responsible for the suppression of symptoms during the incubation period and results from viral antagonism that inhibits major pathways of the innate immune system allowing an extended time of unhindered virus replication.","The incubation period is a common feature of infection by pathogenic viruses. It is defined as the time between infection by a pathogen and the onset of symptoms. Determining the incubation periods of different pathogens assists health authorities control and track the progress of an infectious disease, thus limiting the spread of the pathogen and a possible epidemic. The length of the incubation period varies according to the infectious agent, the host immunological fitness, and previous immunological experience. In humans, it is difficult to determine the length of the incubation period since the exact time of infection is usually unknown. A thorough review of the literature by Lessler et al. [1] showed that the reported incubation periods for human respiratory viruses ranges from around two days for influenza and human rhinovirus (HRV) to 10 days or more for measles virus (MeV).

The abrupt onset of symptoms following infection with respiratory viruses marks the termination of the incubation period. Flu-like symptoms are varied and described by patients as fever and chills, malaise, myalgia, sneezing, cough, runny nose, sinus pain, congestion, headache and others [2, 3] . These symptoms are associated with the secretion of type I interferons (IFNs), interleukin 6 (IL-6), interleukin 8 (IL-8), interleukin 1 (IL-1), tumor necrosis factor  (TNF-), macrophage inflammatory protein-1β (MIP-1β), interferon-γ (IFN-γ) and other cytokines [4] [5] [6] .

While some of the symptoms may be directly related to the virus' cytopathic effect (shedding of damaged epithelium can lead to airway obstruction), most of the symptoms during influenza, MeV and HRV infections are the result of the immune response to the infection [7] . The cause of the symptoms following respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection is controversial and it appears that both direct virus infection and the immune response play a role [8, 9] .

Cytokines are usually observed prior to tissue damage generated by cytotoxic T cells or direct tissue damage caused by the virus infection. Patients treated with type I IFN, TNF-, IL-1β, IL-1α or IL-6 for various illnesses report many flu-like symptoms without actually presenting with a respiratory virus infection [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] . An example of the immune system's contribution to the flu-like symptoms is the fact that administration of TNF-α or type I IFNs can cause headaches [10, 11, 13] .

Fever is mediated by the cytokines mentioned above, mainly IL-1, and is one of the best-understood interactions between the immune system and the nervous system. Although some aspects of the relay signals are unknown, it is largely thought that these cytokines signal the hypothalamus via the peripheral nervous system to increase the thermal set point [15] [16] [17] [18] . Other symptoms also result from the cross talk of the immune system with the nervous system. Sneezing is mediated by the trigeminal nerve. This signal is relayed to the brain stem in response to histamines secreted by leukocytes [19, 20] .

Coughing is mediated by the vagus nerves below the larynx and results from an inflammatory response in the lower respiratory tract [15, 21, 22] .

Nasal discharge (rhinorrhoea) is a combination of goblet cell secretion, gland secretion, plasma exudate, and contains dead leukocytes such as monocytes and neutrophils. The observed color change (from yellow to green) is due to the granule content of these cells [23, 24] .

Many other cytokines, chemokines and growth factors are present at elevated levels in the virus-infected lung and in the serum, demonstrating similar kinetics to the above-mentioned cytokines. The cellular sources of these cytokines are still not completely known but both epithelial and hematopoietic cells are involved.

Before an anti-viral response can take place in infected cells or cells that have been exposed to viral components, viral presence must be sensed. Toll-like receptors (TLRs), Retinoic acid inducible gene I (RIG-I) like receptors (RLRs) and the inflammasome complex take part in this process.

Specialized TLRs for viral sensing are TLR-3 that recognizes dsRNA and localizes to the plasma membrane or endosome [25, 26] . The endosomal TLR-7 and TLR-8 recognize viral single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) [27, 28] . TLR-9 recognizes unmethylated CpG DNA of bacteria and viruses [29, 30] . Some evidence suggests that TLR-4, TLR-6 and TLR-2 play a role in recognition of RSV [31, 32] while MeV hemagglutinin is recognized by TLR-2 [33] (Figure 1 ).

The cytosolic mediators of viral sensing, the RLRs, include the RIG-I and melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5). RIG-I is activated by ssRNA or 5'-triphosphate double stranded RNA (dsRNA) and MDA5 by dsRNA [34] [35] [36] . Both MDA5 and RIGI signal through the mitochondrial-associated protein known as interferon beta promoter stimulator-1 (IPS-1) [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] ( Figure 1 ). The role of a third member of the RLR family, the RNA helicase Lgp2, is less understood. Lgp2 has been implicated both as a negative and positive regulator of MDA5 and RIG-I function [41] [42] [43] .

The inflammasome is a protein complex composed of a number of proteins, among them caspase-1 and different Nod-like receptors (NLR)s. The main inflammasome complex involved in the response to the RNA viruses discussed in this review is NLRP3.

The inflammasome complex is required to generate the active form of the cytokines IL-1β, IL-18 and IL-33. The production of these cytokines requires two signals. Signal one is given by recognition of viral RNA as described above. This leads to increased levels of cytokines mRNA. Signal two activates the inflammasome and is sensed by NLRP3. NLRP3 is activated after exposure to ATP, dsRNA, poly I:C and various crystals such as monosodium urate [44] [45] [46] [47] .In order to produce activated cytokines, pro-IL-1β, pro-IL-18 and pro-IL-33 must be cleaved by caspase-1. Caspase-1 is part of the inflammasome complex that contains NLRP3 and the adapter apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD (ASC) [48] . It has been shown that the NLRP3 inflammasome is required for the production of IL-1β and IL-18 during influenza infection in vivo [49] . It remains unclear whether the inflammasome physically senses these compounds. Recently it was suggested that influenza virus M2, an ion channel, causes changes in ionic concentration in cellular compartments which lead to NLRP3 activation [50] . Figure 1 . Viral antagonism to type I IFN induction and signaling. Many pathogenic viruses are able to inhibit the host cell ability to detect infection through the TLR and RLR pathways, thereby inhibiting the production of type I IFNs and other cytokines. Some viruses are also able to inhibit type I IFNs signaling.

The first indication of an immune response to virus infection is the secretion of type I IFNs. Type I IFNs belong to a family of cytokines consisting of one subtype of IFN-β, 13 subtypes of IFN-α and also IFN-ω, IFN-κ, IFN-ε and IFN-ν. Type III IFNs (IFN-λ) are also produced quickly after infection, and although their function and regulation is less studied than that of type I IFNs, they share similar functions. The existence of multiple IFN-α genes and the fact that virtually all viruses encode proteins that antagonize the production or response to type I IFNs emphasizes their importance during the anti-viral immune response. As we will discuss in more detail later in this review, type I IFNs secretion is delayed in vivo until a few days after infection and is coincident with the end of the incubation period.

The transcriptional regulation of type I IFNs has been comprehensively reviewed [51] . In short, IFN-β is the first type I IFN to be induced following viral recognition. Transcription of IFN-β mRNA requires binding of three groups of transcription factors to the regulatory domain of the IFN promoter; NFκB, activating transcription factor 2 (ATF2)/c-Jun and interferon regulatory factors 3 and 7 (IRF-3 and IRF-7). The activation of all these factors in response to virus infection is induced by triggering either the RLR or TLR systems ( Figure 1 ).

Type I IFNs signaling through its receptor leads to transcription of many interferon responsive genes (ISGs) that limit the virus replication and enhance the immune response. Secreted type I IFNs signal through the IFN-α/β receptor complex (IFNAR), composed of two transmembrane protein subunits, IFNAR1 and IFNAR2, which are present on the surface of every nucleated cell. Sensing of type I IFNs can enhance the production of type I IFNs and other inflammatory cytokines [52, 53] . The dimerization of the two subunits of the IFNAR with IFN- or IFN- leads to activation of the intracellular kinases Jak1 and Tyk2, which phosphorylate the STAT transcription factors leading to the generation of STAT homodimers (STAT1) and heterodimers (STAT1 with STAT2). Phosphorylated STAT1 and STAT2, together with IRF-9, form a complex called interferon-stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3) that translocates to the nucleus and activates the transcription of ISGs [54] (Figure 1 ).

Similarly to type I IFNs, type III IFNs (IFN-λ), which in humans include IL-29, IL-28α and IL-28β, are expressed by many cell types after virus infection or TLR ligand stimulation and have similar effects to those observed with type I IFNs [55, 56] . The receptor for IFN-λ (IFN-λR) is composed by one IFN-λR chain and one IL-10Rβ chain. IFN-λR also signals through the JAK-STAT pathway [57] [58] [59] . Expression of IFN-λR appears to be restricted to non-hematopoietic cells such as epithelial cells.

Given that mammals have evolved a sophisticated detection and response system to viral infections, viruses have adapted to inhibit the initial recognition by the host's immune system. Once the anti-viral response is initiated by type I IFNs signaling, it is rapidly amplified, and thus it is of great importance for the virus to delay this response as long as possible.

Viruses have evolved to inhibit IFN induction in a number of ways; the many functions of the influenza A non-structural protein 1 (NS1) have been recently reviewed [60] . Influenza NS1 inhibits RIG-I and IPS-1 signaling by forming a complex with RIG-I and ssRNA [34, [61] [62] [63] . This explains the inhibition of IRF-3, NFκB, and c-Jun/ATF-2 activation observed upon infection with influenza viruses [64] [65] [66] . In addition, influenza A NS1 blocks virus detection by binding to dsRNA, thereby masking it from detection by RIG-I [67, 68] . Influenza NS1 also inhibits the cellular response by interfering with the processing and export of cellular mRNA [69, 70] .

The paramyxoviruses' ability to inhibit IFN has been reviewed elsewhere [71] . In brief, Sendai virus (SeV), MeV and Mumps virus (MuV) viruses V protein can block the activation of MDA5 [72] [73] [74] [75] . Several V proteins of paramyxoviruses can inhibit IRF-3 activation [76] , for example RSV NS1 and NS2 also block IRF3 activation [77] . RSV NS2 can block type I IFN induction by binding RIG-I and inhibiting downstream signaling [78] .

TLR agonists are potent inducers of cytokine production. It is, therefore, surprising that very little evidence exists for inhibition of the TLR signaling pathway by the viruses discussed above. It has been suggested that certain RSV strains and MeV can inhibit type I IFN induction by TLR-7 and TLR-9 signaling. In the case of MeV, the V protein acts as a decoy substrate for the kinase IκB kinase α, competing with IRF7 [79] [80] [81] . No evidence exists for such inhibition by Influenza, HRV or human parainfluenza virus (hPIV) (Figure 1 ).

Respiratory paramyxoviruses can inhibit the IFN signaling pathway. The C protein of hPIV1 inhibits the translocation of STAT-1 and STAT-2 to the nucleus and the activation of IRF-3 [82, 83] , while the C protein of hPIV3 inhibits the phosphorylation of STAT-1 [84] . Some evidence suggests the C protein of MeV acts to inhibit IFN signaling response [85] . The V protein of MeV appears to form complexes with different signaling proteins in the IFN response pathway preventing either nuclear translocation or their phosphorylation [86] [87] [88] [89] [90] [91] . The NS1 and NS2 proteins of RSV can both block type I IFN and IFN-λ responses [92, 93] . It is thought that STAT2 is actually degraded by NS1 and NS2 [94] (Figure 1) .

Many of the proteins involved in viral recognition, type I and III IFN induction and type I IFN signaling, such as RIG-I, MDA-5, IRF7, STAT1, etc., are themselves type I IFN inducible genes. By blocking IFN induction and signaling the virus also limits the enhancement of the response to infection.

As discussed above, influenza NS1 inhibits the detection of the virus by the host thereby preventing the production of type I IFNs and other cytokines [95] . The inhibition of type I IFN production is of particular importance, since the sensing of type I IFN by neighboring cells generates an anti-viral state in these cells that limits virus propagation. Studies describing the viral proteins required for respiratory virus antagonism are limited to in vitro experiments, in most cases due to poor replication of antagonist deficient viruses in vivo. While it is difficult to extrapolate these observations to the events taking place during a natural infection, studies of influenza NS1 antagonism in vivo provide a model for respiratory virus inhibition of innate immunity.

A close examination of an in vivo influenza virus infection in mice showed that the virus replicates in the lung for almost two days without inducing an innate immune response. We defined this period between early, undetected virus infection and the first signs of an immune response as the ""stealth phase"". Our group showed that the NS1 protein of influenza is responsible for the ""stealth phase"" by hampering cytokine production in vivo. Infection with a virus lacking NS1 triggers an immediate vigorous lung inflammation [96] . Two days after infection with an NS1 competent virus, a robust and abrupt immune response is initiated in the infected lungs. This event demarcates the initiation of innate immunity. The lung innate response includes the production of cytokines (e.g., IL-6, TNF-a, type I IFNs, IFN-γ and IL1-α chemokines (e.g., CCL-2, CCL-20 and KC), the recruitment of diverse cells of the immune system, and the migration of dendritic cells (DCs) to the draining lymph nodes leading to the triggering of T cell responses. This abrupt rise of chemokine is responsible for the recruitment of mononuclear phagocytes, granulocytes and other leukocytes to the site of infection. These recruited cells will play a major role in the eventual clearance of the virus.

Based on several studies, there are a number of possible mechanisms by which the immune system can be stimulated to initiate inflammation.

In an inflamed tissue, the sensing of ""danger signals"" [97] in the form of factors released from infected necrotic or apoptotic cells may stimulate neighboring cells to produce cytokines and chemoattract other immune cells from the blood [98, 99] . Viral RNA released from dying cells may stimulate TLR-7 or TLR-3 upon phagocytosis by plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs), macrophages and other cells culminating in type I IFNs production [100] . The TLR system avoids viral antagonism by rapidly sensing the virus inside endosomal compartments in uninfected phagocytes that culminates in type I IFNs and cytokine production [101, 102] 

Intracellular purine metabolites are released from damaged cells and include uric acid and ATP, which can stimulate the inflammasome complex to cleave pro-IL-1β and intensify the innate response [47, [103] [104] [105] [106] [107] [108] [109] . The inflammasome can also activate type I IFNs production [45] and type I IFNs itself can upregulate AIM2, a protein that contains a pyrin motif that is necessary for promoting IL-1β production. IFN-γ is also involved in this signaling cascade since it can upregulate components of the inflammasome complex [110, 111] .

The natural process by which viruses replicate may contribute to the culmination of the stealth phase. The viral polymerase of many of the viruses discussed here is error-prone. From an evolution or natural selection standpoint, this property has the advantage of promoting rapid mutations in the viral genome, avoiding recognition by the adaptive immune response. However, it is also possible that such a process promotes mistakes in viral replication, such as the generation of mutated, less efficient viral antagonists and defective interfering virus particles (DIs) that may lead to immune recognition. It has been shown in mice that stocks of SeV with high DI content enhance the immune response [112] and MeV vaccine strains induction of type I IFNs correlates with high DI content [113] .

In vitro studies show that cells primed with type I IFNs are able to mount an innate response to an infecting virus, despite viral antagonism. Type I IFN signal transduction turns on transcriptional programs within cells that can decrease the inhibitory effects of the viral antagonists upon infection. Not only does the virus replicate poorly in cells primed with type I IFNs, but also primed cells can secrete pro-inflammatory cytokines more efficiently. It is known that pre-exposure of DCs to type I IFNs upregulates costimulatory molecules and major histocompatibility class I and II (MHCI and MHCII) molecules, improving their function as antigen presenting cells [114] [115] [116] .

In vivo, lung secreted cytokines and chemokines also promote systemic awareness to the virus infection. Type I IFNs can signal to developing leukocytes and memory T cells in primary and secondary lymphoid organs such as the bone marrow and spleen to acquire an anti-viral state and enhance their function [117, 118] . Such an anti-viral state is thought to functionally improve cells of the immune system before they infiltrate the lungs. Type III IFNs are also induced after respiratory virus infection and likely limit virus spread in epithelial cells [119] . Therefore, type III IFN might be induced at the end the of the stealth phase complementing the function of type I IFN. The speed at which this process occurs is controlled by the ability of the virus to suppress inflammation. This observation points out that immune modulation by the pathogen not only targets local lung immunity but also the external intervention of pre-programmed leukocytes with advantageous antiviral machinery.

Finally, the multifaceted inflammatory response can also affect non-hematopoietic cells such as uninfected epithelial cells, protecting them from infection and allowing a more vigorous response upon stimulation.

In close contact to the epithelial border is a tight network of lung DCs [120] that sense viruses and migrate along a CCR7-mediated chemokine gradient [121] to the lung draining mediastinal lymph nodes (MLNs). In the MLNs, the DCs trigger the proliferation and differentiation of virus-specific T cells [96, [122] [123] [124] . Activated virus-specific effector T cells will eventually circulate back to the bloodstream and are then recruited to the respiratory tract to terminate the infection and clear the virus [125, 126] .

Studies tracking DC migration from the lung to the MLNs during influenza infection using fluorescent reagents that induce unspecific inflammation have shown that DCs migrate from the lung to the MLNs rapidly [127] [128] [129] . It is likely that the viral antagonist is unable to inhibit the inflammation triggered by these inflammation inducing fluorescent reagents. However, when no inflammatory agent is present in the tracking reagent, the kinetics of DC migration from the lung to the MLNs during influenza virus infection is quite slow and correlates with the termination of the ""stealth phase"". DC migration begins around two days after infection when small numbers of DCs carrying viral antigens are first seen in the MLNs and reach a plateau around 3-4 days after infection [96, 122, 124, 130] . Therefore, inhibiting inflammation for two days not only affects innate immunity but also delays the initiation of adaptive immunity.

Relationship between the incubation period of influenza virus and the immune response. For the first two days after influenza virus infection, the immune response is inactive (""stealth phase"") due to viral antagonism and no symptoms are observed. The incubation period ends as symptoms abruptly appear about two days after infection when the innate immune response becomes active. The secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines is followed by a robust infiltration of leukocytes to the site of infection and DCs migration from the respiratory tract to the lung draining lymph nodes. The migrating DCs then present viral antigens and activate influenza specific T cells. About six days after infection, virus specific effector T cells infiltrate the lung to resolve the infection.

The incubation period is a helpful definition that describes the time between virus infection and the onset of symptoms. Based on new findings, we propose a model that describes a mechanism of the delayed symptoms (innate immune response) that is likely common to almost all known respiratory virus infections (Figure 2 ). The delayed rise of the innate immune response to a respiratory virus is explained by the suppression of immunity by the viral antagonist in vivo. The ""stealth phase"" is terminated by an initiating event or breakthrough that triggers type I IFN and other cytokines that serve to stimulate cells before they are infected. Type I IFN primed cells are protected from viral antagonism allowing the innate immune response to proceed. Much work must still be done to determine the factors, the sequence of events, and cell types that are relevant to accomplish the end of the incubation period.

"Naturally occurring mutations in PB1 affect influenza A virus replication fidelity, virulence, and adaptability","Background: Mutations in the PB1 subunit of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of influenza A virus can affect replication fidelity. Before the influenza A/H1N1 pandemic in 2009, most human influenza A/H1N1 viruses contained the avian-associated residue, serine, at position 216 in PB1. However, near the onset of the 2009 pandemic, human viruses began to acquire the mammalian-associated residue, glycine, at PB1-216, and PB1-216G became predominant in human viruses thereafter. Methods: Using entropy-based analysis algorithm, we have previously identified several host-specific aminoacid signatures that separated avian and swine viruses from human influenza viruses. The presence of these host-specific signatures in human influenza A/H1N1 viruses suggested that these mutations were the result of adaptive genetic evolution that enabled these influenza viruses to circumvent host barriers, which resulted in cross-species transmission. We investigated the biological impact of this natural avian-to-mammalian signature substitution at PB1-216 in human influenza A/H1N1 viruses. Results: We found that PB1-216G viruses had greater mutation potential, and were more sensitive to ribavirin than PB1-216S viruses. In oseltamivir-treated HEK293 cells, PB1-216G viruses generated mutations in viral neuraminidase at a higher rate than PB1-216S viruses. By contrast, PB1-216S viruses were more virulent in mice than PB1-216G viruses. These results suggest that the PB1-S216G substitution enhances viral epidemiological fitness by increasing the frequency of adaptive mutations in human influenza A/H1N1 viruses.","The genome of influenza A viruses (Family: Orthomyxoviridae) contains eight segments of single-stranded, negative-sense RNA. Antigenic shift results from the reassortment of genomic segments from different strains of influenza A viruses, often from different host species. The unique antigenicity of these newly emerging reassortant strains can evade existing herd immunity against circulating seasonal influenza A viruses, and this type of punctuated antigenic variation has contributed to influenza pandemics throughout history. As a pandemic influenza strain becomes the most prevalent influenza virus in the population, it contributes its unique genetic characteristics to the gene pool of subsequent seasonal influenza viruses.

Since its emergence in early 2009, the swine-origin pandemic 2009 influenza A/H1N1 virus (pdmH1N1) has become a circulating seasonal human influenza virus. Despite its temporal association with swine A/H1N1 [1] , the pdmH1N1 genome contains multiple reassortant viral genes derived from avian influenza viruses [2] . The PB2 and PA genomic segments of pdmH1N1 originated from an avian influenza virus that had previously reassorted into a swine influenza virus in 1998 [3] . The PB1 genomic segment of pdmH1N1 was recently acquired from a human seasonal influenza A/H3N2 virus, which had previously acquired PB1 from an avian influenza virus in 1968 [4] . The hemagglutinin (HA), nucleoprotein (NP), and nonstructural (NS) genomic segments of pdmH1N1 are from a North American swine influenza virus lineage that can be traced to the pandemic 1918 A/ H1N1 virus [5] , and the neuraminidase (NA) and matrix (M) genomic segments are from a Eurasian swine virus that previously acquired both segments from an avian influenza virus in 1979 [6, 7] . The overall influence of the emergence of pdmH1N1 on the gene pool of currently circulating seasonal human influenza viruses remains largely unclear.

Like most RNA viruses, the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of influenza viruses has a higher error rate than that of DNA polymerases because it lacks a proofreading mechanism [8] [9] [10] . Nucleotide misincorporation by RdRp during replication contributes to antigenic drift, which increases the probability of the virus evading host immunity against seasonal influenza viruses. According to the quasispecies theory, the inherent infidelity of RdRp drives the formation of variant clouds in the influenza virus population that consist of diverse genetic variants which are linked through shared mutations. These variants collectively contribute their antigenic characteristics to the influenza virus population, and interact cooperatively at the functional level as selective pressure acts upon the population as a whole [11] . Mutant clouds provide dynamic repositories of variants permitting certain viruses to undergo adaptation to selective pressures, including species barriers, host immune responses, and antiviral agents. An increased mutation rate allows RNA viruses more opportunities to adjust to environmental stresses, whereas elevated RNA replicase fidelity, despite allowing a virus to stably pass on its genetic traits to its progeny, actually serves to restrict genetic diversity among the viruses that occupy the greatest space in the fitness landscape.

Fidelity determinants for an RdRp were first described for poliovirus [12] [13] [14] and chikungunya virus [15] , both of which are single-stranded, positive-sense RNA viruses. Variant viruses of each exhibited a certain degree of attenuation or fitness loss in vivo, which was likely the result of restricting genetic diversity at the cost of increasing fidelity. Site-directed mutagenesis of predicted key residues in the RdRp of Coxsackie virus B3 [16] and the exoribonuclease of coronavirus [17, 18] produced some variants with mutator phenotypes that were less virulent in vivo than the wild-type parent viruses. Altering the fidelity of RdRp clearly affects the virulence and fitness of RNA viruses in vivo, demonstrating the critical role that RdRp plays in balancing pathogenesis with adaptation.

By a large-scale, entropy-based computational algorithm of influenza A virus sequences deposited in the Influenza Virus Database (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/ FLU/ Database/nph-select.cgi?go = database), which is primarily a standard prevalence/frequency analysis, we have previously characterized avian-and human-specific genomic signatures [19] , which showed that most avian viruses contained serine at PB1-216 (96.6%) and valine at PB1-336 (98.8%), whereas all of the pdmH1N1 sequences contained glycine at PB1-216 and isoleucine at PB1-336. PB1-216 and PB1-336 were thus considered to be the host species-associated amino acid positions in influenza A/H1N1 viruses, and that PB1-216G is the human-associated residue, whereas PB1-336I is associated with infections in both swine and humans. At that time, the biological significance of how antigenic variation at PB1 enabled viruses to switch host species was poorly understood. Since then, the pdmH1N1 has become a circulating seasonal human influenza A/H1N1 virus worldwide.

In our current study, we investigated the impact of PB1-216G and PB1-336I on the gene pool of currently circulating seasonal influenza A/H1N1 viruses. We found that the serine-to-glycine point mutation at nucleotide position 216 in PB1 (PB1-S216G) significantly reduced RdRp fidelity. Viruses with PB1-216G demonstrated increased sensitivity to ribavirin and reduced virulence in mice. In cells treated with the NA-specific inhibitor, oseltamivir, PB1-216G viruses generated mutations in NA at a faster rate than PB1-216S viruses. Our findings highlight the need for continuous monitoring to identify emerging adaptive mutations that might contribute to future influenza pandemics.

Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK; ATCC PTA-6500) cells and human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293; ATCC CRL-1573) and HEK 293 T (ATCC CRL-3216) cells were grown in complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/high glucose (DMEM/HG) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. All recombinant viruses were generated in vitro by using reverse genetic methods, as previously described [20] [21] [22] . The HEK293T cells were transfected using the Polyjet DNA transfection reagent (SignaGen, Rockville, MD, USA). The cells were cotransfected with eight pHW2000-based plasmids (1 mg/plasmid), each of which contained one of the eight genomic segments of influenza A virus. Viral genes were expressed under the control of the dual promoters on pHW2000. The inoculums were removed 6 h post-transfection, and replaced with serum free DMEM/HG medium containing 0.1% trypsin (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Between 72 and 120 h post-transfection, the culture supernatants were collected for virus recovery. Recombinant viruses were amplified in MDCK cells for 1 to 3 passages before virus titer determination by plaque assay. Single-nucleotide mutations were introduced into the PB1 plasmid by site-directed mutagenesis, as previously described [23] . The full-length sequences of the eight viral genomic segments were obtained by conventional DNA sequencing. Recombinant PR8 virus contains eight viral genomic segment of PR8, PR8 PB1S216G virus contains eight viral genomic segment of PR8 but the residue 216 on PB1 is replaced from serine to glycine, and PR8PB1 I563R is the residue 563 on PB1 is replaced from Isoleucine to Arginine. Recombinant PR8/TW216 PB1 virus contains seven viral genomic segment of PR8 and PB1 segment of TW126, and recombinant PR8/ TW216 PB1G216S virus is only different from recombinant PR8/TW216 PB1 virus as the residue 216 on PB1 of TW126 is replaced from glycine to serine.

Virus growth curve assay MDCK cells were seeded at 5.0 × 10 5 cells/well in 6-well plates before 24 h infection. MDCK cells were washed with 1 ml PBS twice followed by infecting with viruses at a MOI of 0.001. After incubation 1 h, the cells were washed twice with 1 mL PBS followed by adding 2 ml DMEM/HG medium each well containing 2 mg/ml TPCK-treated trypsin and were incubated at 37°C. The supernatants were collected at indicated hour postinfection.

Viral titer was determined by plaque assay [24] . MDCK cells were seeded at 6.0 × 10 5 cells/well in 6-well plates before virus infection for 24 h at 37°C. Virus titers were evaluated by serial 10-fold dilutions in 6-well plates at 37°C. At 1 h post-infection, cells were washed twice with 1 mL PBS, and the cells overlaid with 2 mL of DMEM/ HG medium supplemented with 0.3% agarose. After incubation for 48 h at 37°C, the cells were fixed in 10% formalin for at least 1 h before crystal violet staining. Virus titers were calculated as the number of plaque forming units (PFU) per milliliter.

All animal experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of National Defense Medical Center (IACUC-10-005). Female BALB/c mice at 4-5 weeks of age were purchased from National Laboratory Animal Center (Taipei, Taiwan), and housed under specific pathogen-free conditions until virus challenge at 6 weeks of age. Four to seven mice per group were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of 0.5 mg zolazepam chlorhydrate (Virbac, Carros, France) before intranasal inoculation with 50 μL virus solution containing 200 PFU or serum free DMEM/HG (control). Mice were observed for illness or death for 14 days. Illness was recorded as lethal if mice lost 25% body weight, and euthanization was performed humanely by CO 2 asphyxiation. For lung titer determination, three to five mice per group were euthanized at 72 h post-infection, and the lungs were homogenized in 1 mL DMEM/HG supplemented with antibiotics and 2.5 μg/mL TPCK-treated trypsin. Homogenates were then centrifuged at 2000×g for 5 min. Supernatants were aliquoted, and stored at − 80°C for viral titrations. The lung viral titers were determined by plaque assay as described previously [24] .

The HEK293 cells were at 1.0 × 10 5 cells/well. Cells were transfected with 400 ng RT2AF in 24-well plates using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) in a total volume of 750 μL/well, according to manufacturer's protocol. Transfection mediums were removed 6 h later, and replaced with fresh medium. At 24 h post-transfection, cells were virus infected (MOI = 0.1). At 48 h post-infection, cells were lysed, and Firefly luciferase (Fluc) and Renilla luciferase (Rluc) activities were measured. Viral replication was measured based on Rluc activity, and the mutation potential was calculated as the cumulative mutation index (CMI), whereby CMI = Fluc/Rluc. For the detail descriptions, please refer to Additional file 1: Figure S2 .

Replication capability and cumulative mutation index (CMI) by dual-luciferase RT2AF reporter Briefly, influenza virus RdRP minireplicon: 1.0 × 1 0 5 HEK 293 cells seeded in 24-well plates before 24 h were transfected using Polyjet DNA transfection reagent (Sig-naGen, Rockville, MD) according to the manufacturer's protocol (www.signagen.com). Two hundred nanograms of expression plasmids encoding PB2, PA, NP and wildtype PB1 or PB1-216 variant were cotransfected with 200 ng RT2AF reporter (Fig. 3a) . After 48 h post transfection, cells were lysed and Firefly (Flu) and Renilla (Rlu) luciferase activities were measured using the Dual-Glo Luciferase Assay System (Promega) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The replication capability of RdRp by relative Rlu luciferase activity and mutation potential (CMI) by Fluc/Rluc ratio were calculated.

The HEK293 cells were transfected with RT2AF reporter as described above. At 24 h post-transfection, cells were treated with ribavirin for 4 h, before viral infection. At 48 h post-infection, cells were lysed, and Fluc and Rluc luciferase activities were measured.

The PB1 protein sequences of avian, swine, and human H1N1 (Fig. 1a) and H3N2 (Fig. 1b) determined for PB1-216 and PB1-336. Genomic sequence (8 genomic segments) data for human A/H1N1 viruses were downloaded from GenBank on March 10, 2018. For the whole viral genome analysis, the various genomes were first divided into two groups based on whether the PB1-216 residue was G or S. The NA segments from each group were then aligned to identify NA mutations in oseltamivir-resistant variants ( Table 2) .

Wild-type PR8 and PR8 PB1(S216G) viruses were passaged twice in MDCK cells at an MOI of 0.001. Viral supernatant for viral RNA was subjected to reverse transcription using the SuperScript III reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies) with universal primer (5′-AGCRAAG-CAGG-3′). The HA cDNA was amplified by the Phusion High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase (Thermo Scientific) with forward and reverse primers (5′-AGCAAAAGCAGGG-GAAAATA-3′ and 5′-GTCCTGTAACCATCCTCAAT-3′). PCR product was cloned into pJET1.2/blunt using the CloneJET PCR Cloning Kit (Thermo Scientific) according to manufacturer's protocol. Clones were sequenced in an ABI Prism 3700 sequence analyzer (Applied Biosystems).

The HEK293 cells were infected with PR8 or PR8 PB1(S216G) (MOI = 0.01) for 48 h. The cells were serial passaged while incrementally increasing the concentration of oseltamivir (Toronto Research Chemicals). The concentrations of oseltamivir from 1 to 625 nM, approximately 0.25-(4.2 nM) to 148-fold IC50 [25] , were added gradually up to 625 nM, which were maintained from passage 5 thereafter until passage 14 as described in Additional file 1: Figure S4a . The culture supernatants were collected at 48 h after each passage, as previously described [26] .

For the conventional Sanger sequencing analysis, viral RNA purified and reverse transcription described as above. The cDNA was amplified by PCR using NA-specific primer set A (5′-AATGAGCTGCCCTGTCGGTG-3′ and 5′-TACTTGTCAATGSTGAAYGG-3′) or primer set B (5′-AGCAAAAGCAGGAGTTTAAA-3′ and 5′-GGTTTCAGTTATTAGCC GTTG-3′) respectively. The PCR products were subjected to direct Sanger sequencing. For deep sequencing analysis, nucleotides 523-921 of NA, which correspond to amino acids 189-321 in PR8, were sequenced by Genomics Ltd. (Taiwan) on the Illumina MiSeq platform. The cDNA was PCR amplified using the following barcoded primers: PR8 (5′-ACAGT-GAATGGGVTGGCTAACAATCGG-3′ and 5′-ACAGT GATGTCACCGAAAA CCCCACTG-3′) and PR8 PB1(S2 16G) (5′-GCCAATAATGGGVTGGC TAACAATCGG-3′ and 5′-GCCAATATGTCACCGAAAACCCCACTG-3′). Total reads obtained were over 2.5 million per strain, and output data were > 2 gb over the 399-bp target with a mean quality score of 38.3 ± 0.8. Output data was first sorted by barcode sequence that represented the NA plasmid, NA of PR8, and NA of PR8 PB1(S216G) . Given the general error rate of the Invitrogen SuperScript III reverse transcriptase [27] used in this study is 3.4 × 10 − 5 , we arbitrarily defined the cut-off value as > 10 mutations in 1 million reads. Therefore, positions at which mutations occurred at a frequency higher than 10 − 5 were considered significantly variable.

Amino acid position 216 in PB1 of influenza A/H1N1 is a species-associated position that distinguishes between human and avian influenza viruses after the emergence of pdmH1N1

By entropy-based computational approach to characterize avian-human signatures, we have previously identified several human-associated positions on pandemic H1N1 2009 virus genome that were all within the internal genes of RdRP complex [19] . In fact, this pandemic 2009 virus strain had subsequently become a human seasonal influenza A/H1N1 strain currently circulating worldwide. We were interested in monitoring the characteristic change in amino acids that may be attributed to the emergence of pandemic 2009 virus and its current offspring of human seasonal A/H1N1. From our previous study, PB1-216 was one of the species-associated positions identified for its exclusively human-like residue Gly found in all pandemic 2009 H1N1 viruses and yet, before this pandemic episode, most human influenza A/H1N1 deposited were an avian signature Ser at PB1-216 as their coexisting avian A/ H1N1 influenza viruses [19] . In contrast, regardless of pandemic impact, we observed PB1-336 of pandemic H1N1 2009 virus still remained human-like residue Ile while avian influenza H1N1 were almost an avian-associated Val [19] . This observation implies there may be a major transitioning pattern from avian to human occurred amongst different influenza A virus populations during pandemic 2009 outbreak. To further understand the significance of the point mutations PB1-S216G and PB1-V336I in pdmH1N1, we first investigated the chronological changes at these nucleotide positions between A/ H1N1 and A/H3N2 viruses collected from different hosts of avian, swine, and human deposited in the Influenza Virus Database. We found that most of the avian A/H1N1 viruses contained PB1-216S and PB1-336 V both before and after 2009 (Fig. 1a) . Most of the human A/H1N1 viruses also contained the avian-associated residue, serine, at PB1-216 before 2009. However, with the emergence of pdmH1N1 in 2009, most of the human A/H1N1 viruses primarily had PB1-216G likely via genome reassortment, which thereafter remained the most prevalent residue glycine at that position. By contrast, most human A/H1N1 viruses contained the mammalian-associated residue, isoleucine, at PB1-336 both before and after 2009. Swine A/ H1N1 viruses exhibited frequent substitutions between the avian-and mammalian-associated residues at both PB1-216 and PB1-336, reflecting the susceptibility of swine to both avian and human influenza viruses and humans on the other hand can be also infected by swine influenza viruses. In A/H3N2 viruses, some substitutions between avian and mammalian signatures were readily observed at PB1-216 and PB1-336 collected from avian and swine viruses (Fig. 1b) , with essentially none of the human A/H3N2 viruses exhibiting such changes before or after the emergence of pdmH1N1. Indeed, PB1-216G was most prevalent among human A/ H3N2 viruses long before 2009. Given that the PB1 genomic segment of pdmH1N1 virus was recently acquired from a human seasonal A/H3N2 virus [3] , we examined sequences deposited before 2006 to determine whether an avian to mammalian substitution had previously occurred in human A/H3N2 viruses. We found that the PB1-S216G point mutation indeed occurred in 1993, after which PB1-216G remained the most prevalent signature in PB1 in human A/ H3N2 viruses (Additional file 1: Figure S1 ). These observations suggested that the substitution from the avian-associated residue, serine, to the human-associated residue, glycine, at PB1-216 at the onset of the 2009 pandemic was the result of robust evolutionary adaptation that has impacted currently circulating seasonal human A/H1N1 viruses worldwide.

The A/Taiwan/126/2009 (TW126) virus, a clinical isolate of pdmH1N1 from Taiwan [24] that contained PB1-216G, was reported to be less virulent in mice, as compared with the A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (PR8) virus [28] , a widely-used influenza A/H1N1 laboratory reference strain containing PB1-216S [19] . TW126 PB1 contains the typical human signatures of Gly at PB1-216 and Ile at PB1-336; in contrast, the laboratory reference strain, PR8, exhibits avian signatures at the corresponding positions of PB1. To examine whether this difference in pathogenicity in mice was associated with the avian and mammalian signatures in the PB1 sequences of TW126 and PR8, we first used a reverse genetic to recover PR8/TW126 PB1 , a reassortant PR8 virus containing the whole PB1 genomic segment of TW126. We also generated the PR8/ TW126 PB1(G216S) variant by PB1-G216S point mutation in PR8/TW126 PB1 . To evaluate the effects of these mutations, we compared the replication and virulence of PR8/TW126 PB1 , PR8/TW126 PB1(G216S) , and parental PR8 in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells and intranasally inoculated BALB/c mice.

Growth curves for PR8/TW126 PB1 , PR8/TW126 PB1(G216S) , and PR8 in MDCK cells were similar (p > 0.05; Fig. 2a ). In mice, infection with PR8/TW126 PB1(G216S) caused significantly higher lung-tissue virus titers (p = 0.0136) and lower survival (p = 0.032), as compared with PR8/TW126 PB1 (Fig.  2b , c) that exhibited significantly higher survival than both PR8 (p < 0.0001) and PR8/TW126 PB1(G216S) (p = 0.032). To further investigate the role of PB1-216S in virulence in mice, we used PR8 virus to generate the PR8 PB1(S216G) and PR8 PB1(I563R) variants. We used the PR8 PB1(I563R) variant as a control for our experiments because the I563R mutation in PB1 was not expected to affect polymerase activity or fidelity. Growth curves of PR8 PB1(S216G) in MDCK cells were similar to those of PR8, PR8/TW126 PB1 , PR8/ TW126 PB1(G216S) , and PR8 PB1(I563R) (p > 0.05 for all; Fig.  2a ). In mice infected with PR8 PB1(I563R) , lung-tissue virus titers and survival were similar to those for PR8-infected mice (p > 0.05 for both; Fig. 2b , c). Mice infected with PR8 PB1(S216G) had significantly lower lung-tissue virus titers (p = 0.0087), and exhibited improved survival (p = 0.0258), as compared with PR8-infected mice. These results indicated that avian-associated PB1-216S is a major virulence determinant for influenza A/H1N1 viruses in mice. By the lethal challenge test in mice, the biological significance could be readily observed because of the difference between PB1-216S and PB1-216G containing viruses (Fig. 2c) ; influenza A viruses with PB1-216S appeared to be more virulent than virus with PB1-216G.

PB1-S216G in A/H1N1 viruses contributes to higher mutation frequency at comparable replication levels Viral RNA reporter genes have been used to quantify the replication and mutation frequency of HIV reverse transcriptase [29] and the RdRp of Cucumber mosaic virus [30] . Because RdRp fidelity has been associated with the virulence of influenza A viruses in mice [31] , we investigated whether the PB1-S216G point mutation affects mutation frequency of PR8 and PR8 PB1(S216G) . We constructed an artificial influenza genomic segment containing the dual luciferase RNA reporter gene [32] , RT2AF, which contained the open reading frames for Firefly and Renilla luciferases connected in tandem by a UAA stop codon (Fig. 3a) . Replication capability was determined based on Renilla luciferase (Rluc) activity. The ratio of the activities of Firefly luciferase (Fluc) and Rluc was used to quantify RdRp fidelity based on the frequency of stop codon repair during viral replication and transcription of RT2AF, which was expressed as the cumulative mutation index (CMI), whereby CMI = Fluc/ Rluc (Additional file 1: Figure S2 ). In influenza-virus-infected HEK293 cells transfected with RT2AF, we found that, while virus replication levels were similar between PR8, PR8 PB1(S216G) and PR8 PB1(I563R) (Fig. 3b) , the PR8 PB1(S216G) variant exhibited a significantly higher CMI as compared with PR8 and PR8 PB1(I563R) (p = 0.0014 and p = 0.0059, respectively; Fig. 3c ).

In addition, combined with expression constructs for the polymerase subunits PB2, PB1, PA and NP proteins, this dual-luciferase RT2AF reporter replicon system allows to quickly measure replication capability and evaluate mutation potential for the given influenza RdRp activity using various PB1-216 variants. Using such minireplicon assay system, we in Fig. 3d and e compared the replication capability and mutation potential between pairs of PR8 (PB2 + PA + NP)/PR8 (PB1-216S) and PR8 (PB2 + PA + NP)/PR8 (PB1-S216G), PR8 (PB2 + PA + NP)/TW126 (PB1-216G) and PR8 (PB2 + PA + NP)/TW126 (PB1-G216S), as well as TW126 (PB2 + PA + NP)/TW126 (PB1-216G) and TW126 (PB2 + PA + NP)/TW126 (PB1-G216S), respectively. The replication capability of RdRp by measuring Rluc activity were not significantly different (Fig. 3d) , indicating that swapping between Gly and Ser at PB1-216 did not affect RdRp replication levels. However, the mutation potential of RdRp determined by CMI (Fig. 3e) showed that RdRp complex having PB1-216G derived from different viruses could all exhibit significantly higher mutation capability than PB1-216S; especially for the experimental groups of TW126 (PB2 + PA + NP)/TW126 (PB1-216G) and TW126 (PB2 + PA + NP)/TW126 (PB1-G216S), from which all four polymerase subunits of PB2, PB1, PA and NP proteins could be closely interactive during viral replication as they were in the native background of TW126 virus, a clinical isolate of pdmH1N1 from Taiwan. In this study, the results from Fig. 3 were further confirmed by using a previously described conventional assay for determining RdRp nucleotide incorporation fidelity and clonal sequencing [31] that had compared the frequency of mutations in HA of PR8 with that of PR8 PB1(S216G) . As these results shown in Table 1 , the mutation frequency of PR8 PB1(S216G) was significantly greater than that of PR8 (p = 0.025). The combined results of our experiments indicated that the PB1-216G mammalian signature in influenza A/H1N1 viruses confers lower RdRp fidelity than the PB1-216S avian signature, and thereby increases the frequency of mutations during viral replication.

Ribavirin is a nucleotide analog targeting RdRp that causes lethal hypermutation in RNA viruses [28, 33] . In a previous study a mutant variant of poliovirus t-test for (a-b) . c Groups of 18 female BALB/c mice at 6 weeks of age were challenged by infections of PR8, PR8/TW126 PB1 , PR8/TW126 PB1(G216S) , PR8 PB1(S216G) , or PR8 PB1(I563R) . Survival rates of the infected mice were recorded daily for 14 days. Log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test was used to confirm the statistically significant differences in survival rate. *#p = 0.032; *p = 0.0258; **p = 0.0048; and ****p < 0.0001 that exhibited enhanced RdRp fidelity was more resistant to ribavirin treatment than wild-type poliovirus with low RdRp fidelity [12] , likely because such a faithful RdRp generated less mutations during viral replication. Similar observations were also reported for HIV studies [34, 35] , in which the high fidelity of reverse transcriptase could reduce the lethal toxicity of nucleoside analogue 2′,3′-dideoxy-3′-thiacytidine (3TC) by making less mutations during retroviral replication. In this study, to examine the effect of the PB1-S216G point mutation on resistance to ribavirin treatment, we compared the replication of PR8 and PR8 PB1(S216G) viruses in RT2AF-transfected HEK293 cells in the presence of various concentrations of ribavirin. We found that the ribavirin-mediated inhibition of PR8 PB1(S216G) replication was significantly greater than that of PR8 especially at 1 and 2 μM ribavirin (Fig. 4) . This result indicated that the PB1-S216G point mutation of influenza A virus could not only reduce RdRp fidelity but also increase sensitivity to ribavirin during replication, consistent with the results from the previous reports concerning poliovirus and HIV [12, 34, 35] .

There has been considerable discussion concerning how low replication fidelity in RNA viruses might contribute to adaptive evolution and enhanced viral fitness in infected hosts by increasing genetic diversity in virus populations [27] . A previous study of chikungunya virus variants found that increased RdRp fidelity resulted in reduced genetic diversity and lower Fig. 3 Effects of the PB1-S216G mutation on replication capability and mutation potential in virus-infected cells using the dual-luciferase RT2AF reporter. a Schematic diagram of mutability assay for influenza RdRp. The dual-luciferase RT2AF reporter is flanked by the 5′ and 3′ UTR sequences of the WSN-NP genome, and transcription was controlled by the human PolI promoter and the murine terminator. b Replication capability was calculated based on Rluc luciferase activity and c the mutation potential was calculated as cumulative mutation index (CMI) based on the Fluc/ Rluc ratio. d and e Mutation potential of RdRp from PB1-216 variants was measured by influenza minireplicon system. The PB2, PA, NP expression plasmids plus wild-type PB1 or PB1-216 variant plasmids were co-transfected with RT2AF reporter in HEK 293 cells. After 72 h, the replication capability (d) by Rlu luciferase activity and mutation potential (Cumulative Mutation Index; CMI) (e) by Fluc/Rluc ratio were evaluated in the indicated PB1 plasmids containing either 216S or 216G, respectively. Error bars indicate the standard error of the mean of three independent experiments. Student's two-tailed unpaired t-test was performed to determine the P value; NS, not significant (p > 0.05) fitness in natural mosquito hosts and newborn mice, compared with that of a wild-type chikungunya virus [15] . In a previous study of poliovirus variants, increased fidelity resulted in a less diversified population and reduced adaptation under adverse growth conditions [11, 12] . The V43I mutation in influenza PB1 is associated with high-fidelity RdRp [31] . Our analysis of influenza A virus sequences showed that PB1-43I did not appear in human influenza A viruses, and occurred only rarely in avian H5N1, swine H3N2, and swine H1N1 viruses (Additional file 1: Figure S3 ), thereby excluding it as a factor in the displacement of PB1-216S viruses by PB1-216G viruses.

Viral neuraminidase inhibitors (NAIs), such as oseltamivir, are not mutagens per se, but do contribute to the emergence of NAI-resistant mutations within the NA gene as the result of random RdRp-mediated nucleotide misincorporation during viral replication in NAI-treated cells. Previous studies of influenza A/ H1N1viruses have reported NA mutations, including NA-H274Y/H275Y and NA-N294S, that contributed to oseltamivir resistance [26, [36] [37] [38] . To gain insight into how low-fidelity PB1-216G variants replaced PB1-216S after the emergence of pdmH1N1, we examined the incidence of mutations that conferred oseltamivir resistance from 2006 to 2017. We found that the incidence of oseltamivir resistance in 2006 and 2007 was much lower than that in 2008, after which an NA-H275Y point mutation coincided with a steep rise in the incidence of oseltamivir resistant mutations worldwide (Additional file 1: Table S1 ). In mid-2009, the oseltamivir-sensitive pdmH1N1 virus (PB1-216G/NA-275H) emerged (Fig. 1a) , the number of oseltamivir-resistant NA-275Y viruses decreased rapidly. Thus, the rapid displacement of NA-275Y by NA-275H coincided with the displacement of the avian 216S signature by the mammalian 216G signature in the field.

The data in Additional file 1: Table S1 also show that five distinctly different NA mutations conferring oseltamivir resistance (S246 N, D198G, D198N , D198GY, and Y155H) occurred after the 2009 pandemic. This pattern in oseltamivir resistance was confirmed in the whole genome analysis, which showed that most NA-275H/ PB1-216G viruses were oseltamivir sensitive, and oseltamivir resistant NA-275Y/PB1-216S viruses contained at least one of these five NA mutations (Table 2 ). We then examined the incidence of the permissive secondary mutations, NA-V241I and NA-N369K, which have been shown to that improve fitness in NA-275Y viruses [39] . The incidence of NA-241I and NA-369 K decreased during the first half of 2009; however, the number of viruses with NA-241I or NA-369Ks increased after 2009, and The relative replication capability was determined by Rluc/Rluc (without ribavirin) ratio. Error bars, standard error of the mean of three independent experiments; NS, not significant (p > 0.05) by Student's two-tailed unpaired t-test; ****p < 0.0001; and **p = 0.0024

Wild-type PR8 and PR8 PB1(S216G) viruses were passaged twice in MDCK cells. The HA cDNA was amplified from viral supernatant, and cloned into pJET1.2/blunt as described in the Methods. The HA mutation frequency was determined by clonal sequencing of 94 to 105 bacterial clones for each experiment were picked and repeated independently three times. *by Student's two-tailed unpaired t-test; NS Not significant became predominant by 2011 (Additional file 1: Table  S1 ).

To investigate whether RdRp fidelity affects influenza A virus adaptation under a stress, we used a modified version of a previously described method for the in vitro selection of oseltamivir-resistant pdmH1N1 variants [26] to assess the effects of the PB1-S216G point mutation on the frequency of mutations in NA conferring oseltamivir resistance in PR8. As shown in Additional file 1: Figure S4a , PR8 and PR8 PB1(S216G) infected MDCK cells were serial passaged with successive incubation in progressively higher concentrations of oseltamivir, reaching a maximum concentration of 625 nM oseltamivir at passage 5 and thereafter. The NA gene sequence was determined after each passage by conventional Sanger sequencing of viral cDNA, which allowed the identification of mutations in a single, relatively long read without the assembly and annotation of shotgun sequencing data obtained using high-throughput methods [36] . The NA N294S mutation was first detected in PR8 PB1(S216G) at passage 7, and serine was the most prevalent residue at NA-294 at passage 9 and thereafter (Additional file 1: Figure S4b , right). No other mutations were detected in the NA gene of PR8 PB1(S216G) . The NA H274Y mutation was first detected at passage 11 in PR8 that had PB1-216S, and tyrosine became the most prevalent residue at NA-274 at passage 14 (Additional file 1: Figure S4b, left) . These results illustrate that PB1-S216G in A/H1N1 viruses could acquire adaptive mutations in NA conferring oseltamivir resistance at a higher frequency than viruses with PB1-G216S in A/H1N1 viruses. Nevertheless, it remains unclear as how two different NA mutations could have independently emerged from PR8 or PR8 PB1(S216G) under selection pressure.

Given that the virus strains used in the above-mentioned experiments were synchronized at passage 5, we investigated whether NA N294S and NA H274Y were merely preexisting mutants in the PR8 PB1(S216G) and PR8 populations, respectively. Following reverse genetics recovery, nucleotides 523 to 921 (amino acid positions 189 to 321) in the NA gene of PR8 and PR8 PB1(S216G) at passage 5 were subjected to deep sequencing. This region was selected because it included all the positions at which we had previously identified NA mutations conferring oseltamivir resistance by Sanger sequencing, and previous studies have shown that the majority of mutations conferring NAI resistance in influenza A viruses have occurred in this region of the NA gene [40] .

Our analysis showed that, at passage 5, a total of 104 and 109 mutations had occurred in PR8 PB1(S216G) and PR8, respectively, among which 93 were shared between these two viruses (Fig. 5a) . The remaining mutations in PR8 PB1(S216G) (n = 11) and PR8 (n = 16) were unique to each virus (Fig.  5b ). In addition, at passage 5 there were no oseltamivir-resistant mutations of NA N294S and NA H274Y could be detected in either PR8 PB1(S216G) or PR8 by NGS analysis, which strongly suggests that these were adaptive mutations that conferred NAI resistance in cell-based selection system observed in Additional file 1: Figure S4a and b. Moreover, these results showed that both PR8 and PR8 PB1(S216G) generated comparable levels of population diversity in the absence of substantial selective pressure, as evidenced by the similarly large number of mutations that were present in each virus at passage 5 (Fig. 5b ).

Although most human A/H3N2 viruses had avian-associated PB1-216S from 1968 to 1991, a substitution to mammalian-associated PB1-216G occurred near the end of that period, and PB1-216G became predominant in human A/H3N2 viruses thereafter (Additional file 1: Figure S1 ). In 2009, an A/H1N1 virus contained this mammalian PB1-216G signature by PB1 reassortment originated from A/H3N2, resulting in the emergence of pdmH1N1 (Fig. 1a) . We in this study investigated the biological significance of the PB1-S216G point mutation in human A/H1N1 viruses. Table 2 Whole genome analysis of correlation between PB1-S216G and NA mutations conferring oseltamivir resistance in human influenza A/H1N1 viruses Genome sets were retrieved from the Influenza Virus Database (GenBank). The NA sequences for PB1-216S viruses (blue) and PB1-216G viruses (red) were aligned and analyzed to identify NA mutations conferring oseltamivir resistance and permissive secondary mutations in NA (V241I and N369K)

The virulence of pdmH1N1 in mice has been shown to be less than that of PR8, an A/H1N1 reference strain containing the avian signature, PB1-216S [28] . We found that PR8 was more virulent in mice than the reassortant virus, PR8/TW126 PB1 , which contains the mammalian PB1-216G signature, despite sharing 99% homology with PR8 PB1 (Fig. 2c) . Producing the avian signature at PB1-216 in PR8/ TW126 PB1(G216S) virus appeared to restore virulence to a level similar to that of PR8 (Fig. 2c) , and producing the mammalian signature in PR8 PB1(S216G) virus on the other hand reduced virulence, as compared to PR8 (Fig. 2c) . These results clearly demonstrated the importance of PB1-216 as a virulence determinant for influenza A/H1N1 viruses in mice.

Using ribavirin to select for resistant viruses, the molecular basis of fidelity determinants within the RdRp gene have been identified for some RNA viruses, including poliovirus [12, 13] , Chikungunya virus [15] , and the influenza A/H3N2 and H5N1 viruses [31] . Ribavirin-resistant viruses typically contained mutations within the RdRp gene causing elevated-fidelity phenotypes that exhibited lower fitness and/or lower virulence in infected animals, compared with the parental viruses. Among these high-fidelity RdRp mutations in ribavirin-resistant variants, the PB1 V43I variant of influenza A/H5N1 exhibited reduced virus population diversity, attenuated virulence, and low neurotropism in mice [31] . By contrast, the mutation of key residues in the RdRp of Coxsackievirus B3 [16] and the exoribonuclease of coronaviruses [17, 18] generated virus variants exhibiting elevated mutation frequencies and attenuated virulence in mice.

We have previously identified several host-specific amino-acid signatures that separated avian and swine viruses from human influenza viruses via entropybased algorithm analysis of influenza A/H1N1 sequences deposited in GenBank [19, 41] . The presence of these host-specific signatures in human influenza A/H1N1 viruses suggested that these mutations were the result of adaptive genetic evolution that enabled these influenza viruses to circumvent host barriers, which likely resulted in cross-species transmission. Our data show that the avian-to-mammalian signature substitution (serine-to-glycine) at PB1-216 in pdmH1N1 is highly suggestive of avian/swine to human influenza virus transmission contributing to the influenza outbreak that caused [19, 42] . However, the mechanisms through which this host-signature substitution ultimately affected the virulence and fitness of pdmH1N1 has remained unclear. It is worth further investigating how the change of 3-D structure of viral polymerase complex at PB1-216 between serine and glycine in influenza A/H1N1 fine-tunes RdRp's fidelity during virus replication.

The results of our current study further showed that this natural switch from serine to glycine at PB1-216 increased the mutation frequency of pdmH1N1 by reducing the fidelity of RdRp ( Fig. 3 ; Table 1 ). The A/H1N1 viruses with PB1-216G were more sensitive to ribavirin inhibition (Fig. 4) , and acquired oseltamivir-resistant mutations in vitro at a faster rate than those with PB1-216S in cell-based selection system. Although the mutation potential of PR8 PB1(S216G) was greater than that of PR8 as the result of reduced RdRp fidelity in the PB1-216G variant, similar levels of genetic diversity were observed in the population of each virus (Fig. 5) , an observation that contrasts sharply with the reduced genetic diversity reported for viruses with high-fidelity RdRp mutations [31] . In addition, the virulence of the low-fidelity PR8 PB1(S216G) virus in mice was attenuated relative to that of the PR8 parent virus (Fig. 2c) , which is inconsistent with the attenuated phenotype previously reported for a high-fidelity influenza A/H5N1 PB1(V43I) variant obtained under ribavirin selection [31] However, this observation was consistent with the previously reports concerning certain viruses with lowered fidelity indeed displayed an attenuated property in vivo [16] [17] [18] .

We determined that the difference in mutation frequency between PR8 and PR8 PB1(S216G) was approximately 20% by conventional sequencing (Table 1) and approximately 30% by minireplicon reporter assay (Fig.  3 ). Although these differences in mutation frequency are relatively small, the effects of the PB1-S216G point mutation in PR8 PB1(S216G) on replication and adaptation, compared to that of PR8, were readily apparent in the results of the ribavirin inhibition assay (Fig. 4) and in vitro NAI assay (Additional file 1: Figure S4 ). These observations indicate that influenza viruses that may differ subtly in RdRp fidelity can generate a variety of variants under clinically relevant conditions, exhibit similar infectivity and growth characteristics, and generate comparable levels of population diversity.

Since the 2009 pandemic outbreak, human influenza A/H1N1 viruses with PB1-216G have become widespread worldwide, and are now major seasonal influenza viruses that currently co-circulate with influenza A/H3N2 and influenza B viruses. In contrast to the current exclusively predominance of PB1-216G in human A/H1N1 viruses, our analysis of influenza A virus sequences deposited in GenBank ( Fig. 1 ; Additional file 1: Figure S3 ) showed that PB1-216S remained predominant in avian influenza A/H1N1 viruses. We also found that, while the PB1-43I mutation associated with high-fidelity RdRp [31] occurred rarely in avian H5N1 and swine H3N2 as well as swine H1N1 viruses, it was not found in human influenza A viruses. These results indicated that, although the high-fidelity PB1-43I influenza A variant can be obtained by reverse genetics and occurs sporadically in the field, it confers no significant evolutionary advantage relative to PB1-43 V viruses.

We focused our investigation on identifying the biological mechanism by which the low-fidelity PB1-216G variant replaced the human influenza A/H1N1 viruses with PB1-216S that existed prior to the 2009 influenza pandemic. We found that the incidences of oseltamivir resistance in human influenza A/H1N1 viruses in 2006 and 2007 were much lower than that in 2008, at which time the emergence of oseltamivir resistant variants rose steeply worldwide due to an NA-H275Y point mutation. The frequency of NA-275Y peaked in the first quarter of 2009, with nearly all NA deposits containing the mutation (Additional file 1: Table S1 ). However, during the mid-2009, the oseltamivir-sensitive pdmH1N1 virus emerged, which contained NA-275H, and pdmH1N1 rapidly displaced oseltamivir-resistant NA-275Y viruses afterwards. The proportion of oseltamivir-resistant NA-275Y A/H1N1 viruses with avian-associated PB1-216S increased rapidly to predominance in the human influenza A/H1N1 population in the first half of 2009, and were subsequently replaced with oseltamivir-sensitive pdmH1N1 at an equally rapid rate (Additional file 1: Table S1 ). Nonetheless, this change in oseltamivir sensitivity at the population level coincided closely with the rising prevalence of mammalianassociated low-fidelity PB1-216G in influenza A/H1N1 viruses near the onset of the 2009 influenza pandemic ( Fig.  1 ; Table 2 ). One appealing hypothesis is that the higher-fidelity RdRp (PB1-216S) of the oseltamivir-resistant NA-275Y A/H1N1 viruses resulted in higher replication rate in the absence oseltamivir selective pressure, thereby rapidly increasing the proportion of these viruses in the population during the swine influenza pandemic in the first quarter of 2009. This rapid rise to predominance was followed by the development of a certain unidentified environmental bottleneck(s) plus the acquisition of low-fidelity PB1-216G by an NA-275H A/H1N1 virus that remained continuously present in the population, which allowed it to undergo adaptive mutation at a higher rate than that of the higher-fidelity oseltamivir-resistant NA-275Y/PB1-216S viruses, thereby contributing to the extinction of PB1-216S viruses following the 2009 pandemic.

The data in Additional file 1: Table S1 show that, prior to the midpoint of 2009, oseltamivir resistance was associated almost exclusively with NA-275Y viruses, whereas five additional, distinctly different NA mutations (S246 N, D198G, D198N, D198GY, and Y155H) were also associated with oseltamivir resistance following the 2009 pandemic. Whole genome analysis focusing on the PB1 and NA sequences confirmed this pattern in oseltamivir resistance in NA-H275Y/PB1-216S viruses, and showed that, while most NA-H275H/PB1-216G viruses were oseltamivir sensitive, those that were resistant to oseltamivir contained at least one of the above-mentioned NA mutations, in addition to the predominant H275Y ( Table 2 ). The lower prevalence of oseltamivir-resistant NA-H275Y in human PB1-216G-A/ H1N1 viruses was apparently not due to the absence of the permissive secondary mutations, NA-241I and NA-369 K, that confer robust fitness in NA-275Y viruses [39] Although the prevalence of NA-241I and NA-369 K decreased temporarily during the second half of 2009, both of these permissive secondary mutations had become predominant once again in 2011 (Additional file 1: Table S1 ). These observations suggested that the greater diversity of NA mutations conferring oseltamivir resistance among current human A/H1N1 influenza viruses is the result of higher mutation frequency due to PB1-216G-driven low-fidelity RdRp, which facilitates adaptive mutations in NA under the selective pressure of NAIs, such as oseltamivir.

In summary, we found that naturally occurring mutations at PB1-216 in influenza A/H1N1 viruses affect replication fidelity, virulence, and adaptability. Our results suggest that the presence of the mammalian signature, PB1-216G, in human A/H1N1 viruses reduces RdRp fidelity, which confers a growth advantage by increasing the probability of adaptive mutations, relative to that of human A/H1N1 viruses bearing the avian signature, PB1-216S. Our results also suggest that, with a canonical low-fidelity RdRp, the increased adaptability and fitness of PB1-216G viruses in human host were the biological mechanisms underlying the replacement of PB1-216S viruses with relative higher fidelity RdRp following the emergence of pdmH1N1. Therefore, continued surveillance of such naturally occurring PB1-216 variants among others is warranted to assess the potential impact of changes in RdRp fidelity on the adaptability and epidemiological fitness of human A/H1N1 influenza viruses.

In the influenza virus-infected and RT2AF-transfected HEK cells, PolI starts to transcribe RT2AF as negative-strand viral RNA, which initiates self-replication of RT2AF reporter. The purpose of this reporter is to not only normalize total replication capability with the first Rluc activities but also evaluate the mutational potential that result in expression of the downstream Fluc activities. The Rluc activity reflects influenza replication levels. The Fluc activity measures the events in which RdRp repaired the engineered stop codon between the Rluc and Fluc reporters. The replication-driven Fluc activity thus represents the mutation potential of the virus. We calculated CMI based on the ratio of Fluc/Rluc that serves as an arbitrary measure of the number of mutation events occurring during virus replication and/or viral transcription.

Evolutionary longitudinal network dynamics of global zoonotic research,"At global and local levels, we are observing an increasing range and rate of disease outbreaks that show evidence of jumping from animals to humans, and from food to humans. Zoonotic infections (i.e. Hendra, swine flu, anthrax) affect animal health and can be deadly to humans. The increasing rate of outbreaks of infectious diseases transferring from animals to humans (i.e. zoonotic diseases) necessitates detailed understanding of the education, research and practice of animal health and its connection to human health. These emerging microbial threats underline the need to exploring the evolutionary dynamics of zoonotic research across public health and animal health. This study investigates the collaboration network of different countries engaged in conducting zoonotic research. We explore the dynamics of this network from 1980 to 2012 based on large scientific data developed from Scopus. In our analyses, we compare several properties of the network including density, clustering coefficient, giant component and centrality measures over time. We also map the network over different time intervals using VOSviewer. We analyzed 5182 publication records. We found United States and United Kingdom as the most collaborative countries working with 110 and 74 other countries in 1048 and 599 cases, respectively. Our results show increasing close collaboration among scientists from the","United States, several European countries including United Kingdom, Italy, France, Netherland, Switzerland, China and Australia with scientists from other parts of the world.

Background Zoonosis can be referred to as the transmissible diseases between vertebrate animals and humans (WHO 1959) , which comprises 75 % of emerging infectious diseases (Taylor et al. 2001) . Therefore, successful management of zoonotic diseases risks and outbreaks require the understanding of the complex interaction network of humans, animals and their living environments (WHO 2013b) . Previous bibliometric studies on relevant topics either investigated specific infectious diseases such as acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) (Patra and Chand 2007; Uthman 2008) , tuberculosis (Ramos et al. 2008) , and malaria (Garg et al. 2009 ) or examined infectious diseases in general (Bliziotis et al. 2005; Ramos et al. 2004 Ramos et al. , 2009 Takahashi-Omoe and Omoe 2012) . The latter studies examined the research productivity and contribution of different countries and regions of the world in infectious diseases showing a gradual increase in research on infectious diseases in the US, the EU and other regions in the world. Our investigation focuses on the contribution and collaboration of countries in exploring the intersection between animal and human health. We provide an investigation of the dynamics of zoonotic research networks over 33 years by constructing and using large scientometric data.

The study first explains the process of developing scientometric data for exploring research collaboration on this topic. These data are based on the extracted publication information from Elsevier's Scopus in the span of 1980-2012. It proceeds with exploring these data by extracting a bibliometric networks (i.e. countries network). Several social network measures such as network density and centrality are employed to analyze this network. The countries collaboration trend, network maps and measures, and their dynamics over this period of time are then discussed.

Elsevier's Scopus (www.scopus.com) as one of the main sources of bibliometric data covering the greatest number of journals Romo-Fernández et al. 2013 ) is used to build the database of this study. The search for publications has been carried out with 240 search queries using combinations of keywords including ''coordination, collaboration, cooperation, communication, preparedness, surveillance, emergency response, crisis management, containment, recovery, zoonotic, zoonosis, animal human, disease outbreak, illness outbreak, epidemic, pandemic and social network'' occurring in the articles' titles, abstracts and keywords. This initial set of keywords was selected after consulting with two experts in the field. The focus of the keywords was on three concepts including coordination, zoonotic diseases, and disease outbreaks at the various stages of disease prevention, detection, effective response and elimination.

The publications information [e.g., author(s), document title, year, source title, citation count, source and document type, affiliations, publisher] were extracted using Scopus export option. The publications used in the subsequent analysis were restricted to the ones in English. It is theoretically possible to miss out certain publications in the search process explained earlier. In order to minimize any missed out document and to account for any important keyword that was not included in the first stage, another set of keywords were identified to run a second round of search. As such, in the second stage, the keywords used in the extracted publications from the first stage were analyzed for their frequency. The frequency analysis of the keywords included identifying the most frequent ''single word'' and ''multiple words'' keywords. The latter keywords were the original keywords used by the authors and the former keywords were produced by splitting the ''multiple words'' ones. Table 1 shows the top ten most frequent ''single and multiple words'' keywords.

Another set of keywords including ''avian influenza, West Nile virus, H5N1, control, risk'' were used in combination with ''coordination, collaboration, cooperation, communication, preparedness, surveillance, emergency response, crisis management, containment, recovery, outbreak, epidemic, pandemic and social network'' for a second round of search for publications (216 search queries). The keywords that were too generic or used in the previous stage such as virus were not included in this round of search. The extracted publication data from this round was added to the previous results. The search span in both stages consisted of the period from 1980 to 2012. The search for the publications was conducted in July 2013. The two rounds of search resulted in 5800 publications of different types (e.g., article, conference paper, review) after filtering the publications with the same title. An application program was developed to extract bibliometric networks from these data, discussed in the next section.

At least four bibliometric networks can be built using the database of publications developed in this study including networks involving authors, keywords, countries, and affiliations. Figure 1 shows these networks. In order to build these network (i.e. identify the links between the nodes) from the information available in the database, an application program is written in Matlab. The algorithm of this application is explained here for the co- authorship network. The process of building the other networks including co-word, countries, and affiliation uses the same algorithm.

There is a co-authorship relation between two authors if they wrote a document together. As such, in social network terms, there is a link (edge) from node A (author A) to n ode B (author B). To map the data exported from Scopus into a co-authorship network, the following algorithm was developed where its variables are presented below:

• Max-No-Papers Maximum number of papers in the database with known authors • Max-No-Aut-Paper Maximum number of authors in a paper in the database • Max-No-authors Maximum number of authors in the database • List-All-Authors A list containing the name of all the authors in the database • List-Max-No-Authors-Per-Paper A list indicating the maximum number of authors for each paper in the database • List-All-Papers-with-All-their-Authors A list of all authors for each paper in the database • Co-authorship-Initial A matrix with the size of (Max-No-Papers, Max-No-Aut-Paper) that its cell (i,j) indicates whether author j in List-All-Authors participated in writing paper i in the database • Weighting A matrix with its cell (i,j) indicating the number of papers wrote by authors i and j in List-All-Authors • Co-authorship A matrix with its cell (i,j) indicating whether authors i and j in List-All-Authors wrote a paper together or not

In order to build the network of collaborating countries, the affiliation records of each publication were processed to extract the countries cited. In Table 2 below, we show some examples of the affiliation records in the database. The name of the countries, when reported, appears at the end of the record. In order to extract the countries associated with each publication, the steps explained below were followed:

• Reverse the affiliation record string,

• Count the number of characters till the first occurrence of a space (e.g., X characters),

• Extracting the first ''X'' characters identified in the previous step from the reversed string, • Reverse the string extracted in step three which gives the name of the country reported.

592 publications contained no affiliation information. These publications were excluded from the countries network analysis. Further data cleaning process in this stage included identifying the variations in the name of the countries reported (e.g., United States, USA, US, United Kingdom, UK) and unifying them. If an affiliation entry did not include the name of the country or useful information (e.g., the name of an institution) to search for the correct country of origin, it was excluded from further analysis (26 publications). Some other cases of data cleaning included finding the relevant country associated with a university, institution, company, state, or city where the name of the country was missing. This resulted in 5182 publications to carry out the data analysis. 

In this study, we apply the following network measures to perform our analysis:

The density measure ''describes the general level of linkage among the points in a graph'' (Scott 2000, p. 69) . In social network analysis terms, this is the number of links in a network, expressed as a proportion of the maximum possible number of links (Scott 2000) . The density of a network increases as the number of linkages between its nodes grows. The densest network (with all its nodes linked together) has a density of 1 and the least dense network (with no node linkage) has a density of 0.

Degree centrality- Freeman (1979) defined degree centrality of a node as the number of its adjacent nodes. Two nodes are adjacent if an edge links them together. Therefore, degree centrality of a node counts the number of other nodes that are directly connected to it.

The closeness centrality of a node is the sum of the graph-theoretic distances of that node to all other nodes in the network. The distance of a node from another is the length of the shortest path (geodesic path) between them (Borgatti 2005; Freeman 1979 ). Normalized closeness centrality value of a node is calculated by dividing the number of all other nodes in the network by the sum of the distances of the node to all others (Freeman 1979; Leydesdorff 2007 ).

The betweenness centrality of a node is defined as the frequency with which it settles in the shortest path connecting any other pair of nodes in the network (Freeman 1979) The giant component In many cases, large and complex networks are seen to have a connected component that includes a substantial portion of the nodes in those networks. This connected component is referred to as the giant component. If a network has a giant component, it is usually only one (Easley and Kleinberg 2010) .

The clustering coefficient of a node (e.g., node A) refers to the probability that two randomly selected adjacent nodes of A are adjacent to each other. In other words, it is the fraction of the pairs of A's adjacent nodes that are linked together (Easley and Kleinberg, 2010) .

Clustering and mapping VOSviewer 1.5.4 is used for displaying the structure of countries network. VOSviewer provides both mapping and clustering of networks (especially bibliometric networks) in a unified approach as an alternative to combing the mapping and clustering techniques with different assumptions. Its clustering technique is based on a weighted and parameterized variation of modularity-based clustering, and it uses visualization of similarities (VOS) as its mapping technique . VOS is a distance-based mapping technique rather than a graph-based one. While in the latter technique the distance between two nodes is not necessarily meaningful, in the former technique this distance represents the strength of their relationship (van Eck and Waltman 2010). VOSviewer provides different visualizations of networks. In the label views, the size of a nodes' circle and label portray its importance. Larger circles and labels represent more important nodes in terms of their weight (van Eck and Waltman 2013). The weight of the nodes in the countries networks in our study are determined based on the number of other countries associated with them and the strength of the associations. The color of the circles also depicts the cluster the node belongs to (van Eck and Waltman 2013) . The density view is helpful for identifying the most important areas of a map. In this view, the nodes are represented with the same label structure as the label view. The color of the point a node is placed in depends on the number of nodes around that point and their weights (i.e. their density). More nodes with greater weight neighboring a node lead to greater density for that node. According to the default color scheme used by VOSviewer, three color (redgreen-blue) represent density where red and blue are assigned to the highest and lowest densities respectively (van Eck and Waltman 2010).

As shown in Fig. 2 , the trend of publications on zoonotic research has been increasing since 1980. While before 1991, the number of extracted publications is constantly low, an increasing trend starts after that. This increase in the number of publications continues gradually and accelerates after 2002. This observation provides three time intervals to examine detail changes in the collaboration networks including 1980-1990, 1991-2001, and 2002-2012 . The dynamic analysis in this study focuses on the last two time intervals as the number of publications in the first period is limited. Another interesting point of time in Fig. 2 is 2006 . Up to this year the number of publications is increasing but this upward trend halts here with occasional rises. To have a better understanding of the possible underlying reasons for such a trend in the zoonotic research output, the frequency of zoonotic research publications and WHO's disease outbreak news per year (WHO 2013a) since 1996 are depicted in Fig. 3 .

Three highest points of disease outbreak news occurred in 2003 [due to Suspected Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) pandemic], 2005 (due to Avian Influenza pandemic) and 2009 (due to H1N1 pandemic). After 2002, with SARS and Avian Influenza pandemics, the publications on zoonotic research grew rapidly, and then started to decline after 2006, but again raised in 2009 with the spread of the H1N1 pandemic to decrease again with the reduction in the disease outbreak incidences. It seems that the output of scientific research in the zoonotic disease outbreaks have reached a saturation level since 2006 and only occurrence of global disease outbreaks triggers increases in quantity of the related publications. As such, the changes of zoonotic research collaboration networks will also be examined for another two periods including 1999-2005 and 2006-2012. Table 3 also shows the top ten journals publishing on this topic over the 33 years examined in this study, in which Emerging Infectious Diseases, Veterinary Record, Euro Surveillance: European Communicable Disease Bulletin, and PloS ONE hold the first three positions.

Countries collaboration trend Figure 4 below illustrates the changes in collaboration among the countries over time in terms of the number of collaborating countries, distinct collaboration links between them, and total number of collaboration links per year. The first instances of international collaboration start from 1995 and steadily increase although the number of collaboration links among countries experiences some rises and falls over the years. The highest amount of collaborations (324 distinct links and 569 total occurrences) takes place in 2011 among 71 countries. In 2012, the amount of collaborations drops to 261 distinct collaboration ties while the number of participating countries increases to 80. Since 2006-2012 the collaborating countries consist of 53-80 countries which are nearly 50 % of all the countries (159) in our database. In other words, the countries collaboration network at its most collaborative status comprises half of the publishing countries. In addition, the trend of recruiting more collaborating countries each year although is overall growing; its pace slows down after 2006. However, the number of collaboration links between the present countries and the frequency of such collaborations shows fast increase (with occasional declines). As such, it seems that after 2006 the community of collaborating countries is more focused on having more collaboration with other existing countries in the community and strengthening these collaborative relationships.

Countries network measures and maps over time Table 4 demonstrates the measures of countries network in different periods. In the first period (1991) (1992) (1993) (1994) (1995) (1996) (1997) (1998) (1999) (2000) (2001) , the density of the network is very low (3.9 %) indicating that a limited number of all possible collaboration links among countries are realized (see Fig. 5a ). In addition, the high clustering coefficient (71.1 %) implies the high possibility of collaboration among two adjacent countries of a third country. Figure 5a , pertaining to this period, illustrates this implication in the form of several triangles in the network. The network also has a giant component and several other small components. The network's degree of centrality is average (48.1 %). As shown in Fig. 5a , the countries are gathered around a few central nodes in the network including the United States and United Kingdom. They also possess the largest Fig. 5 Countries network map during (1991-2001) and (2002-2012) . a Label view of countries network (1991) (1992) (1993) (1994) (1995) (1996) (1997) (1998) (1999) (2000) (2001) , b label view of countries network (2002) (2003) (2004) (2005) (2006) (2007) (2008) (2009) (2010) (2011) (2012) labels. South Africa, Germany, and Italy (overlaid by Germany in the map illustration), and France are the next countries with large labels which indicate their importance in the zoonotic research in this period. There is also a split evident in the map which separates countries around United States from countries around United Kingdom. In other words, there is low density between the two areas. This is an implication of less collaboration among these two important areas of the network.

In the second period (2002) (2003) (2004) (2005) (2006) (2007) (2008) (2009) (2010) (2011) (2012) , the density of the network has improved (almost doubled) although it is still low. There is also a slight improvement in the clustering coefficient value (73.2 %). The degree centrality shows considerable improvement (62.3 %). As shown in Fig. 5b , the countries are coming closer together compared to the previous period. The network closeness and the betweenness have decreased. The high value of closeness (73.3 %) and low value of betweenness (33.0 %) measures implies the low distance between the countries. The network measure for the whole period of time is similar to the second time period, which is expected given that most of the publications belong to this period. Similar trend in the values of the network measures are observed in the other two periods (1999-2005 and 2006-2012) . The interesting observation here together with the information from Fig. 4 is the high value of clustering coefficient (71.8 %), density (8.3 %) and degree centrality (60.6 %) in 2006-2012 period which indicates the high probability that two collaborators of a country will be collaborating with each other and countries having more collaborations and collaborators. These values are higher than the seven years before 2006. In other words, in the recent years, the countries were putting more effort in strengthening their relationship with more other countries (see Figs. 6a, b) .

The label views of the network in the whole period (Fig. 7a) shows that United States and United Kingdom are the major collaborating countries. Italy, France and Netherlands are the next main countries. As evident in the density view (Fig. 7b) , United States and United Kingdom are depicted in red indicating their high density; although United Kingdom is nearer to other moderate density areas of the map while United States is placed farther from this part of the map. These countries as well as the others shown in red or orange comprise the important part of the world in terms of research, publication, and collaboration on zoonotic research.

Top collaborating countries Table 5 lists the countries with 50 or more total collaborations and the corresponding number of countries they collaborated with. According to this list, United States and United Kingdom are the first and second most collaborative countries working with 110 and 74 other countries in 1048 and 599 cases, respectively. In addition, the number of countries they collaborate with exceeds the others. Italy, France and Netherland are the next most collaborative countries; although France's collaborating countries (70) are slightly more than Italy (68). This result complements previous studies on the output of infectious disease research community. Previous studies show that the United States and the western European countries productivity exceed the other countries in terms of publication on infectious disease research (Bliziotis et al. 2005; Takahashi-Omoe and Omoe 2012) , and United Kingdom, France, and Germany lead the European countries in terms of number of publication on this topic (Ramos et al. 2004 (Ramos et al. , 2009 ). Our results show a similar pattern in terms of collaboration efforts on zoonotic research. The United States, United Kingdom, France, Italy and Netherlands are the leading collaborative countries in zoonotic research. Table 6 presents the list of the strongest collaboration links among the countries. Strength of a collaboration link is defined as the frequency of its occurrence during the 33 years. 1991-2001 and 2002-2012 1991-2001 2002-2012 Dynamic analysis

During the period (1991) (1992) (1993) (1994) (1995) (1996) (1997) (1998) (1999) (2000) (2001) , United States, United Kingdom, Germany, Italy, and South Africa are the top collaborating countries. In the second period (2002) (2003) (2004) (2005) (2006) (2007) (2008) (2009) (2010) (2011) (2012) , the number of collaborators and frequency of collaborations increase. While the United States and United Kingdom still hold their position at the top of the list of most collaborative countries, some changes are observed in the countries that follow them. South Africa is no longer among the top 20 countries. Italy, France and Netherlands have progressed further up the list. China, Australia and Switzerland also managed to appear among the top ten collaborating countries (see Table 7 for further details).

To identify their collaboration growth rates, first the average amount of collaboration for each country in each of two time periods (AV = Total collaborations/years) are calculated which is presented in Table 8 . The growth rate is then obtain as the quotient of the second and first periods' average collaborations (Growth rate = AV2/AV1). If a country did not have any collaboration in the first period its average collaboration for the second period is considered as the growth rate. The collaboration growth rates of the countries are identified for the 1999-2005 and 2006-2012 periods as they represent more recent data compared to the other time periods (1991-2001 and 2002-2012) examined in this study. Nigeria, Mexico, Portugal, Egypt and Singapore collaboration growth rates exceed the other countries. 

This study provides longitudinal analysis of countries networks of zoonotic research during 1980-2012 based on large scientific data developed from Scopus. The overall properties of these networks as well as their dynamics over these 33 years are examined in detail. The countries network shows steady increase in collaboration among different countries. The United States is the most collaborative country having links with 110 countries and 1048 total instances of collaborations. Several European countries including United Kingdom, Italy, France, Netherlands, Switzerland, Germany and Belgium are among the top ten collaborating countries. China and Australia are also among the ten most collaborating countries. Nevertheless, the density of the network is still low which means that limited numbers of countries are collaborating. However, this trend is improving such that almost half of the 159 countries had at least one collaboration link in the recent years. In addition, in spite of the recent lower rate of addition of more countries into the network, within the current network, the countries are increasingly initiating new collaborations as well as enhancing these collaborating relations (strengthening them).

The Benefits of Transmission Dynamics Models in Understanding Emerging Infectious Diseases,"Factors associated with the emergence and transmission of infectious diseases often do not follow the assumptions of traditional statistical models such as linearity and independence of outcomes. Transmission dynamics models are well suited to address infectious disease scenarios that do not conform to these assumptions. For example, these models easily account for changes in the incidence rates of infection as the proportions of susceptible and infectious persons change in the population. Fundamental concepts relating to these methods, such as the basic reproductive number, the effective reproductive number and the susceptible-infected-recovered compartmental models, are reviewed. In addition, comparisons and contrasts are made between the following concepts: microparasites and macroparasites, deterministic and stochastic models, difference and differential equations and homogeneous and heterogeneous mixing patterns. Finally, examples of how transmission dynamics models are being applied to factors associated with emerging infectious diseases, such as zoonotic origins, microbial adaption and change, human susceptibility and climate change, are reviewed.","T here is an extensive literature on factors contributing to the emergence and reemergence of infectious diseases. One of the seminal works in this field is the report of Institute of Medicine of the United States National Academies on emerging infectious diseases. 1 A central piece of this work is their convergence model that describes factors that contribute to the emergence of infectious diseases. These include microbial adaption and change, human susceptibility to infection, climate and weather, changing ecosystems, economic development and land use, human demographics and behavior, technology and industry, international travel and commerce, breakdown of public health measures, poverty and social inequality, war and famine, lack of political will and intent to harm. Each of these factors requires complex data collection to be addressed in an epidemiologic study aimed at understanding the emergence of a given infection.

One set of methods that epidemiologists use to better understand emerging infections is mathematical transmission dynamics models. These models describe the transmission of an infectious agent between hosts (humans, animals and/or vectors) in a population. One historical example of their usefulness in furthering our understanding of infections is Sir Ronald Ross' (1857-1932) hypothesis and mathematical model that a community could eliminate malaria by sufficiently reducing the size of the mosquito population. 2 Transmission dynamics models such as Sir Ross' are known to be highly nonlinear 3 and cannot be captured with traditional statistical models, requiring instead a range of calculus-based methods. However, the fundamental concept of keeping a model as simple as possible, while accounting for only the most important factors, is similar to what is done in traditional statistical models. 3 For example, consider the series of images in Figure 1. All the panels are sketches of a bull. The simplest sketch lacks detail and could possibly be confused with other animals, such as a cow or a buffalo. As additional detail is added to the sketches, it becomes readily apparent that the sketch is truly a bull. However, to describe how an infectious agent is transmitted between hosts in a large population, a model as rough as the simplest sketch may be sufficient. Despite the science and mathematics involved in developing infectious disease transmission dynamics models, there is also a certain amount of art entailed; and perhaps surprisingly, usually less is more. Chief among many reasons to keep the model simple is to make it easily comprehensible to a wide audience, including both scientists and policy makers. 4, 5 Thus, infectious disease clinicians/epidemiologists are placed in a paradox. The transmission of emerging infections is often complex, involving several hosts and important small population clusters, yet, the most desirable models to describe the transmission are simple. In addition, most clinicians and public health professionals are not exposed to approaches in which theory (in contrast to data) is the base of developing a model. The theory-based model is used to simulate scenarios of transmission and control, which may be later verified by field data. This approach may provoke a sense of unease and skepticism among the uninitiated researcher or clinician. The purpose of this article is to provide a brief overview of some of the common methods used in transmission dynamics models and illustrate their uses in the context of emerging infectious diseases. Ultimately, our goal is to demonstrate that transmission dynamics models can be helpful in better understanding how emerging and reemerging infections are being transmitted and how best to control them.

There are a few critical differences between traditional statistical methods (eg, regression) used by most public health professionals and transmission dynamics models. All these differences are related to the different set of assumptions needed for infections that are transmissible from person to person and those that are not.

Transmissible diseases, such as emerging infections, are different from nontransmissible diseases because the occurrence of 1 case of disease will impact the occurrence of disease in the people with whom this case has been in contact. For example, it is easy to conceive that, if a case of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is introduced into a household, the household members of that case are more likely to become infected than people who are not in direct contact with that case. In statistics, this phenomenon is called clustering or nonindependence of outcomes and requires the use of specific methods. This would not be true for diseases such as cancer or heart disease in which there is no transmission of an infectious agent. Thus, transmission dynamics models are designed to describe and explain how transmission occurs between contacts.

An incidence rate is defined as the number of new cases of a disease occurring divided by the number of people susceptible for that disease during a specific period of time.

In nontransmissible disease epidemiology, the number of susceptibles in a population is often fairly constant because the outcome is rare (eg, some cancers and heart disease). In addition, the incidence rate is independent from the number of people affected by the disease in the population. With infectious diseases, the number of individuals infected at any point in time influences the chance that a susceptible individual will contact an infected person. Therefore, the inci-dence rate of infection is not constant through time and can vary from day to day.

Most infectious agents of humans require human or other animal cells to replicate. Therefore, most infectious agents require a minimum number of hosts to invade to survive. Thus, the most efficient prevention programs will typically rely on vaccines to reduce the number of susceptible hosts and prevent the agent from surviving. When the proportion of the population who is susceptible is reduced below the ""threshold of susceptible,"" herd immunity is reached, and the agent will become extinct. No such concept exists for nontransmissible diseases.

Although there is ample literature discussing the concepts of transmission dynamics models, 3,6,7 we will provide a brief review of some of the fundamentals in the context of microparasitic infections using a deterministic model. First is the basic reproductive number (R 0 ). The basic reproductive number is the average number of secondary cases of an infection that will occur once an infectious individual is introduced into a population that is completely susceptible to infection. 7 There are multiple mathematical definitions for R 0 , depending on the context and model; some definitions use algebraic principles and some use calculus. 8 One straightforward, algebraic formula is as follows 7 :

R 0 ϭ number of contacts per unit time ϫ transmission probability per contact ϫ duration of infectiousness ϭ cϫpϫd

The application of R 0 in a given epidemic is short lived, because, after the first infectious individual has transmitted infection to the susceptible contacts, the population is no longer completely susceptible. Thus, to understand the number of subsequent infections from the second generation of infective individuals, another, yet highly related term is needed, called the effective reproductive number (R). Similar to R 0 , R is influenced by the number of contacts per unit time, the transmission probability per contact and duration of infectiousness; however, as the number of susceptibles in the population decreases, so will the number of individuals who can be infected by each case. Thus, R is always a proportion of R 0 and will continuously change as the proportion of susceptibles changes in the population.

These concepts are combined using a framework for transmission dynamics models in a susceptible-infected-recovered compartmental model ( Figure 2 ), 9 in which S(t) represents the number of susceptible individuals in the population at time t, I(t) represents the number of infectious individuals in the population and R(t) represents the number of people who are recovered from (or immune to) infection. The simplest approach is to begin with a closed population of size N, where there are no births or deaths affecting the size of the population (including deaths from infection). These models are helpful in counting the flow of individuals through the compartments over the course of time of an epidemic. That is, at time t, the rate at which susceptibles move from S to I is equal to c؋p؋(I/N), and the rate at which people move from I to R is equal to 1/d, where d represents the average duration of infectiousness. The following set of algebraic equations is used to solve for the number of individuals in each of the compartments at time t.

By using these equations, it is easy to approximate the number of susceptible, infectious and recovered individuals in the population at each point of time. This information is particularly useful in estimating how long it will take for the epidemic to run out of susceptibles. When applying this information to more realistic scenarios, such as accounting for an open population in which births in the population are replenishing the pool of susceptibles, we can estimate when a vac-cine, for example, should be implemented to prevent transmission to the new pool of susceptibles.

The field of transmission dynamics modeling is complex and growing increasingly sophisticated. Although the following description and categorization of these models is perhaps overly simplistic, we believe it is instructive for the purposes of a brief introduction. Types of transmission dynamics models often come in pairs, for example, macroparasite versus microparasite, deterministic versus stochastic models, models using difference equations versus differential equations and homogeneous versus heterogeneous mixing assumptions.

In transmission dynamics models, the major difference between microparasites and macroparasites is in the outcome being modeled. In general, for microparasites (ie, bacteria, viruses, fungi, protozoa and prions), the outcome is the number of infected hosts, whereas for macroparasites (ie, helminths and ectoparasites), the outcome is the number of viable female offspring produced. This is important because the intensity of infection (ie, number of parasites infecting the host) impacts the infectiousness of the host. Some additional differences between macroparasites and microparasites are the following: the generation time for macroparasites is longer than for microparasites; hosts rarely develop full immunity to reinfection with macroparasites; and the death rates of macroparasites have greater variability than those observed in microparasites. These factors can be accommodated using increasingly complex compartmental models. 10 Even though a large number of macroparasites are considered as reemerging, the majority of emerging infectious diseases in the United States are microparasites (Table 1) ; thus, most of the examples will be those of microparasites.

The fundamental difference between deterministic models, where fixed mathematical operations are allowed to ""determine"" the course of the model (ie, you get the same results every time) and stochastic models, where probabilities determine the likelihood of obtaining a certain outcome (but the outcome itself is determined randomly), is deciding whether to allow chance an opportunity to play a role in the model. In deterministic models, the size of each compartment is influenced by fixed rates of emigration (going out) and immigration (coming in), which can result in fractions of people being assigned to a given compartment. In contrast, stochastic models incorporate the role of chance in determining whether an event occurs (eg, that transmission occurs given an exposure) and, thus, either an event occurs or it does not. Fractions of people are not allowed to enter compartments, and thus stochastic models attempt to better model reality in transmission of Transmission Dynamics Models infectious disease scenarios. However, because stochastic models are usually run through thousands of iterations to identify the average probability of observing the modeled event, the results from deterministic and stochastic models are often similar when applied to large populations. 7 However, by running a stochastic model through many iterations, a distribution of outcomes is obtained, which is more informative than the average result obtained from a deterministic model. 4, 11 Stochastic models have at least 2 advantages over deterministic models. First, they are better at modeling the probability of an epidemic running a course through extinction. 7 Second, they do not require the assumption of a large sample size (which may be unrealistic in some settings) that deterministic models need. 6 There are 2 primary obstacles to developing stochastic models. One is a lack of computing power necessary to run increasingly complex models through the necessary number of iterations, and the other is the increased intellectual difficulty demanded in incorporating the stochastic components. Computing power is rapidly becoming more available to the average infectious disease clinician/epidemiologist. 5 The decision to overcome the second obstacle is a personal decision. Thus, our recommendation to the novice modeler is to start with deterministic models and work into stochastic models as competence and interest dictates.

One of the most important ways of balancing between an overly simplistic model and overly complex model is to start simple and state as many of the assumptions as possible, both implicit and explicit. Then, find ways to relax those assumptions imposed by the model/method. 4

As discussed above, in the use of compartmental models, the population moves between compartments at specified rates and predefined time steps. The choice of using difference or differential equations is thus influenced by whether the time steps are defined discretely or continuously. That is, difference equations can be used to model discrete changes in time, whereas differential equations use calculus-based principles to model continuous changes in time. 11 The chained binomial probability (eg, the Reed-Frost model) is a well-known example of the use of discrete time events modeled using the compartmental model structure. 12 Because infection transmission occurs on a continuous time-scale, differential models are often preferred. However, the straightforward nature of differ-ence equations can provide useful approximations without intimidating less proficient mathematicians.

Fundamental to the transmission of infections is the way in which susceptible and infectious persons interact, because how that interaction occurs is going to largely determine whether or not transmission can occur. The types of interactions necessary for transmission of measles (transmitted via the airborne route) are vastly different from those necessary to transmit genital herpes. In addition, there are complex patterns that dictate how people within populations interact with each other. For example, while typical school-aged children spend the majority of their time mixing with other children of their same age, the parent of that child likely mixes with a much broader age range of individuals in the same community because of activities related to work, hobbies, etc. Despite the obvious complex pattern of mixing among individuals, basic transmission dynamics models assume that individuals within a population mix homogeneously. 7 That is, the probability of a given individual coming into sufficient contact to transmit infection is equal in every other individual in that population, regardless of age, gender or social status.

Despite the unrealistic nature of this homogeneous mixing assumption, some early models of infections transmitted via the airborne and droplet modes were helpful in predicting transmission and identifying effective methods to control spread. Furthermore, relatively simple adaptations were made to models of sexually transmitted infections (ie, differentiating between males and females) that were able to move this class of models forward. A major advance in transmission dynamics models has been the development of methods to account for heterogeneous mixing patterns. These methods typically rely on matrices in which the columns and rows represent the characteristics of the subpopulations and individual cells are estimates of probabilities of contact or contact rates between each subpopulation as shown in Table 2 . 12, 13 Another method to account for heterogeneous mixing patterns is the use of social networks, 13 for example, areas where public transportation is common in contrast to areas where most individuals use their own transportation. This summarizes some of the basic concepts in the structure of transmission dynamics models. The dichotomy of methods and assumptions illustrates the choice that the modeler must make in determining the complexity of the model and hopefully facilitates the reading of this type of research. We also provided guidance regarding factors to consider when choosing which type of model or assumption to pursue. 

Recently, there has been an important increase in technology that can be incorporated into developing transmission dynamics models. In addition, there has been a tremendous amount of information devoted to understanding factors associated with the emergence (and reemergence) of infectious diseases. Thus, this next section will succinctly assess the latest technology and risk factors that need to be considered in the development of transmission dynamics models.

There are a number of challenges in developing transmission dynamics models. The first is that the majority of emerging infectious diseases are vector borne and/or zoonotic. Thus, in addition to modeling human-to-human transmission (which can be as difficult as the matrices used to describe the mixing patterns of the population), it may be necessary to model both the population dynamics of the vectors and the interaction between the vector and the human host. As technology advances, more factors can be incorporated into transmission dynamics models. For example, considerable advances have been made in molecular techniques that help us better understand microbial adaption and change and human susceptibility to infection, and the use of remote sensing technology has advanced climate change science.

Zoonoses are infectious diseases of humans that have an animal reservoir. Zoonoses not only account for approximately 75% of all emerging infections 14 but also have been responsible for some of the most devastating pandemics in world history [ie, plague, Spanish influenza and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/AIDS]. 15 Most of the zoonotic pathogens that have been modeled are viruses (with influenza and SARS accounting for almost half of all zoonotic models). 15 Modeling infection transmission accounting for spread from the animal reservoir is often an important step in understanding the relevant dynamics. However, the impact of including animal reservoirs in the model is as varied as each zoonotic infection. For example, while HIV can be considered a zoonotic infection in the strictest sense of the word, ongoing spread from the animal reservoir plays an insignificant (if any) role in the overall spread of HIV, which is principally spread person to person. In contrast, tick-borne infections, such as Lyme disease, are not known to be transmitted person to person, and therefore modeling infection transmission from the reservoir is critical. In between these 2 ends of the transmission spectrum are infections such as Escherichia coli O157:H7, which is primarily spread by escaping the animal host (by contaminated food products) but can also be spread person to person via the fecal-oral route.

Among the pathogenic agents that have recently emerged, several have been RNA viruses (eg, HIV, Sin Nombre virus, Nipah virus, SARS coronavirus, human metapneumovirus and avian influenza). RNA viruses are among the most adaptable pathogens, because the structure of their genome is prone to mutations during replication. Models have shown the dynamic nature of these RNA pathogens as they expertly coevolve with their hosts. 16 Our ability to account for microbial adaption and change in transmission models has advanced given the increased availability of viral genome sequences and the growth in computing power. 17 Reasons for modeling microbial adaption include estimating probabilities of emergence from the reservoir, resistance to antimicrobials, geographic diversity across different populations and rate of global spread. 17

One of the fundamental principles of sustaining a pathogen in a population is the replenishment of susceptibles. 12 One of the demographic characteristics of the modern era is the population explosion that has occurred. 1 Hence, with the world being more populous than ever, the potential for having a large pool of susceptibles is high. Another important factor in facilitating infection transmission is creating opportunities for infectious and susceptible individuals to interact with each other. International travel is a primary method of introducing infectious individuals into highly susceptible populations, 18 as has been modeled with SARS, 19,20 influenza 21 and intentional release of smallpox. 22

Changes in weather and climate have been identified as important factors in the emergence of infectious diseases. 23 Advancements in technology, such as satellites for remote sensing, have been used to explore associations between climate change and emerging infections. One specific example is that of Sin Nombre virus, the cause of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, in the 4-corners region of the United States in 1993 24 and, more recently, in Europe and parts of Africa. 25 To date, the models used for this purpose in humans have used traditional methods such as logistic regression, 26 but transmission dynamics models have been used in emerging infections among other animal species, such as nematode infection of muskoxen in the Arctic. 27 

In the past 30 years, since the onset of the HIV epidemic, many other pathogens have emerged as new threats to human populations. During this same period of time, advancement in transmission dynamics models has improved our ability to predict the impact of these emerging infections on our health. Specifically, advancements have increased our ability to understand microbial adaption and change, the aspect of zoonoses escaping their reservoir, climate change and changes in human behavior that facilitate mixing between infectious and susceptible individuals. As these advancements have been made, so have the sophistication and complexity of the models advanced to account for these factors. These models will likely play an increasingly important role in understanding the dynamics of emerging infectious diseases, and thus the importance for infectious disease clinicians and epidemiologists to understand these methods cannot be overstated.

"Widespread Recombination, Reassortment, and Transmission of Unbalanced Compound Viral Genotypes in Natural Arenavirus Infections","Arenaviruses are one of the largest families of human hemorrhagic fever viruses and are known to infect both mammals and snakes. Arenaviruses package a large (L) and small (S) genome segment in their virions. For segmented RNA viruses like these, novel genotypes can be generated through mutation, recombination, and reassortment. Although it is believed that an ancient recombination event led to the emergence of a new lineage of mammalian arenaviruses, neither recombination nor reassortment has been definitively documented in natural arenavirus infections. Here, we used metagenomic sequencing to survey the viral diversity present in captive arenavirus-infected snakes. From 48 infected animals, we determined the complete or near complete sequence of 210 genome segments that grouped into 23 L and 11 S genotypes. The majority of snakes were multiply infected, with up to 4 distinct S and 11 distinct L segment genotypes in individual animals. This S/L imbalance was typical: in all cases intrahost L segment genotypes outnumbered S genotypes, and a particular S segment genotype dominated in individual animals and at a population level. We corroborated sequencing results by qRT-PCR and virus isolation, and isolates replicated as ensembles in culture. Numerous instances of recombination and reassortment were detected, including recombinant segments with unusual organizations PLOS Pathogens |","Several mechanisms generate viral genetic diversity [1] [2] [3] . All work by producing populations of viral genomes, a small fraction of which may exhibit an adaptive advantage in a new host species, different tissue, or in the face of drug or immune pressure. Replication of RNA viral genomes by error-prone polymerases results in relatively high mutation frequencies, and RNA viruses replicate as collections of closely related variant genotypes [2, [4] [5] [6] [7] . Viral genomes can shed content or acquire new loci from their hosts by horizontal gene transfer. In coinfected cells, recombination between different viral strains or species can produce chimeric progeny [8] [9] [10] [11] . And in cells coinfected by segmented viruses, reassortment generates virions containing shuffled mixtures of segments from the parental genotypes [11, 12] .

Understanding basic mechanisms of viral adaptation is essential in order to better combat, prevent, and predict viral diseases. For example, the ability of pandemic influenza virus strains to efficiently replicate in and be transmitted between humans frequently results from de novo mutation and reassortment [13] . The continuous emergence of drug-resistant genotypes is a major hindrance to the effective treatment of human immunodeficiency virus-1 and other pathogens [14, 15] . And, recombination between individually attenuated strains present in the oral poliovirus vaccine results in neuropathic progeny strains, and complicates eradication efforts [16] .

Viruses in the family Arenaviridae have bi-segmented single-stranded RNA genomes with a characteristic organization and gene repertoire [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] . The larger genome segment (L) is about 7 kb in length and encodes the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (L) and a small zinc-binding RING domain protein (Z). The smaller segment (S) is about half as long and encodes the glycoprotein precursor (GPC) and nucleoprotein (NP). On each segment, the two viral genes are in opposite coding orientations and are separated by an intergenic region (IGR) that is predicted to form stable hairpin structures.

Two major lineages of arenaviruses have been described: those that primarily infect rodents and those that infect snakes. The rodent arenaviruses (proposed genus Mammarenavirus) typically establish chronic mild infections in their natural hosts but can be transmitted to humans and other mammals [22] . Severe disease such as Lassa hemorrhagic fever can result from these zoonotic infections. The snake arenaviruses (proposed genus Reptarenavirus) were first identified in US cases of inclusion body disease, a progressive and sometimes fatal disease best described in members of the Boidae and Pythonidae families (boas and pythons) [23, 24] . The identification and study of snake arenaviruses in captive snakes in Europe corroborated and extended this finding [25] [26] [27] . One major difference between the snake and mammalian arenaviruses is the provenance of their GPC genes, with the snake virus gene being more closely related to the glycoprotein gene of filoviruses and some avian retroviruses [23, 28] .

Several mechanisms of arenavirus evolution have been described [17, [29] [30] [31] . Like all RNA viruses, arenavirus genome replication is relatively error prone, and arenaviruses replicate as collections of related variants in vivo [32] . Recombination is thought to have given rise to the ancestral S segment of a clade of the New World rodent arenaviruses [33] [34] [35] . Recombination and reassortment between co-infecting arenaviruses has been observed in the laboratory [36] [37] [38] . And, it has been suggested that arenaviruses detected in snakes in Europe might have undergone recombination [39, 40] . However, arenavirus recombination and reassortment have not been confirmed in natural infections involving extant species.

In this study we document and investigate viral genetic complexity of an unanticipated extent and form in naturally infected captive snakes. We determined the complete or near complete sequences of 210 viral genome segments using metagenomic sequencing. Sequencing results were corroborated and extended by discriminating quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR) and by tissue culture isolation experiments. We detected widespread recombination and reassortment. We also observed an unbalanced accumulation of multiple distinct viral genotypes in individual infections. These findings provide an opportunity to study basic mechanisms of virus evolution and fitness through the identification of genetic determinants underpinning their action.

In order to further characterize the genetic diversity of the snake arenaviruses, we gathered 123 frozen case and control tissue samples from around the U.S.A. that were collected between 1997 and 2014 (S1 Table) . We screened these samples for snake arenavirus RNA using qRT-PCR with degenerate primers targeting the glycoprotein gene. A total of 56 samples tested positive by qRT-PCR for viral RNA. Clinical data of varying detail was available for samples. Histopathology was available for 58 of the 123 samples and detection of viral RNA was well correlated with histopathology-based IBD diagnosis (Table 1) . However, many infected snakes displayed no overt clinical signs (S1 Table) . Thus, detection of viral RNA was correlated with detection of inclusions in tissue sections, but not with obvious clinical measures in a straightforward fashion, consistent with previous reports [23, 25, 26, 41] .

We performed metagenomic sequencing to determine complete viral genome sequences. Samples from 98 animals, including the PCR-positive samples, were sequenced. Samples from 48 of the arenavirus-positive snakes were sequenced to a depth sufficient for assembly of complete or near complete viral genome segment sequences. In many cases, the assemblies included predicted terminal sequences (S1 Fig, [ 23, 42] ). In total, just over 1 million reads contributed to the assembly of 210 genome segment sequences (148 L and 62 S sequences) totaling 1.24 Mb.

Genome segment assemblies were validated by re-mapping paired-end reads [43] . Assemblies were well supported, with 99-fold median coverage (S1 Fig) . Coverage levels were generally lowest in the intergenic regions (IGR), likely as a result of the predicted hairpin-forming sequences in these regions (S1 Fig) . In cases where coverage levels in IGRs fell below 2 reads, PCR was used to confirm assembly continuity.

Genome segments with less than 80% global pairwise nucleotide identity were classified into distinct genotypes (Figs 1 and 2and S2 Fig) [44] . A total of 11 S and 23 L genotypes were delineated by this criterion, and were designated S1-S11 and L1-L23. Within genotypes, L segment sequences shared a mean value of 96% pairwise nucleotide identity, and between genotypes, sequences shared 65% identity (S2A Fig) . For S segments, these values were 96% and 64% (S2B Fig). Multiple alignments of the four coding sequences were used to create Bayesian phylogenies to visualize the inferred evolutionary relationship of these genotypes (Figs 1-3and  S3 Fig) .

In 21 of 48 infected snakes, viral genotypes consisted of a single S and a single L segment genotype (Fig 4and S3 Table, snakes #1-21) . For example, snakes #1-3, the annulated tree boas from the California Academy of Sciences described in an earlier report, harbored S genotype 1 and L genotype 1. This S1/L1 genotype corresponds to the virus we referred to as ""CAS virus"" (CASV; [23] ). In snakes #4-6, segments of genotype S2 and L2 were detected, a genotype corresponding to ""Golden Gate virus"" [23] .

Numerous reassortant genotypes were evident among the singly infected snakes (Fig 4) . For example, the L2 segments present in snakes #7 and 8 were nearly identical at 98.6% pairwise identity, but their S segments shared only 73.5% pairwise identity (genotypes S3 and S6), indicating a more distant common ancestor. Similarly, the S6 segments in snakes #15 and 16 were 97.8% identical but the L3 and L21 segments in these snakes were only 62.2% identical. It was not possible in most cases to determine which S/L pairs were ancestral, nor when precisely reassortment had occurred, but it was clear that reassortment had produced these permuted pairings.

However, in the majority of animals (27 of 48 snakes), we observed viral genotypes that were substantially more complex than single S/L pairs. These snakes harbored multiple S and L genome segment sequences (Fig 4; snakes #22-48). The sets of viral genotypes ranged from that which would be expected for a straightforward co-infection by 2 virus strains in snake #45, to more complex combinations such as that in snake #33, which contained the sequences of 1 S and 10 distinct L segments. The animal with the most viral genotypes was snake #34, which contained 15 genotypes (4 S and 11 L) that could combine to produce virions with 44 unique S/L pairs (assuming coinfection of individual cells). The distinct L and S segment sequences within individual snakes shared on average only 65% and 70% pairwise nucleotide identity respectively, a level of variation not consistent with sequencing error or intrahost diversification. Snakes that were housed together often shared similar combinations of genotypes, and in these cases the sequences of these segments were closely related (Figs 1 and 2and Fig 4) .

The accumulation of viral genotypes within individual animals was not balanced. In all cases there were more L than S segment genotypes (Fig 4and S4 Fig). On average, there were more than twice as many L segment genotypes as S genotypes per animal (mean values of 4.7 L and 2.4 S genotypes per multiply infected animal; S4 Fig) . In fact, 18 of 27 animals with multiple L sequences harbored only a single S genotype.

The S6 genotype was dominant in individual animals and at a population level (Fig 1 and  Fig 4) . This genotype was first detected in a snake from Collierville, TN, and a partial S6 sequence was reported previously [23] . S segments of this genotype were detected in 37 of 48 snakes (77%). These sequences shared 96% average global pairwise nucleotide identity. Re- Individual snakes are infected by complex unbalanced sets of viral genotypes. These tables depict the fractional abundance of S and L genotypes detected in individual animals. Each row corresponds to an individual animal. Each column corresponds to a particular S or L segment genotype. Phylogenies on top of the tables were created using representative sequences from each genotype and a neighbor joining clustering method. Shading of cells indicates the fractional abundance of that genotype in the indicated animal, which was calculated as the proportion of sequencing reads mapping to that genotype divided by the total number of arenavirus-mapping reads from that animal. Recombinant segments are depicted with a triangle. All shaded boxes correspond to coding-complete assemblies, except for those indicated with a circle. Groups of animals harboring similar virus genotype combinations that were housed together are indicated with brackets. Neg snake is a sample from an uninfected snake and HeLa is a sample from total HeLa cell RNA.

doi:10.1371/journal.ppat.1004900.g004 markably, the S6 segment genotype was found in combination with 21 of the 23 L segment genotypes described in this study. In addition to reassortant genotypes, we also identified 6 recombinant S segments and 8 recombinant L segments ( Table) . We used the RDP4 software to detect and statistically evaluate support for recombination events ( Table 2 ; [45] ). Recombination events were well supported by RDP4 analysis and by read coverage levels over recombination junctions (S1 Fig and Table 2 ). We also confirmed segment continuity by PCR amplification across junctions.

While this analysis provided clear evidence of recombination, it was not always possible to determine which genotypes were parental and which were recombinant. However, it appeared that many of the recombinant segments coexisted in snakes with one of their parental genotypes. For example, in snake #35, 2 S segment sequences were evident. One of these was a canonical S6 genotype. The other segment, designated S8, shared 97% average pairwise nucleotide identity with the S6 segment's GPC gene, but only 66% identity in the NP gene ( Fig 5A) . The S8 NP appeared to derive from a segment similar to the S11 NP found in snake #34. Similar patterns were observed for S segments in snakes #22, 26, 27, 34, and 35, and for L segments in snakes #22, 23, 28, 30, 31, 33, 46, 47, and 48 (Figs 1 and 2and Fig 5B) . These may be situations where the parental and progeny genotypes persistently replicated together following a recombination event. Alternatively, the genotypes could have been acquired in independent transmission events.

Some recombination events resulted in unusual genome organizations. For example, the L10 genotype found in snakes #22 and #23 consisted of a full Z coding sequence and a partial L coding sequence from one parental segment concatenated to a partial Z and full L from a second segment (Fig 6) . This segment was predicted to contain 2 intergenic hairpin-containing regions (2xIGR) separating the 2 L/Z pairs. Similar double-IGR segments and partial CDS were observed in recombinant S segments as well (Fig 6) . An offset template switching event during genome replication may have generated these 2xIGR segments (S5 Fig; [10] ).

We used several independent approaches to corroborate the original metagenomic sequencing. First, we completely re-sequenced 41 samples, using independent library preparations, and derived essentially identical results. Second, we developed a panel of PCR primer pairs that discriminated between distinct viral genotypes, and performed qRT-PCR on a subset of samples and genotypes. In all cases, qPCR-based genotyping mirrored sequencing results (S6 Fig). Third, we used tissue culture isolation as another means of determining viral genotype and to confirm that sequences corresponded to infectious virus (see below).

The introduction of an already infected snake (#35) into the proximity of an uninfected snake (#36) in a private collection enabled us to monitor viral transmission (Fig 7) . A 2011 blood sample from snake #36 tested negative for snake arenavirus RNA by qRT-PCR and deep sequencing. Snake #36 was then not exposed to other snakes until September 2012, when its owners obtained a second snake, #35. Snake #35 arrived with stomatitis and was anorexic. Nevertheless, after a 4-week quarantine, snakes #35 and #36 were placed in the same enclosure. Snake #35 continued to refuse to feed and died two weeks later. We obtained the body of snake #35 and a blood sample from snake #36 taken in November 2012, and an additional blood sample from snake #36 from January 2013.

We determined that multiple genotypes were transmitted from snake #35 to snake #36 during their cohabitation (Fig 7) . Snake #35's viral genotype consisted of 2 S and 6 L genotypes (S6,8 / L3, 8, 11, 17, 18, 21 ; Fig 7B) . The November 2012 snake #36 blood sample was arenavirus positive, but the only genotypes detected by sequencing were S6 and L3. The January 2013 snake #36 sample was still positive, but now L genotypes 11, 17, and 21 were also detectable in the blood. Analysis of the viral sequences recovered from the two snakes revealed that they were closely related (98.5-100% identity). This data supports the transmissibility of compound unbalanced snake arenavirus genotypes in the context of cohabitation.

We performed tissue culture isolation and passaging experiments to investigate whether compound viral genotypes were competent to initiate productive infections. We applied homogenates from samples to cultures of boa constrictor-derived JK cells and monitored levels of virus RNA by qRT-PCR using genotype-discriminating primers. In all cases, we detected replication of all of the viral genotypes identified by our metagenomic sequencing (Fig 8) . For example, snake #38 contained viral sequences of genotype S6/L3,18. When a liver homogenate from this snake was applied to a JK culture, replication of all 3 of these segments was detected (Fig 8A) . Similarly, when a homogenate from snake #47 was used as inoculum, replication of all 6 expected viral genotypes was observed (S6 and L3,4,5,6,7; Fig 8B) . The distinct L segments exhibited approximately equal replication efficiencies in these experiments, and the populations could be passaged to uninfected cell cultures. Thus, sequences of multiple viral genotypes Recombinant genome segments with unusual organizations. Recombinant S and L genome segments with unusual double-intergenic regions (2xIGR) and/or partial coding sequences are depicted as cartoons. Plotted below each cartoon are coverage levels (the number of sequencing reads supporting each base in the assembly) and predicted free energy of folding (i.e. predicted RNA secondary structure; -ΔG) of 140 nt sliding windows. Approximate locations of recombinant breakpoints are indicate with triangles and dotted lines. Partial coding sequences are indicated. Some of these segments, or very closely related versions thereof, were detected in multiple animals, as indicated. In these cases, cartoons and plots are based on the segment from the snake listed in bold font.

doi:10.1371/journal.ppat.1004900.g006 corresponded to replication competent virus, and multiple viral genome segments replicated as stable ensembles in culture.

We also investigated whether an L segment with an unusual 2x IGR organization was competent for replication. Snake #47 L4 contains a partial Z region and 2 predicted IGR hairpins (Fig 6) . To track this segment during infection, we performed qRT-PCR using 2 primer pairs: one pair that targeted the L gene of this segment and one pair that spanned the recombination junction (Fig 8C) . Throughout the experiment, near equivalent amounts of template were detected using these 2 primer pairs, suggesting that most copies of this segment maintained their unusual structure.

We performed endpoint dilution experiments to determine the genotypes of individual virus particles. We prepared dilution series from liver homogenates from snakes #37 and #47 and inoculated JK cells in 96 well plates. After 7-10 days, we transferred supernatants to new plates and stained cells with anti-NP Ab to determine wells positive for the presence of virus. Positive wells were then genotyped using discriminating qRT-PCR. In most cases, RNA from a single S and a single L genotype were detected in individual wells infected with the most dilute inocula (Fig 9) . In 3 of 14 (21%) wells at these highest dilutions, more than one L genotype was detected. This could be the result of stochastic co-infection, clumped virus particles, or virus particles packaging more than one L segment. These results were consistent with the model that most virus particles packaged a single L segment, although we could not exclude the possibility that a minority of particles may package additional segments.

Intrahost variation for individual genotypes was also evident. For most genome segments, multiple sites with minor allele variants were detected (S7 Fig). The frequency of variants in most of these cases was less than 10 variant sites per kb (i.e., 1%; S7 Fig) . In several cases, a higher frequency of variant sites was observed, for example the S6 segment of snake #41, which averaged 17 variant sites per kb (1.7% variants sites). This could have resulted from a greater degree of intrahost variation and divergence or from infection by viruses with closely related genotypes whose sequences were too similar to separate using short read assembly.

In this study, we surveyed the genetic diversity of arenaviruses infecting captive snakes in the USA. We used metagenomic sequencing and de novo assembly to determine genome sequences of viruses infecting 48 snakes. We found that most snakes were multiply infected by unbalanced ensembles of S and L segment genotypes. In total, we assembled 148 L and 62 S segment sequences that grouped into 23 L and 11 S genotypes. This expands the known diversity within this group of viruses by several fold. The high level of multiple infection has apparently given rise to numerous recombinant and reassortant genotypes, altogether compromising hundreds of unique viral combinations. We also discovered recombinant genotypes with non-canonical genome organizations, including those harboring apparently superfluous content. Metagenomic sequencing results were corroborated by PCR-based approaches, and extended by tissue culture isolation experiments. These findings highlight the utility of performing unbiased whole genome sequencing to determine pathogen genotypes. Indeed, our initial PCR-based screening correctly identified infected animals, but completely failed to uncover the genetic complexity present in the infections.

Although natural infection by multiple arenaviruses has not been previously documented, this phenomenon has been reported for other viruses. For example, infection involving up to 3 influenza viruses has been documented in humans and wild birds [46, 47] . And, up to 7 or 9 distinct genotypes of torque teno virus or papillomavirus have been identified in individual human samples [48] [49] [50] . In plants, a virus isolate from citrus trees persistently infected by citrus tristeza virus was found to include several genotypes [51] . Shared characteristics of hostpathogen interaction may enable such highly multiple infections. These include persistent, sub-clinical viral replication, the absence of barriers to superinfection, the lack of an immune response capable of clearing infection, and a high prevalence of infection. Virus populations replicate as stable ensembles in culture: (A) Liver homogenate from snake #38 was applied to cultures of JK cells and replication was monitored by measuring supernatant viral RNA levels using qRT-PCR and genotype-specific primers. Levels of distinct S and L genotypes detected are indicated and are normalized to the amount of S RNA detected in the first time point. Points and error bars represent mean and standard deviation of two independent experiments. (B) As in (A), but a liver homogenate from snake #47 was used as inoculum. (C) The 2xIGR L4 segment detected in snake #47 replicates stably in culture. Same experiment as (B), but qRT-PCR used primers that targeted two different regions of the L4 segment as depicted in the inset cartoon.

Although we detected many instances of snake tissues containing multiple viral genotypes, our results do not prove that individual cells in these animals were multiply infected. However, the detection of recombinant and reassortant genotypes suggests that at least in some cases cells are multiply infected.

Although multiple infection per se is not unprecedented, several aspects of these findings are. One is the apparent disconnect between the dynamics of the two viral genome segments, both in individual animals and at a population level. In individual animals, the accumulation of S and L segments was unbalanced: in all multiply infected animals, there were more L than S segments. In the most extreme case (snake #33), a single S genotype was paired with an Most or all virus particles contain one L genotype. End-point dilution experiments were performed to determine the viral genotype of individual virus particles. Serial dilutions were prepared and applied to JK cells in 96-well plates. After 7-10 days, supernatant was reserved and wells were stained with anti-NP antibody to identify infected wells. qRT-PCR using discriminating primers was used to genotype the virus in individual well supernatant. Each row corresponds to one well and each column to an S or L genotype. The fractional abundance of S and L genotypes detected in individual wells are indicated as in Fig 2 as are the dilution used to inoculate the genotyped well. Negative wells (""neg""), not staining with anti-NP antibody, from the highest dilutions served as negative controls. The amount of each genotype detected in the inoculum is also indicated. Inoculum from snake #37 liver was used in (A) and from snake #47 liver in (B).

doi:10.1371/journal.ppat.1004900.g009 ensemble of 10 L genotypes. It is possible that within animals the S and L segments inhabit different fitness landscapes. Another, not mutually exclusive, possibility is that differential replication kinetics or packaging efficiencies of the two segments may underlie the observed imbalance. Additional experiments in vitro and in animals will clarify this issue.

The population level dominance of the S6 genotype was also unexpected and is worthy of additional investigation. Genotype S6 segments were present in 37/48 infections (77%) and in 29 of these, no other S segment was detected. One possible explanation is that the S6 genotype replicates more efficiently within animals, or is more efficiently packaged and transmitted than other competing S segments. Alternatively, the high frequency of this genotype may be a stochastic effect, or may be proportional to viral genotypes in natural virus populations, from which these viruses in captive snakes presumably originate. Alternatively, it is possible that the 23 L genotypes observed here were originally paired with 23 S genotypes in free-ranging hosts. If this were the case, then 12 S genotypes are unaccounted for. Testing of wild-caught snakes could reveal the ""missing"" S genotypes and original S-L pairings and would reveal whether the S6 genotype has indeed risen to dominance in the context of captive animals.

Whether a similar degree of multiple infection is possible in mammalian arenaviruses is an open question, and one that may be relevant to the possible emergence of new mammalian arenavirus strains with pathogenic potential. It may be that there are larger species barriers for mammalian arenaviruses than there are for snake arenaviruses. Another possibility is that an ecological situation analogous to captive snake breeding has never been created for rodents. Alternatively, characteristics of the mammalian arenavirus host-pathogen interaction may prevent multiple infection. Indeed, superinfection exclusion has been documented in mammalian arenavirus tissue culture experiments [52] [53] [54] [55] [56] [57] . And, cross-protection between mammalian arenaviruses has been documented in vivo [58] [59] [60] . Assuming that superinfection accounts for at least some of the genotype accumulation observed here, then no such mechanisms are operating in these snakes. Laboratory experiments with mammalian arenaviruses and other segmented viruses could test the generality of this phenomenon.

The discovery of ""2xIGR"" genome segment configurations was also unanticipated. It would be reasonable to predict that these segments would exhibit decreased fitness or be unstable during replication, given that they carry superfluous content. However, two lines of evidence suggested that these 2xIGR segments are capable of transmission and are stable over multiple rounds of replication. First, several of these segments were detected in co-housed snakes (L10 in snakes #22 and 23; L22 in #28, 30, and 31; L4 in #46-48). Presumably, each of these segments was initially generated via recombination in a single infected snake and then transmitted. Second, in tissue culture these segments replicated stably and could be passaged and isolated (Figs 8C and 9B) . More extensive passage experiments in animals and culture will reveal whether maintenance of the 2xIGR configuration is disfavored over the long term.

These novel segment configurations also raise the possibility for the creation of payloadcontaining arenavirus genome segments. For example, the L10 segment found in snakes #22 and #23 contain 2 intergenic regions and 559 bases of extraneous incomplete coding sequence. If a suitable reverse genetic system were developed, this regions could be replaced with an internal ribosomal entry site and the 516 base NanoLuc luciferase gene or other payloads [61] . Such a tagged virus could be used for example in in vivo pathogenesis studies as an alternative to trisegmented recombinant arenaviruses [62] .

The nomenclature and taxonomy of the snake arenaviruses will likely have to be reconsidered in light of these findings [22] . We propose a nomenclature like that used for influenza A virus (IAV) subtypes, where new S and L genotypes are simply enumerated [63] . We would also propose following the taxonomic scheme for IAV subtypes, which belong to a single species, Influenza A virus. In this case, snake arenavirus genotypes could be grouped into one or possibly more species.

Recombinant genotypes were not limited to those described in this study. Discordance between GPC-and NP-based phylogenies including sequences from viruses detected in snakes in Europe suggested possible S-segment recombination [39, 40] . The increased phylogenetic resolution enabled by this study confirmed the recombinant nature of the S and L segments of Boa3 AV NL and the L segment of UHV-1 [25, 26] (Table 2, Figs 1 and 2) .

It is possible that snake importation and husbandry practices have inadvertently created an ecological context that has enabled this phenomenon. Boa constrictors with different colorations (""color morphs"") are highly valued by collectors and breeders. Such colorations arise in nature as local adaptations and wild-caught snakes are commonly imported for breeding purposes. An estimated 98,500 boa constrictors per year were imported into the USA alone between 2005-2010 [64] . Mammalian arenavirus species have co-evolved with their distinct, geographically isolated rodent hosts, and it may be that snake arenavirus strains have coevolved similarly in the wild. It is plausible that apparently healthy snakes persistently infected by various arenavirus species have been imported and intermingled in high-density breeding operations. This possible anthropogenic disruption of pathogen ecology is reminiscent of the influenza virus diversity generated in live animal markets [65] . Sampling of viral diversity in free-ranging snake populations are needed to clarify the impact of human activities on the evolution of these viruses and to further assess the disease potential of the resulting recombinant and reassortant genotypes.

In the absence of barriers to superinfection, an incalculable number of novel viral genotype configurations, made even more numerous by frequent intra-segment recombination and an error-prone polymerase, could rapidly evolve and accumulate within individual animals and in breeding facilities. In theory, this situation could be exacerbated by the introduction of mammalian arenavirus-infected rodents as feedstock [66] , although it is unknown whether recombinant or reassortant mammalian/reptile arenaviruses are possible or viable. Regardless, further investigation of high-density reptile breeding and feed rodent facilities should be considered.

Samples were collected between 1997 and 2014 from California, Washington, Arkansas, Tennessee, Louisiana, Georgia, and Florida. Veterinarians in private practice or at university teaching hospitals collected samples. Samples were submitted to the University of Florida or the University of California San Francisco for further processing and storage. Blood samples were collected by cardiac or tail vein puncture and frozen until further processing. Tissue samples were collected during necropsy and frozen until further analysis or placed in formalin for histopathology. For histopathology, samples were preserved in 10% formalin, paraffin embedded, sectioned, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Board-certified pathologists blinded to infection status of samples examined H&E stained sections.

RNA extracted from tissues (500 ng) or tissue culture supernatant was denatured for 5 min at 65°C then cooled on ice and added to 10 μl RT reactions containing 100 pmoles random hexamer oligonucleotide (MDS-286), 1× reaction buffer, 5 mM dithiothreitol, 1.25 mM (each) deoxynucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs), and 100 U SuperScript III (Life Technologies). Reaction mixtures were incubated for 5 min at 25°C then for 60 min at 42°C and then for 15 min at 70°C. cDNA was diluted 1:10 in 10mM Tris pH8, 0.1 mM EDTA. qPCR reactions contained 5 μl diluted cDNA, 0.5 μM each primer, 10 mM Tris pH 8.8, 50 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM each dNTP, 5% glycerol, 0.08% NP-40, 0.05% Tween-20, 0.15 μl Taq DNA polymerase, and 1x Sybr Green (Life Technologies) in each 15 μl reaction. Primer sequences are listed in S2 Table. Degenerate primers targeting the glycoprotein gene (MDS-400 and -402) were used to screen for infection. qRT-PCR to screen for individual S and L genotypes was performed using panels of primers that were designed to discriminate between the different sequences. Primer pair efficiencies were determined using template dilution series [67, 68] .

RNA was extracted from tissues as previously described [23] . Sequencing libraries were prepared as previously described [69] . Paired-end 2x135 bp sequencing was performed on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 in the Center for Advanced Technology at UCSF., producing an average of 2.0x10 6 read pairs per sample.

A stepwise pipeline was used to process sequencing data. First, data was demultiplexed. Then, 5 bases were trimmed of the 5 0 end of reads and 1 base off the 3 0 end. Next, low quality read pairs with any 10 base window with an average quality score below 30 were discarded. Then, reads sharing >98% global nucleotide identity (likely PCR duplicates) were collapsed using the cd-hit-est software version 4.6 [44] . Adapter sequences were trimmed from the ends of reads. Then, host-derived sequences were filtered as previously described [23] . Viral genome sequences were assembled from the remaining reads An iterative strategy was used to assemble genome segment sequences. First, from each dataset, post-filtering reads were aligned using Bowtie2 to a database composed of all alreadydescribed snake arenavirus genome segments sequences [43] . Alignment parameters were set stringently (minimum alignment score of 150 in local mode alignment) so that only reads closely matching already described sequences aligned. Alignments were converted into BAM format using SAMTools software and inspected in Geneious software [70, 71] . Sites differing from reference sequences were corrected to generate new draft genome sequences. Remaining virus-derived reads (determined by BLASTx, as described below) that didn't align to an existing virus sequence were used to seed assemblies using the PRICE targeted de novo assembler [72] . PRICE contigs were added to the set of genome segment sequences and the process was reiterated until all reads were accounted for as described below.

Once a complete set of genome segment sequences was assembled, we used Bowtie2 to remap all reads from each dataset to the set of genome segment sequences derived from that dataset. These alignments were manually inspected and were used to generate coverage metrics. For each aligned base, coverage was only counted if the preceding and succeeding 3 bases also aligned. This ""continuous coverage"" metric is more conservative than a simple coverage metric and was implemented to identify possible incorrect assemblies. BAM files from these alignments, as well as FASTQ files of raw sequencing data for all snakes, have been deposited in the NCBI Short Read Archive (SRA; accession SRP057522). Genome segment sequences have been deposited in GenBank with accessions KP071471-KP071680.

We employed the following analysis strategy to confirm that we were accounting for the full viral genetic complexity in our datasets, i.e. that we were not overlooking any viral genome segments. We used the BLASTx tool to align translated reads from each dataset to a database containing all available snake arenavirus protein sequences, including the ones from this study. Because BLASTx alignments are based on protein sequence similarity, it is possible to use them to detect sequences with relatively distant homology. Thus, the number of reads with BLASTx alignments to arenavirus protein sequences (with E-value 10 -8 ) determined a minimum expected number of virus sequences in each dataset. Then, we used the Bowtie2 aligner to stringently map reads from each dataset to the coding sequences of the assemblies generated from that dataset as described above. This allowed us to confirm that the assemblies accounted for all of the arenavirus-derived sequences in each dataset. To calculate the fractional abundance of individual genotypes, we divided the number of read pairs mapping to that genotype by the total number of arenavirus-mapping reads from that dataset.

We performed phylogenetic analyses to infer evolutionary relationships between viral genotypes. We created multiple sequence alignments of the coding sequences for each of the 4 viral gene coding sequences, using MAFFT version v7.017 with default parameters [73] . These alignments were trimmed using the Gblocks software version 0.91b using default parameters except allowing up to half gaps in columns (parameters:-t = d-b5 = h [74] ). We used these trimmed alignments and the JModelTest software v2.1.6 to identify a best-fit nucleotide substitution model (GTR; [75, 76] ). We ran this software with parameters:-s 11-f-i-g 4-AIC-BI-C-AICc-DT-p-a-w. We used MrBayes 3.2.2 to create Bayesian phylogenies from these alignments, using commands lset nst = 6 rates = propinv and mcmc ngen = 2000000 [77] . These phylogenies were visualized using FigTree software (http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/ figtree/).

To create phylogenies including representative snake and mammalian arenavirus sequences, we first downloaded all sequences from the NCBI nucleotide database w/ query: ""txid11617 [Organism:exp]"", i.e. all sequences annotated as being of arenavirus origin. We removed sequences that were not complete or not coding-complete. We extracted NP and L CDS from these sequences. We used cd-hit-est to create a set of representative sequences, with sequences sharing >80% pairwise nucleotide identity collapsed (-c 0.8) [44] . We then created and trimmed multiple alignments and phylogenies as described above.

Global multiple sequence alignments of all S and all L segments were created using MAFFT software version 7.017 with default parameters [73] . Full genome sequences for described European snake arenavirus isolates were included in these alignments (University of Helsinki virus (UHV-1) and Boa arenavirus NL; NCBI accessions NC_023766.1, NC_023765.1, NC_023761.1, and NC_023762.1). Alignments were analyzed with the RDP4 recombination detection program version 4.39 using default parameters except to specify linear molecule topology [45] . We required that recombination events be detected by at least 2 of the methods implemented in the software. Putative recombinant segments were validated by examination of phylogenetic discordance and pairwise sequence alignments.

Genome segments sequences were divided into 140 nt sliding windows (the approximate size of intergenic regions) offset by 5 nt. CentroidFold v0.0.9 was used to calculate the minimum free energy of folding for each window using parameters-g 4-e CONTRAfold [78] .

Variant sites were called using SAMTools version 0.1.19, using command mpileup-I. We required that variant sites be supported by at least 4 reads in the context of a minimum coverage level of 20 total reads. The number of variant sites per genome segment was calculated and normalized to the length of each segment.

Tissue culture RIC For inoculation experiments, frozen tissue samples were thawed on ice and homogenized in MEM + 25mM HEPES (SF-MEM) using a Dounce homogenizer. Homogenates were clarified by centrifugation at 10,000g for 2 minutes then passed through a 0.45 μm filter. Filtrates were diluted 1:10 in SF-MEM then added to cultures of near confluent JK cells. Culture medium was replaced periodically and supernatants were stored at -80°C until further analysis.

We used qRT-PCR to measure viral RNA levels in culture supernatant. We extracted RNA from 180 μl supernatant using the Zymo viral RNA kit (Zymo Research). 5 μl RNA (25% of eluate) was used as template in RT reactions as above. Resulting cDNA was diluted and used in qPCR reactions as above, with primers listed in S2 Table. Primer pair efficiencies were calculated as above and used to determine quantities of viral RNA relative to the amount of S segment RNA present in the first time point sample.

JK cells were grown as described above and were plated at a density of 5000 cells per well in 96-well plates. One day later diluted virus stocks were added to cells. Cells were incubated for 7-10 days and then supernatants were transferred to new 96 well plates. Then wells were stained with anti-GGV-NP antibody, which cross-reacts with the NPs of the viruses used in these experiments. Staining and washing was performed as previously described [23] . Stained plates were scanned on an Odyssey Licor instrument to identify infected wells. Supernatant from NP-positive wells were transferred to 24-well plate wells plated the day prior with 75,000 JK cells per well. One day later cell culture supernatant was replaced. After an additional 3 days of incubation, culture supernatant was collected and clarified by centrifugation at 10,000g for 1 minute. RNA was isolated from these supernatants using the ZR Viral RNA kit according to the manufacturer's protocol (Zymo Research). RNA was used as template in qRT-PCR as described above to measure levels of viral RNA of various genotypes.

This study did not include experiments involving live animals. In some cases, samples (typically blood) were collected from live animals by attending veterinarians. In other cases, tissues were collected during necropsy. All samples were taken and used with owners consent. Some samples were collected in the context of other, related studies: The acquisition of tissue samples at the University of Florida was authorized under University of Florida Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee Protocol A116. The acquisition of samples at the University of California Davis was authorized under IACUC protocol 17450.

Genome cartoons and features are drawn to scale. Vertical lines at the end of genome segments indicate that the putative terminal sequences are included in the assembly for that segment. Where applicable, partial coding sequences and the approximate location of recombination junctions are indicated. Note that it was not possible to confidently identify the recombination breakpoint for the L19 genome segments so it is not depicted. Below each cartoon are plotted coverage levels (the number of sequencing reads supporting each base in the assembly) and predicted free energy of folding (i.e. predicted RNA secondary structure; -ΔG) of 140 nt sliding windows. Displayed are fractional abundances of indicated S or L segment genotypes in individual samples as measured by qRT-PCR using a panel of genotype-discriminating primers (q) and sequencing (s). Fractional abundance was measured for qPCR using standard curve-based quantitation and for sequencing using read mapping as in Fig 4. Neg snake is a sample from an uninfected snake and HeLa is total HeLa cell RNA. Asterisks ( Ã ) indicate the following issues related to template/primer compatibility: snake #30 L2 contains mismatches in the primer binding regions so doesn't amplify; primers targeting the L3 genotype also amplify recombinant genotype L4 in snake #46 and #47; primers targeting the L18 genotype also amplify recombinant genotype L22 in snake #30. In these latter two cases, qPCR-measured abundance was split evenly between the two amplified genotypes. (PDF)

Viruses associated with Antarctic wildlife: From serology based detection to identification of genomes using high throughput sequencing,"The Antarctic, sub-Antarctic islands and surrounding sea-ice provide a unique environment for the existence of organisms. Nonetheless, birds and seals of a variety of species inhabit them, particularly during their breeding seasons. Early research on Antarctic wildlife health, using serology-based assays, showed exposure to viruses in the families Birnaviridae, Flaviviridae, Herpesviridae, Orthomyxoviridae and Paramyxoviridae circulating in seals (Phocidae), penguins (Spheniscidae), petrels (Procellariidae) and skuas (Stercorariidae). It is only during the last decade or so that polymerase chain reaction-based assays have been used to characterize viruses associated with Antarctic animals. Furthermore, it is only during the last five years that full/whole genomes of viruses (adenoviruses, anelloviruses, orthomyxoviruses, a papillomavirus, paramyoviruses, polyomaviruses and a togavirus) have been sequenced using Sanger sequencing or high throughput sequencing (HTS) approaches. This review summaries the knowledge of animal Antarctic virology and discusses potential future directions with the advent of HTS in virus discovery and ecology.","Among Earth's oceans, those in the Polar Regions are the smallest and most constrained, the Arctic Ocean encircled by landmasses and the Southern Ocean by the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC). The latter ocean is bounded to its north by the Antarctic Polar Front (APF), a wellknown faunal barrier, and has a high degree of endemism among both vertebrates and invertebrates (e.g. Briggs, 1995; Eastman, 2013) . Owing to dramatic annual cycles of heat and light, the productivity of the Southern Ocean is highly constrained on a seasonal basis, a characteristic that provides a generally challenging environment for the existence of organisms. Moreover, the high latitude Southern Ocean, i.e. that portion south of the Southern Boundary of the ACC (SBACC), is covered by sea ice for much of the year, in some places the entire year. Most of the birds and seals of a variety of species that inhabit that zone are endemic and resident, the most unvarying species assemblage found in Southern Hemisphere oceans; only a few migrant species augment that assemblage during summer (Ribic and Ainley, 1989) . The species comprising this assemblage breed either on Antarctic islands (birds) or the sea ice that surrounds the continent (seals). In contrast, waters north of the SBACC host a much more speciose, seasonally varying seabird and marine mammal assemblage composed of species breeding on low latitude islands bordering the APF (Antarctic and sub-Antarctic) as well as seasonal migrants from more temperate regions (e.g. Ainley et al., 1994; Laws, 1977a,b; Ribic and Ainley, 1989; Ribic et al., 2011) . In accord with trends of diversity varying inversely with latitude, overall diversity of vertebrate species is low in the Southern Ocean, especially south of the SBACC, but populations are immense (e.g. Laws, 1977a,b) .

Inhabiting the pack-ice surrounding Antarctica is a unique assemblage of pagophilic seals, crabeater (Lobodon carcinophaga), leopard (Hydrurda leptonyx), Ross (Ommatophoca rossii) and Weddell seal (Leptonychotes weddellii). Weddell seals colonize near-shore fast-ice regions feeding mainly on fish, while other Antarctic seals remain year round in the pack-ice composed of individual, often compacted floes. Crabeater seals feed principally on krill (Euphausia spp.), and Ross seals mostly on squid. Unlike the other Antarctic seals, leopard seals are solitary and highly predatory feeding on penguins and other seals as well as fish, krill and cephalopods (Siniff, 1981 

Due to its zoogeographical isolation, introduction of pathogens and parasites to these populations of Antarctic wildlife, particularly the endemics of high latitude, may have detrimental effects. Understanding these potential effects required a knowledge of the entities circulating in the ecosystem. This concern drove interest toward detecting viruses, bacteria and parasites among Antarctic animals providing insight to their health. There have been a few reported cases of mass mortality where the disease-causing agent was undetermined. In 1971, several hundred gentoo penguin chicks at a Signey Island colony, South Orkneys, were found dead (MacDonald and Conroy, 1971 ). Although symptoms were described as similar to puffinosis coronavirus infection, no isolation of the disease agent was possible (Barbosa and Palacios, 2009) . In 1972, about 65% of Adélie penguin chicks were reported dead in a colony near Mawson Station. In this case, penguins were found face down and apparently unable to walk or stand properly . The cause of this disease was not determined. The only mass mortality reported in seals was the death of over 1500 crabeater seals in a colony around Crown Prince Gustav Channel, Antarctic Peninsula in 1955 (Laws and Taylor, 1957) . Interestingly, Weddell seals in the area were unaffected and while the nature of this disease was unknown, a viral infection was suggested. Laws and Taylor (1957) noted that the population of seals in this area was almost ten times higher than normal and predicted that this crowding and partial starvation likely contributed to the effects of the disease.

Only within the last ten years has an increase in knowledge of the viral diversity been evident among Antarctic wildlife at a genome level. Early work, beginning in the mid-1970s, on identifying viruses associated with Antarctic animals relied on serology-based assays ( Table 1) . The research then was particularly focused around detecting pathogens posing a risk to animal health due to concerns regarding the impact of increased anthropogenic activity, e.g. research, tourism, on birds and marine mammals (Kerry and Riddle, 2009 ). During the early period of Antarctic virus research, paramyxoviruses, orthomyxoviruses, birnaviruses, herpesviruses and flaviviruses were serologically detected (Table 1, Fig. 1 ). Subsequently, between 2000 and 2010, probe based assays using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were used to detect paramyxoviruses, orthomyxoviruses and a poxvirus (Table 2, Fig. 1 ). Finally, in the last decade, advancements in high throughput sequencing (HTS) approaches are beginning to have an impact on our knowledge of Antarctic animal virology. For example, in the last five years using viral metagenomic based approaches with HTS, various novel viruses have been identified and characterized at a genomic level (Table 2, Fig. 1 ). These include adenoviruses, anelloviruses, orthomyxoviruses, papillomaviruses, polyomaviruses and paramyxoviruses.

3.1. Positive sense RNA viruses

Flaviviridae is a family of enveloped positive sense RNA viruses with four genera: Flavivirus, Hepacivirus, Pegivirus and Pestivirus. Their genomes range in length from 8.9-13 kb (Simmonds et al., 2017b) . While no genomic information is available for flaviviruses circulating in Antarctic animals, neutralizing antibodies to a flavivirus were detected in the serum of South Polar skuas (Stercorarius maccormicki) around Davis station, East Antarctica (Miller et al., 2008) . As lower latitude seabirds are infested with ticks (e.g. Lee and Baust, 1987) , which are known to carry flaviviruses, this may indicate the transmission of tickborne flaviviruses to seabirds, especially given the fact that a flavivirus was isolated from seabird ticks (Ixodes uriae) infecting king penguins on Macquarie Island (Major et al., 2009) .

The family Togaviridae consist of enveloped positive sense RNA viruses with a genome length of about 11-12 kb in length. Togaviruses are classified into two genera, Alphavirus and Rubivirus (Power et al., 2017) . While the human pathogenic virus, rubella virus, is the only known member of the single species in the genus Rubivirus to date (species Rubella virus), all animal togaviruses are classified as alphaviruses (Power et al., 2017) . The life cycle of alphaviruses requires an arthropod vector, either a mosquito or tick, for transmission to their vertebrate host. The first instance of alphaviruses found in marine mammals was shown in southern elephant seals of Macquarie Island. Initially the seal alphavirus was isolated from the blood-sucking louse (Lepidophthirus macrorhini) that is widespread among southern elephant seals. However, a high seroprevalence of antibodies against the southern elephant seal alphavirus strongly indicated its transmission from lice to seals (La Linn et al., 2001) . The full genome of this alphavirus (Southern elephant seal virus) was determined in a later study (Forrester et al., 2012 Antarctica continues to provide an interesting environment to study Influenza A viruses, especially in the case of migratory birds. For example, the South Polar skuas that breed on the Antarctic continent in the summer but move north, well into the Northern Hemisphere during the non-breeding season (Weimerskirch et al., 2015) , thus act as Table 1 Summary of Antarctic bird-and mammal-associated viruses detected through serological approaches. Fig. 1 ) (Austin and Webster, 1993; Baumeister et al., 2004; Miller et al., 2008; . Such research has indicated that influenza virus is highly widespread and prevalent in Antarctic birds. However, the pathogenicity of avian influenza virus in these populations is unknown. No genomic information for Influenza A viruses in Antarctic birds was available until Hurt et al. (2014) used HTS approaches to identify influenza A virus (H11N2) in Adélie penguins around the Antarctic Peninsula. A following study around the same area later identified the strain H5N5 among chinstrap penguins (Hurt et al., 2016) . None of the early studies have detected antibodies against influenza A virus strains in Antarctic pinnipeds, although several studies have looked at crabeater and Weddell seals (Austin and Webster, 1993; McFarlane, 2009 ).

Paramyxoviridae is a family of enveloped, non-segmented negative sense RNA viruses in the order Mononegavirales with genomes of ∼15 kb. Paramyxoviruses are divided into seven genera: Aquaparamyxovirus, Ferlavirus, Respirovirus, Morbillivirus, Rubulavirus, Henipavirus, and Avulavirus. The genus Avulavirus includes of 13 formally classified species of avian paramyxoviruses including avian paramyxovirus 1 (AVPM-1) (Afonso et al., 2016) . The genus Morbillivirus contains paramyxoviruses infecting mammals.

The majority of research on paramyxoviruses in Antarctica has been based on serological studies using haemagglutination inhibition assay to detect antibodies against paramyxoviruses in serum samples (Table 1) . A high prevalence of antibodies to NDV in South Polar skuas has been reported (Miller et al., 2010) , whereas low incidences have been found in Adélie and royal penguins around coastal Antarctica and Macquarie Island (Table 1 , Fig. 1 ) Westbury, 1981, 1988) . So far, king, gentoo and rockhopper penguin colonies on Macquarie Island have tested negative for AVPM-1 antibodies .

Despite serology-based knowledge of these viruses among Antarctic birds, our understanding of their diversity is extremely limited due to the lack of available genomic data. Partial genome sequences of NDV in Adélie penguins has been obtained using HTS approaches (Thomazelli et al., 2010) . Most recently, complete genome sequences of avian paramyxovirus 10 (APMV 10) and three novel avulaviruses (APMV 11, 12, 13) have been determined from rockhopper penguins on the Falkland Islands and gentoo penguins sampled on Kopaitic Island, northern tip of the Antarctic Peninsula (Table 1, Fig. 1 ) (Goraichuk et al., 2017; Neira et al., 2017) .

With the use of sled dogs (Canis familiaris) during the early Antarctic expeditions, concern of morbillivirus infection among Antarctic pinnipeds drove research in monitoring for this virus in seal populations. Antibodies to canine distemper virus (CDV) have been reported in leopard and crabeater seals around the Antarctic Peninsula (Bengtson et al., 1991) and phocine distemper virus (PDV) in Weddell seals from Vestfold Hills, East Antarctica (McFarlane, 2009) . With the exception of crabeater seals, both of these studies revealed low antibody titers against CDV and PDV. Several other studies looking at morbilliviruses in Antarctic seals have failed to detect any antibodies against these viruses (Harder et al., 1991; Osterhaus et al., 1988; Stenvers et al., 1992; Yochem et al., 2009 ). This may suggest morbilliviruses are not persistent in Antarctic seals or perhaps there are diverse morbilliviruses circulating amongst the pinnipeds that cannot be detected using conventional serology assays but likely to be identified using HTS approaches. Unlike avian paramyxoviruses, no genomic data are available for morbilliviruses from Antarctic seals and therefore impossible to tell if there was a spillover event from the canines to the pinnipeds. Sled dogs are no longer allowed in Antarctica.

Viruses in the family Birnaviridae have non-enveloped capsids that encapsidate two linear double stranded segments of RNA, each ∼2.3-3 kb in length. Four genera have been established in this family: Avibirnavirus, Aquabirnavirus, Blosnavirus and Entomobirnavirus (Delmas et al., 2011) . Infectious bursal disease virus is the only characterized virus belonging to genus Avibirnavirus. Since its initial identification as virus responsible for a highly infectious disease among chickens, infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) has widely been isolated from other birds in the poultry industry including ducks and turkeys, however, disease has only been identified in chickens. Between 1995-2002 neutralization assays identified high titers of antibodies against IBDV in Adélie penguin at colonies around Mawson and Davis stations, and Terra Nova Bay, East Antarctica; and emperor penguin at the Auster, Amanda and Cape Washington colonies, also in East Antarctica (Table 1, Fig. 1 ) (Gardner et al., 1997; Watts et al., 2009) . Highest seroprevalence has been detected among emperor penguin colonies with no difference between sampled locations or years . South Polar skuas around Vestold Hills and Davis Station, East Antarctica, have also had high titer of antibodies against IBDV (Miller et al., 2008; Watts et al., 2009) , however, a significant difference in seroprevalence between sampling periods during 1999-2002 was observed. A low titer and prevalence of antibodies to IBDV has been detected in king penguins around Possession Island, among the Crozet Islands along the APF (Gauthier-Clerc et al., 2002) . High-titers of IBDV neutralizing antibodies detected in distant populations of penguins and South Polar skua around Antarctica suggests it is unlikely IBDV was introduced through disposal of chicken products around Mawson Station as previously suggested by Gardner et al. (1997) . Given that IBDV infection has been commonly detected in other wild avian populations (Hollmén et al., 2000; Kasanga et al., 2008; Ogawa et al., 1998) , this virus may be naturally occurring among Antarctic birds . It is worth noting, however, that IBDV has yet to be isolated from Antarctic birds despite several studies detecting neutralizing antibodies. Therefore, it is difficult to address any questions about the diversity, evolution or transmission of this virus among Antarctic birds.

Adenoviruses are a family of non-enveloped double stranded DNA viruses with a genome length of ∼26-45 kb. The diversification of these viruses is thought to have occurred through several animal hosts including mammals, reptiles, birds, fish and amphibians. The family Adenoviridae has been divided into five genera: Mastadenovirus, Aviadenovirus, Atadenovirus, Siadenovirus, Ichtadenovirus (Harrach et al., 2011) .

Most adenovirus research has focused on the implications of humanassociated adenoviruses, likely due to the known clinical significance in causing respiratory disease and gastroenteritis. However, the first adenoviruses from Antarctic animals have only recently been identified among South Polar skua (Skua siadenovirus A) (Park et al., 2012) , as well as chinstrap, Adélie and gentoo penguins (Penguin siadenovirus A) (Table 2, Fig. 1 ) (Lee et al., 2014; Lee et al., 2016) . This provides important insight to monitoring penguin health in Antarctica, as adenoviruses have been known to cause severe disease among animals.

Whole genomes for these adenoviruses were confirmed using HTS approaches and subsequent phylogenetic analyses of the genomic sequences provide support for the classification of the South Polar skua and penguin adenoviruses in the genus Siadenovirus. Despite this classification, penguin adenovirus genomes are unique in that they lack a putative sialidase gene that is characteristic of other genomes in this Z.E. Smeele et al. Virus Research 243 (2018) 91-105 genus (Lee et al., 2016) . It is likely that there exits adenoviruses associated with Antarctic seals based on the fact that adenoviruses has been identified in California sea lion (Zalophus californianus), Fur seals (Arctocephalus spp.) and South American sea lion (Otaria flavescens) (Chiappetta et al., 2017; Cortes-Hinojosa et al., 2016; Cortes-Hinojosa et al., 2015; Goldstein et al., 2011; Inoshima et al., 2013) .

Herpesviridae is a large family of enveloped viruses with a linear, double stranded DNA genome about 120-240 kb in length. This family has been divided into three subfamilies (Alphaherpesvirinae, Betaherpesvirinae and Gammaherpesvirinae). Herpesviruses belonging to two species, based on partial genome sequencing of conserved regions, have been found among pinnipeds in the Northern Hemisphere (Harder et al., 1996) : phocid alphaherpesvirus-1 (PhHV-1, species Phocid alphaherpesvirus 1) belonging to the Varicellovirus genus of the Alphaherpesvirinae subfamily and phocid gammaherpesvirus-2 (PhHV-2, Phocid gammaherpesvirus 2) belonging to the Gammaherpesvirinae subfamily. Both PhHV-1 and PhHV-2 have been identified in several non-Antarctic pinniped species around the world from free-ranging populations as well as captive populations in zoos and aquaria (Bellehumeur et al., 2016; Goldstein et al., 2004; Osterhaus et al., 1985) .

Among Antarctic pinnipeds, herpesvirus has not been confirmed by molecular methods, however, several studies over the years have shown high levels of PhHV-1 neutralizing antibodies in Antarctic fur seals among sub-Antarctic islands, and Ross, Weddell and crabeater seals off East Antarctica (Table 1 , Fig. 1 ) (Harder et al., 1991; Stenvers et al., 1992; Tryland et al., 2012) . Thus, it is highly likely that herpesvirus is widespread and persistent among pinnipeds. However, genomic data is required to confirm this virus among Antarctic pinnipeds as the serological data has only indicated infection of a herpesvirus antigenically similar to PhHV-1.

Papillomaviridae is a large family of non-enveloped, circular, double stranded DNA viruses with ∼7-8 kb genomes and are known to infect skin, squamous and mucosal epithelial cells. All papillomavirus genomes have a very similar organization that can be divided into three regions encoding replication associated and regulatory proteins, structural proteins, and a long control region. While research on human papillomaviruses has been extensive due its clinical significance, relatively few studies have looked at non-human papillomaviruses. Papillomaviruses are found in a range of hosts including mammals, birds, reptiles and fish. It is a well-supported hypothesis that they have co-evolved with their hosts given their diversity and host specificity, with supporting phylogenetic analyses that track diversification of papillomaviruses to the evolution of their host (Bernard et al., 2010; de Villiers et al., 2004) .

Two novel papillomavirus, Pygoscelis adeliae papillomavirus 1, −2 (PaPV1, −2), was recently identified in Antarctica from feces and cloacal swab of Adélie penguins at Cape Crozier, Ross Island (Table 2 , Fig. 1 ) using a HTS-informed approach (Van Doorslaer et al., 2017; Varsani et al., 2014) . PaPV1 and −2 are related to other avian papillomaviruses, PaPV1 has been assigned to the genus Treisepsilonpapillomavirus whereas PaPV2 is currently unclassified and shares ∼64% genome-wide pairwise identity with PaPV1. These PaPVs are the first papillomaviruses to be discovered in Antarctic animals and are part of the few known avian papillomaviruses.

Polyomaviruses represent a family of non-enveloped, circular, double-stranded DNA viruses with a genome length of 5-6 kb, and infect a range of hosts including mammals, birds, reptiles and fish. This family has four genera: Alphapolyomavirus, Betapolyomavirus, Deltapolyomavirus, and Gammapolyomavirus with three species unassigned to any of these (Moens et al., 2017; Polyomaviridae Study Group of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses et al., 2016) . Phylogenetic analyses have shown that avian polyomaviruses cluster together and have been classified under the genus Gammapolyomavirus. Avian polyomaviruses are known to cause inflammatory disease in birds, and can lead to disease of the skin and feathers and mortality in some species. The first polyomavirus identified in Antarctica was found in the feces of Adélie penguins at Cape Royds, Ross Island (Varsani et al., 2015) using a HTS-informed approach. Analysis of this genome shows that it falls in the avian polyomavirus lineage, representing a novel species (Pygoscelis adeliae polyomavirus 1).

Following this, two other polyomaviruses have been identified from Antarctic animals: a polyomavirus from the stomach of a sharp-spined notothen (Trematomus pennellii) (Buck et al., 2016) and most recently from the kidney of a Weddell seal, both sampled in the Ross Sea (Table 2, Fig. 1 ) . The sharp-spined notothen polyomavirus is one of the three polyomaviruses to be identified associated with fish and all three were identified using HTS approaches (Buck et al., 2016) .

Polyomavirus sequences have been identified in three other pinniped species: once in a captive Hawaiian monk seal (Neomonachus schauinslandi) (Cortes-Hinojosa et al., 2016) , in the placenta of one northern fur seal (Callorhinus ursinus) (Duncan et al., 2013) from Alaska and a stranded free-ranging California sea lion (Zalophus californianus) (Colegrove et al., 2010) . However, until recently the genome of California sea lion polyomavirus (CSLPyV) was the only confirmed pinniped polyomavirus. The recently identified Weddell seal polyomavirus is has been proposed to be classified as the species Leptonychotes weddellii polyomavirus 1 (https://talk.ictvonline.org/files/proposals/ animal_dna_viruses_and_retroviruses/m/animal_dna_ec_approved/ 6941).

Poxviruses are a diverse family of double-stranded DNA viruses with a wide host range among vertebrates and arthropods (Skinner et al., 2011) . Poxviruses have been extensively studied for their clinical significance in causing highly pathogenic disease among humans and other animals. While sealpox has yet to be formally classified, studies have identified this virus in populations of harbor seals (Phoca vitulina) (Muller et al., 2003) , gray seals (Halichoerus grypus) (Nettleton et al., 1995) , Stellar sea lions (Eumetopias jubatus), spotted seals (Phoca largha) (Bracht et al., 2006) , and California sea lions (Nollens et al., 2006) , causing severe proliferative lesions on the bodies of infected individuals. Partial sequencing has indicated seal poxvirus falls under the parapoxvirus family of which only four species have been classified.

The only case of poxvirus in Antarctica known to date has been the isolation and detection from a skin lesion of a deceased Weddell seal in Queen Maud Land, East Antarctica (Table 2, Fig. 1 ) (Tryland et al., 2005) . Other Weddell seals in the area were analyzed for seal poxvirus, however, all individuals were negative, suggesting poxviruses may not prevalent in this population. Partial sequencing of the Weddell seal parapoxvirus shows it is closely related to harbor and grey seal poxviruses (Tryland et al., 2005) .

Recently a seal parapoxvirus was sequenced using HTS from a skin lesion of a grey seal from the Baltic Sea (Gunther et al., 2017) . While poxviruses have been identified in several avian species, very little is known about their diversity and host range. Using HTS technology a novel avipoxvirus genome has been sequenced from an African penguin (Spheniscus demersus) (Offerman et al., 2014) . It is highly likely that poxviruses will also be recovered from Antarctic penguins through HTS.

Viruses in the family Anelloviridae are non-enveloped, circular single stranded DNA viruses with a genome length of about 2-3.9 kb (Biagini Z.E. Smeele et al. Virus Research 243 (2018) (Ng et al., 2009 ). Since then several novel anellovirus genomes have been recovered in harbor seals (Bodewes et al., 2015; Bodewes et al., 2013) . In lung samples of deceased harbor seals along the North American Pacific coast anelloviruses were identified over multiple years demonstrating the persistence of this infection in the population (Ng et al., 2011) . Analyses of sub-Antarctic (Arctocephalus tropicalis) and South American fur seal (A. australis) feces also led to the identification of anellovirus sequences (Kluge et al., 2016) . Anelloviruses circulating in the Antarctic ecosystem have recently been shown following detection by HTS and using pairs of abutting primers in the recovery of 152 genomes from vaginal, nasal and faecal samples of Weddell seals in the Ross Sea during the 2014-2015 summer (Fahsbender et al., 2017) . Analyses identified two novel anelloviruses, torque teno Leptonychotes weddellii virus (TTLwV-1, TTLwV-2). T-TLwV-1 was additionally identified in South Polar skua faecal samples and it was thought that this was as a result of skuas feeding on the placenta and dead carcasses of Weddell seals in the area (Fahsbender et al., 2017) .

Both ecto-and endoparasites have been reported among Antarctic animals. While neither appear to be detrimental to animal health, these Fig. 2. Timeline,1975 , showing the periods of serology-(purple), PCR-(red) and HTS-based (light red) approaches for viral identification. From 2012 onwards, viral genomes are determined by PCR-, Sanger-and HTS-based approaches. Top panel summarizes the determination of complete genomes by either Sanger sequencing and/or HTS from associated Antarctic animals. Colored circles indicating where they were found: Antarctic Peninsula (dark blue), Falkland Islands (green), Macquarie Island (pink) and Ross Island/sea (orange).

Z.E. Smeele et al. Virus Research 243 (2018) 91-105 organisms may play a significant role as vectors of viruses. Ticks, mites and lice commonly parasitize seals, penguins and other Antarctic birds (Gauthier-Clerc et al., 1998; González-Acuña et al., 2013; McFarlane, 1996) . Flaviviruses, orbiviruses, phleboviruses, and nairoviruses have been isolated from seabird ticks (Ixodes uriae) associated with king, rockhopper and royal penguins on Macquarie Island (Major et al., 2009) . A novel alphavirus has also been isolated and partially sequenced from lice associated with southern elephant seals of Macquarie Island and the high seroprevalence in the southern elephant seal population showed to this virus strongly suggests its transmission by lice (La Linn et al., 2001) . Gastrointestinal parasites, particularly cestode and nematode species, are commonly found in Antarctic seals and penguins. Penguins tend to have a low diversity of parasites and similar profiles have been identified among penguins of the same genus (Diaz et al., 2016 (Diaz et al., , 2013 Fonteneau et al., 2011; Kleinertz et al., 2014; Vidal et al., 2012) . Of the Antarctic seals, gastrointestinal parasites are most prevalent among Weddell and leopard seals. Given that helminth parasites are strongly associated with the diet of the host they infect, this likely explains the higher abundance of parasites among Weddell and leopard seals compared to other Antarctic seals ). The potential for endoparasites to transmit viruses to their host has been demonstrated by two genera of plant viruses, nepoviruses and tobraviruses, transmitted by nematodes (Hull, 2014) . While our knowledge of parasites in Antarctic animals remains extremely limited and research in this area has been sporadic, developments in molecular technology will undoubtedly have a strong impact toward revealing relationships between organisms and the movement of viruses in the environment.

Recently, Antarctic penguins have been showing signs of disease of unknown pathology, e.g. unexplained incursions of feather loss in Adélie penguins (Grimaldi et al., 2015) in the Ross Sea (2011-2012) but not the years before or after (personal observation). Furthermore, in 2014 observations of an Adélie penguin colony at Hope Bay, Antarctica identified two chicks showing patches without feathers in two sub colonies (Barbosa et al., 2014) . Beak and feather disease virus (family Circoviridae) infection in certain psittacines causes feather abnormalities and loss (Pass and Perry, 1984) and hence there is a likelihood that feather loss observed in penguins may be attributed to an unknown circovirus-like agent.

Over the last ten years, viral metagenomics has led to a dramatic increase in viral discovery from various environmental and animal samples, for example, Shi et al. (2016) identified ∼1400 novel RNA viruses (from over 200 invertebrate species), Brum et al. (2015) identified ∼5500 distinct dsDNA virus populations (from 43 surface ocean sites worldwide as part of the Tara Oceans expedition) and Paez-Espino et al. (2016) identified ∼120000 partial viral genomes sequences (from ∼3000 geographically diverse samples) using HTS. This together with other studies that have identified large datasets of novel viruses using HTS (e.g. Dayaram et al., 2016; Labonte and Suttle, 2013; Rosario et al., 2015) has shown: 1) the HTS enabled identification of large numbers of previously unknown viruses; 2) we have barely scratched the surface of the viral sequence space and thus their diversity; 3) new taxa will need to be created to classify viruses at a rapid rate to match the pace of virus discovery. All this has opened up discussions on viral classification based on sequence data, either derived from Sanger sequencing or HTS, and lead to a consensus statement by Simmonds et al. (2017a) to incorporate these into current viral taxonomy.

HTS has been used to a large extent in Antarctic environmental virology to study soil (Adriaenssens et al., 2017; Zablocki et al., 2014) , lake (Aguirre de Cárcer et al., 2016; Lopez-Bueno et al., 2015 , 2009 Yau et al., 2011) and marine (Brum et al., 2017; Miranda et al., 2016) viral ecology. Novel viral genomes from various soils and lake samples (Dziewit and Radlinska, 2016; Kerepesi and Grolmusz, 2017; Meiring et al., 2012; Swanson et al., 2012; Zawar-Reza et al., 2014) have been determined using HTS approaches. In contrast, relatively little is known about viruses associated with Antarctic animals and the associated virus ecology despite the advent of HTS. This perhaps can be attributed to the difficulty in accessing/obtaining animal samples and longitudinal sampling for viral ecology studies. Nonetheless, various studies have used HTS to identify viruses associated with Antarctic animals (Table 2 , Fig. 2 ) and we anticipate that the next decade will see a dramatic increase in virology activity and to some extent viral ecology studies of Antarctic animals. Furthermore, it is highly like that large numbers of diverse viruses will be identified using HTS. As sequencing technologies improve, there may be possibility of in-field identification of animal viral pathogens in Antarctica, e.g. using Oxford Nanopore Sequencer (ONS). ONS has been used for metagenomic studies of microbial mats from three lakes in the Antarctic dry valleys (Lakes Fryxell, Lake Vanda and Lake Vida) by Johnson et al. (2017) demonstrating its use in Antarctic field conditions and remote laboratories.

Nosocomial Transmission of Emerging Viruses via Aerosol-Generating Medical Procedures,"Recent nosocomial transmission events of emerging and re-emerging viruses, including Ebola virus, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, Nipah virus, and Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever orthonairovirus, have highlighted the risk of nosocomial transmission of emerging viruses in health-care settings. In particular, concerns and precautions have increased regarding the use of aerosol-generating medical procedures when treating patients with such viral infections. In spite of increasing associations between aerosol-generating medical procedures and the nosocomial transmission of viruses, we still have a poor understanding of the risks of specific procedures and viruses. In order to identify which aerosol-generating medical procedures and emerging viruses pose a high risk to health-care workers, we explore the mechanisms of aerosol-generating medical procedures, as well as the transmission pathways and characteristics of highly pathogenic viruses associated with nosocomial transmission. We then propose how research, both in clinical and experimental settings, could advance current infection control guidelines.","Aerosol-generating medical procedures (AGMPs) are increasingly being recognized as important sources for nosocomial transmission of emerging viruses. Intubation was investigated as a possible cause of Ebola virus (EBOV) transmission among health-care workers (HCWs) in the United States [1] . Additionally, the high rate of nosocomial transmission of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) caused speculation about the role of AGMPs [2] [3] [4] [5] . Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever orthonairovirus (CCHFV), was also associated with nosocomial infection secondary to AGMPs [6] . While guidelines were developed for performing AGMPs on patients with certain viral infections, assessing and understanding the risk that specific viruses and AGMPs pose for nosocomial transmission could improve infection control practices, as well as reveal relationships in virus transmission.

Despite the perceived importance of AGMPs in nosocomial transmission of viruses and other infectious agents, scarce empirical or quantitative evidence exists [7] . In order to assess the risk that certain viruses and AGMPs create for nosocomial transmission, we first need to identify potential AGMPs and viruses. The second step is then to determine the risk associated with these viruses and procedures, either through retrospective analysis, investigating the circumstances of nosocomial transmission, or through experiments, such as using air sampling during AGMPs to determine the risk of generating infectious virus-laden aerosols. Lastly, we can use this knowledge to transmission [11] . Lasers can create plumes of debris that contain infectious aerosolized virus, as well [15] . It is important to recognize the range of AGMPs and the circumstances under which they might be performed on infected patients. In order to associate certain AGMPs with nosocomial virus transmission, researchers need to test whether certain procedures generate aerosols with infectious virus, either through hospital sampling or laboratory procedures. Figure 1 . Potential types of aerosol-generating medical procedures (AGMPs). AGMPs can be divided into procedures that induce the patient to produce aerosols and procedures that mechanically generate aerosols themselves. 

Knowing the mechanisms behind different AGMPs allows us to narrow our focus of emerging viruses that could cause nosocomial transmission via AGMPs. These viruses must be able to Figure 1 . Potential types of aerosol-generating medical procedures (AGMPs). AGMPs can be divided into procedures that induce the patient to produce aerosols and procedures that mechanically generate aerosols themselves. [11] [12] [13] .

In contrast to causing a patient to produce aerosols, AGMPs can also mechanically create and disperse respiratory aerosols through procedures such as ventilation, suctioning of the airway, or nebulizer treatment. Both manual ventilation, using a bag-valve-mask, and other forms of noninvasive ventilation (NIV), such as continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP), and high-frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV) are associated with SARS-CoV nosocomial transmission [11] . Although the exact mechanisms of how these procedures create virus-laden aerosols in the respiratory tract remain unknown, it is possible that forcing or removing air from the respiratory tract could generate aerosols.

While AGMPs are traditionally thought of in regard to the generation of respiratory aerosols, AGMPs can also aerosolize infected fluids in other regions of the human body. Surgical techniques can aerosolize blood and possibly viruses. For example, infectious HIV-1 was found in the aerosols generated by surgical power tools [14] , and a tracheotomy was associated with SARS-CoV transmission [11] . Lasers can create plumes of debris that contain infectious aerosolized virus, as well [15] . It is important to recognize the range of AGMPs and the circumstances under which they might be performed on infected patients. In order to associate certain AGMPs with nosocomial virus transmission, researchers need to test whether certain procedures generate aerosols with infectious virus, either through hospital sampling or laboratory procedures.

Knowing the mechanisms behind different AGMPs allows us to narrow our focus of emerging viruses that could cause nosocomial transmission via AGMPs. These viruses must be able to opportunistically infect via the aerosol route and must be present in the patient where the AGMP is taking place. These two conditions fit a wide spectrum of viruses, and therefore we focus on those that are emerging and pose a high risk to HCWs performing AGMPs. Here we define high risk as both a high likelihood of infection if an aerosol is inhaled or comes into contact with a mucous membrane and a high case-fatality rate for the viral disease. Such viruses are those that are highly infectious and pathogenic and for which limited prophylactic or therapeutic countermeasures are available. This includes most biosafety level 3 and 4 viruses, while it excludes viruses such as the measles, mumps, and rubella, which can infect via the aerosol route and be spread by AGMPs, but a common vaccine protects HCWs against them. Viruses such as Norwalk virus, enteroviruses, or human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), which either cause self-limiting diseases or are primarily pathogenic in pediatric, pregnant, or immunocompromised patients, are also included. Infection control measures must be performed on these and other viruses, for other patients and hospital visitors are also at risk of nosocomial virus transmission [16] . However, here we focus on novel, high-risk viruses for HCWs performing AGMPs.

When considering emerging highly pathogenic viruses, we used the following criteria to assess which viruses are high risk for HCWs performing AGMPs. (1) The virus is infectious via small or large droplet aerosols in humans or non-human primates (NHPs). Although some virus-laden aerosols, specifically large droplets, could land on surfaces and cause subsequent fomite transmission, those that can infect via inhalation of aerosols or aerosol contact with the eyes or mucous membranes may have the most potential to cause nosocomial transmission through AGMPs. (2) The virus is found in the human respiratory tract or in the respiratory tract of NHPs. Most AGMPs occur in the upper or lower human respiratory tract, and, therefore, if the virus is present in these locations, we expect that it has a higher likelihood of becoming aerosolized. (3) There is previous evidence of nosocomial transmission or association with AGMPs. This third criteria identifies viruses that were associated with this type of transmission in the past; although, it may miss viruses that are emerging or do not frequently infect humans.

The viruses that pose the highest risk to HCWs performing AGMPs may be some of the viruses that we know the least about. This is because many of these viruses may be emerging zoonotic viruses that rarely infect humans compared to human-adapted viruses. Therefore, we relied on knowledge from both human and animal viral infections to create a list of potential viruses (Table 2 ). We included viruses that fit at least two of the three previously mentioned classifications. Many of these viruses are also on the World Health Organization's list of priority pathogens for research and development preparedness [17] .

The viruses that we identify as high risk come from eight families and have diverse characteristics. However, they also have much in common. All of these viruses are emerging or re-emerging zoonotic RNA viruses. Initially spilling over from animal hosts into humans, these viruses can undergo subsequent human-to-human and nosocomial transmission to cause epidemics. However, unlike viruses that have evolved with human hosts, none of these viruses are endemic in human populations. Some of these viruses may cause stuttering chains of transmission before disappearing from human populations, while others, like Ebola virus or pandemic influenza A virus, may cause large outbreaks before being contained or establish themselves as endemic pathogens in the human population [18] . Viruses evolve within their hosts to maintain an optimum balance between transmission (consequently virulence) and persistence [19] . Because humans are not the reservoir hosts for these viruses, this equilibrium was not established. Most of these high-risk viruses are highly infectious and virulent, but are not as efficient at transmitting and persisting as true human respiratory viruses. Of the high-risk viruses, those belonging to the families of coronaviruses, orthomyxoviruses, and paramyxoviruses come closest to the equilibrium of persistence and transmissibility in humans. Uncoincidentally, these viral families also contain viruses that have become endemic in human populations. [20] [21] [22] ii.

Viral antigen in human lung [43] Considering these eight viral families, we can begin to assess the risk of particular viruses. To make a conclusive risk assessment, we need further experimental and epidemiological evidence. We can inform these future studies by first looking at what is currently known about the viruses in each of these families in regard to AGMPs.

The family Arenaviridae, in the order Bunyavirales, contains multiple viruses that have the potential for nosocomial transmission due to AGMPs. Arenaviruses spill over when humans inhale the aerosolized excreta of the rodent hosts for these viruses. Additionally, laboratory workers and NHPs were also infected by aerosolized arenaviruses, specifically Junin virus, Lassa virus, and Machupo virus [23] . Arenavirus infections can cause viral hemorrhagic fevers (VHFs) in humans. Known nosocomial transmission has occurred from patients infected with Lassa virus and Machupo virus [26, 27] . Less clinical or experimental data exist for other arenaviruses, but these may have similar characteristics. Although arenaviruses are found in the respiratory tracts of humans or animal models [24, 25, 28] , there is no evidence for human-to-human airborne transmission of arenaviruses. However, arenavirus aerosol transmission could theoretically occur when aerosols are mechanically generated through AGMPs.

Like arenaviruses, multiple other viruses within the order Bunyavirales are zoonotic and can cause VHFs. Both Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) orthonairovirus and Andes hantavirus were associated with nosocomial transmission, with CCHF transmission occurring after AGMPs were performed without eye or respiratory protection [6, 31] . Interestingly, other hantaviruses were aerosol transmitted to humans, either through accidentally aerosolizing the virus or through inhaling aerosolized rodent excreta [23] , but only Andes hantavirus was confirmed to transmit from person to person [31] . Although hantaviruses can cause respiratory disease in humans, as in hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS), and were found in the respiratory tract [30] , they do not seem to efficiently transmit between humans like typical respiratory viruses. However, similar to arenaviruses, certain bunyaviruses found in human-or animal-model respiratory tracts, including CCHF virus, hantaviruses, and Rift valley fever virus, could possibly gain the route of aerosol transmission if an AGMP is performed.

The family of Coronaviridae contains viruses that are known to transmit routinely between humans through the aerosol route. Both MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV cause respiratory disease in humans and transmit via aerosols, but it is unknown whether small-droplet or large-droplet aerosols are the modes of transmission for these viruses. Significant nosocomial transmission of SARS-CoV has incited the most research regarding the role of AGMPs in nosocomial virus transmission [11] [12] [13] , while recent nosocomial transmission events of MERS-CoV warrant further research [2] [3] [4] [5] . Therefore, AGMPs could possibly amplify an already established route of infection for these viruses.

Filoviruses also cause VHFs and could potentially become transmissible through AGMPs. During outbreaks of Ebola virus disease (EVD), concerns were raised regarding airborne transmission of EBOV because of nosocomial transmission events and the discovery of the virus in the human respiratory tract [36, 38] . Given what we know from experimental and epidemiological evidence, airborne transmission is unlikely, yet it is possible that AGMPs could create infectious EBOV-laden aerosols that could lead to nosocomial transmission [8, 44] . Likewise, viruses belonging to the other species of ebolaviruses that are pathogenic in humans, as well as another filovirus, Marburg virus, could share similar transmission properties.

The family of viruses Orthomyxoviridae contains both human and zoonotic viruses, of which the most well-known are influenza viruses. While seasonal flu vaccines protect HCWs against influenza [10] . However, there is variation in the efficiency of human-to-human aerosol transmission of different influenza A viruses. For instance, to date, there were few instances of nosocomial transmission of H7N9 or H5N1, even when protective measures were not used, while there were multiple nosocomial transmission events of pandemic H1N1 and other influenza A virus subtypes [39, [45] [46] [47] [48] [49] . This could be due to variation in infectivity of the virus and tissue tropism, with the pandemic H1N1 preferentially replicating in the human upper respiratory tract and the avian influenza A viruses preferentially replicating in the lower respiratory tract [50, 51] . Therefore, AGMPs have the potential to amplify or open up the route of aerosol transmission for influenza A viruses. Understanding the characteristics of the aerosol transmission of different influenza A viruses and subtypes could help us determine the risk of influenza A viruses for nosocomial transmission due to AGMPs.

Of the viruses in the family Paramyxoviridae, the recently emerged Nipah and Hendra viruses pose a high risk to HCWs performing AGMPs. Both viruses are known to cause respiratory disease in humans, and nosocomial transmission was documented for Nipah virus [42] . Aerosol transmission is one of the suspected routes of transmission for Nipah virus because of evidence from contact tracing and finding the virus in human respiratory secretions [41] . Hendra virus spilled over from horses to humans, and no human-to-human transmission was documented, but the virus was detected in human lungs [43] . Although henipaviruses do not seem to be as contagious through the aerosol route between people as other viruses in their family, such as measles virus, it is possible that AGMPs could contribute to the formation of infectious Nipah-and Hendra-laden aerosols that could cause nosocomial infection.

Given the lack of experimental or epidemiological data on nosocomial virus transmission and AGMPs, current guidelines for infection control are based on the precautionary principle. In order to have a more nuanced understanding of the risks associated with difference AGMPs and viruses, we need more research in both clinical and experimental settings. This type of research could take two different forms, retrospective epidemiological studies or on-site sampling and experimental tests. The former was used to assess the risk of AGMPs and SARS-CoV transmission [11] . However, the quality of retrospective data limits these kinds of studies. Control cases are necessary to rule out other sources of nosocomial transmission besides AGMPs, such as direct patient contact and fomite transmission. Moreover, these studies rely on reporting that may be infrequent and/or unreliable.

Air sampling for viruses during AGMPs performed on patients would provide the most clinically relevant data. Multiple air-sampling techniques for viruses now exist. Researchers can use both solid and liquid impactors to sample and recover aerosolized viruses [52] . Personally worn bioaerosal samplers and stationary room samplers were used to detect influenza A virus RNA in an emergency department [53] . Researchers also used aerosol samplers to determine the amount of influenza A (H1N1) RNA in aerosols in the vicinity of patients while AGMPs were being performed [54] . This allowed the authors to determine which procedures were associated with a higher concentration of viral RNA [54] . In order to determine whether viable virus is present in aerosols, virus isolation could be performed from air samples, and further quantification could occur through titrations or plaque assays [52] . One group used a simulated aerosol chamber to demonstrate that viable influenza virus A could be extracted from surgical masks and N95 respirators [55] . Particle sizers may also be used in experimental settings to characterize the size and dispersal of aerosols. One group used particle sizers to measure the size and travel distance of aerosols from patients who underwent AGMPs, such as nebulizer treatment and NIV [56] . Determining the quantity of viable virus expelled from certain patients during AGMPs could help determine phenomena like super-spreading events, while understanding aerosol characteristics such as particle size could elucidate mechanisms of transmission.

While on-site sampling works for current nosocomial transmission events, we can design experiments to gain prospective knowledge. Procedures such as bronchoscopy and intubation are performed on animal models of the high-risk viral diseases we identified, and air sampling during these procedures could determine whether they are aerosol-generating. Experimentally generating virus-laden aerosols of different sizes and under different environmental conditions could also help determine the risks of different viruses based on their stability in aerosols [57, 58] . Researchers could then create risk models for different viruses based on aersol stability, as well as data on the quantity, concentration, travel distance, and size of aerosols formed during AGMPs.

Multiple environmental factors influence the viability of aerosolized viruses, including relative humidity, temperature, UV radiation, and gas composition of the air [52] . These factors affect viruses differently, and so it is important to consider the environments where emerging viruses exist and where AGMPs are being performed. The aforementioned AGMPs include those that are both ubiquitous, such as CPR or manual ventilation, as well as those that are limited to advanced health-care settings, such as bronchoscopy. The risk of transmission from AGMPs may be very different in a field-based treatment unit than from a tertiary care hospital. Additionally, some health-care settings, such as hospitals with biocontainment units, include additional air-handling systems that can limit aerosol exposure to HCWs [59] . Therefore, the risk of nosocomial transmission via AGMPs varies greatly based on the environment, and this must be considered when designing experiments.

During the 2013-2016 outbreak of EVD, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) updated its guidelines regarding precautions to prevent the transmission of EBOV in health-care settings [60] . The updated guidelines further emphasized proper personal protective equipment (PPE) and isolation when performing AGMPs on EVD patients. Currently, in addition to standard PPE, the CDC recommends the use of eye protection, airborne infection isolation rooms, and N95 or higher respirators when performing AGMPs on patients with VHFs, SARS-CoV, and avian or pandemic influenza A viruses [61] . The CDC made similar recommendations as an interim guidance for MERS-CoV [62] , and we were unable to find additional CDC AGMP guidelines for Nipah virus, Hendra virus, or hantaviruses. More evidence of nosocomial transmission events of these and other viruses due to AGMPs is likely to prompt future guidelines. Therefore, our understanding of the risks associated with AGMPs and nosocomial virus transmission is not static, and we must continue to improve our knowledge to develop appropriate precautions.

The ambiguity of which procedures and viruses require additional protective measures during AGMPs may lead to breaches in protocol. During many of the cited nosocomial transmission events, HCWs did not use proper eye or respiratory protection. Even when aware of the need for respiratory protection, HCWs may mistakenly wear surgical masks or unfitted N95 respirators, which do not provide proper protection. Additionally, HCWs may not have access to approprtiate PPE depending on the health-care environment. Therefore, while determining the risks of certain viruses and procedures is essential, communicating their respective precautions and providing resources is equally important. Likewise, proper patient triage and diagnosis are the first steps to ensuring that precautions are undertaken when performing AGMPs.

Overall, more research and communication about the risks of certain viruses and AGMPs are necessary to resolve the uncertainty surrounding their role in nosocomial virus transmission. Although we identified certain viruses and procedures that could be high risk and should be experimentally or clinically tested, emerging viruses or novel procedures may also play significant roles. If we are to design proactive infection control guidelines and understand the underlying biology of viral transmission, we must conduct collaborative clinical and scientific research on nosocomial virus transmission and AGMPs.

Targeting Transmission Pathways for Emerging Zoonotic Disease Surveillance and Control,"We used literature searches and a database of all reported emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) to analyze the most important transmission pathways (e.g., vector-borne, aerosol droplet transmitted) for emerging zoonoses. Our results suggest that at the broad scale, the likelihood of transmission occurring through any one pathway is approximately equal. However, the major transmission pathways for zoonoses differ widely according to the specific underlying drivers of EID events (e.g., land-use change, agricultural intensification). These results can be used to develop better targeting of surveillance for, and more effective control of newly emerged zoonoses in regions under different underlying pressures that drive disease emergence.","E merging infectious diseases (EIDs) have significant public health and economic impacts and are increasing in frequency (Brahmbhatt 2005 , Jones et al. 2008 . Nearly twothirds of EIDs are zoonotic and three-quarters of those originate in wildlife ( Jones et al. 2008) , thus targeted disease surveillance may be useful to optimize prevention and control measures and reduce the threat of future zoonotic EIDs (Karesh et al. 2005 , Vrbova et al. 2010 . Recent approaches to disease surveillance and control have largely been disease specific and reactive in nature, tackling pathogens after they have already emerged (Childs and Gordon 2009) . Proactive approaches include pathogen discovery in wildlife to identify potential zoonoses , Lipkin 2013 , however the number of microbes in wildlife remaining to be discovered is likely large and the causes and dynamics of transmission from wildlife to human are poorly understood ( Jones et al. 2008 , Childs and Gordon 2009 . As pathogens continue to emerge from wildlife, a better understanding of the ways through which transmission could potentially occur is needed. Because pathogens with different transmission pathways may require very different prevention and control strategies, understanding the relative importance of each pathway for a given pathogen is essential.

Zoonoses can be transmitted from wildlife to humans by a range of routes (or pathways), yet research exploring the role of transmission pathways in past EID events has not been consolidated. Here, we analyze transmission pathways of all known previously emerging zoonoses. Our results suggest that the relative importance of different transmission pathways varies by EID driver (e.g., land use change, bushmeat consumption, climate, and weather). This suggests that targeting pathogen discovery and surveillance programs to different transmission pathways will increase our capacity to identifying important pathogens, either known or unknown.

We identified all unique zoonotic pathogens (n = 183) from a published database of 335 emerging infectious disease ''events'' (the original case or cluster of cases representing an infectious disease emerging in human populations for the first time) from 1940 to 2004 ( Jones et al. 2008 ). This database includes EID events caused by newly evolved strains of pathogens, novel pathogens that have entered human populations for the first time, and pathogens that have likely been established in humans historically, but that have recently increased in incidence ( Jones et al. 2008) . We excluded emergence events that arose through the evolution of antimicrobial drug resistance and those caused by newly evolved strains of known pathogens (e.g., multidrug-resistant tuberculosis and chloroquine-resistant malaria), as well as those attributed to human susceptibility to infection (disease outbreaks that are secondary to immunodeficiency diseases), leaving 148 records in our database.

We then conducted a systematic literature search to identify all documented animal-to-human transmission pathways for each pathogen and the relative contribution of each when more than one transmission route was described. Transmission pathways were identified through a comprehensive search in the ISI Web of Science online database, performing a topic search using the string ''[pathogen name]? AND *transmission* AND (route* OR pathway*) from 1940 to present. The use of this combination of key words allowed for the identification of all documented pathways. Pathogen synonyms were included in the search. Supplementary references, including World Health Organization (WHO) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) fact sheets, were used to provide additional information about transmission routes from animals to humans. We identified five broad but distinct transmission pathway categories: (1) Direct contact (skin-to-skin contact; scratches; animal bites; contact with body fluids, organs, and tissues; direct large droplet exposure); (2) airborne transmission (via dust particles and airborne small droplets); (3) vector-borne (by biting or mechanical transfer by arthropods); (4) oral transmission (consumption of contaminated food or water); and (5) contaminated environment or fomite (indirect contact with soil or vegetation, contact with water, indirect transmission by contaminated inanimate objects). Where no transmission route was documented, this information was assumed to be unknown, and these pathogens were excluded from the analysis (n = 3), leaving a total of 145 records in our database (Supplemental Table 1 ).

To determine whether zoonotic diseases are more likely to be transmitted through specific pathways, we first assigned all transmission pathways per pathogen equal weighting as per methods published in Taylor et al. (2001) and calculated the total proportion of zoonotic EIDs transmitted by each pathway at a broad scale. However, for many pathogens, some modes of transmission are more frequently implicated than others. To account for this, we then assigned all transmission pathways per pathogen different weightings based on how likely transmission is to occur through that particular pathway-either ''likely'' or ''less likely'' (Supplemental Table 1 ).

Each pathogen in the analysis received a total value of 1. For those pathogens that could only be transmitted through one pathway (e.g., West Nile), that pathway received the full value of 1 (assuming transmission would occur via that pathway 100% of the time). However, for organisms that could be transmitted by more than one pathway (e.g., rabies), any pathway that is documented in the literature as likely to occur (e.g., rabies infection via a bite or scratch) received a weight of 0.9, while the remaining value was split equally between the less common pathways (e.g., rabies infection via airborne transmission).

Likewise, if the literature indicated that transmission through a particular pathway was rare or unlikely to occur, this pathway received a weight of 0.1 (assuming that transmission via that pathway was likely to occur less than 10% of the time), and the remaining value of 0.90 was split equally among the other pathway(s). If a pathogen could be transmitted via multiple ''unlikely'' or ''rare'' pathways, the value of 0.1 was split equally between those pathways. In the literature, rare or unlikely routes of transmission generally refer to those that have been demonstrated in experimental laboratory studies and/or where only a handful of human cases have been documented (e.g., four cases of rabies attributed to the airborne pathway, two documented suspected cases of tick-borne Q fever; Supplemental Table 1) .

For example, for the bacteria Coxiella burnetii (Q fever), the most common mode of transmission reported is airborne transmission via inhalation of aerosols from contaminated soil or animal waste. More rare modes of transmission to humans include tick bites and ingestion of unpasteurized milk or dairy products (Anderson et al. 2013) . For this pathogen, we assigned the common pathway, the airborne pathway, a probability of 0.9, whereas the two less common pathways were assigned a probability of 0.05 each (Supplemental Table 1 ).

We then examined which transmission pathways were most likely to occur within various EID drivers, as defined in Smolinski et al. (2003) and Morse (1995) and modified by Jones et al. (2008) . These drivers are largely environmental, ecological, political, economic, and social forces, functioning on a range of different scales, which facilitate the expansion and adaptation of a pathogen to a new niche (Smolinski et al. 2003 ). The first classification of these drivers was published in 1992 by the Institute of Medicine (IOM). This report identified six factors in the emergence of infectious diseases including: (1) Human demographics and behavior, (2) technology and industry, (3) economic development and land use, (4) international travel and commerce, (5) microbial adaptation and change, and (6) breakdown of public health measures. Seven additional drivers were added in a followup IOM report in 2003 (Smolinski et al. 2003) including: ''human susceptibility to infection,'' ''climate and weather,'' ''changing ecosystems,'' ''poverty and social inequity,'' ''war and famine,'' ''lack of political will,'' and ''intent to harm.'' To calculate which pathways were associated with each EID driver, we split the data into subsets by driver, summed the weights for each transmission category, and divided the sum by the total number of EID events per driver.

Last, to determine whether transmission routes differ significantly by disease driver, we used a permutation t-test (Hothorn et al. 2006 (Hothorn et al. , 2008 to compare all possible pairwise disease drivers (121 possible combinations). To minimize the probability of detecting false positives (i.e., decrease Type I error) we selected a rejection alpha of 0.10 (Quinn and Keough 2002) . This level of significance was selected given the inherent reporting bias of EID data (e.g., developed countries tend to report more than other countries) and the low sample size for some of the drivers (e.g., Bushmeat n = 4).

In a previous study, Taylor et al. (2001) included transmission route as a potential risk factor for human disease emergence. In their analysis, if an organism could be transmitted by more than one transmission pathway, all were included with equal weighting. They found that zoonotic diseases were more likely to be transmitted by vectors (by biting or mechanical transfer by arthropods) or indirect contact (via food or an environmental reservoir). In accordance with their results, we found that when all pathways in our analysis received an equal weighting, zoonotic diseases were more likely to be transmitted by the same two pathways that Taylor identified-oral transmission and by vectors (Supplemental Table 1 ; Fig. 1 ). Because some pathogens could be transmitted by more than one pathway, we found that, at a broad scale, 42% of all zoonotic pathogens were transmitted through oral transmission, 42% via vector-borne, 36% by airborne transmission, 29% by direct contact, and 24% via contact with a contaminated environment or fomite.

When broken down by pathogen type, the majority of zoonotic EIDs were viral and bacterial in origin, with smaller proportions of helminth, fungi, and prion-origin diseases. For viruses, the vector-borne route of transmission was the most common, followed by airborne transmission and direct animal contact. Very few viral EIDs were transmitted through the foodborne pathway through exposure to a contaminated environment, or via fomites. For bacteria, transmission was most likely to occur through the foodborne, contaminated environment, and direct-contact pathways. Fewer bacterial EIDs were transmitted through the airborne and vector-borne pathways. The majority of rickettsial and protozoal infections were likely transmitted through vectors, whereas the direct contact and airborne pathways were most relevant for fungal diseases. Last, the oral transmission pathway was most relevant for helminth and prion-driven diseases.

When ranked by primary EID driver; land-use change, agricultural industry change, and international travel and commerce are globally the top three drivers of zoonoses ( Fig. 1) . At the broad scale, our results indicate that all pathways are approximately equally common, yet when stratified by EID driver, the relevant transmission pathways vary greatly (Fig. 2) .

Results from the permutation t-tests indicate that transmission pathways differ significantly between many disease drivers (Table 1) . For example, zoonotic diseases attributed to land-use change were more likely to be transmitted via the vector-borne pathway (52.5%), followed by direct animal contact (23.8%), the airborne pathway (19.8%), and a smaller proportion from the contaminated environment (2%) and oral transmission pathways (2%; Fig. 2 ). For food industry change, the most relevant pathway is oral transmission (58%) (Fig. 2) .

An important challenge to developing effective prevention and control strategies for zoonotic EIDs is identifying the relevant transmission routes between reservoir hosts and humans. In many cases, primary pathways for transmission are identified during outbreak investigations after a disease has already emerged. However, it is likely that many more novel transmission pathways remain undescribed for pathogens that pose a potential human health risk. The recent emergence of a number of pandemic zoonoses (e.g., severe acute respiratory syndrome [SARS] , pandemic influenza H1N1), zoonotic viruses of pandemic potential (e.g., Middle East respiratory syndrome [MERS] coronavirus), and those of regional concern (e.g., Ebola virus), in addition to the increasing frequency of EID events ( Jones et al. 2008) , make the targeting of surveillance programs to early stages of emergence a crucial tool for combating pandemics (Morse et al. 2012 ). Our analysis also provides us with insights into which transmission pathways are important in regions where different drivers of EIDs predominate, thus allowing for more targeted prevention measures and surveillance approaches. This approach may have value for targeted surveillance of pathogens that are known to emerge through different pathways. For instance, although Nipah virus (NiV) has been attributed to preferential feeding by Pteropus bats on human-cultivated fruit or other plant products, as was seen with NiV in Malaysia (transmitted via mangoes fed to pigs) and Bangladesh (via date palm sap) (Chua et al. 2000 , the mechanism through which the disease emerged differed between countries. In Malaysia, agricultural intensification led to the planting of mango trees directly adjacent to intensively managed pig populations, attracting fruit bats to the area. This activity resulted in the initial spillover of NiV from Pteropus bats into intensively managed pig populations, leading to subsequent outbreaks to human via direct contact with live pigs (Chua 2003 , Epstein et al. 2006 , Pulliam et al. 2012 . In Bangladesh, the most frequently implicated transmission pathway from animals to people is via the oral transmission pathway, specifically ingestion of fresh date palm sap contaminated by bat excreta (Hughes et al. 2009 , Olival et al. 2013 . By targeting this and other potential routes of food contamination, surveillance efforts and control measures may better minimize the risk of zoonotic disease emergence.

A more apparent example highlighting the differences in transmission routes between drivers is land-use change versus climate and weather. Land-use change is the leading driver for emerging zoonoses (Fig. 1) and is likely to increase in the future (Smolinski et al. 2003 , Patz et al. 2004 , Murray and Daszak 2013 . Our results suggest that disease emergence in regions under pressure from land use change has most often occurred through the vector-borne pathway and direct animal contact. Thus, effective control measures in regions of active land use change could be focused on ensuring or enhancing vector control (e.g., larval control through environmental management, use of mosquito nets, etc.), preventing transmission through direct animal contact (e.g., use of personal protective equipment, hand washing), and reducing risk of airborne transmission (e.g., use of mask or light cloth to prevent inhalation of infectious agents in high-risk occupations or in areas where land disruption activities are occurring).

Infectious diseases driven by climate and weather are more likely to be transmitted via the oral transmission and vector-borne pathways. The relevance of these particular pathways to this driver can be explained by examining the events in our database linked to climate and weather. For instance, there are 10 events/pathogens that are associated with climate and weather including five Vibro spp., Coccidioides immitis (Valley fever), and several vector-borne diseases, including Murray Valley encephalitis virus, Sindbis virus, St. Louis encephalitis virus, and Zika virus. Previous work has shown climate-related increases in sea surface temperature and sea level can lead to a higher incidence of food-borne (shellfish poisoning) and waterborne infectious diseases, highlighting the importance of the oral transmission pathway. In fact, recent studies examining climate change impacts on human and animal health found a positive correlation between the prevalence of Vibro spp., including V. cholerae, and increasing sea surface temperature. Similarly, changes in climate have also been shown to affect disease transmission of many vector-borne diseases by shifting the vector's geographic range, increasing reproductive and biting rates and by shortening the incubation period (Vezzulli et al. 2013 , Patz et al. 2005 . Although this finding is not surprising, it does allow us to identify strategies to reduce oral transmission (e.g., food safety measures) and vector-borne transmission in regions with changing climates.

In summary, these findings provide us with a novel approach to identifying and understanding all the ways by which a pathogen might spill over from nature into human hosts. These results may be particularly useful to target the growing number of efforts to discover and characterize new pathogens before they emerge in human populations, coupled with efforts that identify potential zoonotic pathogen reservoirs and specific high-risk behavior in a region. Our results could be compiled into a catalogue of relevant transmission pathways and reservoirs. Targeting pathogen discovery through this approach could tell us new information about how likely a newly discovered potentially zoonotic pathogen is to emerge. Public health efforts could develop control strategies that focus on behavioral change in high-risk populations to minimize exposure to potential reservoirs and target relevant transmission pathways (e.g., personal protective behaviors for direct animal contact pathway, vector control targeted at larval mosquitos, use of bed nets, etc., for the vector-borne pathway). This approach will allow zoonotic disease surveillance to shift toward a more preemptive strategy and use more targeted public health interventions to prevent zoonotic disease spillover and emergence. This table shows only statistically significant combinations, sorted from highly significant (0.016) to less significant (0.087). We selected an alpha value of rejection of 0.10 (90% level of confidence). Analysis was performed using the coin library in the R statistics program (Hothorn et al. 2006 (Hothorn et al. , 2008 .

Transmission of corona virus disease 2019 during the incubation period may lead to a quarantine loophole,"The ongoing outbreak of novel corona virus disease 2019 in Wuhan, China, is arousing international concern. This study evaluated whether and when the infected but asymptomatic cases during the incubation period could infect others.","The corona virus disease has spread rapidly throughout China and poses an increasing threat to globe health. 1 The disease is caused by a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), which was first discovered in the epidemic center of Wuhan, Hubei province, China in December 2019. 2 Although China has taken unprecedented actions to halt the outbreak (e.g. lockdown of Wuhan), the reported case numbers are still rising exponentially, particularly in Wuhan. As of February 17, 2020, a total of 72436 COVID-19 cases were officially confirmed in mainland China, 3 and 42752 of which come from Wuhan. 4 The rapidly increasing number of cases in Wuhan promotes people to concern whether there are infected cases not identified or quarantined in time.

The prior outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), which were caused by corona virus, were reported to be rarely transmitted during the asymptomatic incubation period. [5] [6] [7] An urgent question that scientists are racing to learn is whether an asymptomatic COVID-19 case during the incubation period can infect others. 8 Another major unanswered question is when these asymptomatic cases in the incubation period can infect others, and whether individuals in contact with the COVID-19 cases before the symptom onset should be isolated and provided with medical observation. Until now, only one article reported transmission of SARS-CoV-2 infection from an asymptomatic case in the incubation period in Germany. 9 One article from Germany found SARS-CoV-2 in a throat swab in two asymptomatic cases, 10 and the other article from China suggested the transmission by an asymptomatic carrier of SARS-CoV-2 in a familial cluster of five COVID-19 patients. 11 Compared with the relative small number of asymptomatic cases, the majority of COVID-19 cases when they have no symptoms in their .

All the close contacts with COVID-19 cases are required to be isolated in China. 12 However, only the close contacts with confirmed patients after symptom onset are put in quarantined in Wuhan city, but other close contactors with the infected cases before the symptom onset are not isolated due to the restrained resources. If the asymptomatic transmission during the incubation period contributes to a significant number of infection cases, a loophole of quarantine will ensue.

In the present study, we aimed to examine whether and when the COVID-19 cases during their incubation period infect others, in order to offer clues to containment measures to mitigate the spread of infection.

Accurate estimation of the incubation period is essential to clarify whether the cases who are in the incubation period are a potential source of infection. The exposure time of the majority cases in Wuhan is ambiguous and therefore cannot be used to estimate the incubation period. By examining the cases who were confirmed to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 after a short visit to Wuhan or having a short contact history with a confirmed case, the incubation period could be accurately estimated based on their precise exposure time. Moreover, identification of people in households or communities who had contacted with a confirmed COVID-19 case before symptom onset could help to evaluate the potential transmission during the incubation period.

We collected the data of confirmed COVID-19 cases outside Wuhan city and Hubei province in China from local officials in China. The information included demographic characteristics, exposure or contact history, time of exposure and .

Data were entered into a database, and verified by two independent authors. Discrepancies were resolved by discussion and consensus.

In order to increase the accuracy of the incubation period estimation, the selected cases were limited to those with an accurate exposure period of no more than three days. In addition, we only selected the cases who had symptom onset before Chinese Spring Festival (January 25, 2020) to reduce the bias of exposure time, since the custom of visiting relatives and friends in Spring Festival may result to the increase of people's contact and exposure to unknown infectious source. The cases for estimation of the incubation period were harvested according to the criteria as follows: having a short travel history to Wuhan or having a contact history with a confirmed case, and having no other potential source of infection; and their stay duration or contact exposure was no more than three days, and the information on the dates of their exposure and symptom onset was available. Finally, 106 cases were included in for the analysis of incubation period.

The data of family or community clustered COVID-19 cases throughout February 16, 2020 were used to assess the potential of transmission during the asymptomatic incubation period. We defined the first-generation cases in a cluster as those who had a travel history to Wuhan, or had a contact history (contact with the people from Wuhan, or confirmed cases, or persons with respiratory symptoms), and had been confirmed to have infection of SARS-CoV-2. The secondary cases were defined as those who had a clear contact history to the first-generation cases, and had been confirmed to have infection of SARS-CoV-2, but had no other potential infection source.

A total of 50 first-generation cases and 74 secondary cases in 50 clusters were included for the analysis.

We described the demographic characteristics and exposures of the cases, and defined the incubation period as the exposure to the transmission source to the onset of symptoms. As each individual's incubation period was a typically time-to-event, we used a Weibull distribution-based survival analysis model with the extension of Kaplan-Meier estimator to fit the curve of the incubation period for COVID-19

cases. 13, 14 The 95% confidence intervals for the mean and the percentiles of the incubation period were estimated by a bootstrapping method with resampling of 10,000 times. 15 The serial interval was defined as the time from symptom onset in the first-generation case to symptom onset in the secondary case. The back-projection method was used to estimate the infectious curve for the secondary cases of the clusters to further investigate the possibility of transmission during the incubation period. 16 Since the symptom onset date of the first-generation cases in different clusters were different, we centralized the symptom onset dates of all first-generation cases into a specific date, and the symptom onset dates of secondary cases were transformed accordingly. After the transformation, the infectious curve would indicate the number of secondary cases emerging before or after the symptom onset dates of the first-generation cases. We defined the back-projection equation as follows: All analyses were performed in R 3.1 (""surveillance"" and ""survival"" packages) and SAS 9.4.

The data of the confirmed cases were from publicly reported, and this study as thus considered exempt from institutional review board approval.

Of the 106 confirmed COVID-19 cases with a clear travel or contact history, the median age was 41 years (range, 19 to 73), and 70 (66.0%) were known to be male ( Table 1 ). The majority (82.1%) had an exposure period of 1-2 days, and 67.9% had a short travel history to Wuhan city. We estimated the mean incubation period to be 4.9

days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.4 to 5.4) days, ranging from 0.8 to 11.1 days (2.5th to 97.5th percentile) (Fig. 1 ).

Among the 50 clusters infected with SARS-CoV-2, the median age of the first-generation cases was 47 years (range, 21 to 73), and 58.0% were male, and 82.0% had a travel history to Wuhan ( Table 2 ). The median age of the 74 secondary cases was 45 years (range 7-83), and 45.9% were male. As the timelines shown in Figure 2 , most of the secondary cases (89.2%) had symptom onset after their first-generation cases, while four secondary cases (5.4%; in cluster 5, 21, 29, and 46) had symptom onset before their first-generation ones, and four pairs of first-generation and .

The observed mean and standard deviation (SD) of serial interval was 4.1±3.3 days, with the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles at -1 and 13 days (Fig .2) .

After the symptom onset dates of the first-generation cases were centralized, the peak of the infectious curve of the secondary cases was shown locating before the symptom onset dates of the first-generation cases (Fig. 3A) . The majority of the secondary cases (73.0%) were infected before the symptom onset of the first-generation cases, while 18.9% and 8.1% were infected on and after the date of the symptom onset of the first-generation cases, respectively (Fig. 3B) . Particularly, 66.2% of the secondary cases were infected within three days before the symptom onset dates of the first-generation cases.

Our study initially demonstrated asymptomatic transmission of COVID-19 in the incubation period, especially in the last three days of incubation period, by estimating the incubation period with the use of accurate exposure history of confirmed cases.

Among the clusters, we found that four secondary cases had symptom onset earlier than their first-generation cases, which further provides the evidence of the transmission during the incubation period. Our findings could help the officials to take strong and effective measures to contain the spread of COVID-19 and to the prediction of the epidemic trend.

We estimated the mean incubation period of COVID-19 infections to be 4.9 days, which was calculated based on a big sample size with valid data. Most importantly, the exposure time interval of the 106 cases selected in our study was no more than three days, and 82.1% of the cases had an exposure time of 1-2 days, which enabled .

Li et al. 17 reported that the incubation period of the new coronavirus was 5.2 days (95% CI, 4.1 to 7.0) with the 95th percentile at 12.5 days according to the early cases with illness onset exposed to the Huanan seafood wholesale market. The authors deemed that this estimation was somewhat imprecise because it was based on the information of only 10 cases. 17 Backer et al. 14 included cases ranged from one day to more than two weeks, and more than 75% of the cases in the two studies had the exposure time more than three days, which might induce bias in the estimates and cause the estimated incubation period longer than the actual length. In addition, our estimates of incubation period were consistent with the results reported by Guan et al. 19 that they estimated the mean incubation period less than five days from the data of 1099 confirmed patients in mainland China.

We observed the mean serial interval was 4.1 days for COVID-19, which is shorter than the 8.4-day and the 7.6-day mean serial interval reported for SARS and MERS, respectively. 5,20 More importantly, the serial interval is shorter than the estimates of the mean incubation period (4.9 days), suggesting that a proportion of secondary transmission may occur before symptom onset of the first-generation cases. Li et al. 17 estimated the mean serial interval at 7.5 days based on the cases reported in Wuhan city early in the epidemic (mostly in December 2019). However, there were only six pairs first-generation and secondary cases in this study, and the small sampling bias may have been introduced to the variance and mean. Our observed serial interval has been consistently demonstrated by a recent study that the estimated mean serial interval was 4.2 days based on 20 pairs of first-generation and secondary cases. 21 .

Our results of infectious curves of the secondary cases in the clusters found that the COVID-19 cases before they feel sick could infect others, and the findings offer some of the best clues to whether individuals in contact with the COVID-19 cases within at least three days prior to the symptom onset should be isolated. Our results indicated that the current quarantine measures have loopholes, which may lead to some asymptomatic cases during the incubation period slipping through the net. At present, the Chinese government has enforced to quarantine all the close contacts of the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

Therefore, we believe more effective measures should be taken to stem the transmission of asymptomatic contact during the incubation period. Once a case is confirmed, it is imperative to trace back all the close contacts within at least three days prior to the symptom onset, and then quarantine these close contacts. If a patient has extensive social activities before the symptom onset, the risk of transmission will be greatly increased. Therefore, restricting social activities and restricting travel in and out of the cities in severe epidemic areas may effectively reduce the transmission.

All the information about the cases in this study comes from the data released by local authorities, and the cases were screened for analysis by using the same criteria.

The information of the cases released by local authorities outside of Hubei province, including the exposure history, was relatively complete and reliable, because less cases were reported outside of Hubei province and staffs working at local center of disease control (CDC) staffs had enough time to interview the cases as soon as possible. Therefore, this study provides a reliable incubation period and a strong evidence of the COVID-19 transmission during the incubation period.

Nevertheless, there are some limitations in this study. The data about virus detection were not available for those asymptomatic persons in their incubation period.

Since the follow-up quantitative reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction (qRT-PCR) of virus nucleic acid assay was not available for most close contacts currently in China, it is difficult to obtain evidence of molecular biological monitoring in a short time. If qRT-PCR assays are performed for a group of close contacts, more convincing evidence will be provided for transmission of COVID-19 during the .

In conclusion, the COVID-19 cases in the incubation period are potential infection sources, especially within three days prior to the symptom onset. It is imperative to trace back the close contacts of confirmed cases before the symptom onset and avoid the quarantine loopholes.

Increased infection severity in downstream cities in infectious disease transmission and tourists surveillance analysis,"Infectious disease severely threatens human life. Human mobility and travel patterns influence the spread of infection between cities and countries. We find that the infection severity in downstream cities during outbreaks is related to transmission rate, recovery rate, travel rate, travel duration and the average number of person-to-person contacts per day. The peak value of the infected population in downstream cities is slightly higher than that in source cities. However, as the number of cities increases, the severity increase percentage during outbreaks between end and source cities is constant. The surveillance of important nodes connecting cities, such as airports and train stations, can help delay the occurrence time of infection outbreaks. The city-entry surveillance of hub cities is not only useful to these cities, but also to cities that are strongly connected (i.e., have a high travel rate) to them. The city-exit surveillance of hub cities contributes to other downstream cities, but only slightly to itself. Surveillance conducted in hub cities is highly efficient in controlling infection transmission. Only strengthening the individual immunity of frequent travellers is not efficient for infection control. However, reducing the number of person-toperson contacts per day effectively limits the spread of infection.","Infectious disease severely threatens human life. In recent years, deaths caused by infectious diseases have remained at an annual rate of 13-15 million ( WHO, 2013 ) . The epidemic severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) spread to 30 countries, resulting in over 80 0 0 cases and nearly 80 0 deaths in 20 03 ( WHO, 20 03 ). By the end of 2009, the pandemic H1N1 virus had spread to more than 208 countries, resulting in hundreds of thousands of cases and at least 18,0 0 0 deaths ( WHO, 2009a; Massaro and Bagnoli, 2014 ) . By June 2016, more than 28,0 0 0 Ebola cases had been reported in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, with more than 11,0 0 0 deaths ( WHO, 2015 ) . Globally, 2103 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), including at least 733 related deaths, had been reported to the WHO by 1 November 2017 ( WHO, 2017 ) . All of these infectious diseases initially occurred in a few countries and rapidly spread to others. Knowledge on the association between human mobility and infectious disease transmission is very important for infection control ( Barmak et al., 2016 ) .

Many computer simulations have been conducted on infection spread within indoor environments, such as planes ( Namilae et al., 2017 ) and cruise ships ( Zhang et al., 2016a ) ; within buildings, such as offices ( Zhang et al., 2018b; Zhang and Li, 2018 ) , hospitals ( Lau et al., 2004 ) and schools ( Zhang et al., 2011 ) ; and within cities ( Zhang et al., 2016b ( Zhang et al., , 2018a . Research on infection spread across cities and countries has mainly focused on human mobility based on historical data processing ( Opatowski et al., 2011 ) and mathematical models ( Charu et al., 2017 ) . Hyman and LaForce (2003) constructed a mathematical SIPR (where P is the stage of partial immunity) infection spread model across cities and analysed long-term infection spread trends. Kim et al. (2014) developed a mathematical model of multi-city transmission and simulated the outbreaks of pandemic influenza A in Korea across cities considering transportation impacts. Gautreau et al. (2008) used the Rvachev-Longini metapopulation model to analyse the arrival times of infectious disease on a global scale. Balcan et al. (2009) used a mobility (GLEaM) model to obtain multi-scale mobility networks to simulate infection spread across countries. Travellers, including business travellers, play an important role in infection spread across cities and countries ( Wang et al., 2012 ) . In the global network of human mobility ( Du et al., 2016 ) , travellers connect all cities and countries. Therefore, knowledge on how travel behaviour affects infectious disease transmission is useful to the prevention and control of infection spread between cities or even between countries. However, the previous research was insufficient because of a lack of the quantitative comparison between the source and downstream cities, the impacts of travel patterns, and efficiency of different surveillance strategies in the transportation hubs.

In order to reveal these important questions, we develop a multi-city travel and susceptible, infected and recover (MCT-SIR) model to simulate infection spread between cities. The impacts of travel-related factors are studied. We quantitatively analyse the infection severity of the source and downstream cities under different travel patterns. We also assess the different surveillance strategies on public transportation hubs based on quantitative simulation. Moreover, some traditional prevention strategies are compared with various surveillance plans. The results offer some suggestions for infectious disease control from the travel perspective.

We study the difference in the severity level (peak value of the infected percentage) of source and downstream cities. To quantify the difference, we first define the severity increase percentage ( P c d c s ) to describe the difference between the source city c s and the downstream city c d during outbreaks ( Eq. (1) ).

where I c s ,max and I c d ,max are the peak values of the infected population during outbreaks in the source city c s and the downstream city c d , respectively. A large P c d c s suggests that the severity of infectious disease in the downstream city c d is higher than that in the source city c s . We also classify cities into different levels. The source city ( c s ) is the city that discovers the first case. The first downstream city is the city that has direct population exchange with the source city. The second downstream city is the city that has direct population exchange with the first downstream city, but no exchange with the source city, and so on.

In this study, the MCT-SIR model mainly focuses on travel (human mobility) between cities. Therefore, we assume a fully mixed condition in each functional area, such as the offices, accommodations and restaurants in each city. The distribution of different functional areas is not considered. We analyse how influencing factors, such as travel rate ( δ), average travel duration ( t T ), the number of person-to-person contacts per day ( n p ), transmission rate ( β) and recovery rate ( γ ) affect the P c d c s and outbreak occurrence times of infectious diseases. As shown in Fig. 1 , the model has two main parts: infection and mobility. Infection (red dashed frame) means that infectious disease is transmitted in a city and mobility (blue dashed frame) means that infection spreads between cities due to human mobility. It is shown in Eq. (2) . and mobility ( S M c s (t) , I M c s (t) , and R M c s (t) ) are independent.

In Fig. 1 , the left black dashed frame shows the number of susceptible, infected and recovered people at time t − 1 . According to the SIR model ( Kermack and McKendrick, 1927 ) , the number of susceptible, infected and recovered people in city c s can be calculated using Eq. (3) . A specific calculation involving the different confined spaces is introduced in Supporting Information.

where the unit of β is 'per person per unit time' and the unit of γ is 'per unit time'.

The blue dashed frame in Fig. 1 shows the variation in S, I and R caused by mobilit y. For a city, there are inflow and outflow populations during each time step ( Eq. (4) ). 

residents who are not travelling; P go , t is the probability of a resident deciding to travel to other cities after time t ; and P back , t is the probability of a tourist deciding to return to their home city after travel time t . We assume that the per-hour probability of a resident deciding to travel is P go ( h −1 ) and that the per-hour probability of a tourist ending travel is P back ( h −1 ). P go , t and P back , t can be calculated using Eq. (5) .

H1N1 is used as an example to analyse infectious disease transmission between cities. According to previous studies on H1N1, 

respectively, the variations in S, I and R caused by human mobility at time t; n c is the total number of cities;

respectively, the S, I and R inflows from other cities to city i at time t ; and n c j=1

represent, respectively, the S, I and R outflows from city i to other cities at time t .

Default parameters in the study.

Value Definition Travel rate: the ratio of tourists in a city to citizens of the city N 400 people/day ( Hyman and LaForce, 2003 ) Interpersonal contact number per day: the number of people that a person contacts on average per day N r N/50 Number of confined spaces in a city P go , t -The probability of a resident deciding to travel to other cities after time t P back , t 1.57 × 10 −2 h −1 The probability of a tourist deciding to return to their home city after travel time t default parameters used in our study are listed in Table 1 . According to previous studies on H1N1, the basic reproductive number ( R 0 ) of H1N1 is approximately 1.8 ( Balcan et al., 2009; Lessler et al., 2009; Merler et al., 2011 ) , which means on average 1.8 new cases (i.e., infections) arise from a single primary case ( Fraser et al., 2009 ) . In a city, a person on average contacts 400 people per day ( Hyman and LaForce, 2003 ) . To keep R 0 = 1 . 8 , the transfer rate from the susceptible to the infected ( β), is set to 1.56 × 10 −3 . As the infectious period is from 1.1 to 4.69 days ( Balcan et al., 2009; Merler et al., 2011 ) , we set the mean value of 2.89 days (69 h). The recovery rate, γ (the transition rate from susceptible to recovered), is calculated ( γ = 0 . 014 h −1 ).

We set the time step to 3 h. There are eight steps per day. A person contacts on average 50 people per time step. We assume that all cities have the same population ( N ) and number of confined spaces ( N r ). People randomly distribute into different rooms per step. Therefore, a person contacts N / N r people per step. When N N r , it is considered that there is no repeated contact between any pair of people during a day.

Travel rate ( δ) is the percentage of tourists in a city to citizens of the city. It is expressed by Eq. (6) .

where N c s is the total number of city c s 's citizens; n c is the total number of cities; N c d ( c s ) is the number of city c s 's tourists in city c d ; and N c s ( c s ) represents the number of non-travelling residents of city c s . Each city has a population of N . The tourist population in each city is δ · N . To balance the population in a city (e.g., c s ),

Eq. (7) should be satisfied.

where N c s ( c s ) → c d is the total number of new tourists from city c s to city c d during each step; N c d ( c s ) → c s is the total number of tourists travelling in city c d who are returning to city c s ; and δ c s is the travel rate of city c s . P go , t is expressed by Eq. (8) .

Using China as an example, the Chinese Tourism Statistics Bulletin showed that there were 4.44 billion trips taken in 2016 with an average travel duration of 2.66 days ( CNTA, 2016 ) . Considering that the population at the time was 1.38 billion ( NBSC, 2018 ) , the average travel rate of China can be calculated as

where t is the travel duration for a tourist.

The per-hour probability of a resident deciding to travel ( P go )

can be calculated when travel rate ( δ) is known.

Influencing factors, such as travel rate ( δ), average travel duration ( t T ), basic reproductive number ( R 0 ); transfer rate ( β), recovery rate ( γ ) and the average number of person-to-person contacts per day ( n p ) and total population per city ( N ), affect the severity increase percentage ( P ) between a source city ( c s ) and its downstream cities ( c d ), which is expressed by P c d c s . Using H1N1 as an example, infectious disease transmission between only two cities (i.e., N c = 2 ) is simulated based on the MCT-SIR model ( Fig. 2 ) .

Generally, the shape of the infection spread curves in the source city and the downstream city are almost the same when δ → 0 and δ = 50% . As shown in Fig. 2 (a), when δ = 4% , P c d c s reaches the largest value of 4.40%. As δ increases, the P between the source city and the downstream city first increases and then decreases after the peak. Furthermore, the peak arrives earlier when R 0 is small. When R 0 = 1 . 5 , P c d c s reaches the largest value of 5.63% when δ = 4% . However, when R 0 = 2 . 5 , P c d c s reaches the largest value of 2.70% when δ = 3% . Therefore, the lower R 0 is, the higher the peak value of the P between the source city and the downstream city is ( Fig. 2 (b) ). changed if the product of β and n p is a constant. We also find that P c d c s is not influenced by the total population of the city. The P between the source and the downstream city changes with travel duration ( Fig. 4 (a) ). Under a constant travel rate ( δ = 1% ) and R 0 (1.8), when the average travel duration changes from 1 to 7 days, the time delay for outbreak between the downstream city and the source city increases from 5.3 to 15.3 days. In addition, P c d c s decreases from 3.86% to < 0.01% with travel duration expansion. When travel duration increases, the population exchange rate between two cities decreases because the travel rate is constant. The impact of the source city on the downstream city is weakened. Fig. 4 (a) shows that P c d c s monotonically decreases as travel duration increases (1-7 days) when δ = 1% . A negative correlation between P c d c s and travel duration (1 to 7 days) still exists when δ = 2% ( Fig. 4 (b) ). In reality, δ ≥ 4% is possible when certain festivals arrive. As shown by the red and green dashed lines in Fig. 4 (b) , P c d c s does not monotonically decrease as travel duration increases. The peak value occurs at t T = 2 when δ = 4% and at t T = 3 when δ = 6% , respectively. A too high or too low population exchange rate between two cities leads to a low P c d c s . Therefore, a high travel rate with a low travel duration or a low travel rate with a high travel duration decreases P c d c s . Based on our default settings ( R 0 = 1 . 8 , β = 1 . 56 × 10 −3 , γ = 0 . 014 h −1 and n p = 400 ), P c d c s peaks when t T /δ = 50 . Fig. 5 shows how the travel patterns between five cities influence infectious disease transmission (the P between five cities, the severity of infection outbreak and the outbreak occurrence time). In Fig. 5 (a) , infectious disease transmits from source city A to end city E city by city (i.e., A → B → C → D → E ). To maintain a constant population in each city at all times, δ = 1% is set in cities A and E and δ = 2% is set in cities B, C and D . The peak value of infected individuals during outbreaks is the same in cities B, C and D , with an average P BCD A = 0 . 50% ( Fig. 5 (a) ). The P between the middle cities is close to 0. City E is the end city and P E A = 2 . 33% . Comparing P E A to the P c d c s with only two cities ( Fig. 2 (a) ), the P between the source city and the end city is almost the same ( P E A ≈ P c d c s ). In Fig. 5 (a) , city B receives infected tourists from source city A during the infection rising period and delivers infected people to city C at the same time. City A, B , and C like three bottles of solution. City B receives a highly concentrated solution from city A , but is also diluted by city C . However, P E D is high because the end city ( E ) only absorbs the highly concentrated solution from city D without any dilution caused by the other cities. Therefore, P E D and P B A are big, whereas P C B and P D C are very small.

In Fig. 5 (b) , the travel pattern from city A to E is circular ( A → B → C → D → E → A ) and the tourist flow in each city is unidirectional with δ = 1% . The peak value of the infected population during the outbreaks in the second downstream cities ( C and D ) is higher than the first downstream cities ( B and E ) and the source city, A ( P BE A = 1 . 36% , P CD A = 2 . 41% ). This is consistent with the law that the P between the source city ( C s ) and the end city ( C e ) is constant ( P c e c s ≈ 2 . 4% ). In the circular travel pattern, both cities B and E are the first downstream cities. The only difference between city B and city E is the direction of travel ( A → B vs. E → A ). The infected tourists from city A can spread infection to city B . Tourists from city E are probably infected when they travel to city A and then take the virus back to city E , thereby spreading infection. The infection spread curves under both conditions are almost the same. When the time step is small, we can consider the percentage of the infected individuals in city A 's tourist population who travel to city B and in city E 's tourist population who return to their home cities from city A to be the same. The population exchange rate between cities A and B during each time step equals that between cities E and A ( δ AB = δ EA ). Therefore, the infectious disease transmission curves of cities B and E are similar. This pattern can also be seen by comparing the results of cities C and D .

In Fig. 5 (c) , the residents of cities A and B can travel to city C . In city C , they can travel to cities D and E ( A/B → C → D/E ). City C is the first downstream city and cities B, D and E are the second downstream cities. As the travel rate from city B to city C is higher than that from city C to city D/E ( δ BC = 2 δ CD = 2 δ CE ), the infectious disease outbreak occurs earlier in city B . Fig. 5 (d) shows The severity of infection outbreak in city C is slightly lower than that in other cities. The travel rate from city A to C is low, but cities B, D and E have strong dilution impacts during the rising period of infection of city C . Comparing city B to cities D and E , the peak value of the infected population is the same. However, the outbreak occurrence time (when the infected population reaches the peak) in city B occurs later than that in cities D and E .

Human mobility surveillance between cities influences infectious disease transmission ( Fig. 6 ) . We assume that surveillance strategies can help monitor infected tourists with an efficiency of 90%. Therefore, 90% of infected tourists would be monitored when moving from one city to another and sent to hospital for isolation. Comparing Fig. 6 (a) and (f), when people who leave city A are monitored, the outbreak occurrence time in the first downstream city, C , is delayed from day 42.5 to 52 and the peak value of the infected population increases by 2.56%. The outbreak occurrence time in cities B, D and E is also delayed. Monitoring tourists who leave city A does not influence the relative relationship between cities B, D and E . Comparing Fig. 6 (c) and (a), the relative positions of the curves of cities B, D and E remain almost constant.

When people who enter city D are monitored ( Fig. 6 (b) ), comparing it with city A-exit surveillance ( Fig. 6 (a) ), occurrence time for outbreaks of cities B to E is advanced. Cities A, B, C and E are not strongly influenced by this strategy, and infectious disease transmission curves are similar with them under no-control condition ( Fig. 6 (f) ). However, the occurrence time for outbreaks of city D is delayed about 9.5 days compared with city E , and the peak value of the infected during outbreaks is decreased by 1.50%.

City C is the only first downstream city in this travel pattern, and it directly links with the source city A and the second downstream cities B, D , and E . City C can be seen as a hub, and every tourist has correlation with city C . Hub usually plays an important role in a network. As shown in Fig. 6 (c) , when tourists who enter city C are monitored, the outbreak occurrence time in city C is the same as that under the condition of city A exit surveillance. However, the second downstream cities, B, D and E , are strongly influenced. If there is no surveillance, the outbreak in city B occurs earlier than in cities D and E . After monitoring tourists who enter city C , the outbreak occurrence time of city B is delayed and the outbreak severity decreases by 4.72%. When infected tourists return from city C to city B , 90% of them are sent to hospital for isolation. Only 10% of infected tourists can take the virus back, strongly weakening the efficiency of infection spread. City C acts as a filter and reduces the impacts caused by infected city B 's tourists who return from city C . Infected residents in city D are never monitored because none of city D 's tourists go to city C, but a few infected tourists do go to city D from city C . In general, as a hub city, city-entry surveillance is not only useful to city C , but also to cities with a high rate of population exchange with city C . Fig. 6 (d) shows the infection spread under hub city C exit surveillance. Infected tourists leaving source city A cannot be monitored. Compared to city C entry surveillance, the outbreak occurrence time in cities B, C, D and E is advanced in city C exit surveillance. For city B , city C acts as a filter regardless of which of the two strategies is chosen. Therefore, the impact on city B is the same. Focusing on cities D and E , city C exit surveillance helps reduce negative effects and delays outbreak occurrence time. In general, city C exit surveillance contributes to three second downstream cities ( B, D and E ), but only slightly to its own city.

When both city C entry and exit surveillance are conducted, all eight routes between cities A, B, D and E and city C are monitored ( Fig. 6 (e) ). However, it takes more manpower and material resources. In this situation, the outbreak occurrence time is delayed in all cities. Compared to no strategy ( Fig. 6 (f) ), the outbreak occurrence time in city C is delayed by 10.4 days, in city B by 18.3 days and in cities D and E by 19.4 days.

During infectious disease epidemics, the local government usually requests residents to reduce travel to prevent cross infection with people from other cities. In reality, when the severity of infectious disease increases, travel rate is likely to decrease. Comparing Figs. 7 (a) and 6 (f), when travel rate decreases as infection severity increases, the efficiency of infectious disease control is limited because human mobility in cities is not controlled. However, the outbreak occurrence time is delayed in downstream cities. For example, the outbreak occurrence time in city C is delayed by 5 days, in city B by 12 days and in cities D and E by 15.4 days. This strategy cannot reduce the severity of outbreaks, but it can delay the outbreak occurrence time. This gives the government more time to make emergency plans. The local government usually requests individuals to avoid densely populated areas, such as shopping malls, to reduce the number of person-to-person contacts per day during infection outbreaks ( Fig. 7 (b) ). When infectious disease is very serious, some strategies, such as work stoppage, school closure and shopping mall closure, are implemented. In this situation, the probability of person-to-person contact is decreased. Even the probability of tourists spreading infection or becoming infected decreases. The severity of infectious disease outbreak is strongly reduced and the peak value of the infected population in all cities is controlled below 7.7%.

We define the P between downstream and source cities ( P c d c s ) as the ratio of the peak value of infected populations. We mainly study how travel-related factors and intervention strategies δ BC = 1% ; δ CD = δ CE = 0 . 5% . * 2 A 90% surveillance rate means that 90% of infected tourists are monitored when they move between cities. These people are isolated in hospitals and then leave from the hospital upon recovery. affect infection spread ( P , outbreak severity and outbreak occurrence time) between cities.

Infection spreads quickly between cities. The phase 5 pandemic H1N1 virus ( WHO, 2009b ) spread to more than 208 countries, resulting in hundreds of thousands of cases and at least 18,0 0 0 deaths ( WHO, 2009a; CDC, 2009 ). On 21 April 2009, the CDC reported that the first two cases of illness in Southern California had been caused by infection with genetically similar H1N1 viruses; Texas also reported two cases then ( CDC, 2009 ) . By the end of July 2009, Wisconsin, Hawaii and Connecticut had the highest percentages of H1N1 patients ( CDC, 2010 ) . This conforms to our results that some downstream cities are more serious than the source city in an infection outbreak. In addition to inter-city travel, population density, environment, human behaviour and other factors also influence infection spread.

Infectious diseases have different basic reproductive ratios ( R 0 ). For example, that for H1N1 is approximately 1.8 ( De Silva et al., 2009 ) , that for H7N9 is between 0.6 and 2.5 ( Yang et al., 2015 ) and that for norovirus is between 5.3 and 9.3 ( Lee et al., 2011 ) . R 0 influences not only infection spread in a city, but also the infection severity between the downstream city and the source city. The lower R 0 is, the higher the peak value of the P between the 

where I c, max is the maximum number of infected people in one city out of all cities at time t, N c is the current population in the city that has the maximum number of infected people at time t and δ( t ) is the travel rate at time t . The travel rate monotonically linearly decreases from 1% to 0% when the percentage of the infected population in the most severely affected city increases from 0% to 10%. When I c, max (t) N c (t) > 0 . 1 , no people travel ( δ(t) = 0 ). * 2 The average number of person-to-person contacts per day ( n p ) changes with the severity of infectious disease and agrees with n p (t) = n p × [ 0 . 29 − I c,max (t) N c (t) ] 0 . 28 , 0 . 01 ≤ I c,max (t) N c (t) ≤ 0 . 15 , where n p is the default number of person-to-person contacts per day (400 in this study). When more than 1% of people are infected in a city, the contact behaviour between people is limited. n P is halved when more than 15% of people are infected in the most severely affected city. n P monotonically linearly decreases from n p to n p / 2 when I c,max (t) N c (t) increases from 0.01 to 0.15. source city and the downstream city becomes. P c d c s was mainly caused by mobility other than infection ( Fig. 1 ) . And increasing R 0 leads to enhancement of the impact brought by infection , therefore, the P c d c s will decrease because of weaker impact by mobility . Moreover, the higher R 0 is, the higher the travel rate must be to reach the highest P c d c s . With an increasing travel rate, the P c d c s increases first then goes down. For example, if there is only one infected traveller going to the downstream city and only one resident in the downstream city is infected (travel rate → 0), the trend of the number of the infected would be the same for both the source and the downstream cities (all of them are caused by only one infected person), and there is no difference between the peak value of the infected ( P c d c s == 0). When the travel rate is 0.5, which means residents in the source and downstream cities are sufficiently mixed, two cities would have the same curves of number of infected people (( P c d c s == 0). Therefore, there is a specific value of travel rate can lead to the highest P c d c s . The average travel rate in China is 2.34% ( CNTA, 2016 ). When H1N1 spreads ( R 0 = 1 . 8 ), P c d c s reaches a maximum when the travel rate is 4%. During normal periods, the travel rate is generally lower than 4%. However, the travel rate rapidly increases when certain festivals, such as the Spring Festival (the most important festival in China), arrive. At such times, governments should also focus on infectious disease prevention and control in downstream cities rather than only in source cities.

Transmission rate ( β), recovery rate ( γ ) and the average number of person-to-person contacts per day ( n p ) influence P c d c s . For infectious diseases with low transfer rate ( β↓ ) but a high infectious period ( γ ↓ ), downstream cities are strongly influenced by the associated source city ( P c d c s ↑ ). When the infectious period increases, there is a longer time to spread disease when tourists from the source city travel to downstream cities. The severity of infection in downstream cities is strengthened. In addition, under a travel rate of 1%, with increasing travel duration (from 1 to 7 days), the population exchange rate between two cities reduces and the impacts of the source city on downstream cities weaken. In reality, the average travel duration is decided by vacation arrangements. For example, only 1-2 days of travel can occur on weekends, but the average travel duration can be between 5 and 7 days when the Spring Festival or National Day arrives. We find that when the quotient of travel duration ( t T ) and travel rate ( δ) is a constant ( t T /δ = 50 in this study), P c d c s reaches a maximum. Governments may consider different emergency plans based on the characteristics of travel patterns. P c d c s reaches a maximum of 4.40% when the travel rate is 4.0% and the travel duration is 2.66 days. The increased severity of the downstream city is slight. In reality, this influence is ignored because it is easily covered by other impacts caused by environmental differences (e.g., temperature and humidity), cultural differences and individual characteristics between cities. Our results are obtained for the same settings in all cities.

By simulating infection spread in five cities with different travel patterns, we can conclude that when there are many cities, the P between the source city and the end city ( P c e c s ) is almost the same as between just two cities ( P c e c s = P c d c s ). P c e c s is not strongly related to the total number of cities. In general, travel-related factors influence infection spread between cities, but the impacts are limited. In the study, we found that the infection enhancement in downstream cities brought by travel is much weaker than those by some environmental factors such as temperature and humidity. Normally, travel can only bring no more than 4% infection enhancement in downstream cities and the impact is relatively low compared with environment factors. However, downstream cities should be paid more attention because infection intensity in downstream cities is no weaker than the source city.

Tourist surveillance is used to control infection spread in many situations ( Memish et al., 2014; Petersen et al., 2015 ) . Our simulation shows that the severity of infectious disease transmission is difficult to control if only tourist surveillance between cities is used. This strategy can help delay the outbreak occurrence time and provide governments more time to prepare efficient emergency plans. City-entry surveillance of non-hub cities is only useful to the target city that measures tourist surveillance. The positive impacts on other cities can be ignored. City-entry surveillance of hub cities is not only useful to the hub cities, but also to cities with strong connections (i.e., a high travel rate) to them. However, for cities with little or no tourist exchange with hub cities, the positive impacts of hub city entry surveillance are weak. The cityexit surveillance of hub cities contributes to downstream cities, but only slightly to above said hub cities. Both the city-entry andexit surveillance of hub cities are the most effective for infection control, although requiring more manpower and consuming more resources. Tourist surveillance of hub cities is much more efficient than of other cities and can provide local governments more time to prepare emergency plans to reduce the threat of infectious disease.

Infection risk can also be reduced by some other strategies, such as wearing a mask and getting vaccinated ( Sobolev et al., 2016 ) . Strengthening the individual immunity of either frequent travellers or randomly selected individuals yields little difference. The efficiency of strategies that only improve the individual immunity of frequent travellers is limited. However, the outbreak occurrence time can be slightly delayed in downstream cities. Individuals can either wear a mask or get vaccinated to reduce infection risk. Governments can limit the travel rate between cities and the probability of person-to-person contact via work stoppage ( Zhang et al., 2018a ) and school closure ( Gemmetto et al., 2014 ) to reduce infection risk. Comparing the two government strategies, controlling the amount of person-to-person contact per day is obviously effective in infectious disease control.

Our study on infection spread between cities provides some suggestions for governments to control infectious disease transmission based on travel-related factors and strategies. Various limitations exist. We mainly consider the travel patterns between cities and hypothesise the random movement of residents in a city. This may affect the precision of the results. In addition, all cities in this study have the same settings in terms of population scale and the average number of person-to-person contacts per day. Moreover, the MCT-SIR model is established based on the SIR model. Lastly, the increased severity phenomenon may require observation using more sophisticated models, such as multi-agent models.

Open Access RES EARCH Aerosol influenza transmission risk contours: A study of humid tropics versus winter temperate zone,"Background: In recent years, much attention has been given to the spread of influenza around the world. With the continuing human outbreak of H5N1 beginning in 2003 and the H1N1 pandemic in 2009, focus on influenza and other respiratory viruses has been increased. It has been accepted for decades that international travel via jet aircraft is a major vector for global spread of influenza, and epidemiological differences between tropical and temperate regions observed. Thus we wanted to study how indoor environmental conditions (enclosed locations) in the tropics and winter temperate zones contribute to the aerosol spread of influenza by travelers. To this end, a survey consisting of 632 readings of temperature (T) versus relative humidity (RH) in 389 different enclosed locations air travelers are likely to visit in 8 tropical nations were compared to 102 such readings in 2 Australian cities, including ground transport, hotels, shops, offices and other publicly accessible locations, along with 586 time course readings from aircraft.","The contrasting epidemiology of influenza in the tropics versus temperate regions has been discussed for many years, and it has been accepted for decades that jet aircraft are a major vector for global spread of influenza [1] . This study is an attempt to better understand aerosol influenza transmission for indoor locations by examining temperature and humidity indoors where jet travelers are likely to interact with locals and comparing humid tropical locations with temperate winter ones. In recent years, much attention has been given to the spread of influenza around the world, especially with the continuing H5N1 outbreaks since 2003 and the H1N1 pandemic in 2009. Extensive research has been conducted to understand the mechanism of transmission of influenza virus, including environmental conditions that favor transmission. Various aerosol studies have shown that micron range droplet particles from breathing, talking, coughing and sneezing bear influenza viruses, and that the aerosol route is an important contributor to infection [2, 3] . The particles making up aerosol in normal exhalation are less than 1 micron in size; aerosol particles range from 0.1 micron to 5 micron [2, 4] , and these smallest particles are primary vectors of contagion [5, 6] .

Questions have been raised as to whether or not aerosol transmission of influenza occurs or is a significant contributor to its epidemiology, and whether vitamin D is a determining factor [7] [8] [9] [10] . We believe that our study sheds helpful light on these matters by defining a framework that starts to formalize the effect of temperature and RH conditions on such transmission. We treat this more extensively in the discussion section.

We intend this study to be primarily targeted at public health planners and epidemic model developers. Interventions to successfully interrupt spread of influenza that have been studied in depth are quarantine, isolation, different types of masks, gloves, hygiene, and combinations of these [11] . Public health planners can use our results to consider making climate control adjustment recommendations, which can help control aerosol transmission. As well, modeling of epidemics in software depends on assumptions about where contagion is likely to occur. Some types of modeling today may take into account generalized types of mixing locations which are enclosed [12, 13] , as it is believed that most transmission (including aerosol) occurs indoors, with much attention put on social network [14, 15] . We believe that such models can be improved by modeling of interior temperature and RH.

The authors developed a contour map of T versus RH based on literature from Lowen et al. [16] [17] [18] and others. In the studies of Lowen et al. guinea pigs were exposed to aerosol infection from another guinea pig for 7 days in an environmental cabinet maintaining temperature and relative humidity at varying levels. Thus, where we refer to a 25% risk of transmission, or a 25% contour, we mean that the risk of aerosol infection of one guinea pig over 7 days of continuous aerosol exposure to an infected guinea pig is roughly 25% (25% G7 ). We use this animal model as a baseline for estimation of differential risk to human populations. It is understood that temperature and humidity are not the only factors in aerosol transmission; however, we believe that they are primary factors along with dilution by air exchange and distribution by air currents [2, 19] . In modern building systems, recirculation of indoor air for energy efficiency is also a likely factor. We collected data in 8 countries in the tropics and 2 Australian cities during winter (June-September 2009). Relative humidity and temperature readings were taken in public areas frequented by travelers (e.g. hotels, banks, malls, shops, taxis, buses, etc.) as well as during flights between nations. Observations were also recorded of behaviors that could augment the spread of influenza significantly. Interviews were conducted in major cities in the tropics and Australia to improve understanding of influenza transmission conditions.

In the process of our study, observations were made that suggest inexpensive measures that could be taken to minimize the spread of influenza in the tropics via aerosol, and these may also apply to temperate regions.

A model EP8706 digital psychrometer (Mannix Testing & Measurement, Lynbrook, New York) was used to take readings of temperature and humidity for most of the data. For a subset of the Singapore data, a Holmes analog humidity meter was used with a conventional analog dry bulb thermometer. These instruments were calibrated against each other, and the digital psychrometer was assumed to be the more accurate instrument. Correction was applied to the Holmes humidity data based on crosscalibration. Each reading is a one-time measurement; instruments came to equilibrium before a reading was recorded by hand with the time, date and location. Care was taken to ensure instrument temperature was at ambient, shielded from strong air currents and major infrared radiant sources to prevent condensation or improper evaporation from the probe.

During the months of July through September 2009, major cities in the countries of Costa Rica, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Panama, Peru, Thailand, Singapore and New Guinea were surveyed as representative of the humid tropical belt. Australia was chosen as the location of cities experiencing temperate winter conditions and a significant spike in H1N1 influenza. The cities (which included nearby suburban areas) were: San Jose, Costa Rica; Lima, Peru; Panama City, Panama; San Salvador, El Salvador; Managua, Nicaragua; Bangkok, Thailand; Singapore; Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea; Sydney and Melbourne, Australia. Some surveillance of outlying areas was also performed.

Travel locations typical of choices made by tourists and business travelers was performed, as well as a survey of shops, offices, malls, high end hotels, and dining establishments in each city. These locations were chosen because in the modern world, epidemics are spread rapidly by aircraft [1] and thus by extension, the places visited by those who travel on aircraft (tourists and businesspeople) are the logical contact points with the population of those nations.

Environment in buses, tour cars, and taxicabs was also monitored, and, where feasible, time courses were conducted on transportation. These data could be improved on by a more comprehensive data collection conducted in more countries over the course of several years at a larger number of locations. However, the data is sufficient to be useful, and care was taken to make choices as consistent with tourist and business behavior typical of air travelers as possible and to only observe, never direct or interfere with environmental controls or human behavior.

After review, aerosol transmission estimations were primarily drawn from Lowen et al. to interpolate contours of transmission of influenza in the humidity versus temperature phase space. A set of contours was generated that is believed to be mildly conservative (Figure 1 and Additional file 1 -Contagion contour estimation details). 

We recognize that accurate influenza morbidity and mortality data are notoriously difficult to acquire [21, 22] . Mortality and morbidity rates based on current surveillance data were collected both from official reports (WHO PAHO/SEARO, Departments of Public Health) and directly from responsible public health personnel in interviews. Care was taken to try to minimize artifact differences due to surveillance deficits. Alternate sources such as Flutracker [23] were consulted to vet surveillance data and we believe our data is as accurate as obtainable for the period.

Crude risk derivation is based on a histogram of the estimated time of contagion for the animals in Lowen et al., as presented in Figure 2 . Calculated crude risk estimates are given in tables where time in location estimation allows it.

A polynomial equation (equation 2, Additional file 1-Contagion contour estimation details) was fitted to the histogram data using Maple 10 [20] to estimate the risk of start of infection over the days in which secondary infections are estimated to have occurred. This 4 th degree equation from day 1 to 9 was selected to fit observations and knowledge that virus shedding from inoculated animals is expected to end by day 8. To express probability of infection, the histogram values were represented as fractions of the total number of infections, and the equation fitted so the area under the curve is equal to 1 to 3 decimal places. Tables 1 and 2 contain estimates generated from this equation. (See also: Additional file 4 -Maple workbook for empirical contagion probability equation, and Additional file 5 -Empirical contagion probability integral in text format for use in Excel.)

Where t =time expressed in days, p is crude risk probability assuming 100% 7 day contagion (100% G7 ) C(T, RH) is the estimated risk for a field reading from the contour map and p c = probability of contagion. Result p when multiplied by contagion contour percentage at a temperature and RH provides the time scaled risk of infection in a location (p c ). See Additional file 1-Contagion contour estimation details for more discussion.

The aerosol transmission contours are presented in Fig Figure 4 Temperature distance from 25% G7 transmission risk contour. The 4A ogive (cumulative distribution curve for the histogram) for each nation was plotted with a vertical line at the zero point. For Figure 4A bins of 2 degrees C width are used to categorize temperature distances from the 25% G7 transmission risk contour. Figure 4B presents the same temperature distance data in a linear density plot for each nation, with a tick mark for each temperature distance, and the arithmetic mean. The temperature distances were calculated for each point shown in Figure 3 Average Distance from 25% Contour Estimate Mortality per million Figure 6 Closed, Air Conditioned Tropical Ground Transport. The scatter plot (6A) and linear density plot (6B) show all data (multiple time course readings per trip) for motor vehicles categorized by old and new. The vehicle data shown above is for vehicles with closed windows and air conditioning. All old taxi, tour and hotel car readings show low risk (above the 25% G7 transmission risk line). Most readings for new cars in this low risk region are due to higher temperature and low humidity, presumably because automotive engineers are using evaporative cooling from the skin of passengers in dehumidified air to lower perceived temperature. 6B data points produced the cumulative histogram of temperature distances ogive/density charts of Figure 4 . This shows the relationship of readings to the 25% G7 risk contour for the entire dataset. Figure 5 shows correlation of average distance from the 25% G7 contour to cases of influenza. We will now examine in more detail different types of locations surveyed.

Luxury buses are used for long-distance trips of 4-12 hours, have air conditioning (AC) and windows operable only in emergency. A not uncommon complaint is that these buses are too cold. They are commonly used by traveling visitors, and also by middle class inhabitants of the region desiring more comfort in their travel. Luxury bus trips (N = 16) fell into the region of concern below the 25% G7 transmission risk contour (Figure 6 ), and passengers shedding virus are a probable source of aerosol. Additionally, vendors often appear at stops selling merchandise. Some vendors get on at one stop and travel with the bus for 45 minutes or so, selling products and entertaining the passengers. Others get on the bus at stops and spend shorter periods of time on the order of 10 minutes, getting off one stop later. Some get on and off at the same stop in 2-4 minutes. Total estimated vendor time inside buses is on the order of 3-5 hours per day over as many as 20 buses, each bus containing potential influenza aerosol, raising their chances of both infection and transmission. Wake effects such as those proposed to explain SARS transmission in a modern jet aircraft [24] are generated by them, and they lean in close to many passengers. Additionally, they have physical contact through money and product exchange, which is usually food. Inexpensive buses used by locals have no AC, using open windows for ventilation. Readings confirmed that their temperatures and RH are equal to or higher than ambient temperatures (data not shown). Vendors serving these inexpensive buses were fewer, and were only observed to board briefly at stops, departing the bus within 2-3 minutes, or to make sales directly through windows.

Trips in high end taxicabs and new minivan shuttles (N = 21) also showed good transmission conditions ( Figure  6 ). Trips in old taxis (N = 11), even if closed and air-conditioned, and those not using recirculation, stayed out of the high risk region. The ability of a new automobile to rapidly lower humidity with the windows closed on recirculation setting to between 45% and 25% RH within 5 minutes or less is remarkable (Figure 7 ). New high end taxis and hotel cars were commonly occupied by travelers for 20-45 minutes (to/from airports, to/from holiday or business meetings).

Of high end tropical hotels studied (N = 22) approximately 50% had good conditions for aerosol transmission in common areas. However, all tropical hotels having good conditions were in the high RH region near 65% (data not shown).

Tropical locations to find good conditions for aerosol influenza transmission to the general public were bank branches, dining facilities, retail shops and offices ( Figure  8 ). The overall impression was that business locations in the tropics needing to appear high-status set their AC systems to generate low humidity and temperature.

In the temperate Australian winter, 98% of buildings (N = 100) showed good aerosol transmission conditions ( Figure 3B ). Thus, no breakdown by type of facility is presented.

Dwellings were not surveyed in all nations and the sample was low; however, where surveyed, estimates were made of how typical RH and temperature were for a dwelling class. The majority of tropical apartment buildings (N = 10, data not shown) had open-air common areas and showed poor aerosol conditions. Surprisingly, temperature and RH conditions in dwellings surveyed were not optimum for transmission in Australia, although the sample was insufficiently large.

Using our transmission contours, conditions for influenza transmission exist during deplaning (Figure 9 ) for intervals of 7 minutes or less from the time passengers It can be seen that within 5 minutes, relative humidity is lowered to between 45% and 25%. Time 0:00 is street ambient temperature and the first interior reading is at or after 1 minute. The humidity in a new automobile was significantly lower than the street humidity at the time of the first reading after the door was closed. That these vehicles recirculated their air would be expected to contribute to contagion. N = 15. stood up until aircraft cleared (mean 3 min 55 sec, N = 12). During this time, ventilation was often turned to a low setting or off. The authors believe risk is probably low on a per passenger basis, because the period is limited to the short time in which passengers file out of the airplane and other factors may override T and RH. Aircraft data ( Figure 10 ) is otherwise presented without risk interpretation (see discussion).

Literature shows opposing conditions for transmission of viruses in general; low relative humidity (RH) and high RH [5, 25, 26] with temperature a secondary factor. Theory predicts osmotic forces should affect enveloped viruses such as influenza, while icosahedral viruses (e.g. polio, norovirus) would not be so sensitive for structural reasons. Enveloped viruses generally have highest infective stability at RH somewhat below 50% [5] , and non-enveloped icosahedral viruses usually show greatest infective stability in aerosol in high humidity conditions [25, 26] . Data of Lowen et al. [16, 17] at 20°C show optimal transmission of influenza by aerosol at a first RH range from 20-40%, and at a second from 60-70%. Lower temperatures improve transmission, with temperatures above 30°C reducing transmission to zero. These data correlate with other in-vitro studies [5, [25] [26] [27] .

Influenza is an enveloped virus. Enveloped viruses bud from the cell membrane, so the virus envelope is host cell (or golgi) membrane acquired in the budding process. Inside the envelope is RNA, a few enzymes and proteins, along with cell cytosol at physiological salt concentration. This matters because if one puts a cell in an environment containing lower salt concentration than in cytosol, the cell membrane acts as an osmosis membrane and eventually ruptures [28] . Enveloped viruses will have the same issue, although the smaller diameter should give greater stability to rupture per equation 3.

Where F = membrane tensile force, P = pressure, r = radius Infectious droplets from the lungs start out with physiological levels of salts. These salts could cause rupture of virion envelopes as droplets collect distilled water from humid air. Schaffer et al [27] studied stability of enveloped viruses from different cell lines (viz. kidney, chick embryo) and these cell lines buffer osmotic pressures at different rates [28] . Those results indicate that cells which are better at buffering themselves to osmotic pressure produce enveloped viruses that survive longer at higher RH. We are not aware of any direct study of osmotic destruction of enveloped virions, although it makes considerable sense. At lower RH, enveloped viruses are quite stable and infectious; at high RH they are not. One possibility is the above-mentioned osmotic pressure issue. Another is the theory that droplet particles settle more quickly as they take on water [17] under high RH, which fits Stokes' law [2] . In addition, enlargement of the particle as a condensation nucleus will cause it not to penetrate as far into lungs as a result [2] . However, none of these hypotheses explain the viability trough at 50% RH nor the secondary peak at 65% RH, although the rapid decline toward 80% RH does fit. The primary variable between in-vitro studies and Lowen et al. appears to be differences between the synthetic droplet media of the in-vitro studies [25, 27] and the natural droplets from exhalation, which are likely to be glycoproteins, salts and other components of mucus [29] .

A study by Harper [25] examined, in-vitro, survival of 4 cultured viruses in aerosol, at temperatures ranging from 21°C to 24°C. To the degree his results differ from Lowen in the 50% + humidity range, they might be explained by his higher temperature. If so, that would change the contours of influenza transmission risk (Figure 1) somewhat, although the current transmission risk contours would remain conservative. Alternatively, this difference may be from the droplet fluid carrying virus used by Harper, as mentioned above.

There is an argument that influenza strains might vary in stability from mutations sufficiently to affect the contours of transmission as taken from Lowen. However, evolutionary argument supports virus stability in aerosol as strongly conserved, since in humans, viruses with lesser aerosol stability will not propagate as well as those with greater stability (unless aerosol stability is compensated for by some other propagation enhancement), and viruses with optimum stability will be selected for during host to host transmission [30, 31] . Thus, literature results from human influenza virus strains would be expected to be from virus near the practical limit of aerosol stability. Further, osmotic pressure generates tensile force on the envelope, which will exhibit resistance to osmotic pressure not exceeding the weakest envelope bilayer hydrogen bonds.

Based on the considerations above, contours were generated based on linear interpolation of Lowen et al. [16, 17] cross-validated with others [5, 25, 27, 32] . These contours apply to RH conditions from 20% to 80%, although it is likely that contours above 80% RH have lower transmission risk than at 80%. Both the region from 0% to 20% RH and that above 80% RH are less clear and need investigation. The justification for using these risk contours in larger scale environments is based on data from studies that show long term persistence (hours) of viable aerosol virus [25, 27] .

As presented by Lowen et al. [16, 17] in studies of aerosol transmission of influenza over 7 days, there are three temperature groups, 5°C, 20°C and 30°C at varying RH. For the 5°C temperature there are four RH categories, 35%, 50%, 65% and 80%. At 20°C and 30°C there is an additional fifth at 20% RH. At 30°C there is no transmission. At 5°C transmission varies from 100% to 50% and at 20°C from 100% to 0%. Thus, where statistical power is in question is between 5°C and 20°C. As discussed [17] , the difference in transmissibility between 5°C and 20°C at 50% and 80% humidity is significant (p < 0.05). This leaves the 65% relative humidity results at 20°C to be examined.

To further evaluate the Lowen data, we considered it in the context of Harper [25] and Schaffer [27] data on time course viability of influenza virions at differing temperature and humidity, because it is axiomatic that the longer virions can remain viable in aerosol, the more likely they are to cause infection by this route. Harper shows support for the transmission decline of Lowen, as viability declines when RH increases toward 50%. Schaffer data for one hour survival at 21°C (see figure two of Schaffer et al.) also shows a viability trough at 50% RH rising at humidity above 50% followed by a decline [27] . These features of Harper and Schaffer further support the Lowen 20°C data for 50% RH, which was already of sufficient statistical significance. Additionally, Schaffer supports the 65% RH increase in transmission called out as statistically of insufficient power by Lowen et al. A further argument in favor of the 65% RH increase in transmission is care to present conservative contagion contours where there is a question; thus we retained the feature showing a rise in contagion at 65% RH.

Consequently, although p values for Lowen et al. alone are insufficient for acceptance of the 65% RH rise in contagion, taking alternative data sources and conservatism into account, we retained the 65% RH feature. We understand that the details of the type of contour map we present may change with larger datasets between 5°C and 30°C and we strongly encourage performance of larger experiments with multiple strains of influenza and other respiratory viruses. It would be highly desirable to have a larger dataset on the order of 30 animals or more at each temperature and RH setting and more temperature and RH values.

For visual inspection purposes the 25% G7 transmission estimate contour is emphasized and became the reference using the following rationale.

Since Lloyd-Smith et al. reported the SARS epidemic was primarily propagated by superspreaders infecting 4 or more people [33] , we chose conditions that should limit spreading to infect 1 or 2 on average.

The guinea pig experiments of Lowen were performed for 7 days. In most public places such as banks and hotel lobbies with good conditions for transmission of influenza, the time people spend is on the order of 10 minutes. This corresponds by integration of equation 2 to a crude risk of 1/1959 for any one entry and exit at the 25% G7 contour. Thus, assuming 300 patrons per day yields approximately 1 case every 6 days for a usual branch, assuming an infected individual is shedding virus continuously. Risk on a bus ride of 8 hours at the 25% G7 contour yields a crude risk of 1/41, which roughly corresponds to 1 new infection per 8 hour bus ride assuming continuous virus shedding. Assuming an influenza case of 7 days virus shedding duration, we thought it improbable most locals would take more than two 8 hour luxury bus rides with 50 passengers per bus in that time span (vendors excluded) for a total of 2 new infections. (Table 1) These crude risks represent the rationale of our risk cutoff in enclosed spaces. However, we do not think one contour cutoff is always appropriate.

A considerable amount of data was collected for aircraft, however, transmission risk on aircraft is complex. First, the influenza contagion space relative to temperature and RH on aircraft is mostly unknown since studies have not been done below 20% RH, and large portions of flights can occur with RH in the 3% to 15% range ( Figure 10 ). How such extremely low RH affects transmission is unknown. Second, although influenza was communicated well to aircraft passengers circa 1979 during a ground delay (38 of 54 passengers in 4.5 hours, 1 index case) given lack of air circulation [34] , HEPA filtration of recirculated cabin air on most aircraft today mitigates this hazard, together with outside air exchange in flight. Literature raises questions about efficacy of HEPA filters on aircraft [35] ; however, the careful epidemiology of SARS on an aircraft [24] suggests HEPA filters and air exchange were fairly effective on that aircraft because of the apparent wake pattern of infection. That correlates with modeling of wake particles carried behind persons moving along the aisle [36] . SARS, like influenza, is an enveloped RNA virus of the same size, which likely has similar filtration characteristics. Third, on some aircraft, ozone is negligible due to catalytic units [37] . Ozone For quick, rough estimates in a public health setting, estimates such as these can be made by use of the table. These kinds of estimates were used to decide which was the reasonable aerosol transmission risk contour to use to demarcate the low risk boundary of the figure 1 graph.

(See Discussion, 25% G7 transmission risk contour selection.) It should be noted that these numbers are useful as guidance rather than being completely predictive since other factors such as ventilation diluting virus aerosol, rate of exhalation of aerosol virus, direction of airflow, and wake effects will have major effects on actual infection numbers.

would be expected to deactivate virions significantly [38] , but the extent this occurs at ozone levels of aircraft lacking catalytic units is unknown. One must also weigh ozone causing a possible increase in host susceptibility and worse course of disease [39] , another unknown. Consequently, we believe risk, per our study criteria, to be low on aircraft outside deplaning, but worth continued attention.

Examining literature questioning whether influenza is transmitted by aerosol, it appears a major question is the distance at which aerosol transmission of influenza occurs, and we contend that such transmission varies greatly with conditions. There is also a proposal that vitamin D hormone is a regulator of seasonal influenza incidence in the context of questions raised about influenza's fundamental epidemiology [10] .

In the example of Han et al. [9] the researchers state that no aerosol transmission occurred because interview data indicated that the 9 infected parties out of 31 tour group members all either talked to or were coughed on directly by the index case over a 3 day period. (Aircraft infections in Han are left aside for the reasons discussed above.) Noting that in a warm, humid environment contact transmission would be the expected primary mode, a guess can be hazarded in light of the current study. What the temperature, relative humidity or ventilation characteristics were for the indoor environments of this tour group are not known with precision. A best guess of aerosol expectation based on bus data for comparable outdoor conditions in the current study derived a low of 1 infection (7 hours, 40% G7 risk) and a high of roughly 5 -6 infections (7 hours, 100% G7 risk, poor ventilation roughly doubling infections). (Better estimates would depend on actual T and RH, ventilation and other factors.) Leaving aside the reliability of interviews, the droplet (non-aerosol per Brankston et al. [8] ) doses administered by talking and coughing (presumably at close range) will drop off quickly with distance due to conditions and dilution. And depending on RH, those droplets may evaporate into aerosol.

A few aerosol infections out of the 9 could easily be missed by the Han methodology due to overlap (i.e. a person who talked to the index case could be infected by aerosol). Whether there is significance to there being 2 to 9 times the number of infections guessed depends on more details than are available. Given the caveats, contact could account for the majority of cases in this example as could aerosol.

The concerns of Lemieux et al. [7] and Brankston et al. [8] as to whether aerosol influenza infection is significant hinge on a number of matters. Primary among these is what aerosol transmission means, as defined in the differentiation of droplets ¥5 mm and aerosol §5 mm. We find Tellier's response to Lemieux et al. compelling [40] . To it, we add several notes.

We believe that influenza is transmitted both by contact and by aerosol. The conversion of droplets ¥5 mm to smaller size varies based on humidity and we reiterate Tellier's point that studies have shown viable virus after hours suspended in air [25, 27] . Tropical temperature and humidity does not block transmission by contact, but does block transmission by aerosol [17] . Since it has long been observed that influenza epidemics are muted in the tropics, and they die out in temperate summers, this argues that aerosol transmission is necessary to sustain a rise in R 0 above 1 in large populations.

A number of studies have presented data showing an inverse correlation between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-hD) levels and upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) and questions raised about influenza epidemiology [10, [41] [42] [43] . 25-hD level has been proposed as the seasonal factor for influenza epidemics by correlating 25-hD level inversely with influenza season. That these groups maintained a differential year round is evidence in its favor as a factor and 25-hD has been shown to positively modulate mucosal immunity [44] .

Notably though, summer URTI incidence is roughly half of winter for all groups; also, the least protected group (10 ng/ml of 25-hD) in summer had approximately 25% lower URTI incidence than the protected group (30 ng/ml of 25-hD) had in winter. Additionally, influenza spikes can occur in October and November when 25-hD levels are reported relatively high [45] . Thus, 25-hD is a probable influence but whether it is sufficient in itself to explain seasonality is at most an open question. Vitamin A (present in cod liver oil with 25-hD for some studies) may also be a significant factor since vitamin A shows a strong influence on measles [46] , which is another enveloped virus spread by aerosol. Such factors need continued study in order to include them properly in our understanding and epidemiological models.

The present study presents a view of influenza epidemiology that needs to be carefully considered, as it can potentially explain certain apparent anomalies of influ- 

Given the results of this survey and analysis of literature data, we recommend the following to help mitigate the spread of influenza in the broader context of recommending that influenza epidemiological studies try to account for and report temperature and RH data of indoor enclosed locations to the extent this is practical.

Digital psychrometers cost on the order of $100 to $160 in single quantities (larger purchases may be possible at lower cost). Based on visualizing the data collected, steps can be taken to attempt to either move higher risk environments in the direction of lower aerosol transmission risk, or else direct the use of other measures in those environments. A chart (Figure 1 ) should be inexpensive to distribute.

Luxury buses deserve special attention, as they cross borders and travelers spend upwards of 4 hours in the environment. The close quarters of these vehicles' recirculating air are a good opportunity for aerosol transmission of influenza (and other respiratory diseases).

Vendors to luxury buses represent the potential to be superspreaders of influenza, visiting many buses, speaking and moving systematically through the bus for periods of time per bus from 2 to 45 minutes, spending totals of hours per day in buses in multiple visits. Vendors also have direct contacts with passengers, increasing their chances of acquiring and then transmitting infection. Superspreaders were important for the SARS epidemic, showing an unexpected distribution of infectors [33] and probably are for influenza. Bus companies distributing masks and hand sanitizer to vendors to protect them may yield benefits.

Public health can educate maintenance staff of luxury hotels, newer malls (small and large), offices, dining establishments, banks, and colleges about caring for their environmental settings during a flu season. For those locations that have a need to portray an image of higher status, and hence comfort, how to balance that is a question for HVAC engineers.

Based on our examination, we think that influenza transmission on aircraft is probably a not a serious risk most of the time, as discussed above, although the passenger numbers are quite large. Most of the risk appears to be off the aircraft, although wake effects can be troublesome, and T and RH may regulate whether wake effects can occur. Lacking viability data for the humidity range common on aircraft, how that works is clearly an open question. However, since the period starting when passengers stand up after landing to emptying the aircraft does fall within our parameters and is quite short, it may be an insignificant cost for airlines to flush cabin air from the end of the runway after landing until passengers leave the aircraft to further lower transmission risk on aircraft.

Public health relative to other disease and temperature vs. RH Many viruses and bacteria will display viability conditions opposite to influenza. Endemic disease threat such as M. tuberculosis should be weighed since TB is correlated with tropical climates [47] , suggesting its aerosol transmission is optimum in high RH and warm temperature. TB is a hardy organism that forms culturable aerosol from coughing [48] but the aerobiology of transmission is not well explored [47] . Guinea pig model TB transmission studies in parallel with influenza exploring variations of temperature and RH relative to HEPA filtration and ultraviolet light as recommended by Nardell and Piessens [47] would be desirable. The TB concern indicates that in TB endemic regions humidity lower than 60% should be targeted on the transmission contour map (Figure 1 ). There are also commonalities between other measures that can minimize influenza aerosol contagion and measures against TB and other microbial aerosol (such as UV irradiation of upper air [49] ).

Climate control for enclosed spaces should be added to public health to control influenza epidemics. The range between 20% and 80% RH covers most human habitation outside of aircraft, and the region above 80% RH appears to be a low transmission risk, although both these regions should be explored. In the tropics, getting an indoor facility out of the region of highest risk should be simple and low or no cost. In temperate regions, controlling AC to stay out of the optimum transmission region may be more challenging. At a minimum, the low or no cost step of changing climate control parameters should not raise the R 0 (reproductive number) of an influenza epidemic and will lower it considerably if seasonal influenza transmission is any guide. The authors hope for further refinement; however, this is an inexpensive starting point with highly probable benefits, which should be a net savings for nations. For those who perform epidemiological studies, analyzing data in light of temperature and relative humidity will help our understanding of influenza epidemiology.

"Bayesian inference of transmission chains using timing of symptoms, pathogen genomes and contact data","There exists significant interest in developing statistical and computational tools for inferring 'who infected whom' in an infectious disease outbreak from densely sampled case data, with most recent studies focusing on the analysis of whole genome sequence data. However, genomic data can be poorly informative of transmission events if mutations accumulate too slowly to resolve individual transmission pairs or if there exist multiple pathogens lineages within-host, and there has been little focus on incorporating other types of outbreak data. We present here a methodology that uses contact data for the inference of transmission trees in a statistically rigorous manner, alongside genomic data and temporal data. Contact data is frequently collected in outbreaks of pathogens spread by close contact, including Ebola virus (EBOV), severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB), and routinely used to reconstruct transmission chains. As an improvement over previous, ad-hoc approaches, we developed a probabilistic model that relates a set of contact data to an underlying transmission tree and integrated this in the outbreaker2 inference framework. By analyzing simulated outbreaks under various contact tracing scenarios, we demonstrate that contact data significantly improves our ability to reconstruct transmission trees, even under realistic limitations on the coverage of the contact tracing effort and the amount of non-infectious mixing between cases. Indeed, contact data is equally or more informative than fully sampled whole genome sequence data in certain scenarios. We then use our method to analyze the early stages of the 2003 SARS outbreak in Singapore and describe the range of transmission scenarios consistent with contact data and genetic sequence in a probabilistic manner for the first time. This simple yet flexible model can easily be incorporated into existing tools for outbreak reconstruction and should permit a better integration of genomic and epidemiological data for inferring transmission chains.","Introduction Inferring chains of transmission in an infectious disease outbreak can provide valuable epidemiological insights into transmission dynamics, which can be used to guide infection control policy. For example, reconstructed outbreaks have been used to identify drivers of ongoing infection [1] , characterize heterogeneous infectiousness in a population [2] , evaluate the effectiveness of interventions [3] and determine transmission mechanisms [4] . Consequently there has been increased interest in developing statistical and computational tools for inferring such 'transmission trees' from various types of data, including times of symptom onset, contact tracing data, spatial data and, increasingly frequently, pathogen whole genome sequence (WGS) data [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] .

Most state of the art outbreak reconstruction tools aim at approximating a posterior distribution of likely transmission trees in a Bayesian MCMC framework. Two major approaches have emerged, which can be defined by their treatment of genetic data [14] . The 'pairwise approach' begins with a model of disease transmission and attaches to this a genetic model that describes the pairwise genetic distance between putative transmission pairs [6] [7] [8] [9] . The 'phylogenetic approach' uses genetic data to infer the unobserved history of coalescent events between sampled pathogen genomes in the form of a phylogenetic tree and infers transmission trees consistent with this phylogeny using epidemiological data. Such methods either use a fixed phylogeny inferred a priori [10, 15] or jointly infer the phylogeny alongside the transmission tree itself [11] [12] [13] .

These methodologies differ in their ability to identify unobserved or imported cases, accurately describe evolutionary behavior in the presence of multiple dominant strains within-host or incomplete transmission bottlenecks and accommodate multiple genetic sequences per host. However, a notable similarity between these studies is the fact that they generally only consider temporal and genetic data. Accordingly, such approaches rely heavily on highly informative genetic sequence data for identifying likely transmission pairs, as temporal data is generally consistent with a large number of potential ancestries [16] .

However, WGS are not always informative of the transmission route of an epidemic. Firstly, genetic diversity across most outbreaks is low and a significant portion of genetic sequences expected to be identical [17] , most prominently if the pathogen genome is small (e.g. human influenza [18] ), the mutation rate low (e.g. Mycobacterium tuberculosis [19] ), or the generation time (delay between primary and secondary infection) short (e.g. Streptococcus pneumoniae [20] ). In these cases, transmission pairs cannot be accurately identified by genetic data alone, resulting in an overall poorly resolved transmission tree. The informativeness of genetic sequence data is also limited by complex evolutionary behavior. Didelot et al. demonstrated that realistic genetic models accounting for within-host diversity, in which several strains coexist inside a host and can be transmitted and sampled, place significant uncertainty around ancestry allocation even when genetic diversity across the outbreak is high, as multiple transmission scenarios are consistent with the genetic data [15] . Pathogens displaying significant within-host diversity include those with long periods of carriage (e.g. Staphylococcus aureus [21] ) or a propensity for super-infections (Streptococcus pneumoniae [22] ). WGS is also uninformative of the direction of transmission between donor-recipient pairs if multiple sequences per host are not available [23] . Finally, WGS will generally not be available for all infected individuals, especially in resource poor settings. In the 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa, for example, sequences were collected in only 5% of cases [24] . Genetic data is therefore frequently of limited use in reconstructing transmission trees, and inference methods that rely heavily on it will perform poorly in such circumstances.

Integrating other types of outbreak data is therefore necessary for inferring transmission trees in realistic outbreak situations. A frequently collected and highly informative source of data on likely transmission routes is contact data, an integral component of early outbreak response that describes the network of reported contacts with infected individuals. Contact data provided most of the information used to reconstruct transmission chains during Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) [25] , Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) [26] and Ebola [1, 27, 28] epidemics, and is routinely collected in outbreaks of HIV [29] and Tuberculosis [30] . Contact data can be classified as 'exposure' data and or 'contact tracing' data. Exposure data describes contacts between a given case and their potential infectors and is an intrinsic part of case definition in diseases with person-to-person transmission. Contact tracing data describes contacts between confirmed/probable cases and individuals they could have infected: it is used for active case discovery and rapid isolation and is an integral part of containment strategy. Importantly, both types of contact data potentially contain information on the topology of the transmission tree.

Here, we introduce a model which exploits contact data alongside dates of symptom onset, information on the incubation period (delay between infection and symptom onset) and generation time, and pathogen WGS to reconstruct transmission chains. Our methodology extends the outbreaker model introduced by Jombart et al. [6] with a contact model that accounts for partial sampling and the presence of non-infectious contacts between cases. As an improvement over other approaches, the integration of a full contact model reduces the reliance on high quality genetic data for accurate inference. We evaluate the performance of this new model and compare the value of the different types of data for inferring who infects whom, using a variety of simulated outbreak scenarios. We then apply our approach to the early stages of the 2003 SARS outbreak in Singapore, integrating the available data on contact structures and genome sequences in a single statistical framework for the first time. The inference tool presented in this study is freely available as the package outbreaker2 for the R software [31] .

We tested our new model on simulated outbreaks of two pathogens with well-defined epidemiological and evolutionary parameters, namely EBOV and SARS-CoV [27, 32] . As SARS-CoV WGS generally contain greater genetic diversity between transmission pairs and are therefore more informative of transmission events than Ebola WGS [17] , we describe contrasting outbreak settings where the added value of incorporating contact data may vary. Outbreaks were simulated using empirical estimates of the generation time distribution, the incubation period distribution and the basic reproduction number R 0 (i.e. the average number of secondary infections caused by an index case in a fully susceptible population [33] ). To reflect observed heterogeneities in infectiousness, outbreaks were simulated under strong super-spreading tendencies, where a small number of individuals account for a high number of cases [2, 25, 34] . Genetic sequence data was simulated using estimates of the genome length and genome wide mutation rate.

To describe contact tracing efforts in various outbreak scenarios, contact data was simulated using two parameters (for a full description of the model, see Methods). Briefly, the probability of a contact being reported is described by ε, the contact reporting coverage. Noninfectious mixing between cases that obscures the topology of the underlying transmission network is described using the non-infectious contact probability λ, defined as the probability of contact occurring between two sampled cases that do not constitute a transmission pair. A useful corollary term to λ is the expected number of non-infectious contacts per person, ψ, as this accounts for the size of the outbreak and describes the amount of non-infectious mixing in terms of numbers of contacts.

We investigated the effect of the coverage of contact tracing efforts and the probability of non-infectious contact on our ability to reconstruct transmission trees using using a grid of values for ε and ψ. The informativeness of different types of outbreak data was determined by reconstructing each outbreak four times, using combinations of times of sampling (T), contact tracing data (C) and genetic sequence data (G): T, TC, TG and TCG. For an example of a simulated transmission network, contact network and reconstructed transmission tree, see S1 Fig. Transmission tree reconstruction was essentially impossible using only times of sampling, with on average only 9% and 10% of infectors correctly identified in the consensus transmission tree for EBOV and SARs-CoV outbreaks, respectively (Fig 1) . Statistical confidence in ancestry allocation as defined by the average Shannon entropy of the posterior distribution of potential infectors for each case, for which a value of 0 indicates complete posterior support for a given ancestry and higher values indicates lower statistical confidence, was also low (S2 Fig) . Including genetic data improved both the accuracy of inference and the statistical confidence in these assignments. However, even in the idealized scenario of error free sequencing and WGS for all cases, this data was insufficient for complete outbreak reconstruction under our genetic likelihood, with on average only 29% and 70% of transmission pairs correctly inferred in in EBOV and SARS-CoV outbreaks, respectively.

Incorporating contact tracing data using our new contact model improved the accuracy of transmission tree reconstruction across all simulations, with the magnitude of improvement dependent on the values of ε and ψ (Fig 1) . Unsurprisingly, accuracy of inferred ancestries increased with coverage ε, as a greater number infectious contacts were reported, and decreased with the number of non-infectious contacts ψ, as these reduced the proportion of contacts informative of transmission events. In the idealized scenario of complete contact tracing coverage and zero non-infectious contacts, outbreaks were reconstructed with near perfect accuracy, even in the absence of genetic data, with the few incorrectly assigned ancestries attributable to misinformative sampling times. Encouragingly, improvements in accuracy persisted in more realistic contact tracing scenarios with partial coverage and large numbers of non-infectious contacts. For example, consider the contact tracing scenario with only 60% coverage and on average two non-infectious contacts per person. When adding this data to the purely temporal outbreaker model, the accuracy in reconstructing EBOV outbreaks increased from 9% to 44%. Though more than half of ancestries remained incorrectly assigned, outbreaks were in fact reconstructed with greater accuracy than when using WGS from Ebola cases, for which accuracy was only 28%.

When comparing the informativeness of contact data and genetic data across all simulations, we found that information on contact structures was frequently equally or more informative than fully sampled and error-free genetic sequence data, even under limitations of partial coverage and significant levels of non-infectious contact (Fig 2) . For example, contact data with only 40% coverage and 4 non-infectious contacts per person was as informative as fully sampled Ebola genetic data. Similarly, if the reporting coverage was 100%, contact data was as informative as Ebola WGS even when individuals reported 10 non-infectious contacts with other cases on average, meaning that only 17% of reported contacts represented true transmission pairs. Though contact data was generally less informative than SARS-CoV WGS in most scenarios, it still provided comparable increases in accuracy when coverage was high (ε > 0.6) and contact of non-infectious contact low (ψ < 2).

As expected, accuracy of outbreak reconstruction was highest when using contact, temporal and genetic data at the same time. Notably, contact data was able to correct a significant portion of ancestries falsely assigned using only temporal data and WGS. For example, incorporating contact data with 80% coverage and 2 non-infectious contacts per person lead to an increase in average accuracy of outbreak reconstruction from 28% to 79% for EBOV outbreaks ( Fig 1) . Contact data therefore contained significant additional information on likely transmission routes not available from pathogen WGS, which was successfully integrated in our inference framework.

In addition to the transmission tree itself, we inferred the model parameters ε and λ under uninformative priors and observed accurate estimates of the simulated values for both EBOV and SARS-CoV outbreaks (S3 and S4 Figs). When using temporal and contact data, the mean posterior estimates of ε and λ across 100 outbreaks were generally distributed around the true simulated value, and with low variance especially when the coverage ε was high. Only when λ was high were the estimates slightly off-centered from the true value. Including genetic data improved parameter inference across all scenarios, resulting in correctly centered estimates with a reduced variance. ε and λ are therefore identifiable in our contact likelihood and generally well estimated by our inference framework, allowing appropriate probabilistic weighting of contact data in the allocation of ancestries.

We applied our method to the early stages of the 2003 SARS outbreak in Singapore, for which dates of symptom onset, whole genome sequences and contact information were collected for Inferring transmission chains from temporal, genetic and contact data the first 13 cases [35, 36] . Previous attempts to infer the transmission tree from these data either reconstructed probable lineages by manual inspection [35, 36] , or entirely discarded information on the six reported contacts between cases [6, 37] , even though they were all thought to be epidemiologically significant [36] .

Using outbreaker2, we were able to infer the range of transmission histories consistent with the temporal, genomic and contact data in a probabilistic manner. We analyzed the outbreak several times using different settings; with and without contact data and using different priors on λ (Fig 3) . Under the assumption that the reported contacts were very likely to be epidemiologically relevant, by fixing the non-transmission contact rate λ at 1e-4, contact data significantly changed the posterior distribution of ancestries (Fig 3B and 3C ). As expected under these assumptions, transmission links in line with reported contacts were better supported. For example, the most likely infector of cases sin2677 and sin2774 was sin2500 when including contact data (Fig 3C) , instead of sin2748 in the default analysis ( Fig  3B) . Even though these transmission events were less likely under the genetic likelihood, as they implied the accumulation of 2 and 3 mutations, respectively, rather than 1 and 2 mutations, these ancestries were supported by the contact data and were therefore credible under our model. Importantly, the original transmission pathway inferred in the absence of genetic data (sin2748 infecting sin2677 and sin2774) also remained plausible. Further novel infection routes supported by contact data were sin849 infecting sin848, and sin848 infecting sin852.

However, not all ancestries supported by contact data received significant posterior support. Even though sin849 was in contact with and therefore a likely infector of sin848, sin847 remained the consensus ancestor of sin848 with 78% posterior support, as it is separated from sin848 by only 1 mutation, which is far more favorable under the genetic likelihood compared to the 7 mutations separating sin849 and sin848. Furthermore, though sin850 and sin848 had a reported contact, an infectious relationship between the two received no posterior support due to the large number of mutations (10) separating the two. Therefore, while the contact model generally provided support for transmission histories in line with epidemiological observations of contacts, each ancestry allocation was the result of weighing the evidence provided by all three, potentially conflicting, data sources.

Interestingly, incorporating contact data in our analysis affected ancestry allocations not directly referenced in the contact network. For example, sin848 was suggested as a novel infector of sin847 with 22% posterior support, though these cases are not linked by a reported contact. This is explained by a change in the inferred infection times (S5 Fig). sin848 infecting sin852, as suggested by the contact data, resulted in an earlier inferred infection time for sin848, which in turn made it a plausible infector of sin847. A similar change in the inferred infection times of sin2500 and sin2748, driven by the contact data, reversed the directionality of their consensus infectious relationship, even though this directionality was not provided in the contact data. Incorporating the contact model alongside the genetic and temporal model therefore allowed for high level interactions, beyond simply providing support for ancestries indicated in the contact data.

We also analyzed the dataset using a weaker prior on λ (Beta(1, 10)) and an uninformative prior. However, the resulting posterior ancestries were essentially identical to those inferred in the absence of contact data (S6 Fig). We then reconstructed the outbreak under the assumption that all reported contacts necessarily occurred between direct transmission pairs by fixing λ at a value of 0 ( Fig 3D) . The posterior distribution of transmission networks therefore spanned the contact network, with 6 of the 12 ancestries remaining fixed. This rigid topology of plausible transmission networks resulted in low variance among the remaining ancestries, producing essentially a single posterior tree. Notably, this analysis proposed several new ancestries (sin2679 to sin842, sin842 to sin847 and sin848 to sin850) rejected with a λ value of 1e-4 and had a substantially lower average log-likelihood (-647.4 compared to -579.2). Therefore, while the assumption that λ was 0 may have been valid, this approach forced the algorithm to accept ancestries highly unlikely under the genetic and temporal likelihoods, thereby preventing a meaningful integration of different data sources. B) The outbreak was reconstructed using temporal and genetic data. Arrows represent posterior ancestries between cases, scaled in width by the posterior frequency of that ancestry. Ancestries with a minimum posterior frequency of 0.01 were included. The color of a node corresponds to the median posterior infection time of that case. C) The outbreak was reconstructed using temporal, contact and genetic data, and the non-infectious contact probability λ fixed at a value of 1e-4. D) The outbreak was reconstructed using temporal, contact and genetic data, and the non-infectious contact probability λ fixed at a value of 0.

The methodology described here represents, to our knowledge, the first outbreak reconstruction framework integrating contact data alongside the timing of symptom onset, reporting rates and pathogen WGS data. Using simulations, we have shown how contact data can improve epidemiological inference across a range of outbreak settings, including incomplete contact tracing coverage, significant amounts of non-infectious contact and strong superspreading tendencies. By integrating contact data in the analysis of early stages of the 2003 Singaporean SARS outbreak for the first time, we have illustrated how our approach can work in a realistic outbreak scenario and provide a probabilistic description of plausible transmission routes in the face of conflicting outbreak data. The general applicability of our model, in addition to being implemented in a freely available and well-documented software package, makes outbreaker2 useful to a broad epidemiological audience.

Our work reduces the reliance of outbreak reconstruction tools on WGS data. This is significant when considering that genetic diversity in many pathogens arises too slowly to resolve a significant portion of transmission pairs by genetic means [17] , and that within-host genetic diversity of other pathogens hinders accurate transmission tree reconstruction from genetic data [38] . Furthermore, sequencing pathogen genomes from enough cases in an outbreak to resolve individual transmission events is frequently unrealistic in the face of logistical and financial limitations [24] . In contrast, contact tracing is routinely conducted during outbreak response, and therefore provides a valuable additional window of information on transmission events without placing an additional burden on field epidemiologists. Indeed, given the simulation model and likelihoods used for inference, our work suggests that even incomplete contact tracing data may be more informative than fully sampled, error-free genetic sequence data of some pathogens.

Methodologically, our contact model differs from previous methods for relating contact data to epidemiological processes, with several advantages [39] [40] [41] . Soetens et al. estimate effective reproduction numbers by assigning transmission links on the basis of contact data, while accounting for right censoring of case counts [39] . However, they assume complete sampling of contacts and cases, and automatically designate confirmed cases with a known contact as transmission pairs. This is equivalent to fixing λ at a value of 0 in our model, which our analysis of the SARS dataset has shown is unsuitable for integrating other types of data in a meaningful manner. Similarly, Hens et. al. restrict transmission pairs to those supported by reported contacts [40] , thereby mis-assigning ancestries if contacts are only partially reported.

Jewell and Roberts establish a more statistically rigorous approach for epidemiological inference from contact data by explicitly modelling the contact process that drives the infectious process in an SINR compartmental framework [41] . Such a mechanistic model natively relates epidemiological processes to a set of observed contact data and has the advantage of potentially accommodating complex contact structures caused by non-random mixing in the future. However, a prospective model of this sort is considerably more complex to develop in a statistically tractable manner and has necessitated the assumption of a single index case, whereas multiple infectious introductions are easily accounted for in our contact likelihood. Furthermore, their approach does not explicitly model under-reporting of contacts, and therefore does not allow valuable prior information on the coverage of the contact tracing effort to inform the analysis. Our approach is therefore applicable to a wider range of realistic outbreak settings.

Incorporating this contact model alongside a temporal and genetic model represents an improvement over previous, ad-hoc methods to data integration, which generally use contact data to exclude transmission links and then explore the remaining transmission tree space using other data [42, 43] . By modelling contact tracing as a probabilistic process in a Bayesian framework, information on the contact tracing effort can also be embedded in the prior to improve the inferential process and more explicitly describe the assumptions underlying it. For example, if most contacts in an outbreak are expected to have been reported, the prior on the contact reporting coverage ε can be shifted to provide greater support for higher values, reducing support for ancestries that lack a contact. ε could even be fixed at a value of 1, meaning a reported contact is required for a given transmission pair to be inferred, given the assumption that every contact has been reported. Similarly, as shown for the 2003 SARS outbreak, an informative prior on the non-infectious contact probability λ should generally be used. As most contact tracing efforts are conducted under the belief that non-transmission pairs experience contacts with significantly lower probability than transmission pairs, the prior on λ should provide support for lower values, in turn placing greater weight on reported contacts when assigning ancestries.

Our method also allows conflicting data to be treated in a systematic manner, as demonstrated by the analysis of the the 2003 SARS outbreak, where several ancestries were supported by contact data yet separated by an implausibly large number of mutations. In contrast to existing tools [6, 35] , outbreaker2 can evaluate these inconsistencies and determine the distribution of likely transmission trees under multiple data types. While not necessarily improving the accuracy of the inferred transmission tree, our approach better captures the uncertainty around these ancestry assignments given the available data.

However, it is important to note both the intrinsic informational limitations of contact data as well as the methodological limitations of the work presented here. Contact tracing constitutes a significant logistical challenge, as most if not at all infected individuals must be followed up, and suspected cases monitored past the upper end of the incubation period distribution [44] [45] [46] . The coverage of contact tracing efforts conducted in low resource settings may therefore be low [47] , and consequently poorly informative of the transmission network (Fig 1) . Even if a significant proportion of contacts are reported, a high degree of mixing between cases can obscure the topology of the underlying transmission network, for example within hospital wards or classrooms. Contact data alone will therefore not always suffice for complete reconstruction of an outbreak. Nevertheless, the framework presented here allows even minimally informative contact data to be incorporated into transmission tree inference alongside other available data.

Furthermore, the use of strong priors on ε and λ may be required to ensure adequate weighting of contact data, especially in the face of conflicting genetic data as shown in the analysis of the 2003 SARS outbreak. While our framework forces an explicit description of these assumptions, the sensitivity of the algorithm outputs to the prior distributions should be noted and explored adequately.

Our model of epidemiological contacts also makes a number of simplifications, some of which could be improved upon in future work. As the contacts are undated, the model does not consider that they are only indicative of transmission events if they occur during the infectious period of the infector, potentially resulting in overconfident ancestry assignments if contacts frequently occur outside this time period. However, as epidemiologists generally only record meaningful contacts occurring within likely windows of infection, the assumption that recorded contacts represent epidemiologically plausible transmission pairs appears reasonable. As currently implemented, our model also does not account for different weights between contacts, which could be useful for example to stratify different types of sexual intercourse by their risk of HIV transmission [48] , or TB contacts by their duration of contact (e.g. household vs. casual). However, it could be easily extended to do so by using separate parameters for the reporting coverage (e.g. ε 1 , ε 2 , ε 3 ) and non-infectious contact probability (e.g. λ 1 , λ 2 , λ 3 ) of each type of contact. Furthermore, the contact model is undirected and treats exposure data and contact tracing data equally, resulting in a loss of information about the potential directionality of the infectious interaction which must instead be inferred from other data. Directionality could be incorporated with relative ease by treating reported contacts as asymmetric (individual i contacting individual j is distinct from j contacting i) and relating this to the infector-infectee relationship in the putative transmission tree (I infecting j is distinct from j infecting I). However, the current model generally inferred directionality successfully from temporal data simulated under realistic delay distributions (Fig 1) .

It should also be noted that the use of fixed generation time and incubation period distributions is poorly suited to epidemic scenarios with highly connected contact networks, for which hazard-based approaches are more suitable [49, 50] . However, as demonstrated in Fig 1, contact data is only informative when the contact network itself is fairly sparse (i.e. λ is low). The assumption of fixed generation time and incubation period distributions is therefore suitable for the use cases of our contact model [10, 13, 51] .

Finally, the assumptions underlying the pairwise genetic model should be considered when using outbreaker2. The likelihoods of pairwise genetic distances are treated as independent, when in fact they are dependent on the underlying infectious relationships between cases (e.g. the genetic relatedness of case A and its infector B is dependent on the infector of B). Similarly, by considering only genetic distances, our method disregards histories of shared mutations between genomes. These assumptions can result in loss of information and potential misinterpretation of genetic signals, especially when evolutionary histories are complex [38] . In such cases, character-based, phylogenetic models should be considered [10, 11] .

In conclusion, the work presented here provides a simple yet flexible methodology for integrating contact data with genetic and temporal data in the inference of transmission trees. By allowing contact data to complement and/or substitute genetic data as the primary source of information on infectious relationships between individuals, our work increases both the scope and accuracy of methodologies for outbreak reconstruction.

Our work is an extension of the outbreaker model developed by Jombart et al. [16] , re-written in a manner to be more extensible This model considers, for each case I (i = 1, . . .,N), the probability of a proposed transmission history given the time of symptom onset t i and a pathogen genetic sequence s i (Table 1) . Assumptions on the temporal relationship between transmission pairs are given by the generation time distribution w, defined as the distribution of delays between infection of a primary and secondary case, and the incubation period distribution f, defined as the distribution of intervals between infection and symptom onset of a case. w and f are assumed to be known, and not estimated during the inference process.

The unobserved transmission events are modelled using augmented data; case i is infected at time T i inf , and its most recent sampled ancestor denoted α i . To allow for unobserved cases, the number of generations separating i and α i is explicitly modelled and denoted κ i (κ i � 1). The proportion of cases that have been sampled is defined by the parameter π and is inferred as part of the estimation procedure. The other estimated parameter is the mutation rate μ, measured per site per generation of infection.

This model is embedded in a Bayesian framework. Denoting D the observed data, A the augmented data and θ the model parameters, the joint posterior distribution of parameters and augmented data is defined as:

The first term describes the likelihood of the data, the second term the joint prior (for a complete description of both, see Jombart et al. [6] ). Briefly, the likelihood is computed as a product of case-specific terms, and can be decomposed into a genetic likelihood O 1 , a temporal likelihood O 2 and a reporting likelihood O 3 .

The genetic likelihood describes, for a given case i, the probability of observing the genetic distance between sequence s i and that of its most recent sampled ancestor s αi , given the proposed ancestries and parameters:

and is defined as:

This calculates the probability of d(s i ,s j ) mutation events occurring at the observed nucleotide positions and no mutations occurring at the remaining positions, while summing over the κ i generations in which the mutations could have occurred. For a full derivation of this likelihood, see S1 Text. The temporal likelihood describes the probability of observing the time of symptom onset and proposed time of infection:

and is calculated as: Inferring transmission chains from temporal, genetic and contact data w κ = w � w � . . . � w, where � is the convolution operator and is applied k times. The first term describes the probability of the imputed time of infection under the incubation period distribution. The second term describes the probability of observing the delay between infection times of the case and its most recent sampled ancestor under the generation time distribution, over the imputed number of generations. The reporting likelihood describes the probability of unobserved intermediate cases:

and is calculated as:

where NB is the probability mass function of the negative binomial distribution, and describes the probability of not observing κ i -1 cases given a probability of observation of π.

To integrate contact data into outbreaker, we developed a method for modelling contact data from transmission trees (Fig 4) . The model considers undated, undirected, binary contact data, such that the contact status c i,j is set to 1 if contact is reported between individuals i and j and set to 0 otherwise. The model is hierarchical and describes two processes: the occurrence of contacts and the reporting of contacts. Transmission pairs experience contact with probability η. This formulation accounts for the possibility of transmission occurring without direct contact, for example by indirect environmental contamination as is observed with Clostridium difficile [52] . Sampled, infected individuals that do not constitute a transmission pair experience contact with probability λ, the non-infectious contact probability. Contacts that have occurred, either between transmission pairs or non-transmission pairs, are then reported with probability ε, the contact reporting coverage. Contacts that have not occurred are reported with probability z, the false positive reporting rate. We make two assumptions to simplify this model, which can be relaxed in future work if necessary. Firstly, we assume that direct contact is necessary for transmission and set η to 1. Inferring transmission chains from temporal, genetic and contact data Furthermore, we assume that false reporting of contacts that have not occurred is negligible and set z to zero. This model allows us to define a contact likelihood O 4 , describing the probability of observing the contact data C (a symmetrical, binary, NxN adjacency matrix with zeros on its diagonal) given a proposed transmission tree and parameters ε and λ. Formally, for individual i:

kÞ Using the contact model described in Fig 4 and the simplifying assumptions made above:

For a mathematical description of the unsimplified model, see S2 Text. The updated joint posterior distribution is therefore proportional to the product of the four likelihood terms and the joint prior:

PðA; yjDÞ / pða; m; p; �; lÞ

The prior distributions are assumed independent, such that:

pða; m; p; �; lÞ ¼ pðaÞpðmÞpðpÞpð�ÞpðlÞ

The prior on ancestries p(α) is uniform, and the prior on the mutation rate μ exponentially distributed. π, ε and λ represent probabilities and are assigned Beta distributed priors with user-defined parameters, to allow flexible specification of previous knowledge on the sampling coverage, contact reporting coverage and non-infectious contact probability.

Transmission trees and genetic sequence evolution were simulated using the simOutbreak function from the R package outbreaker. To describe heterogeneities in infectiousness within a population, well-documented in both EBOV [34] and SARS-CoV [25] outbreaks, and capture consequent 'superspreading' events, in which a small portion of the population accounts for a large number of infections, we described the 'individual reproductive number' R i , a variable describing the expected number of secondary cases caused by a particular infected individual [2] . Following previous studies by Lloyd-Smith et al. [2] and Grassly and Fraser [53] , we assumed R i to be Gamma distributed with a mean of R 0 and a dispersion parameter k, with lower values of k indicating greater heterogeneity in infectiousness. The resulting offspring distribution is a negative binomial [2] .

Estimates of the generation time distribution, R 0 , mutation rate and genome length were taken from a literature review described by Campbell et al. [17] Estimates of the incubation period distribution and dispersion parameter of R i were drawn from the literature ( Table 2) .

Generation time distributions and incubation period distributions were described by discretized gamma distributions, generated using the function DiscrSI from the R package EpiEstim [54] .

Contact data was simulated from transmission trees using the model described in Fig 3 , using a grid of values for the reporting coverage (ε ∊ [0, 1]) and the number of non-infectious contacts per person (ψ ∊ [0, 10], λ ∊ [0, 0.18]). For a mathematical description of the relationship between ψ and λ, see S3 Text. At each grid point, 100 outbreaks were simulated, with a single initial infection in a susceptible population of 200 individuals. Simulations were run for 100 days, or until no more infectious individuals remained. The first 60 ancestries of each outbreak were reconstructed four times using the R package outbreaker2, using combinations of times of symptom onset (T), contact data (C) and WGS (G): T, TC, TG and TCG. For each analysis, one MCMC chain was run for 10,000 iterations with a thinning frequency of 1/50 and a burn-in of 1,000 iterations. The prior distributions used for ε and λ were uninformative (Beta(1,1) ), and default priors used otherwise.

The accuracy of outbreak reconstruction was defined as the proportion of correctly assigned ancestries in the consensus transmission tree, itself defined as the tree with the modal posterior infector for each case. The uncertainty associated with an inferred ancestry was quantified using the Shannon entropy of the frequency of posterior ancestors for each case [68] . Given K ancestors of frequency f K (k = 1, . . .,K), the entropy was defined as:

Thirteen previously published [35, 36] and aligned [6] SARS whole genome sequences were obtained for our analysis. Data on epidemiological contacts were described by Vega et al. [36] . The same generation time distribution and incubation period distribution used for the analysis of the simulated SARS outbreaks were used ( Table 2) . As the number of non-transmission contacts was assumed to be low and a total of 6 contacts were reported in an outbreak of 13 cases, the proportion of contacts reported was believed to be about 50%. The prior on ε was therefore chosen as Beta (5, 5) . Several priors on the non-transmission contact rate λ were tested; Beta(1, 10), Unif(0, 1), a fixed value of 0 and a fixed value of 1e-4. The priors on the mutation rate μ and proportion of cases sampled π were uninformative. The MCMC chain was run for 1e7 iterations with a thinning frequency of 1/50 and a burn-in of 1,000 iterations. green lines correspond to transmission pairs, red lines to non-transmission pairs. Dashed green lines represent contacts between transmission pairs that were not reported. C) The outbreak was reconstructed using temporal and genomic data, and the consensus transmission tree, describing the modal posterior infector for each case, determined. Green lines correspond to correctly inferred ancestries, red lines to incorrectly inferred ancestries. The accuracy of outbreak reconstruction was 46%. D) The outbreak was reconstructed using temporal, genomic and contact data, with an accuracy of 94%.

Transmission patterns and evolution of respiratory syncytial virus in a community outbreak identified by genomic analysis,"Detailed information on the source, spread and evolution of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) during seasonal community outbreaks remains sparse. Molecular analyses of attachment (G) gene sequences from hospitalized cases suggest that multiple genotypes and variants co-circulate during epidemics and that RSV persistence over successive seasons is characterized by replacement and multiple new introductions of variants. No studies have defined the patterns of introduction, spread and evolution of RSV at the local community and household level. We present a whole genome sequence analysis of 131 RSV group A viruses collected during 6-month household-based RSV infection surveillance in Coastal Kenya, 2010 within an area of 12 km 2 . RSV infections were identified by regular symptom-independent screening of all household members twice weekly. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the RSV A viruses in nine households were closely related to genotype GA2 and fell within a single branch of the global phylogeny. Genomic analysis allowed the detection of householdspecific variation in seven households. For comparison, using only G gene analysis, household-specific variation was found only in one of the nine households. Nucleotide changes were observed both intra-host (viruses identified from same individual in follow-up sampling) and inter-host (viruses identified from different household members) and these coupled with sampling dates enabled a partial reconstruction of the within household transmission chains. The genomic evolutionary rate for the household dataset was estimated as 2.307 Â 10 À 3 (95% highest posterior density: 0.935-4.165Â 10 À 3 ) substitutions/site/year. We conclude that (i) at the household level, most RSV infections arise from the introduction of a single virus variant followed by accumulation of household specific variation and (ii) analysis of complete virus genomes is crucial to better understand viral transmission in the community. A key question arising is whether prevention of RSV introduction or spread within the household by vaccinating key transmitting household members would lead to a reduced onward community-wide transmission.","Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a leading viral cause of acute respiratory illnesses (ARI) worldwide (Haynes et al. 2013) , with the virus infecting 5-10% of the world population annually (Falsey et al. 2005) resulting in an estimated 3 million hospitalizations of children aged under 5 years (Nair et al. 2010 ) and more than 160,000 deaths across all age groups each year (Nair et al. 2010 ). An important epidemiological feature of RSV disease is its highly seasonal patterns in communities (Stensballe et al. 2003) . Globally, RSV disease occurs as recurrent annual epidemics that peak during the winter in temperate climatic regions but shows less consistent timing in the tropical or subtropical climatic regions (Stensballe et al. 2003; Haynes et al. 2013) . No licensed RSV vaccine exists but several candidates are in development with some in phase three trials (Higgins et al. 2016) . Infection prevention and treatment are currently limited to passive immunoprophylaxis, case isolation, and supportive care (Drysdale et al. 2016) .

RSV belongs to family Paramyxoviridae and its genome is a nonsegmented single-stranded negative-sense RNA molecule ($15,200 nucleotides long) that encodes eleven viral proteins (in the order NS1-NS2-N-P-M-SH-G-F-M2 (1 and 2)-L). Two genetically and antigenically distinct RSV groups are recognized (A and B) whose local predominance alternates over successive epidemics (Mufson et al. 1985; Cane 2001 Cane , 2007 . Based on phylogenetic analysis of the immunogenic and variable attachment (G) gene (Johnson et al. 1987) , at least eight genotypes (and several variants within these genotypes) have been identified within each of the two groups (Peret et al. 1998 (Peret et al. , 2000 Agoti et al. 2015a ). Analysis of RSV strains detected in several parts of the world found that RSV epidemics frequently comprise multiple genotypes (and variants) but locally a single genotype normally predominates an epidemic with periodic replacement in successive epidemics (Cane et al. 1992; Peret et al. 1998 Peret et al. , 2000 Agoti et al. 2015a; Otieno et al. 2016) .

Improved understanding of RSV epidemiological patterns, transmission chains, and mechanism of persistence in host populations can help with infection control (Munywoki et al. 2014; Agoti et al. 2015a) . Information on the origins of RSV seed strains for local epidemics, hubs of virus transmission, and spread patterns during outbreaks is limited (Nokes and Cane 2008; Munywoki et al. 2014; Agoti et al. 2015a) . Detailed molecular analyses of RSV strains sampled during epidemics have the potential to elucidate these patterns (Agoti et al. 2015a and 2015b) . However, such studies to date have primarily used samples collected from hospitalized individuals, representing a small and biased proportion (<1%) of all RSV infections during epidemics (Cane 2007) . Community-based studies of RSV are rare (Munywoki et al. 2014) . As a result, many aspects of RSV transmission, spread, and survival in the settings where majority of the infections occur remain unknown.

RSV surveillance in Kilifi County, located in coastal Kenya, has been ongoing since 2002 with a continuous hospital-based arm and intermittent community-based arm (Nokes et al. 2004 (Nokes et al. , 2009 Munywoki et al. 2014; Agoti et al. 2015a ]. Recently, we reported the RSV infection epidemiological findings from a cohort of forty-seven households followed over one epidemic season (Munywoki et al. 2014) . Consistent with previous findings in developed countries (Hall et al. 1976 ) school-going children were found to be frequent introducers of the virus into households (Munywoki et al. 2014) . Infection spread in the households was confirmed by group matching (typing into RSV A and B) and nucleotide comparison of the G gene (Munywoki et al. 2014) . However, efforts to map transmission chains by combining the date of sampling and G sequence results showed limited success due to low phylogenetic signal from this short fragment (Munywoki 2013 (Munywoki , 2014 .

The intensive sampling regime during the household study provides an opportunity to uncover RSV transmission and evolution patterns in community epidemics. We recently showed that analysis of the relatedness of G gene sequences identified within and between epidemics can distinguish virus strains newly introduced into the community from those locally persisting (Agoti et al. 2015a) . We also pointed out that a large fraction of RSV strains collected from local epidemics possess identical or highly similar G sequences (Agoti et al. 2015a; Zlateva et al. 2004; . This illustrated the challenge of low phylogenetic resolution in undertaking detailed tracking of RSV transmission in a community by analyzing G gene sequences alone (Munywoki et al. 2014) . However, when we compared full genomes of G identical strains, nucleotide differences were found occurring outside the G region (Agoti et al. 2015b) . Thus, increasing the examined sequence length can provide muchneeded additional phylogenetic resolution for monitoring virus transmission over short times (Cotten et al. 2013) .

The analysis reported here investigated RSV A transmission in a community setting, the source of seed viruses and genomic diversification in a subset of samples collected during the household cohort study (Munywoki et al. 2014) . We assessed the strength of the phylogenetic signal provided by analyzing the individual RSV genes versus for the whole genome sequences in tracking RSV transmission and the relatedness of the household viruses to contemporaneous strains across the world (Do et al. 2015) . Further, due to the close monitoring of this cohort we were able to observe changes occurring at the consensus genome level intra-and interhost during household transmission of RSV. In this report we show the utility of whole genome sequencing in defining RSV transmission, persistence, evolution and spread in households and at the local community level.

The household study was undertaken within Kilifi County of Coastal Kenya in two local administrative units located to the north of the Kilifi Health and Demographic Surveillance System (KHDSS) (Scott et al. 2012) . A household (HH) was defined as group of people living in the same compound and eating from the same kitchen (Munywoki et al. 2014 ). The area is primarily rural, with a number of small markets and the key economic activities include small-scale crop and animal farming, fishing and tourism. Overall, the county experiences a tropical climate with bimodal annual rainfall pattern: main rains April-July and shorter rains October-December. Annual RSV epidemics in this region, as recorded through surveillance in the Kilifi County Hospital (KCH), typically start in October-December of one year and continue to June-August of the following year (Agoti et al. 2015a; Nokes et al. 2009 ). The GPS locations of study households were recorded and entered in a confidential database. These addresses were validated in Google Earth and then visualized in QGIS v2.2 program (http:// www.qgis.org/en/site/) overlaid with regional amenities data including local schools and main roads, Fig. 1 . The sampled households occurred within an area of approximately 12 km 2 .

A detailed description of the household study design was provided in previous publications (Munywoki et al. 2014 (Munywoki et al. , 2015a (Munywoki et al. , 2015b . Briefly, 47 households were recruited and closely followed up over a 6-month period between December 2009 and June 2010 to document all respiratory virus infection episodes. Twice weekly throughout the observation period, a nasopharyngeal-flocked swab was obtained from every household member regardless of the symptoms status. More than 80% of the planned samples were collected (Munywoki et al. 2014 ). The specimens were screened for a range of respiratory viral nucleic acids including RSV using multiplex real-time RT-PCR method (Gunson et al. 2005) . A cycle threshold (Ct) of 35.0 or below was considered indicative of infection with the associated virus. In the current analysis all RSV A positive samples (187 RSV A mono-infected and 12 RSV A-B co-infected) from a select 13 households of the 47 were processed for whole genome sequencing and analysis, Table 1 . These households were prioritized for analysis because RSV infection (group A or B) was detected in more than one member within a week suggesting a household RSV infection outbreak. The specimens had been collected between March and May of 2010 from 63 subjects. The arising sequence data were analyzed both independently and together with sequence data of RSV A strains from other countries deposited into GenBank.

The samples analyzed in this study were collected following an informed written consent from each individual participant if aged !18 years or through a guardian or parent if aged <18 years and all children assented to participate. The study protocol was reviewed and approved by both the Scientific and Ethics Review Unit (SERU) of the Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI), Nairobi, and Coventry Research Ethics Committee, UK (Munywoki et al. 2014 ).

RNAs were extracted from raw nasal specimens using the QIAamp viral RNA extraction Kit following the manufacturer's instructions (QIAGEN Ltd, London, UK). Complementary DNA (cDNA), PCR amplification and nucleotide sequencing of RSV genomes were performed as previously described (Agoti et al. 2015b) . Briefly, the RSV genome was amplified as six overlapping fragments, which were henceforth pooled and used to prepare Illumina NGS libraries. These were subsequently sequenced using Illumina MiSeq, multiplexing 15 to 20 samples per run, to generate approximately 1-1.5 Million paired-end reads (150 bp Â 2) for each sample.

Raw sequence data from MiSeq were de-multiplexed into sample specific readsets and processed in QUASR (Watson et al. 2013) to remove low quality reads (median Phred score of <35) and primer and adapter sequences at the end of the individual reads. The resulting reads were de novo assembled using the SPades Program v3.5.0 (Bankevich et al. 2012 ) into contigs, examined for completeness of the expected open reading frames and, where necessary, partial contigs were further combined using Sequencher v5.0.1. To avoid errors due to crosstalk between multiplexed samples only contigs with a median read coverage of > ¼500 were used. Genomes with gaps (< 500 nucleotides) were joined with a series of ambiguous nucleotides (Ns) using the most complete genome from the same household as a guide for inferring the length of the gap. Multiple Sequence Alignments (MSA) were generated in MAFFT v6.83 (Katoh et al. 2002) .

Nucleotides at polymorphic positions on the genomes were checked as follows: A sequence alignment for each household was generated (all sequenced viruses) and any nucleotides showing variation from the group were directly examined. For each observed variant site, a 21-nucleotide (nt) motif spanning the variant nucleotide (normally at the center but adjusted for variants near the termini) was prepared. The frequency of these 21-mers (both forward and reverse complement sequences) in the quality-controlled short read data was then determined using a modified grep script Cartman.py (available at https:// github.com/mlcotten/RSV_household_scripts) using ack (http:// beyondgrep.com/why-ack/) and the majority nucleotide kept. In addition, all indels were directly examined and all ambiguous nucleotides (R, Y, S, W, M, K) were resolved by a similar direct read counting and with the ambiguous nucleotide replaced by the absolute majority nucleotide. In cases of a position having 2 or more variants with equal counts, the nucleotide variant present in the majority of the genomes from the study was used.

A total of 131 virus genomes for which the assembly yielded contigs >5000 nucleotides long were included in the analyses (i.e. gene-by-gene and whole genome analysis). These genomes were derived from 9 households. Of the 131 genomes, 103 were > 14000 nt in length with fewer than 500 ambiguous nucleotides (henceforth referred to as genomes, the only set considered in the whole genome analysis level). The alignment of the full genome was trimmed to include only sequence region covered by all genomes to maximize homology. The aligned sequences were analyzed for recombination using the RDP4 program and no recombination was detected (Martin et al. 2015 ).

Three data sets were prepared for comparison with the household study viruses. First, 11 G gene reference sequences, one for each of the known RSV A genotypes (GA1-7, SAA1-3 and ON1) were prepared and used for genotyping the household viruses on the basis of phylogenetic clustering. Second, 275 RSV A G sequences collated from GenBank that were sampled from different countries across the world between 2009 and 2010 and also from the Coastal Kenya in-patient surveillance at the KCH (Otieno et al. 2016 ) were prepared and used for determining the number and a probable source of the virus variants that seeded the household infection outbreaks. The third set included 354 nearly complete RSV A genomes retrieved from GenBank. These, inclusive of only genomes with information on country of origin, date of sampling and no recombination detected, were used to determine the global phylogenetic placement of the household viruses genomes.

Phylogenies were generated from the nucleotide alignment of both whole genomes and from the excised individual genes. The trees were reconstructed using Maximum Likelihood (ML) method in either MEGA v5.22 (Tamura et al. 2011) or PhyML v3.1 program (Guindon et al. 2010) . The best-fitted models of nucleotide substitution for each alignment were determined in IQ-TREE v1.4.3 (Nguyen et al. 2015) . All gene-specific ML trees were inferred in MEGA under HKY85 model bootstrapping for 1,000 replicates. Whole genome ML trees were inferred in PhyML v3.1 under GTR þ C 4 model of substitution, with 1,000 bootstraps. A bootstrap value of >70% was considered as statistically significant.

The potential transmission networks within and between households were inferred in PopART package v1.7.2 (http:// popart.otago.ac.nz/index.shtml). The networks were reconstructed using median joining trees (MJT) method with an epsilon of zero.

The household viruses were genotyped by phylogenetic clustering pattern of their G ORF region with reference G sequences. Representative sequences of all known RSV A genotypes (GA1-7 & ON1) were included. A genome was assigned to a particular genotype if its G sequence clustered with the genotype reference sequence within the same branch with > 70% bootstrap support. To understand the evolution and transmission history of the identified viruses within the same genotype, the sequences were further typed into variants. Viruses were defined as same variant if their divergence was estimated to have occurred no more than a year before their date of collection and this helped identify independent virus introductions into the study area. We inferred these by considering the number of nucleotide differences observed in the G ectodomain region for virus pairs as recently described elsewhere (Agoti et al. 2015a ). This method asserts that 4 or more nucleotide differences between viruses in the G ectodomain indicates a distinct virus variant, a criterion that takes into consideration the fragment length, substitution rate and time interval between the samples (Agoti et al. 2015a ). The number of variants was also confirmed by the relatedness of the household viruses in the presence of contemporaneous background diversity from multiple countries across the world (Agoti et al. 2015a) . A cluster was defined as a group of viruses that do not meet the distinct genotype or variant threshold rules but fall within one tree branch with a bootstrap support of > 50%.

The temporal signal in nucleotide divergence of the household viruses was estimated in TempEst v1.4 (Rambaut et al. 2016 ) using a ML whole genome tree as input. The evolutionary pattern and time to the Most Recent Common Ancestor (tMRCA) of the obtained whole genome sequences were determined in BEAST v1.8.2 under HKY85 model of substitution, (uncorrelated) lognormal relaxed molecular clock and Gaussian Markov random field (GMRF) population skyride (Minin et al. 2008; Drummond and Rambaut 2007; Drummond et al. 2012) . The Metropolis Coupled Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MC-MCMC) chain length was set to 50 Million steps sampling after every 2500 steps. The output was examined in Tracer v1.6 (http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/tracer/), with a 10% burn-in removal, to confirm run convergence (i.e. if the estimated 

The sequence nomenclature on the phylogenetic trees is country of origin (_sample source for Kilifi indicating if sampled from inpatient (IP) or household (HH))/Unique identifier/Date of specimen collection. The unique identifier for household samples includes the household identifier (first two digits) and subject identifier (the last two digits). All new sequences from this study were deposited in GenBank under the accession numbers KX510136-KX510266.

The baseline characteristics of the households yielding RSV A positive samples and details on the number of genomes obtained per household are given in Table 1 . Nucleotide changes were observed across the entire RSV genome (Fig. 2) in the 8 households with more than one genome sequenced. Within individual households, the number of nucleotide changes between virus genomes was variable and ranged from 0-17 nucleotides. Of the 131 specimens yielding contigs of >5000 nt, 120 from 10 households yielded an intact G coding sequence (CDS) and all these belonged to genotype GA2 and the closely related sub-genotype NA1 (result not shown). These household genomes formed a single monophyletic group within genotype GA2 on the global phylogeny (Fig. 3) that was most closely related to GA2 genotype viruses from Coastal Kenya that had been sampled from young children admitted to KCH in the years 2009 and 2010 [15] . Further, the entire set of RSV A viruses from the households fell within a single variant definition as also determined by their clustering of the G gene genomic region in the global G-gene phylogeny ( Supplementary Fig. S1 ).

A time-resolved phylogenetic clustering of the 103 household study genomes (Fig. 4, panel A) revealed that all viruses clustered by household of origin, except for those from households 26, 38 and 57. This pattern was also observed with a ML phylogeny ( Supplementary Fig. S2 ) and MJT network that showed household-specific clustering of viruses as well as a varied level of the interconnection of viruses within and between households (Fig. 4, Fig. S2 ). However the virus genome obtained from 26 th March appeared on a lone branch suggesting a second introduction of a genetically varied virus. Genomes from households 14 and 29 were interspersed within the same viral cluster. Household 6 provided only one genome.

In contrast to the genome-based phylogeny, when considering individual gene ORFs, the resolution was reduced and fewer household-specific distinct clusters were identified compared to the full genome analysis. ML phylogenetic clustering of the sequenced viruses by ORF is shown in Supplementary Fig. S3 (whole genome phylogeny included for comparison purposes, panel xi). When we considered the G gene alone (901 nt), just one household had a distinct virus cluster (HH 31); the remaining clusters included viruses from multiple households. Similarly reduced resolution was obtained with the F gene (1727 nt) with only two household-specific clusters (HH 6 and 40), the nucleoprotein (N) gene (1200 nt, with also only two household-specific clusters (HH 5 and 40) and with the L gene (7915 nt), four household-specific clusters were observed (HH 5, 6, 31 and 40). For comparison, the full genome analysis showed seven household specific clusters.

The spatial distribution of the nine households is shown in Fig. 1 . The geographical distance between the study households ranged from 302 to 3925 meters. There were a variable number of nucleotide differences across the genomes distinguishing clusters of viruses found in one household from the next (range 2-16), Fig. 4 , panel B. The RSV A infection was first detected in household 40 (on 15 th February) followed by 29 (21 st February), 14 (1 st March), 57 (3 rd March), 5 (9 th March), 26 (11 th March), 31 (30 th March), 6 (9th April) and finally household 38 (19 th of April). For some of the study households, the infection periods overlapped. Notably, both HH 14 and 57, being the closest households in geographical distance ($300 meters apart), had the first RSV infections detected in the first week of March (2 days apart) and virus strains were phylogenetically close when compared to strains from most other households we analyzed ( Fig. 4 and Supplementary Fig. S2 ). This scenario was also observed with HH 6 and 38 ($400 meters apart). Although these two cases were consistent with the hypothesis that physical distance modulates virus transmission and spread, there were household pairs that showed a contrary relationship, for example some members of household 14 and 29 gave multiple identical full genome sequences despite the two households being 1715 meters apart. Statistical analysis of the entire household dataset did not find a linear relationship between physical and genetic distance for this dataset (R 2 ¼ 0.01686).

We reconstructed a plausible virus transmission chain between the household members by combining the genetic data with sampling dates. As examples we show analysis for HH 14, a sixmember household (Fig. 5) and household 38, a 23-member household ( Supplementary Fig. S4 ). In household 14, of the 18 RSV positive samples identified in this household, 14 assembled into contigs >5000nt and 12 gave near complete genomes. From the sample collection dates, we inferred that the individual designated 1404 introduced the virus into this household since this individual was the only virus positive person in this household on the 1 st March (Fig. 5, panel A) . Subsequently, the other household members designated 1401, 1402 and 1403 became virus positive within a week after the identification of individual 1404 RSV positivity. The genome data were consistent with individual 1404 (index case) infecting individuals 1402, 1403 and 1401 being identical or displaying only one nucleotide difference across their genomes, Fig. 2 , Panel C. Each of the individuals 1405 and 1406 had both only a single virus positive sample collected on 15 th March (two weeks after first sample from the index case). Sequencing was unsuccessful with the sample from individual 1405. However, the sample from 1406 had one or two nucleotide changes compared with all genomes in this household. The virus from individual 1406 was genetically closest to virus from individuals 1402 and 1404 but it is more likely that 1406 acquired the infection from individual 1402 who showed prolonged virus shedding. It is also important to note that some viruses identified in household fourteen were identical to those observed in household twenty-nine thus we could not exclude a second introduction of the virus into this household.

Individual 1402 was virus positive for the longest period (39 days) compared to other members in this household, Fig. 5 , Panel A. Interestingly, the positive sample collected on the 15 th April came after several samples collected between 20 th March and 13 th April had tested RSV negative. The virus from 1402 on 15 th April had 3 nucleotide substitutions that distinguished it from all the other viruses sampled from this household, Fig. 5 , Figure 2 . Nucleotide differences between viruses (total ¼ 130) detected within the individual households. Each panel is a single household. The viruses were compared to the earliest virus genome sequenced from the same household. Vertical colored bars show the nucleotide differences. Red is a change to T, orange is a change to A, purple is a change to C and blue is a change to G. Grey is a deletion or an non-sequenced portion of the genome. Household six is excluded as only a single genome sequence was obtained. A python script to generate this figure is available at https://github.com/mlcotten/RSV_household_scripts. Asterisk mark has been placed next to major branches with a bootstrap support of >70%. panels B and C. This scenario could have arisen due to: (i) another virus introduction into the household or (ii) a virus rebound (recrudescence) from initial infection in this individual after accumulating these changes. Combining the genome sequence and temporal diagnostic information we inferred the transmission chain presented in Fig. 5 , panel D, for this household.

TempEst analysis estimated that the MRCA for the household viruses occurred in December 2009 and their evolutionary rate was 4.948 Â10 À 3 sub/site/year. Notably, the R squared value for the linear model was 0.29 indicating the stochastic nature of variation observable in this limited time period. Different households had differing levels of diversity with only limited temporal relationship to this variation ( Supplementary Fig. S5 ). Using BEAST program, the date of the MRCA for the household dataset was estimated to be 3 rd Jan 2010 (95% HPD: 1 st November, 2009 to 31 st Jan, 2010), corresponding to the beginning of the Kilifi 2009/10 RSV epidemic season. This date was consistent with a single virus variant leading to the RSV A infections in all nine analyzed households. The BEAST-inferred genomic evolutionary rate for the household viruses was estimated as 2.307 Â 10 À 3 (95% HPD: 0.935Â 10 À 3 to 4.164 Â 10 À 3 ) sub/site/

year. This was about 5 fold higher compared to previous estimates for data derived across epidemics (Agoti et al. 2015b ). While synonymous nucleotide (dS) changes were found in RSV encoded proteins, non-synonymous nucleotide (dN) changes were observed in only 7 of the 11 RSV proteins (NS2, SH, G, F, M2-1, M2-2, L) with the highest number of dN changes observed in the L protein region (11 independent changes). The NS1, N, P and M were totally conserved at the amino acid sequence level. A summary of the amino acid changes observed between the household genomes for all the ORFs are shown in Table 2 . The F protein had the third highest number dN changes (most of these affecting 27-mer amino acid domain (pep27)). Changes in the G protein were spread throughout its length but outside of the central conserved cysteine noose region. All the household genomes contained six highly conserved N-glycosylation sites within their F protein, at positions 27,70,120, 126 and 500. Also six completely conserved N-glycosylation positions were found within the G protein: 85, 103, 135, 251, 273, and 294. All the household viruses were observed to encode uniform F and G protein lengths, 574 and 297, respectively.

Our knowledge of RSV transmission in the community, evolutionary patterns and 'who acquires infection from whom' (WAIFW) is incomplete (Agoti et al. 2015a; Munywoki et al. 2014) . Close contacts within households, workplaces, worship places, market places and other social gathering avenues may provide opportunities for respiratory virus transmission (La Rosa et al. 2013) . However, there is little evidence beyond temporal patterns of case occurrence to support that households are a major environment of RSV transmission (Munywoki et al. 2014; Hall et al. 1976 ). Viral genetic data can provide evidence to support epidemiological linkage of household RSV infected cases and to discount other sources of the infection. Our findings support the hypothesis that RSV transmission within households is common as members belonging to the same household were infected with closely related strains, in terms of genomic sequence than viruses found in members from different households. Specifically, household-specific genomic variation was observed in seven of the nine households where we compared associated genomes. Only two households shared a genetically identical strain at full genome level. Notably, this between-household phylogenetic resolution was lost when examining the individual genes (including the G gene), as genetic variations between the sequenced viruses were random and distributed throughout their entire RSV genomes such that examining greater sequence lengths linearly increased the phylogenetic resolution achieved.

The genomes of all the household study viruses fell within a single branch on the global phylogeny and G gene analysis suggested that all the nine households were infected by a single virus variant that had entered into this community. Due to limited contemporary sequences from other parts of Kenya or Africa, it was not possible to identify close ancestors of this variant (Agoti et al. 2015a ). Furthermore, it was not possible to infer the directions of household-to-household transmissions or pathway of the spread of infections reported here, because only a minority of the households in the study area were sampled. However, some of the households that were physically close happened to be infected by viruses that were also phylogenetically close. This is consistent with the idea that occupants of neighboring households are more likely to come into close contact during daily activities for example journeys to fetch water, to markets and clinics. It is also more likely that children in physically close households go to the same school, which are thought to be respiratory virus transmission hubs.

Within two individual households (HH 38 and 57), we observed higher genomic variation. We hypothesize three possible sources for this variation: (1) multiple virus introductions into these households, (2) co-infection of the index case with multiple genetic variants, and (3) diversification of a single virus in the process of replication and transmission through the members of the households. Some of the households had clearer evidence of multiple virus introductions (e.g. household fifty-seven) and this may be a result of factors that cannot be comprehensively investigated from our limited sampling. However, further analysis of these data including inspection of the minor variant populations is necessary to provide additional illumination (Hughes et al. 2012; Grad et al. 2014; Do et al. 2015) . It is also possible that some of the observed changes simply reflected PCR and/or sequencing errors. However this is highly unlikely especially where nucleotide changes were observed at the same exact genomic position in multiple samples from the same household or individual despite their independent sample processing (Cottam et al. 2008) . Also, importantly, only contigs with high read depth (> = 500) were included into our analysis.

The variation of genomes within households aided in identifying members who are likely to have shared an infection source or sequentially transmitted the infection from one to the other (e.g. the chains inferred for household fourteen and thirty-eight). However, it was not possible to elaborate in complete detail the transmission chains within most households even after considering these genomic data. This was partly due to incomplete sequencing (some samples had too low virus load) and also due to fact that the evolutionary rate of the virus was sometimes too low to provide a useful signal. This is likely to be caused by the highly infectious nature of RSV once introduced into a household setting resulting in overlapping infection generations before distinct nucleotide changes accumulate.

The evolutionary rates calculated at genome level from the household outbreak were significantly higher than rates derived from long-term data (Tan et al. 2012 (Tan et al. , 2013 Agoti et al. 2015b; ) . Our findings support the notion that evolutionary rates for viruses are highly context-specific and decrease when calculated from long-term sampling data (Duchene et al. 2014 ). This may reflect that deleterious mutations occurring during shortterm transmission (and observed in the higher frequency sampling) that are purified from the virus population in the longer term. Multiple nucleotide changes were observed across RSV genome but some genes remained completely conserved at the amino acid sequence level. Although it is unlikely that the amino-acid substitutions observed represented adaptive evolution during short-term transmission of the virus, it will be worthwhile to further investigate their significance in allowing virus survival or escape from pre-existing immune responses.

Among respiratory viruses, viral genetic data have been previously utilized for influenza A viruses to define within and between household virus spread. Sequencing of hemagglutinin and neuramidase genes of 2009 pandemic H1N1 viruses found occurrence of only limited genetic diversity for viruses derived from different households early during the outbreak and diversity was negligible for viruses derived from same households (Thai et al. 2014) . Deep sequencing of household viruses from Hong Kong revealed that genetic variation was more similar within than between households and associated information on minor variant sharing helped confirm transmission events (Poon et al. 2016) .

For RSV, our study is the first of its kind using full genomic data to define patterns of its transmission in a community setting. Using temporal infection data alone, it has been previously concluded that young children are most likely to introduce RSV infection into households (Hall et al. 1976; Munywoki et al. 2014; Heikkinen et al. 2015) and the genetic data provided here support this conclusion. Within household RSV transmission has never been inferred to the detail described here. The Table 2 . Amino acid changes in the household viruses' genomes by encoded protein.

Our study shows that patterns of shared virus strains between households can vary by the gene analyzed, but it is possible to separate almost all households as infected by a distinct virus strain by analyzing full genome sequences.

We are aware of limitations in this study. First, sampling in the households only reached $85.6% of the planned level with gaps mostly occurring in adults (Munywoki et al. 2014 ). Thus, it is possible that we missed important samples in inferring the transmission chains. Second, a significant proportion (34.2%) of the samples failed amplification, especially those with low viral load, hampering the reconstruction of transmission chains. However, this difficulty is common to all such studies (Memish et al. 2014; Bose et al. 2015 ) . Third, PCR and sequencing errors were not completely modeled into the interpretation of our data (Orton et al. 2015) . Despite our analytical stringency, it is possible that some of the nucleotide changes we observed could be artifacts especially those occurring in single genomes only. Fourth, we only analyzed a small proportion of households in the study area and important information such as contact patterns and school attendance were not factored into the analysis. This made it difficult to infer the broader community transmission pathways and exclude multiple sources of identical virus into a household.

In conclusion, our study has shown that the analysis of genome sequences provides better phylogenetic resolution in tracking RSV spread compared to analysis of small partial sequences including the highly variable G gene. Although whole genome analysis alone could not resolve every step in the transmission chains within households, the information derived distinguished many of the between-household transmission links and suggested clear epidemiological linkage of infections of some household members. The findings are consistent with a large percentage of RSV transmissions occurring within the household and thus infection control at the household level should be considered in RSV disease control. Future studies should include mathematical modeling to combine whole genome analysis (both consensus and minor variants data) with other epidemiological information (e.g. symptoms onset, viral load, immunity, social contact patterns, etc.) to allow mapping of WAIFW with regard to RSV spread within households.
