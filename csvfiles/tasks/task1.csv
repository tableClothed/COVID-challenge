Environmental Conditions Affect Exhalation of H3N2 Seasonal and Variant Influenza Viruses and Respiratory Droplet Transmission in Ferrets,"The seasonality of influenza virus infections in temperate climates and the role of environmental conditions like temperature and humidity in the transmission of influenza virus through the air are not well understood. Using ferrets housed at four different environmental conditions, we evaluated the respiratory droplet transmission of two influenza viruses (a seasonal H3N2 virus and an H3N2 variant virus, the etiologic virus of a swine to human summertime infection) and concurrently characterized the aerosol shedding profiles of infected animals. Comparisons were made among the different temperature and humidity conditions and between the two viruses to determine if the H3N2 variant virus exhibited enhanced capabilities that may have contributed to the infections occurring in the summer. We report here that although increased levels of H3N2 variant virus were found in ferret nasal wash and exhaled aerosol samples compared to the seasonal H3N2 virus, enhanced respiratory droplet transmission was not observed under any of the environmental settings. However, overall environmental conditions were shown to modulate the frequency of influenza virus transmission through the air. Transmission occurred most frequently at 23°C/30%RH, while the levels of infectious virus in aerosols exhaled by infected ferrets agree with these results. Improving our understanding of how environmental conditions affect influenza virus infectivity and transmission may reveal ways to better protect the public against influenza virus infections.","Influenza viruses display distinct seasonal patterns in temperate climates with peak infection rates occurring in the winter months and little to no influenza virus activity detected at other times of the year [1] . However, it is not completely understood why we have ""flu seasons"". The same seasonal trends do not necessarily apply to regions in tropic and subtropic climates where influenza virus activity can be detected year round. Social and health factors such as indoor crowding and seasonal fluctuations in host immunity have been offered as explanations for influenza seasonality, but the lack of direct evidence supporting these theories suggests that the environment may be the most relevant contributor and potential driving force of seasonality [1, 2] . Although seasonal influenza viruses display predictable infection patterns, the four most recent influenza virus pandemics began with newly emerged viruses appearing outside the usual influenza season (1918 Spanish Influenza A H1N1, 1957 -1958 Asian Influenza A H2N2, 1968 Hong Kong Influenza A H3N2, 2009 H1N1) [3, 4] . Emergence of the most recent pandemic virus was preceded by reports of sporadic infections of a swine-origin H1N1 virus in young individuals [4, 5] . During the summers of 2010-2014, reports have emerged in the Midwest region of the U.S. of H3N2 variant influenza virus infections in children with a recent history of exposure to swine [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] . These events highlight the importance of closely monitoring emerging strains of influenza viruses throughout the year and the need for our improved understanding of the effects of environmental conditions like temperature and humidity on influenza virus transmission.

There are three generally accepted modes of influenza virus transmission [11] . Aerosol transmission occurs via respirable particles (<5 μm) that may remain suspended in the air for prolonged periods of time thus increasing the opportunity for them to be inhaled. Droplet transmission occurs when larger droplets (>5 μm), typically expelled during coughing or sneezing, encounter the upper respiratory tract or ocular mucosa of a susceptible individual. Lastly, contact transmission involves directly touching an infected host or contaminated surface. The relative contribution of these modes of transmission to the overall spread of influenza viruses and the role of environmental conditions is not completely understood. However, recent studies in human volunteers support a role for aerosols in influenza virus transmission [12, 13] .

Temperature and humidity are inextricably linked when considering their effects on evaporation rates and on infectious particle dynamics [14] . Although the majority of reports of increased virus viability in low humidity have been focused on relative humidity (RH), it has been demonstrated that there is also a relationship between influenza virus seasonality and absolute humidity (AH) [15] . RH is the ratio of water vapor in the air to the maximum amount the air can hold at a particular temperature. AH represents the mass of water vapor present within a unit of air [1, 15] . Previous in vitro studies have demonstrated that influenza viruses in droplets and aerosols maintain viability better at low humidity [16, 17] . Animal models have also been used to address the role of environmental conditions on influenza virus transmission and have shown that low temperature and RH environments support transmission among guinea pigs [18] . The ferret model has become an invaluable tool for evaluating virulence and transmissibility of influenza viruses and is a critical component of risk assessments performed on emerging influenza viruses that pose a risk to public health [19] . To more clearly understand the influence of temperature and humidity on influenza virus in exhaled aerosols and on transmission, we housed ferrets under four distinct environmental conditions and evaluated the respiratory droplet (RD) transmission of two highly transmissible H3N2 influenza viruses: A/Panama/2007/1999 (PN99), a seasonal H3N2 virus, and A/Indiana/8/2011 (IN11), an H3N2 variant (H3N2v), triple-reassortant swine influenza virus containing the 2009 pandemic H1N1 M gene that was isolated from a human in the summer of 2011 [7] . During these transmission experiments, the aerosol particle size distribution and the levels of infectious virus exhaled from infected ferrets were also assessed. Here, we demonstrate that the amount of influenza virus exhaled by infected ferrets and, ultimately, RD transmission are influenced by the temperature and humidity in which the animals are housed. These findings draw attention to the importance of climatic effects on influenza virus transmission and the potential for temperature and humidity to play a role in the emergence of influenza viruses that pose a risk to public health.

All ferret procedures were approved by Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and in an Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International-accredited facility. Animal studies were performed in accordance with the IACUC guidelines under protocol #2234MAI-FERC: ""Transmissibility of influenza viruses with pandemic potential"".

Virus stocks of A/Panama/2007/1999 (H3N2) were propagated in the allantoic cavity of 10 day old embryonated hens' eggs while A/Indiana/8/2011 (H3N2v) was grown in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells (MDCK) as previously described [20] . Titers of virus stocks were determined by standard plaque assay using MDCK cells and are reported as plaque-forming units (pfu)/mL.

Male Fitch ferrets 5-11 months of age (Triple F Farms), serologically negative by hemagglutination-inhibition (HI) assay for currently circulating influenza viruses, were housed during each experiment in cages placed inside a custom environmental chamber (Bahnson Environmental Specialties, Raleigh, NC) with HEPA filtration operating at 20 air changes per hour. Experiments were conducted at four environmental settings with consideration for the comfort of the animals: 5°C/70%RH (4.8 g/m 3 AH); 23°C/30%RH (6.2 g/m 3 AH); 23°C/50%RH (10.3 g/ m 3 AH) and 23°C/70%RH (14.4 g/m 3 AH). Prior to inoculation, ferrets were allowed to acclimatize inside the chamber for at least four days. Baseline temperatures were measured using an implantable subcutaneous temperature transponder (BioMedic Data Systems, Seaford, DE) and baseline serum, weight and minute volume (MV) of respiration measurements were collected as described [20, 21] .

For each virus and each condition, three ferrets were sedated with a ketamine/zylazine/atropine hydrochloride cocktail injection and were presented with 10 3.8 to 10 5.5 pfu of aerosolized virus as described [21] using an aerosol exposure system with an AeroMP management platform (Biaera Technologies, Hagerstown, MD). Inoculations were performed at ambient laboratory temperatures (21±1°C) and at the corresponding experimental RH. Aerosol presented dose (PD) refers to the amount of virus inhaled by the animal, not necessarily the amount that is deposited within the respiratory tract. PD is based on the time of exposure, baseline MV of respiration of the animal and the aerosolized virus concentrations achieved during the exposure session.

RD transmission was assessed for each virus at each of four environmental conditions. Experiments were conducted using animal cages modified with perforated side walls which allow transmission of virus through the air while preventing direct or indirect contact between inoculated and naïve ferrets. Airflow velocity was measured inside the cages housed within the chamber using a hot wire anemometer with a telescopic probe (General Tools, New York, NY) and was found to be negligible (<0.05 m/s) for all of the cages. One day post inoculation (dpi) a naïve ferret was placed in a cage adjacent to each inoculated animal. Nasal washes (NW) were collected every other day for up to 11 dpi or days post contact (dpc) [22] for virus titration by standard plaque assay in MDCK cells [23] . Clinical signs of infection including weight loss, fever and activity levels [22] were recorded daily for inoculated and contact animals. Sneezing frequency in animals was not audible from inside the chamber and therefore was not recorded. MV of respiration was measured on 2, 4 and 6 dpi using whole-body plethysmography (Buxco) in inoculated animals. At the experimental endpoint, ferrets were sedated and euthanatized by injection of a euthanasia agent containing pentobarbital. Transmission was confirmed by seroconversion via hemagglutination inhibition assay using sera collected from animals at least 18 days after exposure.

Three inoculated ferrets from each experiment were anesthetized and exhaled aerosol samples were collected and analyzed for size distribution using an aerodynamic particle sizer (APS; TSI Inc, Shoreview, MN). Aerosol samples were collected from ferrets immediately after exhalation on 2, 4 and 6 dpi for 15 minutes of closed-mouth, normal breathing and for 5 minutes of induced sneezing as described [24] . Size distribution data represent the total particle counts or volumes collected for aerosols with aerodynamic diameters in the range of 0.5-20 μm. Volume data were derived using the DistFit software package (Chimera Technologies).

Exhaled aerosols from inoculated animals were analyzed for infectious virus using a viable two-stage cascade impactor (Tisch Environmental, Cleves, OH) on 1, 3, and 5 dpi as described with modifications [24] . Aerosols were collected from ferrets immediately after exhalation for 15 minutes of normal breathing and 5 minutes of sneezing and separated onto two stages by size (>4.7 μm or 0.65-4.7 μm). Aerosol samples were immediately processed by plaque assay without dilution and RNA extraction for real-time RT-PCR as described [24] . Influenza virus M gene RNA copy numbers were extrapolated using a standard curve based on samples of known virus titer (pfu/mL).

The effects of the aerosol collection procedure on influenza virus recovery was evaluated in duplicate by applying a known amount of virus (10 2 -10 3 pfu) directly on prepared impactor plates and placing the impactor assembly inside the environmental chamber at one of the four environmental conditions [24] . Using a vacuum, air was then pulled through the impactor for 15 minutes or 5 minutes to reflect the collection times for normal breathing or sneezing, respectively. The aerosol collection media was harvested and processed as described for ferret sample collection to determine the percentage of RNA and infectious virus recovered. These recovery rates were used to estimate the amount of virus exhaled by ferrets at all of the time points in which infectious virus was detected.

Linear mixed models were used to estimate the means and differences in means for weight loss and aerosol volume data. Square root transformation of the aerosol volume data was needed to normalize the values. Further, because the weight loss data at any given time point was dependent on the previous time point data collection, a repeated measures model was utilized to estimate the respective means. To best determine the relationship between mean weight loss and ferret housing condition, the following independent variables were included in the model: ferret housing condition and day of weight measurement. For models associated with the aerosol volume data, the independent parameters included were: virus, ferret housing condition, and exhaled aerosol sample size. An interaction term was also included in the model to evaluate whether aerosol volume data varied based on virus, ferret housing condition, and exhaled aerosol sample size. Lastly, a Poisson regression model was used to estimate the means and differences in means for aerosol virus count data. The independent variables in the Poisson models included: virus, ferret housing condition, exhaled aerosol sample size and interaction terms. The interaction terms between independent variables were developed so as to allow for the testing of mean differences between groups or conditions. A p-value of <0.05 was considered significant. Analyses were performed using SAS software version 9.3 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC).

During RD transmission experiments, six ferrets were housed in an environmental chamber set to one of four experimental conditions (5°C/70%RH, 23°C/30%RH, 23°C/50%RH, or 23°C/ 70%RH) ( Table 1 ) and allowed to acclimatize for at least four days prior to each experiment. The temperature and humidity settings were chosen to represent a range of conditions with consideration for the functional limitations of the chamber and the tolerance level of the animals. For each condition, three ferrets were inoculated by aerosol inhalation with 10 3.8 -10 5.5 pfu of PN99 or IN11 virus (Table 1) . One dpi, a naïve ferret was placed in an adjacent cage to an inoculated ferret, each cage with a perforated side wall, allowing for the transfer of Data shown represent infected, contact animals only. c NW, Nasal wash titer (log 10 pfu/mL) ± SD is shown. respiratory droplets through the air while preventing any direct or indirect contact between the animal pairs. Inoculated and contact animals were monitored for clinical signs of infection for up to 11 dpi or dpc to establish differences in morbidity in ferrets housed under each environmental condition.

Regardless of the inoculum, changes in activity levels in infected animals were minor (relative inactivity indexes ranged from 1.0-1.2) while anorexia and nasal discharge were the most common clinical signs observed in ferrets housed at any of the controlled environmental settings. Peak temperatures were detected 2-3 dpi in inoculated animals and ranged from 1.2-2.4°C above baseline for PN99 virus and 1.9-3.3°C above baseline for IN11 virus ( Table 1) . MV of respiration was measured by plethysmography at 0, 2, 4 and 6 dpi for each inoculated animal ( Fig 1A) . Respiration patterns were generally similar for PN99 and IN11 virus-inoculated ferrets housed at any of the environmental conditions with MV peaking 2 dpi for most of the animals and the largest change in respiration of ferrets in the IN11 virus group housed at 23°C/ 30%RH. Mean maximum weight loss in PN99 virus-inoculated ferrets was greatest (15.3-16.5%), although not significantly (p = 0.489), at the lower AH settings. Mean maximum weight loss was more similar across the environmental conditions for animals in the IN11 virus group, ranging from 10.7-13.4% (Table 1 , Fig 1B) . Weight loss observed in animals infected after exposure to inoculated animals (i.e. infected contacts) was not as severe, with mean maximum values 8.7% for all groups ( Table 1 , Fig 1C) , presumably due to differences in dose received by these animals compared to inoculated ferrets. Furthermore, uninfected animals from the transmission experiments exhibited minimal weight loss regardless of housing condition ( Fig 1D) . Together these data show that while the housing conditions alone did not result in considerable weight loss in any of the animals, morbidity in inoculated animals may have been enhanced under certain conditions compared to those animals that were infected from exposure to inoculated ferrets.

RD transmission experiments were performed at each environmental setting to assess the ability of PN99 and IN11 viruses to transmit through the air among ferrets housed under different environmental conditions. Successful transmission was noted when virus was detected in nasal wash samples within 11 dpc and hemagglutination inhibition antibody titers against homologous virus were detected in convalescent serum collected after 18 dpc. Mean peak NW titers ranged from 10 4.2 to 10 4.8 pfu/mL in ferrets inoculated with PN99 virus and were 3-24 times higher (10 5.2 to 10 5.7 pfu/mL) in ferrets inoculated with IN11 virus housed under the respective environmental condition; the greatest difference was observed at the 23°C/70%RH condition ( Table 1, Fig 2) . Virus was first detected in NW samples from all inoculated animals by 1-3 dpi and was cleared by 7 dpi in all PN99 virus-inoculated animals, except for one ferret housed at 23°C/30%RH, and by 9 dpi in all but one ferret in the IN11 virus group housed at 23°C/70% RH (Fig 2) . Overall, levels of virus shedding in NW samples were higher in the IN11 virus-inoculated animals compared to PN99 virus. Linear regression models using area under the curve values were used to determine if any of the environmental conditions served as a significant driving force for the observed differences in NW virus titers between the two viruses. Comparisons made between the virus groups was significant (p = 0.0004) but differences between the conditions was not (p = 0.4243) indicating that any observed differences between NW virus titers at any of the environmental conditions was related more to the virus than to the environmental condition itself. Fig 2) . At 5°C/70% RH, transmission occurred in 1 of 3 ferrets exposed to PN99 virus-infected animals by 3 dpc and no transmission was observed in the IN11 virus contact group. Trace levels of IN11 virus were detected among some animals late in the course of infection but without seroconversion. The frequency of transmission events at 23°C/30%RH was greatest with 2 of 3 ferrets for PN99 virus by 3-5 dpc and 3 of 3 ferrets for IN11 virus by 3 dpc. One of the animals in the pair that One day later, a naïve, contact ferret was placed in a cage adjacent to each inoculated animal. Nasal washes were collected from ferrets every two days for up to 11 days and virus titers were assessed by plaque assay. Solid bars represent data from inoculated ferrets, n = 3, and hatched bars represent contact ferret data. The mean ± SD is shown and the limit of virus detection is 100pfu/mL. Frequency of transmission events is shown as an inset on each panel and represents the number of contact animals that shed virus and seroconverted. did not transmit PN99 virus had an unknown underlying condition that required euthanasia at 7 dpi which may have affected transmission between this pair. At 23°C/50%RH, 1 of 3 PN99 virus-infected animals transmitted virus to a contact animal after 5 dpc while no transmission occurred in the IN11 virus group despite detection of baseline levels of virus 1-3 dpc but without seroconversion. It is not clear why productive infections did not occur in these animals. Transmission was detected by 3 dpc in 2 of 3 ferret pairs at 23°C/70%RH in both the PN99 and IN11 virus groups. Virus was cleared in all contact animals by 11 dpc except for a single ferret housed at 23°C/70%RH that had >10 5 pfu/mL of IN11 virus in the NW sample for that day. Collectively, the frequency of RD transmission events was similar between the two viruses at any of the environmental conditions and transmission occurred least often among ferrets housed at 5°C/70%RH and 23°C/50%RH at 17%, while transmission frequency was highest at 83% under the 23°C/30%RH environmental conditions and was 67% at 23°C/70%RH.

Respiratory secretions exhaled into the air serve as the vehicle for influenza viruses to transmit between hosts in the absence of direct or indirect contact. To assess the effects of temperature and humidity on the size distribution of aerosols exhaled from ferrets infected by PN99 or IN11 virus, an APS was used to measure the aerodynamic diameter of particles present in aerosol samples collected on 2, 4 and 6 dpi from ferrets housed at each controlled environmental condition. Aerosol particle counts in exhaled breath were highly variable among ferrets but, for all animals, peaked in the respirable size range (Fig 3) . During 15 minutes of normal breathing, aerosol particle counts were highest 4 dpi; significance at this time point was found among all ferret groups (p<0.0001) except PN99 virus at 5°C/70%RH and IN11 virus at 23°C/30%RH (Fig 3A) . Overall, particle counts were lowest at the lowest RH condition (23°C/30%RH) (p<0.0001) which is probably because a greater proportion of the aerosol particles are <0.5 μm, below the detection limit of the APS, due to evaporation. During 5 minutes of sneezing stimulation, much more variability was observed between ferrets and between conditions (Fig 3B) . Because aerosols were collected for size distribution analysis on days 2, 4 and 6 postinoculation and nasal wash samples were collected on days 1, 3 and 5 post-inoculation, the kinetics of increased aerosol shedding cannot be linked to the time point at which transmission was observed for each animal. In fact, the highest numbers of aerosol particle counts were measured during normal breathing on 4 dpi in the IN11 virus group housed at 5C/70%RH ( Fig 3A) and no transmission was observed in these animals ( Fig 2B, Table 1 ). Particle counts in sneezing samples were highest at 23C/70%RH for both virus groups but transmission occurred among 67% of ferret pairs at this setting.

To further compare aerosol shedding among environmental conditions, the volume of aerosols <5 μm and 5 μm exhaled by naïve animals was measured and, in general, increased with AH ( Fig 4A) . Volume data from inoculated animals at all time-points after inoculation were normalized to the respective ferret's naïve level of aerosol shedding at each environmental setting and were compared between viruses (Fig 4B and 4C ). Normal breathing sampling showed similar volumes of exhaled aerosols between PN99 and IN11 viruses with the exception of IN11 virus-inoculated ferrets housed at 5°C/70%RH for both aerosol particle size ranges (<5 μm and 5 μm) (Fig 4B) . This increase was primarily represented in the sample collected at 4 dpi (Fig 3A) . Sneezing samples were more variable but still followed a similar trend between virus groups (Fig 4C) . These data indicate that the size distribution of aerosols exhaled by inoculated ferrets did not differ consistently between the PN99 and IN11 virus groups and that the volume of aerosols exhaled by naïve animals generally increased with increasing AH. The overall volume of aerosols collected from ferrets did not appear to be associated with the frequency of transmission events among ferrets housed at the respective environmental settings.

Any successful aerosol transmission event requires that infectious virus pass through the air from a contagious host to a susceptible one. Using methods designed to maintain the viability of infectious virus in aerosols, sampling of the exhaled breath of ferrets was performed and comparisons were made among the amounts of infectious virus exhaled by influenza virus infected ferrets housed under the controlled environmental conditions. Aerosols were collected for 15 minutes of normal breathing and 5 minutes of sneezing and separated into two size ranges (>4.7 μm and 0.65-4.7 μm) on 1, 3 and 5 dpi and then quantified for influenza virus by plaque assay as well as real-time RT-PCR. Infectious virus detected at any time point and in either size range in normal breathing samples was 10 pfu (Fig 5A) and in sneezing samples was 34 pfu (Fig 5B) . The overall normal breathing grand mean values were lowest at 23°C/50% RH (Fig 5A) while other conditions were similar but slightly higher, and little difference was observed between the two size ranges (<4.7 μm and 4.7 μm). With few exceptions, the levels of IN11 virus measured were higher compared to PN99 virus at the respective housing conditions, similar to NW titer comparison results (Fig 2) . Likewise, in most cases, IN11 virus RNA Environmental Conditions Affect Influenza Transmission in Ferrets levels were higher in these samples compared to PN99 virus. This was most evident in the higher humidity conditions during normal breathing ( Fig 6A) and nearly all of the sneezing samples (Fig 6B) .

The impact of the aerosol collection procedure on virus recovery was tested for each controlled environmental condition by spiking the collection medium on each impactor stage with known quantities of virus. After air was pulled through the impactor for 15 or 5 minutes, to represent normal breathing and sneezing sampling times, respectively, the collection medium was harvested and processed as described for the ferret samples. PN99 virus RNA recovery from either stage and for the 15 and 5 minute collection times ranged from 54 to 79%, similar to IN11 virus RNA recovery which was 47 to 81% (Fig 7) . Infectious virus recovery was somewhat more variable at 15 to 62% for PN99 virus and 11 to 37% for IN11 virus. While the recovery rates of RNA illustrate the physical loss of material due to the collection procedure, the loss of infectious virus account for the additional loss due to the inactivation of virus during the collection procedure. However, because virus was applied directly to the gelatin medium, these Environmental Conditions Affect Influenza Transmission in Ferrets recovery rates do not necessarily reflect virus susceptibility to the environmental conditions while in an aerosol state but do serve as a means to more accurately estimate the levels of infectious virus exhaled by ferrets during the sampling sessions. Based on these recovery rates, the total amounts (<4.7 μm and 4.7 μm combined) of infectious virus exhaled by individual animals during 15 minutes of normal breathing peaked between 7 and 42 pfu for PN99 virus and between 50 and 73 pfu for IN11 virus for all of the environmental conditions tested (Fig 8A) . Comparison of mean values between PN99 and IN11 viruses revealed that during normal breathing, regardless of the environmental condition, IN11 yielded greater levels of infectious virus (p = 0.001). Overall, the levels of infectious influenza virus were significantly lower at 23°C/50%RH compared to all other groups (p<0.0001) and 23°C/30%RH was significantly higher than all other groups (p<0.01). As expected, sneezing samples were much more variable, but IN11 virus levels were again higher (Fig 8B) . These findings support those derived from NW titer comparisons and confirm that, although the overall amount of IN11 virus being exhaled was greater than PN99 virus, no single environmental condition we chose for housing animals had a significant influence on virus shedding and ultimately on transmission for one virus compared to the other. However, collectively, influenza virus was exhaled during normal breathing in the greatest amount at the 23°C/30%RH condition and the lowest amount at the 23°C/50%RH condition, the same environmental settings at which RD transmission was most and least frequent, respectively.

The influence that temperature and humidity have on aerosolized influenza virus and the consequence for transmission remain poorly understood despite the potential impact on the seasonality of influenza epidemics in the temperate regions of the world. Climatic conditions in tropical regions of the world represent a different set of parameters affecting transmission, and furthermore, routes of transmission not involving airborne virus (e.g. direct or indirect contact) demonstrate the complexity of global influenza virus transmission and the multitude of potential mechanisms at play each impacted differently by environmental conditions. Here, we Environmental Conditions Affect Influenza Transmission in Ferrets evaluated the transmissibility of two H3N2 influenza viruses (PN99 and IN11) using ferrets housed under diverse environmental conditions and concurrently evaluated the aerosol shedding profiles of infected animals. We compared the two virus groups to each other and then combined them to identify common differences at each environmental condition. Higher levels Environmental Conditions Affect Influenza Transmission in Ferrets of IN11 virus were measured in ferret nasal washes and in exhaled aerosol samples compared to PN99 virus but overall, we found little difference in the transmission capabilities of the two viruses at any of the environmental conditions with transmission most frequently observed at 23°C/30%RH (83%) and least frequently observed at 23°C/50%RH and 5°C/70%RH (17%).

The viruses chosen for this study were selected because one represents a seasonal H3N2 strain (PN99 virus), the other one is a swine-origin H3N2 variant strain (IN11 virus) responsible for a summertime infection [7, 25] and both were previously shown to be highly transmissible in the ferret model under normal laboratory conditions [26] [27] [28] . Since 2011, H3N2v viruses that possess the M gene segment from the A/(H1N1)pdm09 virus have been isolated from humans and have resulted in over 300 cases in the U.S., primarily in the summer months and in children <10 years of age with a recent history of exposure to pigs [9] . In the years preceding the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, swine-origin H1N1 viruses also caused sporadic infections in young individuals at different times of the year, including the summer [4, 5] . This prophetic prelude to the 2009 pandemic stresses the importance of improving our understanding of the transmissibility of H3N2v viruses under different environmental conditions. Epidemiological data suggest that the summertime pattern of H3N2v virus infections is associated with the opportunistic occasion of agricultural fairs that often bring people and pigs together [9] . Individuals 10 years of age and older generally possess some cross-protective immunity to H3N2 viruses providing an explanation for why most of the cases were reported in children under this age [29, 30] . However, because the H3N2v human infections were mainly reported during the summer months, comparisons were made in the current study between PN99 and IN11 viruses to explore the potential for enhanced H3N2v virus transmission in a warm, humid environment compared to a virus known to exhibit typical seasonal infection patterns. Although higher levels of H3N2v virus were detected in nasal washes and aerosols exhaled by ferrets housed at the 23°C/70%RH setting compared to the seasonal H3N2 virus (PN99), no difference in the frequency of transmission was observed for the virus pair, indicating that this H3N2v virus has no enhanced ability to transmit under these conditions. In a previous study using the guinea pig model, transmission of PN99 influenza virus through the air was eliminated when animals were housed at 30°C [31] but it is unclear whether a difference between IN11 and PN99 virus transmissibility would reveal itself under warmer housing conditions in the ferret model. Ferrets are naturally cold weather animals and do not tolerate exposure to extremely warm conditions (26°C) for prolonged periods of time; they are optimally housed at temperatures of 4-18°C and 40-65% RH [32] . Therefore, we chose housing conditions with this in mind and found that none of our conditions (5°C/70%RH, 23°C/30%RH, 23°C/50%RH, 23°C/ 70%RH) resulted in substantial morbidity in uninfected ferrets.

Any successful transmission event through the air requires that virus pass from an infected host to a susceptible one while maintaining infectivity. As this occurs, aerosols are released from the warm, humid environment of a respiratory tract, through the ambient conditions outside of the host and eventually reach the warm, humid environment of a recipient's respiratory tract. Depending on the ambient conditions and the solute composition of the aerosol, evaporation and condensation processes may have deleterious effects on any virus present in the aerosols [16] . Using coughing and breathing simulators in a recreated examination room, researchers demonstrated that influenza virus infectivity is markedly reduced at 43%RH [17] . Similarly, the infectivity of influenza virus aerosolized at 40%RH was significantly impacted [33] . Transmission studies using guinea pigs revealed reduced RD transmission capabilities of influenza virus at 50%RH [18] . In the current study using the ferret model, reduced RD transmission was also observed (down to 17% with both virus groups combined) at 50%RH. Further, we observed lower levels of infectious virus present in aerosols exhaled by infected animals but not in nasal wash samples collected from ferrets housed at 23°C/50%RH demonstrating the added advantage of including the analysis of aerosol samples as a parameter in influenza transmission studies. At 70%RH (with a consistent 23°C setting), RD transmission frequency was somewhat improved to 67% but was most efficient at the low humidity, 30%RH, setting. Under cold conditions (5°C) and 70%RH, RD transmission was rare, occurring between 17% of ferret pairs. However, the levels of infectious virus measured in aerosols exhaled by ferrets at 5°C/70%RH were not reduced, unlike our observations of animals housed at 23°C/ 50%RH. This disparity may be explained by the fact that water vapor released into a cold, humid environment can quickly convert to a liquid [34] . In other words, we can speculate that as the animal exhales air from the warm, humid environment of their respiratory tract, it encounters the colder ambient air (5°C/70%RH), which may cause some of the exhaled aerosol particles to essentially ""grow"" by condensation, thereby increasing the settling velocity of those exhaled droplets [34] . Thus, the frequency of transmission events occurring through the air at 5°C/70%RH is reduced but aerosols collected immediately after being exhaled by the animal do not show any reduction in the levels of infectious virus. Experiments conducted in guinea pigs housed at 5°C and 65%RH or 80%RH displayed successful RD transmission 50% of the time but directional airflow used during those experiments may have assisted the transport of virusladen aerosols from infected animals to their uninfected counterparts [18] . However, both guinea pig and ferret studies concur that RD transmission is most efficient in low RH environments. Mechanisms have been proposed to explain the loss of infectivity of influenza virus aerosolized at mid-range RH settings (reviewed in [14] ). As water evaporates from aerosol particles, the solute components become more concentrated which can have damaging effects on influenza virus being carried within those aerosols. At high humidity environments, evaporation is minimal, but at low humidity environments, below the efflorescence RH (~50%RH), the solute components crystallize rendering the virus intact and viable [16] . This may be the reason why we observed reduced exhaled infectious influenza virus and ultimately reduced frequency of RD transmission in ferrets housed at 23°C/50%RH. Detection of influenza virus in exhaled aerosols has been largely limited to the detection of viral genetic material via RT-PCR with few reporting infectious virus detection in humans [12, 13] or laboratory animals [35, 36] . We previously developed a method to collect size-segregated, exhaled aerosols from ferrets using a cascade impactor and measure the total amount of infectious influenza virus present [24] . Those experiments were conducted under normal laboratory conditions (21°C/30%RH) without the use of an environmental chamber, and we found similar results as reported here for ferrets housed at the 23°C/30%RH setting, including efficient RD transmission of PN99 and IN11 viruses [26] [27] [28] . Because there is unavoidable loss of viral material during our aerosol collection and processing procedure, recovery rates were derived to provide improved estimations of the amounts of virus in the exhaled breath of infected ferrets. Comparison of these estimated levels of virus were as follows: 23°C/30%RH > 23°C/ 70%RH > 5°C/70%RH > 23°C/50%RH, similar to the overall frequency of RD transmission (83%, 67%, 17%, 17%, respectively). Unlike normal breathing samples, the levels of influenza virus measured at each condition during sneezing sessions was not consistent with the frequency of transmission events (i.e. the greatest amount was measured at 23°C/50%RH), suggesting that the virus released during normal breathing may be more instrumental in influenza transmission through the air. It has been suggested that although sneezing and coughing events send more aerosols into the air per maneuver compared to normal breathing, over the course of an entire day, significantly more aerosols will be released during normal breathing because breathing is continuous [37] . Furthermore, the substantial heterogeneity in aerosols generated by ferrets during sneezing usually confounds analysis of data obtained from these highly variable samples. Despite these challenges, increased sneezing is routinely reported in ferrets infected by influenza viruses [26, 38, 39] so the contribution of virus-laden aerosols expelled by ferrets during sneezing to transmission cannot be ruled out for this animal model.

In the temperate regions of the world, people spend the vast majority of their time indoors, especially during the winter months where the environment is typically maintained at a warm temperature and low RH [1] . This scenario sets the stage for influenza virus transmission through the air by providing favorable conditions for maintaining virus viability in aerosols while, due to high evaporation rates, creating a large fraction of respirable particles capable of prolonged suspension in the air [1] . Improving our understanding of how environmental conditions modulate influenza virus infectivity and transmission could help reveal mechanisms that can be exploited to develop novel prevention strategies that better protect people from influenza virus infection. There are inherent limitations in the techniques used to evaluate the role of bioaerosols in influenza virus transmission. Most notably, we are challenged with isolating infectious influenza virus from aerosol samples collected from the exhaled breath of infected hosts at levels high enough for meaningful evaluation. Collection times typically represent brief snapshots within the overall kinetics of virus shedding. Unfortunately, increasing collection times often compromise aerosol collection efficiency and the preservation of virus infectivity. Innovative strategies in multiple laboratories are being pursued to improve these techniques [12, 35, 40, 41] . Additionally, even the most suitable animal model will not always accurately represent the presentation of influenza virus infection in humans and ethical responsibilities necessitate the use of a minimum number of animals. Nevertheless, knowledge gained through controlled animal studies using both virological and aerobiological techniques will ultimately further our understanding of influenza virus infection and transmission in the diverse environmental conditions experienced throughout the year and around the world.

Host genetics determine susceptibility to avian influenza infection and transmission dynamics,"antibody. Genetic resistance to a novel H9N2 virus was less robust, though significant differences between host genotypes were still clearly evident. The existence of host-genetic determination of the outcome of influenza infection offers tools for the further dissection of this regulation and also for understanding the mechanisms of influenza transmission within and between birds.","immunological reagents 4 . Mice have been widely employed to study host-genetic determinants and have helped to identify many candidates of the genetic host regions involved 9, 12 , including the influence of Mx gene in susceptibility to influenza 10 . However, it is a poor model for virus transmission 13 . The chicken is a natural host of AIV and obviates the need to use model species.

In humans an association has been broadly described between MHC haplotypes and the outcome of infectious diseases 14 . Similarly in chickens, strong associations have been reported between the MHC haplotype (or B haplotype) and resistance and susceptibility to viral, bacterial and parasitic pathogens 15, 16 . Although a heritable association to susceptibility to influenza in humans has been described there are no definitive reports of individual genetic variability in relation to influenza disease and its outcomes 17 . The few studies addressing this question in birds have yielded disparate results, the analysis of field infection with H5N1 HPAI suggesting a hierarchy of survival based on the B haplotype, with B21 giving complete protection from mortality 18 , whilst experimental infection of congenic lines suggested that B21 conferred only partial protection of between 60% and 30% and that non-MHC genes might also be important 19 . In the earlier study B12 appeared to be associated with high susceptibility. The discovery of the existence and mechanism of robust genetic resistance to AIV would be of substantial value in protecting birds from infection and being the source of mutated human pandemic virus. On the basis of these putative resistance and susceptibility associations we studied the infection of Line 0 birds (B21) compared with Line C-B12 (B12) 20 . Genetic resistance to infection, viral transmission, route of infection and regulation by immune responses were all subject to investigation. As the majority of incursions of avian influenza in Europe have been of H7N7 we used a virus of this serotype for the detailed analysis of genetic resistance and made comparison with two strains of H9N2 viruses that are endemic in Asia.

We observed clear differences in the shedding trajectories, measured by qRT-PCR, of an H7N7 LPAI virus, (A/Turkey/England/647/77) between two inbred lines of bird experimentally infected through the nares. In the case of Line 0 birds, viral shedding from the oropharynx decreased steadily from the second day post infection (DPI) and stopped one week later. Oropharyngeal shedding in Line C-B12 birds was significantly higher from day 5 post-infection (p < 0.001) and continued throughout the 3 weeks experiment (Fig. 1A ). There was a complete absence of the virus in cloacal swabs from Line 0 birds, while C-B12 birds showed a clear shedding of virus from this route for the entire three week period of the experiment (Fig. 1B) . These effects were independent of the viral dose, as a lower dose of infection produced similar differences in oropharyngeal and cloacal swabs ( Supplementary Fig. S1 ).

We further confirmed the observed qRT-PCR results by analysis of infective virus by plaque assay (Supplementary Fig. S2 ). Virus was detected in oropharyngeal swabs in both lines, and the shedding decreased over time; the viral load and the number of positive samples in oropharyngeal swabs was significantly higher in Line C-B12 birds. The cloacal shedding of Line C-B12 birds was detected beyond two weeks after infection and not at all in Line 0.

We also detected differences in transmission of virus between lines ( Fig. 1C -F): Naïve Line 0 sentinel birds co-housed with infected syngeneic birds did not shed virus (Fig. 1C ,D) nor seroconvert ( Supplementary Fig. S3A ). However, Line C-B12 sentinel birds shed virus from the oropharynx and cloaca from 1 day after exposure to syngeneic infected birds ( Directly infected birds of both lines seroconverted, with Line C-B12 birds tending to exhibit higher antibody titers ( Supplementary Fig. S3 ). On this basis we designated Line 0 resistant and Line C-B12 susceptible to sustaining chains of infection within syngeneic populations.

A subsequent experiment was performed to determine whether the virus shed from the oropharynx of the resistant Line 0 birds was capable of infecting the susceptible Line C-B12 and whether the resistant Line 0 birds were able to be infected when exposed to sustained challenge by virus shed from experimentally infected Line C-B12. Mixed populations of the two lines were housed in two isolators. In one isolator the resistant Line 0 birds were infected by the nasal route ( Fig. 2A) whilst in the other the susceptible Line C-B12 birds were infected (Fig. 2C ), in each case leaving the alternate line birds as uninfected sentinels (Fig. 2B,D) . Infected Line 0 birds showed the characteristic oropharyngeal shedding profile, with no virus seen in cloacal swabs ( Fig. 2A) . None of the C-B12 sentinels produced positive swabs (Fig. 2B ). In the second isolator, Line C-B12 birds shed virus by oropharyngeal and cloacal routes with the time-course previously described (Fig. 2C) . All of the resistant contact Line 0 birds shed virus from the oropharynx followed, in 6/10 birds, by cloacal shedding, although this was always significantly lower than with infected C-B12 birds and over a shorter duration (Fig. 2D ). 4/10 contact Line 0 birds failed to shed from the cloaca (data not shown). Seroconversion was correlated with cloacal shedding (Supplementary Fig. S3B ).

We found similar results when the same susceptible Line C-B12 birds were infected via the cloacal route (Fig. 2E,F) , although in this case all sentinels birds showed clear cloacal shedding.

The magnitude of adaptive immune responses does not explain differences in susceptibility to infection. We analysed the adaptive response for a possible correlation with the different susceptibilities to infection. Splenocytes of infected birds were compared by ELISpot for detection of both antigen-specific IFNγ and antibody secreting cells (Fig. 3 ). Using either AIV infected syngeneic Antigen Presenting Cells ( from Line C-B12 birds showed higher IFN responses at syngeneic stimulation (398.7 ± 82.8 vs. 104.5 ± 38.6 SFU/10 6 splenocytes, p = 0.0079) or against whole virus (368.3 ± 49.9 vs. 135.8 ± 62.5 SFU/10 6 splenocytes, p = 0.0317). We also detected influenza specific antibody IgM and IgY secreting B cells (Fig. 3C ,D) in birds of both lines after infection. As with IFN, we found that responses in C-B12 birds tended to be higher than observed in Line 0 at day 7 for IgM (109.4 ± 20.6 vs. 58.0 ± 14.2 SFU/10 6 ) and day 14 (95.9 ± 33.1 vs. 32.3 ± 6.4 SFU/10 6 ). The number of IgY producing cells also tended to be higher at 7 DPI (131.8 ± 35.9 vs. 77.8 ± 16.0 SFU/10 6 ) and 14 DPI (113.2 ± 39.2 vs. 101.0 ± 21.0 SFU/10 6 ). Overall, a stronger adaptive response was consistently observed in the susceptible C-B12 birds than in resistant Line 0 birds.

capability of the H7N7 strain in Chicken Embryo Fibroblast (CEF) cultures from birds of Line C-B12, Line 0 and also an outbred Line of birds (Rhode Island Red, RIR). Supernatants of these infected cultures were harvested and measurement of infectious virus made by plaque assay. CEF cultures were infected at different MOI; Multiplicities of Infection ( Fig. 4 : MOI of 0.1, 1). Assuming that virus particles were released about 4 hours after virus absorption 21 , we took samples before one cycle of infection-replication (1 hour), after 1 cycle of infection-replication (6 hours) and several cycles of infection-replication (24 hours).

As expected, we observed that the longer the harvesting time after infection or the higher the initial multiplicity of infection, the higher the yield of infective particles. The dynamics of virus production from CEF of the three lines of bird were similar, except at 24 hours postinfection, where at the lowest dilution (MOI of 0.01) the number of infective particles produced by cells from birds of Line C-B12 (80.0 ± 13.4 pfu /ml supernatant) was higher than birds of other lines (21.0 ± 1.0 and 23.2 ± 10.0 pfu/ml supernatant in Line 0 and RIR respectively, significant at (p < 0.05)). This single time point and MOI was the only significant difference (we also tested higher MOI: 1,5 and 10, data not shown), suggesting that cell-autonomous factors were unlikely to explain the main characteristics of the resistance of Line 0 birds, the absence of cloacal shedding. Host factors control viral transmission within the bird. We hypothesised that the restricted shedding profile seen in Line 0 birds was due to a restriction in the transmission of virus from the experimentally-infected respiratory tract to the gastrointestinal tract. To test this we infected Line 0 birds by the cloacal route, in the presence of sentinel birds. Directly infected birds showed significant cloacal shedding (Fig. 5A) with a profile similar to those Line 0 birds previously infected by contact with shedding susceptible birds (Fig. 2D,F) . Particularly, shedding had started to decline sharply by 4 DPI and by 6 DPI no cloacal shedding could be detected. However, viral shedding did not extend to higher respiratory tissues as no shedding was detected in oropharyngeal swabs (Fig. 5B) . The serological responses of these cloacal infected birds were similar to those infected by the intra-nasal route (data not shown). Contact Line 0 birds did not show infection. By contrast, in Line C-B12 birds, transmission to sentinels was detected (Fig. 5C,D) and viral shedding extended to higher respiratory tissues (Fig. 5D ).

The ability to sustain a chain of infection of LPAI among resistant Line 0 birds correlates with cloacal shedding and is dependent on viral strain. We compared the profile of viral shedding of directly infected and close-contact sentinel birds with H7N7 (A/Turkey//England/647/77) and two H9N2 LPAI strains ((A/chicken/Pakistan/UDL-02/2008 (H9N2-UDL) and A/Turkey/Wisconsin/1/66 (H9N2-Wis), Fig. 6 ). H7N7-infected birds showed the characteristic pattern of viral shedding, transmission of infection and serological responses previously described (Fig.6 A,D and G).

H9N2 infected birds showed significantly higher oropharyngeal shedding values (p < 0.0001) than H7N7 infected birds at any time point after infection (Fig. 6B,C) , with higher values during the first day that steadily decreased, with few positives beyond day 8 post-infection. However, the two H9N2 strains were highly divergent in other aspects. Whilst H9N2/wis did not shed from the cloaca (Fig. 6E) , infection with H9N2-UDL resulted in viral shedding (Fig. 6F) , resolving by 10 days post-infection. Contact sentinels of the H9N2-UDL infected birds shed virus from the oropharynx and cloaca (Fig. 6C and F) , with cloacal shedding almost equivalent to that of the directly infected birds. The peak of cloacal shedding was at day 5, decreasing steadily thereafter. Serological results mirrored shedding data, with all directly infected birds seroconverting but only sentinels of the H9N2/ UDL infected group (Fig. 6G-I ).

Our initial observations revealed profound differences in host-genetic control of experimental H7N7 influenza infection in chickens, including the total absence of cloacal shedding in resistant birds and a restricted time course of oropharyngeal shedding. This phenotype was maintained following infection with an historic H9N2 virus but broke down after challenge with a novel H9N2 virus. The Pakistan group of viruses to which this belongs have higher infectivity, virulence and transmission than many LPAI due to polymerases (PB2, PB1 and PA) and non-structural (NS) gene segments identical to highly pathogenic H7N3 viruses 22, 23 . The mechanisms responsible for this increased virulence were clearly able to overcome the genetic resistance seen in Line 0 birds.

Notwithstanding reports of a degree of genetic resistance to HPAI in congenic lines of chicken 19 and epidemiologic studies carried out in humans 17 , our finding is the most striking example so far reported of the variation of in vivo host-genetic control of influenza within a reservoir species that threatens the human population. Furthermore, resistant birds were completely unable to initiate or sustain a chain of infection of LPAI, with sentinel birds of either susceptible or resistant genotype showing neither infection nor seroconversion. Our consistent finding was that cloacal shedding of the directly infected birds is the main contributor to sustain a chain of transmission (Figs 1-2 and 6) . Indeed, this is the first experimental evidence of the irrelevance of oropharyngeal shedding to transmission of a particular influenza strain in intimately co-housed birds, with previous literature mostly reporting studies relying on a physical separation between infected and sentinel groups 24 . Housing resistant Line 0 birds with directly infected and shedding C-B12 birds changed their previously observed phenotype by producing a transient low level shedding of virus from the cloaca (Fig. 2D,F) . Host factors were clearly still relevant as, unlike with susceptible C-B12 sentinels, not all individuals succumbed to cloacal shedding, and in those birds that were infected this stopped after 5-8 days, as compared with over two weeks for the C-B12 sentinels. Although it is possible that the change in phenotype of the resistant birds was due to persistent challenge with a high level of virus from the susceptible birds, an alternate explanation is that this was the result of an alternative route of infection. We demonstrated the possibility that infection can be achieved through the cloaca (Fig. 5) , in which case the Line 0 birds reversed the phenotype seen with intra-nasel infection and shed from the cloaca and not the oropharynx, suggesting that the limited shedding trajectories seen in Line 0 birds may be due to a restriction of within-animal transmission of virus. This may be relevant to the natural situation where the virus is known to persist in water 25 , giving rise to the possibility of infection by cloacal sampling due to the Shaffner reflex 26 . Infection by an environmental route that selectively allowed cloacal shedding and onward transmission would have a profound effect on the transmission dynamics and persistence of avian influenza viruses in the wild 27 . Though the methodology of the present study does not allow for the identification of particular genes or genomic regions that may be responsible for the observed resistance and susceptibility profiles we can infer what elements of immune regulation may be relevant. Firstly, differences in resistance and susceptibility were observed within 2-3 days postinfection, too early for an adaptive immune response and indicative of innate factors including innate immune mechanisms. However, although we cannot rule out some degree of cell-autonomous immunity there were no profound differences in viral production in in vitro assays (Fig. 4) , suggesting that this early-acting factor, evidenced in vivo, was either present in cells other than the CEF used for our in vitro assays or was mainly exerted by a more complex level of interaction of cellular and soluble-factors. The correlation of cytokine and chemokine gene expression with viral load in influenza infected poultry has previously been described 28 . We also cannot discard the involvement of other elements triggering the immune response, such as IFN stimulated genes, TLR pathways 29 or other genes activated in response to infection 30 . As differences in development are reflected in gene expression and the strength of host responses at transcriptional level, these factors have been linked with age-dependent susceptibility to infection in birds 28 . In the present study we also compared infection of 1 week and 3 week old Line 0 birds. However, we found the same viral dynamics and adaptive responses (data not shown) indicating that the expression of relevant host factors are independent of the host development, at least in perinatal birds.

MHC mediated adaptive immune responses have been shown to determine the resistance or susceptibility of the Compton lines of inbred chicken to a variety of pathogens 31, 32 , including those that, like with the present study, have a very early, presumably MHC-independent, innate component of resistance 33 . Since Line 0 and C-B12 differ in their MHC haplotype, being B21 and B12 respectively, we hypothesised that adaptive responses might also be important with respect to susceptibility to infection with LPAI. However, our observations that the magnitude of adaptive response (given by IFNγ secreting cells, antibody specific clones or total influenza antibody in serum) correlates with the amount of, rather than resistance to, infection would indicate that adaptive responses may not play a significant role in the shedding/non-shedding phenotype. We cannot entirely exclude the possibility that qualitative differences in, for example, the binding capacity of MHC for specific protective viral-derived peptides may be relevant. There are also other, non-adaptive, immune mechanisms encoded within the avian MHC, including a number of chicken NK receptor genes. Polymorphic and diverse, these genes are involved in the activation or inhibition of chicken NK cells [34] [35] [36] . Since these cells have been considered a factor involved in avian influenza pathogenicity 37 , and that a principal activating natural killer cell receptor has been described as critical in the in vivo eradication of the influenza virus 38 , the importance of the B-region haplotype in relation with the NK function could be crucial. It is also possible that a hierarchy of interaction exists between the haplotype-specific NK receptors, with some haplotypes being better than others for resistance to pathogens because of increased activity of NK cells 15, 39 . It will be important to investigate resistance and susceptibility to influenza in relation the NK activity of different haplotypes.

The present study indicates other priority areas for further investigation. The identification of the precise mechanisms and host-genetic control of resistance and non-transmissibility would offer the prospect of breeding or engineering resistant birds. Although ultimately rewarding this will be a complex undertaking as studies of genetic predisposition in mice have indicated that the host response is not only influenced by simple Mendelian inheritance of a single gene but also by complex, incompletely understood, interactions of genes and their associated variants 40 that catalogue the global host responses to infection 9 .

Though birds resistant to influenza transmission have recently been engineered by the incorporation of interfering RNA into the avian genome 41 , there is considerable consumer resistance to this approach, while conventional selective breeding for many traits has existed since the domestication of poultry. Furthermore, as human genetic determinants for influenza are comparatively unknown 42 , a better understanding of the genes and mechanisms involved in susceptibilities identified as a result of animal models could lead to improved therapeutic options in humans 10 .

Further work will be crucial for refining understanding of host-pathogen interaction, pathogenesis and transmission of influenza in poultry, overcoming the limitation of the analysis of the human model 10 . Our work has narrowed the task of identifying and determining the host genetic factors governing influenza infection and emphasizes the importance of the host for the control of viral replication and transmission. The prospect of breeding birds with natural immunity to influenza virus would widen the scope of existing control measures and limit the risk to the human population of the emergence of pandemic viruses. 

Chicken cell lines were produced and maintained at the Pirbright Institute (Compton, UK). Chicken Embryo Fibroblasts (CEFs) of 3 different birds each of Lines C-B12 and 0 were harvested from 10-day old embryos, washed and grown in T25 flasks (Nunc) in a culture media containing Medium 199 supplemented with TPB Glutamine (Sigma), 100 U/ml Penicillin, 100 μ g/ml streptomycin and 10% heat inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS), equilibrated to neutral pH with sodium bicarbonate and maintained in 5% CO 2 at 41 °C. Confluent monolayers of cells were washed with warm PBS and infected with a solution of culture media (without FBS) 0.5 μ g/ml TPCK trypsin (Sigma) containing H7N7 strain at different Multiplicity of Infection (MOI) of 0.1 and 0.01. After 1 hour incubation at 41 °C, cells were washed again and culture media solution was added to the monolayers. After incubation at 1, 6 and 24 hours at 41 °C, supernatant of infected cells were harvested, centrifuged at 300 × g for 10 min to remove dead cells and frozen at − 80 °C.

Determination of viral titers. Determination of viral load was performed by detection of viral matrix mRNA transcript by qRT-PCR of swabs as previously described 44, 45 , or by plaque assay plaque assay on Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells by standard methods 46 . MDCKs were supplied by the microbiological services unit at the Pirbright Institute (Compton, UK).

Determination of adaptive response. Determination of haemagglutination titres and IFNγ ELISpot assays of splenocytes cocultured with influenza infected haplotype-matched CKC or influenza inactivated virus was carried out as previously described 45 . For antigen-specific B Cell ELISpots, MultiScreen ™ -HA ELISPOT plates (Millipore, UK) were coated for 2 h at 37 °C with 2 μ g /mL of anti-H7 and anti-N7 antibodies (2B scientific) in carbonate buffer (Sigma). Plates were washed with PBS and subsequently incubated for another 2 h at 37 °C with 100 μ L per well of blocking buffer (PBS containing 4% dried skimmed milk). After the PBS wash, a suspension in PBS of 2 × 10 6 PFU per well of the viral strain employed for challenge was added and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C After a PBS wash 5 × 10 5 splenocytes were added per well and cultured overnight at 37 °C with 5% CO 2 atmosphere. Cells were washed off the plates using PBS containing 0.05% Tween20, and 100 μ L of biotinylated goat anti-chicken IgM (antibodies-online.com) or biotinylated goat anti-chicken IgY (Vector Laboratories) diluted in PBS at 2 μ g/ml added per well. After a 3 h incubation at room temperature plates were washed with PBS including 0.05% Tween20 and 100 μ L per well of avidin/biotinylated enzyme complex (Vectastain Elite ABC kit, Vector Laboratories) added.

Environmental Factors Affecting the Transmission of Respiratory Viruses,"Many viruses are capable of infecting the human respiratory tract to cause disease. These viruses display various transmission patterns among humans; however, they all share the ability to transmit from person to person, and their human transmissibility is influenced by the environment in which pathogen and host meet. This review aims to summarize recent and significant observations regarding the impact of environmental factors such as weather and climate, humidity, temperature, and airflow on the transmission of human respiratory viruses. Where possible, knowledge gaps that require further scientific study will be identified.","Viral respiratory tract infections are both ubiquitous and burdensome, accounting for many millions of lost school-and workdays and millions more physician visits each year [1] . Although there are similarities in the clinical syndromes caused by the many viruses capable of infecting and causing disease in the human respiratory tract, they possess varying transmission patterns among humans. The mode or modes by which a virus transmits from person to person are critical to understanding how the environment in which they transmit impacts person-to-person spread. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) consensus definition for the modes of transmission of influenza virus is broadly applicable to other respiratory (i.e., non-vector-borne) viruses as well (Box 1). In this review, for consistency, we will adhere to the CDC terminology; thus, ""contact transmission"" encompasses both direct and indirect transmission, while ""airborne transmission,"" comprising both droplet spray and aerosol modes, describes the direct inoculation of virus particles from the air into the respiratory tract without an intermediate.

In both modes of contract transmission (direct and indirect), contaminated hands play an important role in carrying virus to mucous membranes.

Virus is transferred by contact from an infected person to another person without a contaminated intermediate object (fomite).

Virus is transferred by contact with a contaminated intermediate object (fomite).

Virus transmits through the air by droplet sprays (such as those produced by coughing or sneezing); a key feature is deposition of droplets by impaction on exposed mucous membranes.

Virus transmits through the air by aerosols in the inspirable size range or smaller; aerosol particles are small enough to be inhaled into the oronasopharynx and distally into the trachea and lung.

http://www.cdc.gov/influenzatransmissionworkshop2010/ Respiratory viruses display a great deal of variety not only in their virion structure and genome composition but also in their modes of transmission among humans (Table 1) . For instance, evidence supports a primary role for direct and indirect contact in respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and adenovirus transmission, while airborne routes (droplet spray and aerosol) seemed to be more important in SARS coronavirus spread. With other viruses, evidence is either contradictory or incomplete, and mode(s) of transmission are yet to be fully resolved.

Here we will review the effects of certain environmental factors on respiratory virus transmission, with an emphasis on influenza and respiratory syncytial viruses. We have referenced several large-scale surveillance studies, as well as experimentally generated data in small animal models. We will also discuss remaining uncertainties as to the relative importance of these factors, as well the possible contributions of non-environmental factors on the infectiousness and transmissibility of respiratory viruses.

Multiple hypotheses have been advanced to explain the specific effect of humidity and temperature on the pronounced seasonality of influenza and, to a lesser extent, disease caused by RSV and other respiratory viruses [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] . These include changes in host behavior (for instance, more time spent indoors, in closed environments, during cold or rainy weather), changes in host defense mechanisms (such as impairment of mucociliary clearance with inhalation of cold, dry air) and changes in the virus infectivity and stability in different climactic conditions ( Figure 1 ).

Animal models have elucidated potential mechanisms by which humidity and temperature influence human influenza virus transmission. In the early 1960s, Schulman and Kilbourne developed an influenza virus transmission model in mice. Although mouse-to-mouse transmission is relatively inefficient, they still observed a significant decrease in transmission efficiency with increasing relative humidity (RH) [23] and during summer months, even when laboratory temperature and RH were controlled during experiments [24] . Lowen et al. expanded upon these experiments in the guinea pig transmission model. At 20°C, transmission efficiency of an influenza A/H3N2 isolate displayed a bimodal dependence on RH, with airborne (i.e., droplet or aerosol) transmission being maximal at 20-35% RH, poor at 50% RH, moderate at 65% RH, and absent at 80% RH. At 5°C, transmission was overall more efficient than at 20°C, and the relationship between RH and transmission efficiency was montonic, with efficiency decreasing with increasing RH [25] .

Transmission was abolished at high temperature (30°C), regardless of RH [26] .

Transmission of viruses via airborne routes may be affected by ambient humidity, which affects not only the virus' stability but also respiratory droplet size, as water content evaporates. In turn, droplet size influences whether the particle will quickly settle to the ground or remain airborne long enough to be inhaled into the respiratory tract of a susceptible host. For influenza virus, mathematical modeling suggests that RH is an important variable in airborne transmission of influenza virus; high RH favors removal of infectious particles both by increasing the settling of large, water-laden droplets and by hastening virus inactivation [27] . In aerosol viability experiments, adenovirus [28, 29] and rhinovirus [30] were more stable at high RH; in contrast, a bovine parainfluenza virus was more stable at low RH [31] , while RSV demonstrated bimodal peak stability at 20% or 40-60% RH with relative instability at 30% [32] . Influenza viruses are also generally more stable at lower RH; some studies have observed a bimodal stability similar to that seen by Lowen et al., while others have not [20] . However, these data should not be overinterpreted, as aerosol generation protocols and thus particle size and composition were not necessarily uniform across experiments.

RH is a ratio that describes the actual water vapor pressure of air, relative to its vapor pressure at saturation. Because saturation vapor pressure is exponentially related to temperature, RH varies both with the temperature and with the water vapor content of air. Absolute humidity (AH), on the other hand, describes the actual water vapor content of air, without respect to temperature. Thus, at equivalent RH, warm air contains more water vapor (i.e., has higher AH) than cold air [33] . A reanalysis of the data of Lowen et al. showed that, although RH and temperature were both weakly correlated with influenza virus transmission efficiency, AH was strongly associated with transmission efficiency, with efficiency decreasing as vapor content of air increases [33] . Subsequent analyses of epidemiological and meteorological data in temperate areas in the United States [34] and Japan [35] suggest that low AH correlates strongly with the onset of influenza epidemic activity, more so than RH.

However, as Tamerius and colleagues observe [20] , hypotheses correlating AH and influenza epidemics are best suited to explain the seasonality of influenza virus transmission in temperate climates. While influenza virus transmission has been thought not to display marked seasonality in the tropics, accumulating data suggest that equatorial regions can experience not only year-round transmission (such as Colombia; 4°N) [36] but also distinct annual epidemics that are unimodal (Fortaleza, Brazil; 3°S) or bimodal (Singapore; 1°N) [20] . In other tropical areas, influenza epidemics correlate with the rainy season, when AH is highest (such as Dakar, Senegal; 14°N [37] , or Belem, Brazil; 1°S [38] ). The question remains to what extent the seasonality (or lack thereof) of influenza epidemics is attributable to seasonal factors like humidity and temperature, what other environmental or seasonal variables matter, and which variables are causative and which are merely correlated or even confounding [20] .

Another environmental factor that may influence viral transmissibility is precipitation. Several large-scale studies have been conducted in tropical and equatorial countries in order to determine the relationship between rainfall and respiratory disease, particularly that associated with RSV and, to a lesser extent, influenza virus. A 3-year study of RSV infections in Lombok, Indonesia (8°S) found an association between rainfall and RSV hospitalizations; interestingly, total monthly precipitation was less important than the number of days on which it rained [39] . In a study from 1982 to 1997 in Malaysia (4°N) involving over 5,000 children, Chan et al. also documented a significant correlation between number of rainy days and RSV infection [40] . An association between rain and RSV infection has also been seen in several other studies [41] [42] [43] [44] . In contrast, a large, 3378children study in Northern Taiwan (23°N) did not find any association between rainfall and RSV infection [45] , nor did a 2002 study in Santiago, Chile (33°S). Of note, however, the Chilean study focused on cases in just one public pediatric hospital [46] ; it is possible that a limited sampling of cases in only one hospital would hinder the ability to draw statistically significant conclusions. However, studies in other locations have found the relationship between RSV disease and rainfall to be inversely related. In a 24-month study of over 1000 symptomatic children in India (22°N), RSV infection rates were negatively correlated with millimeters of rainfall; these findings were statistically significant [47] .

Inconsistencies in the role that rain plays in infection rates is not altogether surprising; discrepancies can even be reported within a given country. Following a 43-month study in Fortaleza (3°S), in the northeast of Brazil, an association between rainfall and RSV infection was documented [48] ; Nasciemento-Carvalho et al. reported a similar correlation in Salvadore (12°N) [49] . However, RSV infection did not correlate with the rainy season in Sao Paolo (23°N) [50] . While these studies employed varying techniques and collected samples over different time periods, it is possible that rain plays a unique role in RSV infection depending on a variety of factors, including geographic location. In addition, weather-dependent behavioral factors such as crowding following rainfall, could also influence RSV infection rates [51] , as RSV is thought to transmit through direct or indirect contact [7] . Indeed, family structure, living conditions and person-to-person contact are risk factors for RSV infection [51, 52] .

Epidemiological data appear generally to support a relationship between influenza virus infection and rainfall. In a two-year study, a significant association was found between rainfall and influenza A virus infection in India (22°N), with little to no reported infections during the dry season [47] . These findings are in agreement with earlier studies by Rao and Banerjee, who reported a statistically significant association between rainfall and influenza virus infection, though the relative contribution to influenza A or B virus infection was not determined [53] . While it has been noted that peak influenza virus activity coincided with the first rainfall in Chennai, India (13°N) [54] , the study lacked sufficient statistical rigor to determine if a relationship in fact exists. In a fairly limited study of pediatric influenza virus infections in an urban slum in Bangladesh (23°N) in 2007, 77% of the influenza B cases occurred during the monsoon season (July to September); conversely, 70% of the influenza A cases occurred during the pre-monsoon period (April to June) [55] . This study also did not determine statistical significance, and has several limitations in the study design, including the retrospective collection of samples from children who displayed clinical symptoms.

Like RSV, influenza virus transmission may be more affected by rainfall in one geographic location than another. When comparing incident influenza and weather trends in Singapore These results were not statistically significant, likely due to the small number of human cases during the study period. In the same study, Murray et al. did not find any association between H5N1 infection and rainfall in Indonesia, though the authors attributed this result to variation in climate across the country, societal differences that may affect how poultry is handled, or differences in susceptibility of the inhabitants and/or poultry due to previous exposures [57] .

Much less work has been done to assess the relationship between precipitation and infection with other respiratory viruses. In a study that investigated the seasonal patterns of viral and bacterial infections among hospitalized children with radiologically diagnosed pneumonia in Salvadore, Brazil (12°N), adenovirus infection was significantly correlated with total precipitation. However, parainfluenza virus infection was inversely correlated in the same study [49] . Indeed, there are substantial knowledge gaps as to how rainfall affects transmission of respiratory viruses. The effects of rain would be difficult to examine experimentally, such as in a small animal model, and it is possible that weather-or climaterelated factors other than precipitation affect seasonal infection rates.

Though relatively few data exist, airflow (the speed of air currents flowing through indoor spaces) and ventilation (the degree of mixing between indoor and outdoor air) seem play a role in respiratory virus infectivity and transmission. Schulman and Kilbourne again made prescient early observations of the effect of airflow on the transmissibility of influenza viruses in the mouse model, demonstrating that the rate of transmission decreased with increasing ventilation of a closed chamber in which mice were housed [23] . A similar phenomenon was observed with rhinovirus; the probability of detecting airborne picornavirus RNA in office buildings was directly correlated with the carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) content of the air, which is in turn inversely related to ventilation with fresh outside air [58] ; however, there were too few positive nasal samples to correlate CO 2 content with actual human infection.

Although inadequate ventilation has been implicated in the airborne transmission of respiratory viruses [59, 60] , the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) coronavirus outbreak in 2002-2003 provides an interesting case study for the outdoor airborne transmission of a viral respiratory pathogen. More than 300 residents of the Amoy Gardens high-rise apartment complex in Hong Kong were infected with the virus, in a dispersion pattern consistent with a single index patient, a visitor to the complex. The index patient was found to have extremely high viral loads in fecal and urine samples; computational fluiddynamics modeling of the dispersion plume was most consistent with transit of virus aerosols through improperly sealed plumbing U-traps, up an airshaft in the index building, and then along prevailing winds into neighboring buildings up to 60 meters away [61, 62] . In the largest nosocomial SARS outbreak in Hong Kong, 17 of the 30 infected patients were housed in different multi-bed wards from the index patient. A recent reanalysis of this outbreak found that, even though the patient wards were designed to be at positive pressure relative to the hospital corridor (thus preventing bioaerosols from entering the wards), small differences in temperature -as little as 0.5°C -between corridor and wards was sufficient to allow two-way airflow at ward entrances, thus permitting SARS coronavirus entry into patient wards [63] .

Viral infections of the respiratory tract are common acute illnesses among humans, and virus transmission, by either direct or indirect routes, occurs in disparate regions around the globe. A more detailed understanding of how these viruses transmit can have broad public health implications. Indeed, a variety of meteorological factors have at times been associated with rates of virus infection as well as transmission among individuals. As presented in this review, precipitation, humidity, temperature, and airflow can be determinants of virus infection and transmission; however, despite robust investigation of the effects of these environmental factors, inconsistencies and uncertainties in the data remain. It is possible that meteorological determinants play greater roles in some geographic regions than others, or simply that differences in experimental design affect outcomes and data interpretation. Nonenvironmental effects, including but not limited to seasonal changes in behavior, family and social structures, and pre-existing immunity, could also be playing a role in respiratory virus transmissibility and rates of infection. Discrepancies in collected data suggest that more vigilant surveillance over large geographic regions and further controlled experiments in animal models and perhaps in humans will likely be necessary to determine with increased certainty the role that environmental factors play on the transmission of viral pathogens.

• Respiratory viruses are spread from person to person via various modes of transmission, including direct and indirect contact, droplet spray, and aerosol.

• Virus transmission is affected by a number of factors, including environmental determinants, host behavior, host defense mechanisms, and virus infectivity.

• Uncertainties remain with respect to the relative importance of these factors and the roles that they play. A more complete understanding of environmental factors impacting respiratory virus transmission will require enhanced epidemiological and surveillance data, as well as controlled experiments in small animal models.

The ecology and adaptive evolution of influenza A interspecies transmission,"This is an open access article under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits use, distribution and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited. Since 2013, there have been several alarming influenza-related events; the spread of highly pathogenic avian influenza H5 viruses into North America, the detection of H10N8 and H5N6 zoonotic infections, the ongoing H7N9 infections in China and the continued zoonosis of H5N1 viruses in parts of Asia and the Middle East. The risk of a new influenza pandemic increases with the repeated interspecies transmission events that facilitate reassortment between animal influenza strains; thus, it is of utmost importance to understand the factors involved that promote or become a barrier to cross-species transmission of Influenza A viruses (IAVs). Here, we provide an overview of the ecology and evolutionary adaptations of IAVs, with a focus on a review of the molecular factors that enable interspecies transmission of the various virus gene segments.","Influenza A virus (IAV) has caused significant morbidity and mortality globally in humans, with an estimated 14 pandemics that have occurred since the 1500s. 1 Wild aquatic birds are well known to be the natural reservoirs for IAV subtypes harbouring H1-H16 subtypes, 2-4 with the exception of H17 and H18 subtypes that were recently discovered in bats. 5, 6 The phylogenetic relationships of all IAV subtypes are displayed in Fig. 1 . In addition to its natural reservoir species, influenza viruses infect a wide range of hosts including canids, equids, humans and swine. 2 IAVs' ability to generate novel gene constellations through reassortment between subtypes poses a risk for immune escape in these new hosts. 7 Furthermore, IAV undergoes rapid genetic and antigenic evolution, which makes vaccination control difficult in humans and other domestic species.

In addition to human pandemics that have emerged from avian and swine hosts, there are also repeated spillover events from domesticated animals, primarily poultry and swine, that pose a significant threat to human health. [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] Direct transmission of IAV from a wild avian source to humans is rare, as there has only been a single report of laboratoryconfirmed human infection with H5N1 contracted through close contact with dead and infected wild swan in Azerbaijan. 15 However, there is serological evidence of H5N1 infection among Alaskan hunters who handled dead wild avian species, 16 indicating that exposure to IAVs from wild birds through close contact can potentially cause infection.

More notably, viral genes that are similar to the 1918-like H1N1 avian virus were recently detected in the influenza gene pools of wild birds, raising the potential for the re-emergence of a 1918-like pandemic virus. 17 Furthermore, due to increasing human encroachment of wildlife habitats, the potential of a wild-source threat becomes more relevant, as is seen with the emergence of other pathogens such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and the more recent Zaire-variant Ebola virus in Western Africa. [18] [19] [20] [21] In this review, we discuss the current knowledge of ecological and molecular determinants responsible for interspecies transmission of IAV, with specific focus on avian-derived influenza subtypes involved in zoonotic and epizootic transmission to other hosts (see Fig. 2 ).

Wild birds of the orders Anseriformes (such as ducks and geese) and

Charadriiformes (such as shorebirds and gulls) are the primary reservoir of avian influenza viruses. 2 The maintenance of this diverse pool of viruses globally is in part due to the migratory nature of the bird species, a mechanism in which the viruses are shed in bird faeces and later acquired by other birds that share the same habitat along migratory flyways. 2, [22] [23] [24] Transmission of IAV in wild bird populations is dependent on several factors including virus shedding, virus stability in the environment and the degree of close contact/mixing with other host species. 3, 25 Virus shedding by bird species in the environment mainly occurs in fresh water, from where viable viruses of most known subtypes currently circulating in wild birds have been isolated. 24 The persistence of infectivity of IAV shed by aquatic birds is dependent on the temperature and pH of the freshwater, where it has been found that shed viruses can remain infectious for 4 days in temperatures of 28°C and >30 days in temperatures below 0°C, with greatest viral recovery noted at a slightly basic pH (7.4-8.2) and temperatures lower than 17°C. [26] [27] [28] [29] Prolonged virus shedding, which can be attributed to the development of the avian immune system, facilitates the efficient transmissions of IAVs in their natural hosts. 27 In the avian cellular immune response, the maturation of T lymphocytes occurs in the thymus glands that are distributed around the neck and inside the thoracic cavity of most birds. Unlike humans, these thymus glands only fully develop in late juvenile birds and persist throughout adult life. 30 F I G U R E 1 Diversity and host distribution of influenza A viruses (IAVs). Maximum-likelihood (ML) estimation of the haemagglutinin (HA) gene sequences of all subtypes of IAVs downloaded from the NCBI GenBank database. Overall data set randomly subsampled to include 200 isolates per subtype per host for the tree reconstruction. External branches of tree coloured by the major host groups from which the virus has been isolated from: avian (blue), canine (purple), chiropteran (pink), equine (brown), human (red), swine (amber) and other incidental hosts (black). Scale for branch length represents number of nucleotide substitution per site (subs/site) in the HA alignment In contrast, the plasmacytoid B cells essential for antibody-mediated response mature in a specialized organ called the bursa of Fabricius (BF), located in the cloaca, but the BF involutes or disappears early in the juvenile bird stage, that is at the onset of feather growth. 27, 30 The transition from the loss of the BF to the full functionality of the thymus results in a period of a weakened immunity in these avian species; thus migrating juvenile birds with a high viral load become an infection source of different pathogens. 27, 31 The stability of the haemagglutinin (HA) protein, both in the intracellular and extracellular environment, is a key determinant of the influenza virus stability and infectivity in the environment. 32 Stability of the HA in low intracellular pH of the early endosome is essential for the intracellular entry of the virus, after which point a threshold pH is reached in the late endosome causing the fusion of the protein to the lipid membrane, enabling the viral genome to escape the late endosome and successfully infect the cell. 7 Conversely, the virus must also maintain its stability in variable extracellular pH environments in its transmission between hosts. Thus, it has been observed that the pH stability of IAV subtypes evolves differently depending on host type and the route of transmission. 33 As most transmission of avian IAV in aquatic birds is through the oral-faecal route and the replication occurs mostly in the GI tract and cloaca of the birds, these viruses have evolved for stability at higher extracellular pH to accommodate these sites of replication and also maintain viability in the aquatic environment. [33] [34] [35] [36] More recently, the incorporation of environmental durability data into a phylogenetic study of avian IAV demonstrated that environmental transmission is correlated with the increase in virus genetic diversity in short-lived avian hosts, suggesting an environmental reservoir can act as a source of annual outbreaks. 37

AIV can cause low pathogenic infections (LPAI) in domestic birds with an asymptomatic or mild disease, with HA subtypes H1, H3, H5, H6, H7 and H9 most commonly isolated. 38, 39 In contrast, certain AIV lineages in subtypes H5 and H7 cause severe disease and rapid mortality in domestic birds and are referred to as highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI). While HPAI is phenotypically defined by a viruses lethality for susceptible chickens under strict experimental criteria, 40 genetically, the key distinguishing structure of HPAI is the presence of a multibasic F I G U R E 2 Significant interspecies transmission of influenza A viruses (IAVs). Representative diagram of interspecies transmission events of IAVs and the subtypes involved in these events. Solid arrows represent direct transmission events that have since been established in the host species. Dashed arrows represent sporadic or limited infection of subtypes where sustained transmission in the new host has not been detected cleavage site (MBCS), which contains two to several basic residues (e.g. PQRERRRKR/G) in the HA gene, as opposed to a single basic residue (PQRETR/G) in LPAI strains. [41] [42] [43] Furin-like peptidases, which are expressed ubiquitously in all tissue types of both avian and mammalian species, are responsible for the cleavage of HA at the MBCS site. 41, 44 Additionally, HPAI strains have also emerged through non-homologous recombination with a non-HA protein nucleotide sequence, introducing a non-native sequence into the HA gene. 45, 46 Although this can enhance the pathogenicity of the virus, systemic replication does not necessarily occur in all species: experimental infection of ferrets and mice with HPAI H5N1 showed systemic virus replication, 47, 48 but replication was only observed in the respiratory tract of non-human primates, 49 suggesting that pathogenicity of HPAI viruses is possibly host specific and multifactorial. 43 It has been recently understood that domestic birds such as chicken lack the retinoic acid-inducible gene-I (RIG-I), which is essential for signalling in the innate immune response, 50,51 as opposed to presence of RIG-I in other avian species and mammals as an important sensor of viral RNA leading to activation of type I interferons. 52 In experimental infection of chickens and ducks with H7N1 virus, increased viral pathogenesis with clinical signs of disease and death is observed in chickens, but infected ducks do not exhibit clinical signs, highlighting the evolutionary adaption of ducks being a natural host of the influenza virus. 53, 54 There has also been back-transmission of HPAI viruses from domestic poultry to wild bird populations that are implicated in bird die-offs 55 and intercontinental spread. [56] [57] [58] [59] Most IAV spillover events to humans have occurred through close contact with domestic poultry. 2 

In a large-scale analysis of sequence data of IAVs from various hosts, several mutations were reported to be indicative of adaptation of IAVs from avian to other host species. 83 However, in the surveillance of swine populations in southern China, many of these sites retain their avian-like residues despite over 30 years of circulation in these mammalian hosts, 84 suggesting these residues are likely founder effects rather than true adaptive mutations. Here, we highlight a few mutations that have been validated experimentally as critical in the adaptation of avian IAVs to humans and other mammalian hosts. 94, 98, 99 Finally, mutations outside the RBS, specifically in glycosylation sites near the RBS, have also been determinants of receptor binding specificity, as these sites, when glycosylated, cause stearic hindrance to the optimal binding of respective SA linkage to the RBS, thereby restricting binding. [100] [101] [102] [103] [104] [105] As mentioned earlier, the stability of the HA protein at various pH is associated with transmission in different hosts, with mammalian viruses having a lower optimum pH of conformational stability than avian viruses. 35,106-108 However, it was recently discovered that, in the adaptation from avian H1N1 to establishment of the European avianlike (EA) swine virus lineage, this mammalian virus possessed a higher optimum pH of conformational stability than its avian counterpart, which is hypothesized to be mediated by changes in HA2 residues 72, 75, and 113. 109 These findings certainly warrant the increased need to differentially characterize this trait between all susceptible species that can harbour IAVs for pandemic and panzootic preparedness as previously understood host-specific optimum pH for HA stability may vary between subtypes and hosts.

The primary function of the NA protein is to cleave sialic acid receptors of host cells from where the virion has budded, thereby preventing reinfection into the same cell and promoting viral spread within the host. 7 An optimal balance between the HA and NA protein function is required for effective infection and transmission of IAV: excess NA proteins can hinder the binding of HA to host cell receptors, whereas insufficient NA protein results in limited virus spread. 110, 111 Avian NA proteins preferentially cleave α-2,3-SA residues, whereas mammalian NA proteins can cleave both α-2,3-SA and α-2,6-SA residues, indicating host-specific adaptations of the protein. 112 In avian IAV subtypes (e.g. H2N2, H7N1 and H9N2), deletions in the NA stalk are crucial for adaptation in chickens and other Galliformes poultry species. 113, 114 While the significance of this deletion is yet to be elucidated, the naturally selected deletion serves as a barrier in interspecies transmission, as viruses containing the stalk region deletion were shown to have compromised transmission between ferrets. 115 

The most widely cited mutation in polymerase PB2 subunit is Glu-627-Lys substitution, which is responsible for adaptation from avian to mammalian hosts. This mutation has been shown to mediate replication at a lower temperature (33°C) in the human upper respiratory tract, thereby facilitating efficient aerosol transmission, as opposed to a higher temperature (40°C) in avian intestinal tract. [116] [117] [118] Additionally, this PB2 Glu-627-Lys mutation enhances the assembly of the viral ribonuclear protein (vRNP) complex in mammalian cells by stabilizing the binding of nucleoprotein (NP) and PB2 proteins during viral replication, [119] [120] [121] and this stabilization further contributes in resistance to host RIG-I sensing. 122 Exceptions are found in H5N1 avian viruses as they are able to replicate in mammals successfully even with the absence of PB2 Glu-627-Lys mutation; however, a compensatory Asp-701-Asn mutation in the PB2 gene is present and has been found to facilitate adaptation to mammalian replication. 123 This mutation promotes the transport of the RNA polymerase subunits into the nucleus through NP and PB2 interaction with importin-α in mammalian cells, thereby promoting transmission in mammalian systems. 123, 124 

The NP segment plays a key role in interspecies transmission of IAV, particularly the switch from avian to mammalian hosts. The viral NP is associated with the sensitivity of the IAV to host myxovirus resistance A (MxA) proteins-an important intrinsic antiviral factor of mammals known to inhibit IAV as well as other RNA and DNA viral infections. [125] [126] [127] It has been experimentally shown that an avian H5N1 virus with a reverse engineered human H1N1 NP protein can restrict the MxA sensitivity to eliminate species barrier and enhance viral replication 10-fold, 125, 126 indicating IAV can overcome the species barrier from an avian host to replicate successfully in the mammalian system through variation in the NP protein. For instance, the avian H7N9 virus has a crucial Asn52 mutation in the NP gene, causing a reduction in MxA sensitivity within human hosts. 128 This also suggests that pre-adaptive Asn-52 mutation (i.e. resistance to MxA proteins) has been initiated in avian hosts prior to adaptation in mammalian hosts. This was demonstrated experimentally in squirrel monkeys, where the addition of an avian NP segment into a human H3N2 backbone attenuated virus growth. [129] [130] [131] 

The non-structural protein 1 (NS1) protein has been implicated in variable virulence and pathogenicity within different hosts through its interactions of PDZ-binding motif at the C terminus of the protein. 83, [132] [133] [134] In a large-scale comparative genomic approach of all IAV, a specific 11 amino acid long sequence feature variant type (SFVT) located between residues 137-147 of the NS1 protein was statistically associated with a host restriction phenotype, 135 although this has yet to be tested experimentally. Nonetheless, discovery of this SFVT emphasizes the importance of further studying this protein and its potential role in interspecies species transmission.

Mutations in the non-structural protein 2 (NS2)/nuclear export protein (NEP) gene has of late received more attention as an important factor in mammalian adaptation of avian IAV, due to its role as a regulator of transcription and replication of influenza virus genome within the host cell. [136] [137] [138] Importantly, it was shown that substitution Met-16-Ile in the NEP conferred H5N1 avian polymerases the ability to efficiently replicate in mammalian cells by stabilizing the vRNP complex and by enhancing vRNA synthesis. 138

The complete role of PB1-F2 in the virus lifecycle still remains to be elucidated, as it has been shown to both aid and disrupt viral virulence. It is generally understood that PB1-F2's role is subtype and host dependent.

It has been demonstrated that within the 1918-like H1N1 viruses, PB1-F2 interacts with the PB1 protein to increase replication by retaining the polymerase complex in the nucleus longer. 139 In HPAI H5N1, the wildtype PB1-F2 protein was found to have no effect on the severity of infection in mice beyond replication in the lung, but replication was detected systemically in multiple organs of experimentally infected ducks, further supporting the existence of a host-specific function for the protein. 140, 141 

Mutations in the non-coding region of IAV have been shown to mediate cross-species transmission. These non-coding adaptations are due in part to constraints on host mechanisms that restrict the probability of mutational fixation, and consequently, a non-random pattern of mutation is seen across the virus genome in different host species. 142 For instance, many RNA viruses evolve to mimic the CpG dinucleotide frequencies of their hosts. 143, 144 Mammalian DNA sequences contain unmethylated CpG motifs responsible for inducing innate immune responses through interactions with Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) 144, 145 ; however, most mammals protect themselves against autoimmunity by maintaining CpG dinucleotides that are methylated and at low frequency. 145 To accommodate this, IAV has been observed to evolve lower dinucleotide CpG content following interspecies transmission. 143, 146 This phenomenon has also been experimentally confirmed, where the infection with modified human A/WSN/33 influenza virions expressing avian-like increased CpG content was shown to increase ssRNA recognition and immune activation by human plasmacytic dendritic cells. 144 This low CpG preference has been reported in human IAV subtypes such as the H1N1 and H3N2 in comparison with avian IAVs. 143 However, this trend was not observed in H2N2 isolates from the 1957 pandemic, likely due to the short duration in which this subtype circulated in humans. 147 Another parameter of codon usage bias is relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU), which is commonly applied to IAV genomes as a metric of comparison between different host species. 142 in antigenic escape within human hosts. 154 The 2009 pandemic H1N1 (pH1N1) viruses did not contain the Lys-627 or Asn-701 substitutions that were considered indicative of mammalian adaptation, 43, 155, 156 and it now appears these substitutions are not required for swine to human transmission. Indeed, when the mammalian-like Lys-627 and Asn-701 residues were introduced, a significant increase in polymerase activity and viral pathogenesis was observed, 155, 156 but this replicative advantage of the mutation was not necessary for the initial establishment of the avian polymerase in TRS lineage and subsequently human pH1N1 viruses. 157 Instead, partial compensatory mutations Gly590Ser and Glu591Arg were observed to aid polymerase activity of in the lack of the mammalian 627 and 701 residues, providing a possible explanation for the successful transmission of the avian-like residues in mammals. 43, [155] [156] [157] Additionally, the H1N1/2009 virus has reduced sensitivity to host MxA proteins though the interaction with the NP gene, as a result of the TRS-origin NP reassortment. 120, 121, 158 There have been several spillover infections of swine IAVs into humans [159] [160] [161] ; however, increasing evidence suggests reintroduction of the human virus into swine populations is more common. 162, 163 The susceptibility of swine infection by human virus can be attributed to, among many options, the dynamics of host immune development and farming practices. The immune response to IAV infection in swine is similar to that of the human antiviral responses, with experimental evidence showing similar activation and secretion of cytokines is triggered in response to infection with the same virus. 164, 165 Unlike humans, swine are unable to transfer maternal immunoglobulins to porcine embryos due to the existence of a thick placenta comprising six tightly connected tissue layers. 166 The first 24 hours after birth of the newborn pigs is exceptionally crucial for the transfer and intestinal absorption of maternal IgG from colostrum. [166] [167] [168] Although maternal antibodies through suckling can protect newborn piglets to some extent, the piglets are still highly susceptible to new infections. Highdensity commercial farming practices, where piglets are typically sent to market at 6 months of age, can therefore have profound effects on the transmission and diversity of IAVs in various swine populations. 162, 163 

Two equine IAV subtypes, H7N7 and H3N8, were first detected in the 1950s, although the host origin of the former subtype is not known. 169 However, as the H7N7 equine lineage has not been detected in over three decades, it is possible the H7N7 has become extinct in equine hosts. [170] [171] [172] Despite its disappearance, the lineage has been studied extensively to elucidate the factors involved in its emergence and potential virulence in mammalian species. [173] [174] [175] Of note, it has been observed that the equine H7N7 contains an MBCS in the H7 HA protein, 176 which in avian H7 lineages have been implicated in HPAI infections in poultry and have infected humans. 177 The equine lineage virus was also found to be highly pathogenic and neurovirulent in mice without prior adaptation. 173 However, the intracellular cleavage of the equine H7N7 lineage was found to be due to an 11 amino acid motif adjacent to the MBCS that, when inserted into an LPAI H7N3 virus, increased the pathogenicity of infection. 175 In contrast, the H3N8 equine lineage may have originated wholly from an avian IAV source, and these viruses have been shown to undergo frequent intersubtype and intrasubtype reassortments. [178] [179] [180] Interestingly, the H3N8 virus in equine hosts preferentially binds to avian-like α-2,3-SA, where the receptors are abundantly present in the upper respiratory tract of horses. 181, 182 As such, horses are always considered as dead-end hosts, but the interspecies transmission of H3N8 virus from horses to dogs and camels raises the question of whether horses can act as mixing vessels for IAV. 169, 182 

IAV has been detected in canine species since the early 2000s, and there are currently two stably transmitting lineages of IAVs that circulate in dogs: the equine-derived H3N8 and the avian-derived H3N2 strains. 169 The transmission of the equine H3N8 subtype to dogs seems to have occurred en bloc through close contact with infected horses 183 and this virus continues to circulate in dogs with no evidence of reassortment with other subtypes to date. 169 This is further supported by recent findings that despite phylogenetic divergence and genetic change from the equine lineage, canine H3N8 was not observed to be phenotypically different from equine H3N8 strains. 184 The avian-derived H3N2 canine IAV has a much broader host range, and unlike the H3N8 lineage, reassortment with other subtypes, such as with H5N1 and H1N1, has been detected. 185, 186 Recently, an isolated case of an H6N1 virus was detected a dog in Taiwan, likely through contact with infected chicken, and represents the potential for other avian IAV subtypes to emerge in canid hosts. 187 Lineage-specific mutations have been detected in the canine IAVs that suggest adaptive mutations in various segments towards the new canine hosts, 188, 189 but only the role of a leucine residue at position 222 (H3 numbering) has been confirmed as a host-specific adaptation thus far. 190, 191 

There is a need to understand adaptations in IAV that confer interspecies transmission capabilities to drive active surveillance for these mutations in nature and prevent an impending outbreak. Thus, the continued evolution of influenza viruses in its myriad of hosts necessitates further studies that characterize the risk of human transmission in these viruses, to provide a meaningful assessment of pandemic potential. Furthermore, the benefits of such efforts have been seen in the identification and rapid response to recent H7N9 outbreaks in China, 12, 73 while other studies that have characterized mutations that may enable sustained human-to-human transmission or describe pathogenesis have been useful for risk assessment of contemporarily circulating IAVs. 104, 107, 108 However, as there is continued mixing of viruses normally resident in different species, there is value in the continued experimental characterization of circulating viruses, particularly from subtypes known to have caused pandemics and those viruses present in animals to which humans have high exposure.

Ionizing air affects influenza virus infectivity and prevents airborne- transmission OPEN,"Active ionizer prevented 100% (4/4) of guinea pigs from infection. Moreover, the device effectively captured airborne transmitted calicivirus, rotavirus and influenza virus, with recovery rates up to 21% after 40 min in a 19 m 3 room. The ionizer generates negative ions, rendering airborne particles/ aerosol droplets negatively charged and electrostatically attracts them to a positively charged collector plate. Trapped viruses are then identified by reverse transcription quantitative real-time PCR. The device enables unique possibilities for rapid and simple removal of virus from air and offers possibilities to simultaneously identify and prevent airborne transmission of viruses.","Visualization and efficiency of aerosol sampling as determined by electron microscopy. To develop and validate the ionizing technique for collection and identification of viral pathogens, we used several viruses of clinical importance; calicivirus, rotavirus and influenza virus (H3N2, strain Salomon Island) as well as latex particles. Canine calicivirus (CaCV, strain 48) was used as a surrogate 27 for human norovirus, the aetiological agent behind the ""winter vomiting disease"", causing outbreaks of great clinical and economic importance 28 . Rhesus rotavirus was used as a surrogate marker for human rotavirus 29 .

The device (Fig. 1a) consists of a small portable 12 volt operated ionizer, with a collector plate of positive charge attached to the ionizer, attracting negative particles from the air by electrostatic attraction. To determine optimal time collection parameters, latex particles with sizes ranging from < 1 to > 10 μ m were nebulized into a room of 19 m 3 . Testing revealed that 40-60 min was required to eliminate > 90% of free latex particles in the air as determined by real-time particle counting (PortaCount Plus). The particle counter can detect particles with size greater than 0.02 μM. Visualization by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) on grids from active-and inactive ionizer collector plates showed that accumulation of latex particles was dramatically enhanced on active ionizer collector plates compared to the inactive (Fig. 1b,c) . Next, high numbers of rotavirus and formalin-inactivated influenza virus were aerosolized under the same conditions. While, after 40 min the inactive collector plates contained few (< 5) rotavirus and influenza virus, the active collector contained > 50 virus particles, as determined by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), (Fig. 1d,e) .

RT-qPCR. We next determined the capacity of RT-qPCR technology to quantitate the capacity of the ionizer technique to collect and concentrate viruses. Three independent experiments with each of the three viruses were carried out using the same virus concentrations in each experiment (Fig. 2a-c) . Although several steps are involved from collection to detection the system was robust as to reproducibility. The RT-qPCR data shows that the active collector is concentrating and collecting virus 1500-3000 times more efficient as compared to the inactive collector (Table 1) . When different dilutions of virus was used for aerosol production the proportion of aerosolized virus collected on the active collector was normally in the range of 0.1-0.6% for CaCV, rotavirus and influenza virus. A reproducible finding with regard to CaCV was a significant increase in relative recovery at the lowest concentrations increasing to 10-20% of the total amount of virus aerosolized (Table 1) .

Next we determined if collected viruses retained their infectivity after being exposed to negative ions and/or after being exposed to the positively charged collector plate. Five mL of cell culture medium (Eagles Minimal Essential Media (Eagles MEM)) containing 1 × 10 6 peroxidase forming units of rotavirus respectively of CaCV were aerosolized and collected during 40 min to an active collector plate, containing 1 mL of Eagles MEM. CaCV in cell culture medium was also directly exposed to an active and inactive collector plate, without being aerosolized. Viral infectivity was determined essentially as described 30 and the ratio between viral genome copy numbers versus infectivity was compared between aerosolized virus, virus exposed to active-and inactive collector plates and the viral stocks. CaCV exposed to an active collector plate, without being aerosolized, showed a slight reduction in infectivity (~40%) in comparison to virus that have been trapped on an inactive collector plate (Table 2 ). In contrast, the infectivity of aerosolized viruses was greatly reduced by > 97%, indicating that ionization of the aerosol accounts for the vast majority of infectivity reduction, and not the exposure to the charged collector plate.

Further support that ionizing was the mechanism by which viruses lost infectivity comes from experiments were rotavirus was nebulized without ionizing and allowed to be trapped to an inactive collector plate. Collectors were located at 30 cm from the nebulizer. The result concluded that the genome copy versus infectivity ratio was unchanged from that of the viral stock, thus suggesting that inactivation of virus is associated with ionized air.

Ionizing air and electrostatic attraction prevents airborne-transmitted influenza A/Panama virus infection between guinea pigs. Next we took advantage of an established influenza guinea pig model [31] [32] [33] to study if ionizing air and electrostatic attraction could prevent airborne aerosol and droplet transmitted influenza A/Panama (Pan/99) virus infection between guinea pigs. The airborne/ droplet transmission model was established essentially as described 31 using two separate cages with the ionizer placed between the cages (Fig. 3) . Four guinea pigs were infected by intranasal route as described with 5 × 10 3 pfu of Pan/99 31 and placed in cage ""A"" (Fig. 3) . At 30 hours post infection (h p.i.) 4 uninfected guinea pigs were placed in cage ""B"" 15 cm from the cage with infected animals as illustrated in Fig. 3 , with no physical contact. The ionizer was placed between cages ""A"" and ""B"". Two identical experiments were performed, one with active ionizer placed between the cages and one with an inactive ionizer. Uninfected animals in cage ""B"" were exposed for 24 hours with airflow from cage ""A"" hosting the 4 infected guinea pigs and then placed in individually ventilated cages for the next 21 days, to ensure that the only time-point for being infected was the 24 hours when they were exposed to air from infected animals in cage ""A"". RT-qPCR of lung-and trachea biopsies examined at 54 h p.i. from the nasally experimentally infected animals, revealed that 3 out of 4 guinea pigs in both experiments were positive for influenza.

We assessed transmission of infection from animals in cage ""A"" to exposed uninfected animals in cage ""B"" by development of an immune response 21 days post exposure. The results shown in Fig. 4 illustrate that when the ionizer was inactive, 3 of the 4 uninfected but exposed animals developed a serum IgG influenza-specific immune responses. In contrast, none of the 4 animals in cage ""B"" developed an immune response to influenza virus when the ionizer was active (Fig. 4) . Furthermore, influenza virus RNA could be detected by RT-qPCR, albeit at low concentration, on the collector plate from the active ionizer but not with the inactive ionizer, showing that the ionizing device indeed collected virus excreted from the infected animals in cage ""A"".

We describe a simple ionizing device operating at 12 volt that can prevent spread of airborne transmitted viral infections between animals in a controlled setting, whilst simultaneously collecting virus from air for rapid identification. Coupled with sensitive RT-qPCR assays, this sampling method enabled fast detection and highly sensitive quantification of several human clinically important viruses such as influenza virus, rotavirus and calicivirus. The device consists of a small portable ionizer, where a sampling cup of positive charge is attached to the ionizer attracting negative particles from the air. Important advantages with this novel ionizing device is the simple handling, high robustness as well as the wide applicability to airborne pathogens.

The observation that significantly higher numbers of rotavirus and CaCV particles were detected on the active ionizer compared to the inactive ionizer (~1500-3000 times), led to the conclusion that this technique can actively and efficiently collect viral particles from air. Similarly, visualization of latex particles by SEM revealed that latex particles of all sizes investigated were concentrated on the active collector. It is interesting to note that a broad range of particles sizes, from 35 nm to 10 μ m was concentrated, suggesting a wide application range of the technology. However, too large particles may decrease the recovery since these are proposed to remain for less time in the air 33, 34 .

Interestingly, when we aerosolized low amounts of CaCV, (1.56 × 10 4 gene copies and 1.87 × 10 3 gene copies), we observed collection recoveries of 10.6 and 21%, respectively. This markedly increased While the active ionizer prevented 4 of 4 exposed guinea pigs from developing an immune response to influenza virus, 3 of 4 animals were infected when the inactive ionizer was used. Graph shows antibody titers by ELISA before infection (pre-serum 1, 2, 3 and 4) and at day 21 post-exposure to influenza virus (post-serum 1, 2, 3 and 4). Briefly, influenza virus H1N1; (SBL Influenza Vaccine, Sanofi Pasteur, Lyon, France) were coated on ELISA plates and incubated with two-fold dilutions of pre-and post-guinea pig sera, followed by biotinylated rabbit-anti-guinea pig antibody, HRP conjugated streptavidin and TMB substrate as described in Methods. Cut off (dashed line) value (0.284 OD) was the mean of the negative controls + 2SD.

Scientific RepoRts | 5:11431 | DOi: 10.1038/srep11431 efficiency, with smaller amounts of virus distribution in air, could be due to less aggregation of virus-virus or virus-cell debris particles more long lasting airborne, and thus leads to stronger electrostatic attraction by the collector. Furthermore, it is likely that much particles end up at the walls of the collector plate or on areas adjacent to the collector plate on the ionizer; and are subsequently not quantified by real-time PCR; thus underestimating the electrostatic effect. When aerolizing higher virus concentrations, this effect can thus lead to lower estimates of recovery. Using CaCV, rotavirus and influenza virus, we performed three independent experiments for each concentration of aerosolized virus in order to assess the robustness of the assay throughout all steps (collection with active ionizer, RNA extraction, cDNA synthesis and real-time PCR). Although several steps are involved from collection to detection we found the assay to be highly robust since the minimum and maximum quantity of virus from each independent measurement was always within a range of 1 log (Fig. 2) .

Inactivation of viruses by electrostatic attraction has only been briefly investigated 35 . In the present study, rotavirus and CaCV lost significant (> 97%) infectivity (ratio; CaCV from 3.0 × 10 −2 to < 7.8 × 10 −4 and rotavirus from 4.9 × 10 −1 to < 7.6 × 10 −3 ) in ionized air as determined by a ratio of infectivity versus gene copies. The mechanism of inactivation was not explicitly investigated in this study, but inactivation mechanisms may include reactive species and/or increased protein charge levels, which could inactivate virus as previously described 36, 37 . Reduced infectivity has been proposed to be due to reactive oxygen species and ozone, through lipid-and protein peroxidation reactions that may cause damage and destruction to the viral lipid envelope and protein capsid 36 . In particular, protein peroxidation may play a key role in the inactivation of non-enveloped viruses, such as adenovirus, poliovirus and other enteroviruses such as rota-and caliciviruses. Enveloped viruses are suggested to lose infectivity due to lipid peroxidation. However, the cytotoxity of ozone creates a major obstacle for the clinical application of ozone. It has been shown hat increasing the ion concentration of the air efficiently protect chickens from air-born transmission of lethal Newcastle disease virus infection 23 . The exact mechanism of negative ion inactivation of viruses has not been shown and needs to be further investigated. However, in a study using generation of negative and positive ions, influenza virus was inactivated although ozone level was negligible (0.005 ppm or less) 37 .

Our device released a steady-state ozone concentration below the detection limit (0.002 ppm) as tested by VTT (Technical Research Center of Finland, Tampere, Finland) and by Air Resources Board in the US, thus ozone cannot in this case be a contributor of viral inactivation. However, reactive radicals such as •O 2 may be generated, which may contribute to inactivation through damage to either the protein or the nucleic acid structure of the viruses 37 . As infectivity was not lost when virus was nebulized into the air of the room without ionization and only slightly reduced when applied directly on the positively charged collector plate, it is suggested that most reduction of infectivity may be due to increased negative charged levels, presumably resulting in changes in isoelectric point and thus structural changes of the capsid. As the two viruses investigated are non-enveloped, lipid modification can be ruled out.

Most interesting, and of great clinical significance of this study was the novel finding that the ionizing device could detect and prevent influenza virus infection in a controlled setting, mimicking ""authentic"" conditions. Our intranasal infection protocol was essentially as previously described 31, 33 using Harley guinea pigs and 5 × 10 3 plaque forming units (pfu) of Pan/99 influenza virus. As guinea pigs of the Hartley strain are highly susceptible to human influenza A virus strain Pan/99 (H3N2), with an infectious dose (ID 50 ) of 5 pfu 31 , this makes the viral strain most appropriate for these studies. Moreover, Lowen and co-workers have shown 100% transmission of Pan/99 by aerosol to guinea pigs 38, 39 . Previous studies have also shown that the used infectious dose results in a viral growth peak around day 3 p.i. in both lungs and nasal passages in this animal model 31 , a time point when naïve animals in our study was exposed to air from the infected animals.

We found, by assessing development of the immune response, that 3 of 4 uninfected guinea pigs became infected after exposure to animals inoculated with 5 × 10 3 pfu of Pan/99. These susceptibility figures are similar to those of Mubareka and co-workers 33 who found that 2 of 3 guinea pigs became infected following short-range aerosol transmission with a dose of 10 3 pfu whereas 3 of 3 animals became infected with a infectious dose of 10 6 pfu. We examined the immune response at 21 days p.i., a time point when Lowen and co-workers 40 previously have found that naturally Pan/99 infected guinea pigs had developed a significant immune response.

The mode of influenza virus transmission includes direct contact with individuals, exposure to virus-contaminated objects (fomites) and inhalation of infectious aerosols. Previous studies using the guinea pig animal model have indicated that aerosol and not fomites is the principal route of Pan/99 transmission between guinea pigs 33 . Aerosol released virus from inoculated animals could be detected on the active collector plate by RT-qPCR, albeit at very low gene copy numbers. Using the guinea pig as a host model, Lowen et al. 38 showed that aerosol spread of influenza virus between animals is dependent upon both the relative humidity and temperature. They found that low relative humidity of 20-30% and temperature of 5 °C was most favourable, with no transmission detected at 30 °C. In our set-up system, the temperature was between 20-21 °C and relative humidity between 35-36.2%.

The described ionizing device coupled with RT-qPCR assays has a clear diagnostic potential. The easy handling, low cost, free of ozone production, robustness, high efficiency and low-voltage (12 volt) operation enables large-scale use. Locations critical for infectious spread, such as airplanes, hospitals, day-care centres, school environments and other public places could thus be monitored and controlled by the collection and analysis of airborne viruses and other pathogens on the collector plate. The device also show potential for transmission prevention, although the potency needs to be further investigated in real-life settings. We conclude that this innovative technology hold great potential to collect and identify viruses in environmental air.

Study design. The experimental room has grounded metal walls, with a volume of 19 m 3 (B250*L330*H235cm). One active and one inactive ionizer device, designed for collection and analysis of particles in the air, were placed in the room at equal distance (215 cm) from the nebulizer (Aiolos Albatross, Aiolos, Sweden), with a distance of 64 cm between the ionizers. A particle counter (PortaCount Plus, TSI Incorporated, USA) was used before and during the experiment. Before the start of aerosol experiments, the room was emptied on particles by the active ionizer and the collector plate was discarded before the experiments begun and replaced with a new collector plate. The experiments were continued until the particle counts were back to basal level, usually reached within 40 min. Humidity and temperature conditions were measured initial to each aerosol experiments.

Ionizer technology and device. The ionizing device used in this study was developed on the basis of the ion-flow ionizing technology from LightAir AB, Solna, Sweden (www.lightair.com) and was modified for this work by the Department of Microbiology, Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden. The device (size of 13 × 35 cm) was modified by installing a plastic-cup with a conductive surface of 47 mm in diameter (GP plastindustri, Gislaved, Sweden) as the collector plate (Fig. 1) . The collector plate has for safety reasons a very low current, less than 80 μ A, however the ionizer accelerates an extremely high voltage of more than 200,000 eV. The ionizer creates electrons, which will render surface molecules of particles in air negatively charged thus attracting them to the positively charged collector plate. This device generates approximately 35 000 billion electrons per second (www.lightair.com) with a steady-state ozone concentration below the detection limit (0,002 ppm) as tested by VTT Technical Research Center of Finland, Tampere, Finland. It has also been ozone tested and certified by ARB (Air Resources Board) in the US. After the end of the sampling period, the ionizer was turned off, and the collector plate was covered with a lid and stored at − 20 °C until analysis. Viruses captured on the collector plates were analyzed by a RT-qPCR for rotavirus, CaCV and influenza virus, and the results from the active-and inactive ionizers were compared. Scanning-and transmission electron microscopy were used for visualization of collected viruses and latex-particles. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Carbon/Formvar-coated 400 mesh copper grids were placed on the collector during aerosol experiment with influenza-and rotavirus. Grids were then rehydrated in Eagles MEM containing 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) before being negatively stained with 2% phosphotungstic acid and analyzed by TEM. Ten grid squares were analyzed per specimen and the number of virus particles per unit area was calculated.

Collected samples were added on the surface of a polycarbonate 0.6 μ m filter (Nucleopore, Inc) which was fitted to an airtight gadget (GP Plastindustri AB, Gislaved, Sweden). The filter was dried in room temperature, coated with 40 Å thick layer of ionized gold and analyzed by SEM (Philips High Resolution SEM 515). The method has previously been used and reported in studies of cytomegalovirus as well as cerebrospinal fluid 41-43 . Extraction of viral RNA from collector plates. The attached viral particles on the collector plates were lyzed with 1 mL of viral lysis buffer (buffer AVL, QIAamp viral RNA mini kit) added directly into the collector plate and immediately proceeded for extraction of viral RNA using QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Cat.no: 52906 Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Each sample was eluted with 60 μ L of RNase-free water containing 0.04% sodium azide (AVE buffer; Qiagen, Hilden, Germany).

Reversed transcription of extracted viral RNA. 28 μ L of the extracted viral RNA was mixed with 50 pmol of Pd(N) 6 random hexamer primer (GE-Healthcare, Uppsala, Sweden) and quickly chilled on ice for 2 min, followed by the addition of one Illustra Ready-To-Go reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) bead (GE-Healthcare, Uppsala, Sweden) and RNase-free water to a final volume of 50 μ L. For rotavirus, an initially denaturation step at 97 °C for 5 min was performed to denature the dsRNA. The reverse Scientific RepoRts | 5:11431 | DOi: 10.1038/srep11431 transcription (RT) reaction was carried out for 40 min at 42 °C to produce the cDNA later used for real-time PCR.

Quantitative real-time PCR for rotavirus. Rhesus rotavirus was detected and quantified using a LUX real-time PCR assay as described previously 7 . This real-time PCR uses labeled primers with different fluorophores for each VP6 subgroup and external plasmid standards for semi-quantification 44 . Quantitative real-time PCR for CaCV. CaCV was detected and quantified using a SYBR green assay on a ABI prism 7500 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) with primers; (final concentration 200 nM) CaCV-3 (5-ACCAACGGAGGATTGCCATC-3´ (nucleotides 393 to 410 according to GenBank accession no. AF053720) and CaCV-4 (5´-TAGCCGATCCCACAAGAAGACA-3´ (nucleotides 452 to 474), specific for CaCV strain 48. The reaction was performed with 2 μ L cDNA in 10 μ L 2X SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) and water to a final volume of 20 μ L. The following cycling program was used: 95 °C for 10 min followed by 45 cycles of 95 °C for 15 seconds and 60 °C for 1 min. Melting curve analysis was performed immediately after PCR completion, by heating at 95 °C for 15 seconds, followed by cooling to 60 °C for 1 min and subsequent heating to 95 °C at 0.8 °C min −1 with continuous fluorescence recording. Melting temperatures were determined on all samples using the Sequence Detection Software version 1.3.1 (Applied Biosystems) and visualized by plotting the negative derivatives against temperature.

Sampling for infectivity studies with rotavirus and CaCV. To determine whether the ionizing technology has any influence on virus infectivity, rhesus rotavirus and CaCV was aerosolized and collected on active ionizer collector plates, covered with 1 mL of Eagles MEM. Rotavirus (1 × 10 6 peroxidase forming units) and CaCV (1 × 10 6 peroxidase forming units) was aerosolized, each in a total volume of 5 mL and collected for 40 min followed by determination of viral infectivity and number of genome copies.

To determine if ionized air per se had an effect on viral infectivity, rhesus rotavirus was aerosolized and captured on a collector plate containing 1 mL of Eagles MEM, without ionization, placed at a distance of 30 cm from the nebulizer.

To determine if electrostatic attraction of the collector plate affected viral infectivity, rotavirus (2 × 10 5 peroxidase forming units) and CaCV (2 × 10 5 peroxidase forming units) in 1 ml of Eagles MEM, were added to inactive and active collector plates for 40 min. The plates were subsequently stored at − 20 °C until determination of viral infectivity and number of genome copies.

Rotavirus stock and samples were diluted 1:10 in Eagles MEM and subsequently diluted in two-fold dilutions. Determination of viral infectivity was performed as previously described on confluent Green monkey kidney cells (MA104) in 96-well plates 30 . CaCV infectivity was determined essentially as for rotavirus with the modification that samples were added to confluent Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cells in 48-well plates and infectivity determined as previously described 45 and confirmed by RT-qPCR. To determine the reduction of infectivity, the ratio of viral genome copy numbers versus infectivity was compared between aerosolized virus, virus exposed to active-and inactive collector plates and the viral stock.

Animals. Guinea 

We use a guinea pig animal model to investigate whether the ionizing technique could prevent transmission of influenza virus infection, since this model have successfully been used as a model of aerosol transmission studies of influenza virus 31, 33 . Human influenza A virus, strain Pan/99 (kindly provided by Peter Palese, New York, USA) was used since this strain has been shown to effectively replicates in the upper respiratory airways and effectively transmit by aerosols but not by fomites in guinea pigs. Female guinea pigs, 300-350 g, strain Hartley, were housed at Astrid Fagreaus Laboratorium, Solna, Stockholm (Ethical permission N177/11). Four animals were anesthetized by an intra peritoneal injection of ketamin (Ketalar el Ketaminol) 50 mg/kg and xylazin (Rompun) 5 mg/ kg and infected intranasally with 5 × 10 3 pfu of Pan/99 virus in 100 uL (50 uL in each nostril). All four infected animals were placed into the experimental cage (Fig. 3, cage ""A"") . At 30 h p.i., four naïve uninfected guinea pigs were placed next to the transmission cage (Fig. 3, cage "" B"") at a distance of 15 cm. Air flowed freely between cages, but direct contact between inoculated and exposed animals was prohibited.

The four naïve guinea pigs were exposed for 24 hours and then put into separately individually ventilated cages, to ensure that no aerosol transmission occurred between the animals. Two identical experiments were performed, with an active and inactive ionizer. The nasally infected animals were removed after the exposure time and lung and trachea biopsies were collected (54 h p.i.) and investigated for influenza virus by RT-qPCR. At 21 days post exposure, serum was collected from the uninfected exposed guinea pigs and the prevalence of antibodies against influenza A virus was determined by ELISA. Sera Scientific RepoRts | 5:11431 | DOi: 10.1038/srep11431 taken before exposure to the infected guinea pigs (pre-sera), and 21 days days after exposure (post-sera) were analyzed from each animal.

Briefly, 96-well plates (Nunc, 96 F MAXISORP, Roskilde, Denmark) where coated with formalin-inactivated Influenza A virus H1N1 (SBL Influenza Vaccine, Sanoil Pasteur, Lyon, France) diluted in coating buffer (0.05 M sodium carbonate buffer, pH 9.5-9.7) at 5 μg/mL and incubated at + 4 °C over night. Wells were washed x3 (0.9% NaCl and 0.05% Tween-20) and blocked with 3% BSA in PBS buffer for 1 hour at 37 °C. Serum samples were diluted 1:100 and further in two-fold dilutions in dilution buffer (PBS containing 0.5% BSA and 0.05% Tween-20), and incubated for 90 min at 37 °C. Plates were then washed x5 and incubated for 60 min at 37 °C with secondary biotinylated goat-anti guinea pig antibody (Vector, BA-7000) and horseradish-peroxidase (HRP) conjugated Streptavidin (DAKO, Denmark, P0397), both at a dilution of 1:3000. Plates were then washed x5 and 100 μL of tetramethyl benzidine (TMB) substrate (Sigma Aldrich, T-0440-16) was added to each well, the reaction developed for 10 min and stopped by addition of 100 μL of 2 M H 2 SO 4 . Absorbance was measured at 450 nm in an ELISA reader (VersaMax, Molecular Devices). Cut off values were calculated as the average value of negative controls OD and 2 times the SD.

Extraction of influenza RNA from guniea pig tissue. RNA was extracted from trachea and lung tissue of infected guinea pig. Briefly, 100-250 mg of tissue were homogenized with a tissue homogenizer and total RNA extracted with RNAeasy Midi Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions.

To detect and quantify influenza A virus on the collector plates as well as in guinea pig tissue samples, we used a One-Step Taq Man real-time RT-PCR assay 46 with primers F1-mxA (150 nM) (5´-AAGACCAATYCTGTCACCTCTGA-3´), F3-mxA (150 nM) (5´-CAAGACCAATCTTGTCACCTCT GAC-3´) and R1-mxA (900 nM) (5´-TCCTCGCTCACTGGGCA -3´) and probes P1-Mx (110 nM) (5´-FAM-TTGTGTTCACGCTCACC-MGB-3´) and P2-Mx (110 nM) (5´-FAM-TTTGTATTCACGCTCACCG-MGB -3´), with the Rotor-Gene Probe RT-PCR Kit (Qiagen). The real-time PCR reaction was performed in a Corbett Rotor-Gene 6000 (Qiagen) with the following cycling protocol: 50 °C for 10 min, followed by 45 cycles of 95 °C for 5 seconds and 57 °C for 15 seconds.

HVAC filtration for controlling infectious airborne disease transmission in indoor environments: Predicting risk reductions and operational costs,"This work describes and applies a methodology for estimating the impact of recirculating heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning (HVAC) particle filters on the control of size-resolved infectious aerosols in indoor environments using a modified version of the Wells-Riley model for predicting risks of infectious disease transmission. Estimates of risk reductions and associated operational costs of both HVAC filtration and equivalent outdoor air ventilation are modeled and compared using a case study of airborne transmission of influenza in a hypothetical office space. Overall, recirculating HVAC filtration was predicted to achieve risk reductions at lower costs of operation than equivalent levels of outdoor air ventilation, particularly for MERV 13e16 filters. Medium efficiency filtration products (MERV 7e11) are also inexpensive to operate but appear less effective in reducing infectious disease risks.","The airborne transmission of respiratory pathogens such as measles, tuberculosis, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), influenza, rhinovirus, and others in indoor environments and the associated risk of infection presented to uninfected occupants are governed by several complex physical and biological processes. Communicable respiratory illnesses lead to large excesses in expenses associated with healthcare, absence from work, and lost worker productivity [1] , but the control of airborne infectious disease transmission in indoor environments is not yet entirely understood [2] . Several studies have shown that building design and operational characteristics such as increased outdoor air ventilation rates, lower occupant density, and use of UV germicidal irradiation can reduce the risk of infectious disease transmission inside buildings [3e7] . Similarly, commonly available particle filters in recirculating heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems may also be used to reduce the risk of airborne infectious disease transmission, depending on the nature of infectious aerosols and some important building characteristics [2,4,8e12] .

However, key questions remain about (i) the effectiveness of particle filtration for controlling airborne infectious aerosols, (ii) the associated risk reductions achievable with HVAC filtration, and (iii) the relative costs of risk reduction by HVAC filtration versus other control mechanisms such as increased outdoor air ventilation rates. To address these questions, this article describes and applies a methodology for estimating the impact of recirculating HVAC filters on the control of size-resolved infectious aerosols in indoor environments using a modified version of the Wells-Riley model for predicting risks of airborne infectious disease transmission. Estimates of likely risk reductions and associated operational costs of both HVAC filtration and equivalent outdoor air ventilation are modeled and compared using a case study of airborne transmission of influenza in a hypothetical office space in multiple climates.

Aerosol transmission has been shown to be a predominant route of transmission for a number of communicable diseases, including rhinovirus [7, 13] , influenza [14e16], tuberculosis [17] , and SARS [18] . There is also growing empirical evidence that increased outdoor air ventilation rates in buildings can reduce the transmission of some of these same diseases [19] , which further confirms the likely importance of airborne transmission via infectious aerosols in indoor environments. One often-used approach to estimating the risks associated with airborne transmission of respiratory diseases is the Wells-Riley model, as shown in Equation (1) [20] .

where P infection ¼ the probability of infection; cases ¼ the number of infection cases; susceptibles ¼ number of susceptible individuals; I ¼ number of infector individuals; p ¼ pulmonary ventilation rate of a person (m 3 /hour); q ¼ quanta generation rate (1/hr); t ¼ exposure time (hr); and Q oa ¼ room ventilation rate with pathogen-free air (m 3 /hour).

The Wells-Riley model is based on a concept of ""quantum of infection,"" whereby the rate of generation of infectious airborne particles (or quanta) can be used to model the likelihood of an individual in a steady-state well-mixed indoor environment being exposed to the infectious particles and subsequently succumbing to infection. Note that some researchers have also expanded this model to include time-varying exposures [21] and others have developed zonal versions that account for incomplete mixing in an indoor environment [22] .

The quantum of infection term (q) in this risk model is not an actual physical unit; it is a hypothetical infectious dose unit that is typically back calculated from observational epidemiological studies. Conceptually, it describes the number of infectious particles in a way that implicitly accounts for both the amount of particles generated over time and the infectivity of particles, which also inherently captures susceptibility of individuals and particle size effects such as the probability of deposition in relevant regions of the respiratory system. Because of the empirical nature of the model in Equation (1), existing literature on quanta generation rates (q) is relatively limited. Published ranges of q for several infectious airborne diseases are shown in Table 1 .

It is also important to note the assumption of well-mixed indoor environments in this model and in previous derivations of quanta generation rates. Because of this assumption, the model cannot distinguish between long-range transport of smaller infectious aerosols (i.e., droplet nuclei) and close-contact airborne spread of infectious diseases that occurs when expelled infectious aerosols deposit directly on susceptible parts of the human body (i.e., large droplets). However, quanta generation rates are usually back calculated from scenarios where long-range transport was very likely a major factor. For example, Rudnick and Milton (2003) estimated quanta generation rates of 15e128 per hour for influenza (depending on steady-state or dynamic assumptions) using data from a grounded passenger airplane where the majority of passengers throughout the airplane acquired the influenza virus from one infected individual [23] . While the quanta generation rates in this case may have accounted for some close-range transport, it is reasonable to assume that many passengers would also have been infected by longer-range aerosol transport.

Despite some of these limitations, the Wells-Riley model has been used previously to show that some building factors, particularly outdoor air ventilation rates, can be an important removal mechanism for airborne infectious agents [17, 30, 31] . Because the removal mechanisms of any aerosol (including HVAC filtration) are primarily functions of particle size [32, 33] , it is important to consider the actual particle size distributions of infectious aerosols in indoor environments for use with this model. Although the original Wells-Riley model does not explicitly account for the sizeresolved nature of infectious aerosols, modifications have been made by others to do so [4, 34, 35] . Therefore, the next sections describe previous efforts to integrate other size-dependent loss terms into the Wells-Riley equation and then review existing knowledge of particle size distributions of infectious aerosols to inform the modeling effort herein. Infectious particle size distributions are explored with the specific intent of generalizing for use with the particle size range relevant to a common HVAC filtration standard: ASHRAE Standard 52.2 [36] .

From a mass balance perspective, HVAC filtration and other removal mechanisms are treated similarly to outdoor air ventilation because they both can be used to reduce indoor concentrations of airborne infectious particles. In fact, the steady-state Wells-Riley equation has previously been modified in other investigations to include additional removal terms other than outdoor air ventilation, including filtration by personal respirators, UV degradation, particle deposition, and HVAC particle filtration [3, 4, 10, 31] . Equation (2) follows the same procedures by including both HVAC filtration and deposition loss terms.

where V ¼ indoor air volume (m 3 ); l ventilation ¼ outdoor air ventilation rate (Q oa /V, 1/hr); k filtration ¼ infectious particle removal rate due to filtration (1/hr); and k deposition ¼ infectious particle deposition rate (1/hr). Deposition removal rates (k deposition ) depend primarily on particle size, density, and room characteristics such as airspeeds and surface areas [35, 37] . Filtration removal rates (k filtration ) depend on the rate of airflow through the HVAC filter (Q filter ), the fractional operation time of the HVAC system (f HVAC ), and the size-resolved infectious particle removal efficiency of the filter or air-cleaning device installed (h filter ) as shown in Equation (3). The airflow rate through the filter divided by the volume of the indoor air space served and multiplied by fractional operation time is also called the recirculation rate (l recirculated ).

where f HVAC ¼ fractional HVAC operation time (À); Q filter ¼ airflow rate through filter (m 3 /hr); h filter ¼ particle removal efficiency of the filter (À); and l recirculated ¼ recirculation rate through the HVAC filter (1/hr). Depending on the nature of the virus or bacteria of concern inside of expelled droplets or droplet nuclei, some rate of inactivation may also occur as aerosols are exposed to indoor air [34] . This rate has been explored for some viruses [38, 39] and is dependent in part on environmental conditions such as relative humidity. However, we have excluded this loss rate in this work in [20] part because of a lack of existing data on size-resolved inactivation rates for multiple infectious aerosols of concern and in part because quanta generation rates, when back calculated using Equation (1), should inherently account for any inactivation that occurred during the case study period. Additionally, although Equations 2 and 3 are shown without explicitly considering particle size effects, both the filtration and deposition loss parameters (k deposition and k filtration ) are size-dependent. Therefore, the following sections describe existing knowledge of the particle size distributions of infectious aerosols.

When an individual coughs, sneezes, speaks, or breathes, droplets consisting of liquid water, proteins, salts, and various other organic and inorganic matter are expelled into the air. If the emitter is infected with a particular respiratory infection, those droplets may also contain smaller infectious particles themselves, which may be viruses or bacteria depending on the type of infection. Viruses are typically an order of magnitude or more smaller in size than bacteria: w20e200 nm for viruses vs. w0.2e5 mm for most bacteria [40] . In other explorations of the impacts of particle filtration and other size-dependent processes on virus and bacteria disease transmission, some researchers have assumed that the individual virus or bacteria particles are aerosolized and exist suspended as individual organisms [11, 41] ; however, it is likely more appropriate to consider the particles as larger expelled droplets that contain aggregates of the smaller infectious particles within Refs. [8, 35, 42, 43] .

Once expelled from a high relative humidity environment (the human body) to a relatively less humid environment (most indoor environments), droplets rapidly decrease in size as the surrounding liquid evaporates. Several studies have shown that this liquid evaporation typically occurs within less than 1 s of emission for particles smaller than w50 mm in diameter [44] . After rapid evaporation, droplet nuclei containing the mix of solid particles (including any infectious particles) remain. Droplet nuclei typically have particle diameters that are 40e50% of the original droplet size [35, 39] .

It is commonly believed that droplet nuclei particles average 1e 3 mm in diameter [42] , although several recent studies have shown considerable variation in the size distribution of expelled droplets and droplet nuclei. Nicas et al. [35] summarized nearly 50 years of measurements of particle size distributions of droplets emitted by humans during coughing and sneezing and reported that coughgenerated aerosols could be divided into two lognormally distributed modes: (i) a small particle size distribution with a geometric mean diameter of w10 mm (ii) a large particle size distribution with a geometric mean diameter of w160 mm. However, the smaller particle size distribution was found to contain the majority of cough particles (w70%). Given that the same authors described some evidence of smaller particles being more infectious than larger

particles, it appears that smaller (i.e., <10 mm) particles are likely of greatest concern for droplet nuclei transmission of infectious diseases. Several more recent studies utilizing more advanced measurement techniques have revealed a general consensus that the majority (often 80e90%) of particles expelled during various human activities are actually smaller than 1e2 mm in diameter [45e 50], although it is not clear whether actual virus content scales more with particle number, surface area, or volume distributions.

While previous studies have been helpful for identifying the size of particles expelled during human activities, several more recent studies have utilized more sophisticated techniques (e.g., quantitative polymerase chain reaction, or q-PCR) to identify the presence of viruses or bacteria in expelled droplets and droplet nuclei collected on multi-stage bioaerosol samplers [46,51e55] . These studies offer insight not only into what size aerosols exist after expulsion from the human body, but in what size-fractions are viruses or bacteria actually present and are thus of most concern for infectious disease transmission. Several of these recent studies have focused on the particle size distributions of influenza in indoor and personal airborne particulate matter in indoor environments, as summarized in Table 2 .

In these recent investigations, the amount of influenza virus content in a range of particle sizes was quantified using a variety of bioaerosol samplers installed in a variety of locations and indoor environments. Sampling environments included healthcare centers, daycare centers, hospital emergency rooms, simulated patient rooms, and in the coughing/breathing zone of both people and manikins. Sampling locations within each environment included both stationary indoor measurements and personal measurements. Importantly, the variety of aerosol samplers used also varied in their particle size cut-off points. However, each study characterized Fortunately for this work, the size bins from the selected studies aligned relatively closely to the three size bins outlined in the most commonly used HVAC filtration standard in the U.S., ASHRAE Standard 52.2, which classifies filtration efficiency in bins of 0.3e 1 mm, 1e3 mm, and 3e10 mm [36] . Therefore, we adjusted each of the reported size distributions in Table 2 to fit within those three particle size ranges by assuming that the virus content has a uniform distribution in each particle size bin. These assumed distributions are shown in the rightmost columns in Table 2 . Although this assumption introduces some uncertainty, we have no way of directly quantifying the magnitude at this time. We do however explore uncertainty in a later section using both the mean and relative standard deviations of the assumed viral size distributions, as summarized in the bottom of Table 2 , which can place likely bounds on risk estimates made using Equation (2).

On average across all of these studies, we estimate that approximately 20% of influenza virus content is associated with particles in the 0.3e1 mm size range in these recent studies; 29% is associated with the 1e3 mm size range, and 51% is associated with the 3e10 mm size range. The smallest size range has the highest relative standard deviation from that mean (70%), followed by the middle size range (44%) and the largest size range (36%). At this point, we have reviewed enough background knowledge of the nature of infectious particles emitted during various human activities and the likelihood of those aerosols containing virus content to inform a mechanistic study of droplet nuclei transport and control based on these infectious aerosol characteristics.

This work uses the modified particle-size-resolved version of the Wells-Riley model in Equation (2) to estimate the risk reductions likely achievable by common HVAC filters for a case study of influenza transmission in a hypothetical office building. Estimates of operational costs are also made for both HVAC filtration and an equivalent amount of outdoor air ventilation in a range of climate zones across the U.S. in order to compare the likely costs of both control methods. The next sections describe our methodology for connecting the modified Wells-Riley model to HVAC filtration (i.e., MERV) and estimating operational costs.

To connect the modified Wells-Riley equation to HVAC filtration, we first linked likely infectious particle removal efficiency with the Minimum Efficiency Reporting Value (MERV) classification from ASHRAE Standard 52.2. A summary of the MERV table from Standard 52.2 is shown in Table 3 along with best estimates of particle filtration efficiency for lower-MERV filters that have no MERV requirement for certain particle size bins (i.e., MERV 4e11). Average values across each of the 0.3e1 mm and 1e3 mm size bins were taken from a previous study that measured the in-situ removal efficiency of lower efficiency filters [56] ; these values also align similarly to other previous studies [57, 58] .

Subsequently, the range of infectious particle size distributions for influenza virus from Table 2 were linked to the filter removal efficiencies in Table 3 by an infectious particle size-weighting procedure, as shown in Equation (4).

where h filter ¼ infectious particle size weighted filtration efficiency (À); h i ¼ size-resolved particle filtration efficiency for the geometric mean diameter of particle size bin i (from Table 3 ); and F i ¼ the fraction of virus content associated with particle size bin i (from Table 2 ). Because there are multiple references for the distribution of influenza virus content in size-fractioned aerosols, we introduced an estimate of uncertainty by assuming the infectious particle size distributions from each environment in each referenced study were equally likely to be present in the modeled indoor environment. These distributions for each filter are shown in Table 4 , along with the mean infectious particle removal efficiency for each filter averaged across each study in Table 2 Mean filtration efficiency values for infectious droplet nuclei are estimated to range from 10.5% for MERV 4 filters to 99.9% for HEPA filters. Assumptions across the wide range of infectious particle size distributions summarized in Table 2 lead to infectious droplet nuclei removal efficiencies that vary by as much as 19% absolutely (although the range narrows for higher MERV filters because of high removal efficiencies for all particle size ranges).

While Table 4 provides estimates for assumed removal efficiencies for various MERV filters across the size ranges of concern for infectious droplet nuclei transmission, other important parameters for determining the impact of filtration on infectious disease risk in indoor environments include the infectious particle deposition rate and the recirculation rate through the HVAC system (which is a function of specific building characteristics).

Particle deposition rates (k deposition ) are important for removal of indoor aerosols but are highly variable depending on the nature of the indoor environment [59, 60] . The original Wells-Riley model neglected particle deposition; however, for the particle sizes considered, it is more appropriate to account for deposition [4, 34, 35] . For simplicity, we assume constant values of k deposition based on size-resolved values used in Riley et al. (2002) [33, 61] .

Using a geometric mean diameter between 0.3 and 1 mm (0.55 mm), between 1 and 3 mm (1.7 mm), and between 3 and 10 mm (5.5 mm), deposition rates were estimated as w0.10 per hour, w0.45 per hour, and w3.0 per hour, respectively (taken directly from their Fig. 3 ). When combined with the mean infectious particle size distributions from Table 2 , these lead to a mean size-weighted estimate of w1.7 per hour for k deposition for particles containing the influenza virus. Values for k deposition ranged from w1.0 to w2.3 per hour depending on the range of infectious particle size distributions assumed from Table 2 . These values for k deposition for influenza were kept constant in each model scenario.

This section relies on a case study of a particular indoor environment (an office) to demonstrate the likely impacts that HVAC filtration can have on the risk of spreading a particular airborne infectious disease (influenza). The methods used herein are generalizable and repeatable for other environments although the results are limited to assumptions for the hypothetical environment.

We considered a hypothetical 500 m 2 office building with 3 m ceilings (V ¼ 1500 m 3 ). We assume the office space has 25 occupants, one of which is infected with the influenza virus (I ¼ 1; susceptibles ¼ 24). Per ASHRAE Standard 62.1 [62] , the minimum outdoor air ventilation rate should be 8.5 m 3 /hr per person þ 1.1 m 3 /hr per m 2 of floor area, which is equivalent to w760 m 3 /hr in the assumed space (yielding an air exchange rate (AER) ¼ 0.51/hr). Assuming the outdoor air supply fraction of total airflow is 25% [63] , the total supply airflow rate is w3000 m 3 /hr, with w2300 m 3 /hr provided as recirculated air. The removal rate due to recirculated air filtration is thus w1.52 Â h filter per hour (where 2300 m 3 /hr divided by 1500 m 3 ¼ 1.52/hour; multiply by particle removal efficiency to get k filtration , assuming that f HVAC ¼ 1). In the office we assumed that adult occupants work 8-h days (t ¼ 8 h) and that all occupants have an average breathing rate (p) of 0.67 m 3 /hr [64] . We relied on a central estimate of previously published values of quanta generation rate (q) for influenza: q ¼ 100 per hour. However we also explore the sensitivity to our modeling results using both upper bounds (q ¼ 500 per hour) and lower bounds (q ¼ 15 per hour) in the uncertainty analysis.

Although outdoor air ventilation rates have been shown to decrease the risk of spreading some infectious airborne diseases, introducing more ventilation air also comes with an energy penalty. Conversely, the introduction of higher efficiency filtration typically increases the pressure drop across the filter, which, in commercial systems with variable air volume fans and airflow controls, will generally increase the amount of energy required to move the same amount of airflow. The next sections describe methods to estimate the annual costs of both outdoor air ventilation and various levels of filtration.

The amount of energy required to condition excess ventilation air varies according to the magnitude of outdoor airflow rates, climate conditions, and system and equipment efficiency. However, approximate estimates of the amount of energy required to condition the sensible load from outdoor air ventilation can be made using metrics of heating-degree-days (HDD) and cooling-degreedays (CDD) and by making assumptions about equipment efficiency and system operational times [65, 66] . An approximation of the amount of energy required for heating on an annual basis was made using Equation (5) . This equation assumes that outdoor air ventilation rates do not vary during operational times. 

where E heating ¼ energy required for heating (MJ); r air ¼ density of air (1.2 kg/m 3 ); C p,air ¼ specific heat capacity of air (1000 J/(kg-K)); HDD ¼ heating degree days during times of building operation (Kdays); h heating ¼ conversion efficiency of heating equipment (À); and a ¼ units conversion factor (24 h/day Â 10 À6 MJ/J). Similarly, the amount of energy required for cooling on an annual basis was approximated using Equation (6) (and utilizing the same assumptions as Equation (5)):

where E cooling ¼ electricity required for cooling (kWh); h cooling ¼ electric efficiency of cooling equipment (À);

CDD ¼ cooling degree days during times of building operation (Kdays); and b ¼ units conversion factor (24 h/day Â 0.277 kWh/ MJ Â 10 À6 MJ/J). Finally, annual energy costs were estimated by multiplying average utility rates (assuming these are constant for simplicity) by the amount of delivered energy required. We assumed that electricity was used for cooling and natural gas was used for heating. We estimated the cost of outdoor air delivery in the case study office environment for four different locations across the United States: Chicago, IL, Charlotte, NC, Houston, TX, and Phoenix, AZ. We assumed that a 90% efficient natural gas boiler or furnace was used for heating and the air-conditioning equipment had a constant electric coefficient of performance (COP) of 3.0 (or approximately SEER 12, which is in line with many relatively new existing commercial buildings [67] ). We assumed that the office building did not operate continuously year-round, but that it operated w31% of the time (i.e., 11 h per day from 7 am to 6 pm to accommodate staff members, excluding holidays and weekends). We used the defined operational schedule and hourly TMY3 (typical meteorological year) weather data to calculate HDDs and CDDs for each hour of assumed operation [68] . HDDs and CDDs were calculated using a base temperature of 18.3 C. Estimates of HDDs and CDDs utilized in the model are shown in Table 5 , along with estimated annual costs of supplying one unit of outdoor ventilation air in each climate. We assumed electricity rates were constant at $0.12/kWh and that natural gas rates were $8/MMBTU (1 MMBTU ¼ 1055 MJ). These are generally in line with national average rates although we do not explore geographic variations for simplicity.

In commercial environments with variable speed fans, any additional cost of HVAC filtration can be expressed first in terms of additional fan power required to overcome the additional pressure drop associated with a higher efficiency (typically higher pressure drop) filter. This is not necessarily the case in many smaller commercial environments [69] , but is a reasonable assumption for this analysis. The additional fan power required to deliver a particular airflow rate through an HVAC system can be estimated in Equation (7).

where W fan ¼ power draw required for filtration (W); Q filter ¼ airflow rate through the HVAC filter (m 3 /s); DP avg ¼ average pressure drop across filter (Pa); h fan ¼ fan efficiency (assumed 70% constant as in Bekö et al., 2008) ; and h motor ¼ motor efficiency (assumed 65% constant as in Bekö et al., 2008 [70] ). The total fan energy cost can be estimated using Equation (8) .

C fan energy ¼ W fan t operating P electricity (8) where C fan energy ¼ cost required to overcome filter pressure drop ($); t operating ¼ amount of time that the building is occupied (hours); and P electricity ¼ electric price ($/Wh). The fan was assumed to operate 100% of the time that the building was occupied.

To estimate the total cost of filtration, one must also consider the initial cost of the filtration product itself, the number of filters required for each installation, the typical lifespan of filtration products, and the labor for filter installation and subsequent disposal at the end of its useful life [70] . Labor costs were estimated directly from Bekö et al. (2008) as $12 per filter installation and $5 per filter disposal. Assuming each filter is 24 00 Â 24 00 (0.6 Â 0.6 m), the number of filters required for the office environment was estimated by (i) dividing the airflow rate through the HVAC filter by an assumed constant 2 m/s face velocity, which yields the approximate area of filtration required, and (ii) determining the number of 24 00 Â 24 00 (61 Â 61 cm) filters to achieve that approximate area, rounding to the nearest whole number. This yielded one filter required in the hypothetical office environment. Annual labor costs were estimated by multiplying the labor cost of changing one filter ($12 þ $5 ¼ $17 per filter) by the estimated number of filter replacements during one year of operation. The initial costs of filtration products and the typical expected filter life spans were taken from an anonymous contact in the commercial filtration industry, as shown in Table 6 . The AHU fan in the office environment was assumed to operate 2717 h per year (or 31%) as described in Section 3.4.1.

This section first describes results from the infection risk modeling effort, followed by results from cost estimates and cost comparisons between filtration and outdoor air ventilation. Fig. 1 shows the predicted risk of infection by the influenza virus during an 8-h workday in the hypothetical office building with 25 occupants using a range of HVAC filters installed in the constant operation HVAC system. The central estimates represent risks predicted using Equation (2) with a quanta generation rate of 100 per hour and the mean assumption of viral particle size distributions from Table 2 . The error bars represent minimum and maximum risks predicted according to the range of assumptions for viral particle size distributions in Table 2 and infectious aerosol removal efficiencies in Table 4 (assuming the same quanta generation rate).

Using the central estimate for infectious particle size distributions (i.e., the mean from Table 2 ) and q ¼ 100 per hour, 15% of the susceptible occupants (4 out of 24) are estimated to acquire the flu virus from the sole infectious individual if the building is operated without a filter installed. The various assumptions for infectious aerosol size distributions from Table 2 impact estimates of absolute risk in each scenario, although trends across filter scenarios are unaffected. For example, the range of assumptions for size-resolved distributions of virus content in indoor aerosols results in an estimate of the absolute risk of acquiring influenza of between 12% and 21% without a filter installed.

Continuing with the central estimate of infectious particle size distributions, even a relatively low efficiency filter (MERV 7) is predicted to reduce the number of infected individuals by 1 (to 12% risk). Increasing to MERV 13 or higher likely prevents another individual from airborne influenza infection (to 10% or lower risk). Finally, increasing to MERV 16 or HEPA filtration has the same effect of lowering the likely number of infected individuals to 2 (with a w35e40% reduction relative to no or low filtration efficiency). For MERV 13 and greater, risk reductions are limited not by filtration efficiency but by the amount of airflow recirculating through the HVAC system and filter. Increasing recirculation rates may show stronger impacts of higher efficiency filters; however, these results Table 5 Climate conditions (HDD and CDD) and annual cost of outdoor air delivery used for the office environment under the assumed operational schedule in each location. suggest that MERV 13 can reduce the risk of influenza infection by as many as two individuals in this environment. For reference, one avoided influenza case has been estimated to provide approximately $375 in economic benefits in the United States [1] .

While the infection risk reductions shown in the previous section are absolute, we can also explore trends in risk reductions for each filtration case using a measure of relative risk (RR), as shown in Fig. 2 . RR values use the ""no filter"" condition as a baseline; thus, each RR is calculated as the probability of infection with a particular filter installed divided by the probability of infection without a filter installed. The black line shows the RR in the office assuming the mean assumption for infectious aerosol size distributions and a quanta generation rate of 100 per hour. The gray area shows how RR responds to the different assumptions for viral particle size distributions in Table 2 .

In Fig. 2 , MERV 4 filters are shown to provide only a 6e7% reduction in risk relative to no filtration. MERV 7 filters are likely to provide a 19e25% reduction in risk (RR ¼ 0.75e0.81) and MERV 11 filters are expected to provide 28e35% risk reductions (RR ¼ 0.65e 0.72). MERV 13 and greater levels of filtration are expected to provide between 31% and 47% risk reductions compared to an environment without filtration installed (RR ¼ 0.53e0.69).

Although not shown here, we also explored the effects of assuming different values of quanta generation rates for the influenza virus (ranging from 15 to 500 per hour). Ranges in assumptions for q greatly impact absolute risks as Equation (2) demonstrates (and more so than assumptions for particle size distributions of viral content), but relative risks remain largely unchanged (although the bounds on uncertainty are higher).

The following sections summarize results from the operational cost analysis for both HVAC filtration and outdoor air ventilation.

Using the costs and physical properties for filters described in Table 5 in conjunction with the procedure outlined in Section 3.4.2, estimates of the annual costs of filtration were made for each filtration scenario. Results are shown graphically in Fig. 3 and in tabular form in Table 7 . Total annual costs of filtration are divided into annual fan energy costs, filter purchase costs, and labor costs (which includes the cost of disposal).

Annual HVAC filtration costs are predicted to range from $112 for the MERV 

In order to compare estimates of annual HVAC filtration costs to the annual costs for delivering outdoor air ventilation, Fig. 4 shows annual costs of both filtration and outdoor air (OA) ventilation normalized by unit removal rate of each scenario. This normalized filtration cost is the total cost of filtration (i.e., the sum of annual labor, filter, and fan energy costs) divided by the average estimate of the infectious aerosol removal rate (i.e., the mean infectious removal efficiency from Table 4 multiplied by the HVAC recirculation rate in the space). This provides a measure of the cost of each control mechanism relative to its ability to remove infectious droplet nuclei from indoor air in units of $ per 1/hr. Fig. 4 contains data for both outdoor air ventilation in each of the four U.S. cities described previously and each level of HVAC filtration operating in the hypothetical office environment (assuming the central estimate of viral content distributions in indoor aerosols).

According to Fig. 4 , MERV 13 and 14 filtration products are estimated to provide the least expensive removal mechanism in this office environment (in terms of $USD per 1/hour of infectious droplet nuclei removal rate). This is attributed to both relatively high effectiveness (as described in Sections 4.1 and 4.2) and relatively low costs of operation (as shown in Fig. 3 ). Even HEPA filtration is expected to cost less on an annual basis than outdoor air ventilation in all climates. MERV 4 is the only filtration product that is more expensive than outdoor air ventilation according to this metric, primarily because of its very low effectiveness. Although this approach allows for direct comparison between OA ventilation and HVAC filtration, it does not provide information about achievable risk reductions in particular environments.

In order to compare costs of operation directly to estimates of risk reductions for both HVAC filtration and OA ventilation, Fig. 5 plots the mean predicted relative risk (RR) values from the Wells-Riley modeling (from Fig. 2 ) versus the total cost of providing that same risk reduction with both outdoor air ventilation in each climate and with each level of HVAC filtration. To compare OA ventilation in each location directly to HVAC filtration, OA ventilation rates have been adjusted to achieve the same removal rate as that of each level of HVAC filtration. For example, a MERV 15 filter is expected to achieve 1.37 per hour in infectious droplet nuclei removal in the office environment with the mean assumption for infectious particle size distributions; for outdoor air ventilation to achieve the same risk reduction as filtration, the office HVAC system would need to provide 1.37 additional air changes per hour of outdoor air ventilation. Therefore, OA ventilation and HVAC filtration can be thought of as equivalent in terms of risk reduction (on the y-axis), but will differ in their cost estimates (on the x-axis). For each of the four geographic locations, the cost per unit ($ per 1/hr) ventilation energy costs from Table 5 was used to estimate the cost of providing this equivalent reduction.

As Fig. 5 shows, for each level of risk reduction achievable by the use of every level of HVAC filtration except MERV 4, filtration is estimated to be less expensive on an annual basis than equivalent outdoor air ventilation in each of the four climate zones. MERV 13 and MERV 14 filters appear to achieve an optimal combination of lowest risk reductions at least costs. MERV 4 is actually more expensive to operate than providing equivalent outdoor air ventilation in each climate, primarily because of the very low effectiveness in controlling infectious aerosols. HEPA filtration appears to offer only a small incremental advantage over MERV 13e16 filters (i.e., 1e4% lower RR) for as much as 1.6e2.3 times the cost of operation, which suggests that MERV 13e16 filters may be most appropriate for cost-effectively reducing risks of influenza transmission in this particular indoor environment. In fact, switching from MERV 7 to MERV 13 could likely reduce the number of infected individuals in this office environment by one person at an additional annual cost of only $17. Compared to the estimated economic losses of a single influenza case of $375, MERV 13 Table 7 Estimated annual cost of filtration in the office environment.

Annual filter product costs filtration could provide a benefit-to-cost ratio of 20 or more. These basic relationships were not sensitive to the various assumptions for infectious particle size distributions.

According to the results herein, filtration of recirculated air may be able to reduce the transmission of airborne infectious diseases in this particular indoor environment. Although there is a tremendous amount of uncertainty involved in each step of this modeling effort, the sensitivity of the model to input parameters for both infectious aerosol size distributions and for quanta generation rates was shown to be relatively small for relative risks. The sensitivity to each parameter was larger for absolute risks, with much greater uncertainty associated with assumptions for quanta generation rates.

While this case study on a single office environment has been presented for demonstration, more robust statistical techniques could also be used to simulate a wide range of buildings, occupants, and infectious aerosol properties to provide a more generalizable estimate of the likely impacts of filtration across the building stock. Additionally, risk models should be used in conjunction with more detailed hourly building energy balances to more accurately explore the energy impacts of infectious disease filtration relative to control by outdoor air ventilation, which will necessarily vary by climate, human occupancy and activity, and building operational characteristics. Additionally, it is clear that particle size distributions of expelled droplet nuclei should be measured in more standardized ways with much greater numbers of individuals than only those studies identified in the literature review and summarized in Table 2 . Last, future epidemiological work should also validate the predictions herein.

It should be noted that there are also more physically and biologically grounded models for assessing risks of infectious respiratory diseases, such as doseeresponse (DeR) models that incorporate mass balances and/or Markov chains that predict infectious particle concentrations, exposures, and doses, the ""infectivity"" of the particles, and the organism's susceptibility to disease [29, 71, 72] . DeR models have been used in recent studies to model infectious disease transmission using more mechanistic properties of both tuberculosis [73] and influenza [39, 71] ; however, DeR models also have their own inherent limitations, including often requiring interspecies extrapolation to estimate susceptibility of a human subject. Regardless, results from the modeling effort herein demonstrate that HVAC filtration can very likely play a role in preventing the transmission of airborne infectious diseases at lower costs than providing an equivalent amount of outdoor air ventilation, as previous studies have typically explored [3, 4, 6, 7] .

In this work, an existing airborne infectious disease risk model (the Wells-Riley equation) was modified to include removal by recirculating HVAC filters and linked directly to the primary rating metric of ASHRAE Standard 52.2 for filtration products: MERV. Based on a series of assumptions about infectious particle size distributions resulting from human activities in indoor environments, the risk of acquiring the influenza virus from a single infector was modeled in a hypothetical office environment with a particular focus on what levels of risk reductions could be achieved by different levels of HVAC filtration and equivalent outdoor air ventilation, and at what costs of operation. Overall, recirculating HVAC filtration was predicted to achieve the greatest risk reductions at lower costs of operation than equivalent outdoor air ventilation, particularly for MERV 13e16 filters. Medium efficiency filtration products (MERV 7e11) are also inexpensive to operate but appear less effective in reducing infectious disease risks.

Adaptive Contact Networks Change Effective Disease Infectiousness and Dynamics,"Human societies are organized in complex webs that are constantly reshaped by a social dynamic which is influenced by the information individuals have about others. Similarly, epidemic spreading may be affected by local information that makes individuals aware of the health status of their social contacts, allowing them to avoid contact with those infected and to remain in touch with the healthy. Here we study disease dynamics in finite populations in which infection occurs along the links of a dynamical contact network whose reshaping may be biased based on each individual's health status. We adopt some of the most widely used epidemiological models, investigating the impact of the reshaping of the contact network on the disease dynamics. We derive analytical results in the limit where network reshaping occurs much faster than disease spreading and demonstrate numerically that this limit extends to a much wider range of time scales than one might anticipate. Specifically, we show that from a population-level description, disease propagation in a quickly adapting network can be formulated equivalently as disease spreading on a well-mixed population but with a rescaled infectiousness. We find that for all models studied here -SI, SIS and SIR -the effective infectiousness of a disease depends on the population size, the number of infected in the population, and the capacity of healthy individuals to sever contacts with the infected. Importantly, we indicate how the use of available information hinders disease progression, either by reducing the average time required to eradicate a disease (in case recovery is possible), or by increasing the average time needed for a disease to spread to the entire population (in case recovery or immunity is impossible).","During recent years it has become clear that disease spreading [1] [2] [3] transcends geography: the contact process is no longer restricted to the immediate geographical neighbors, but exhibits the stereotypical small-world phenomenon with inescapable impact [4] [5] [6] [7] . The SARS and, at the time of writing, the influenza A outbreaks provide arresting examples of this effect in a biological context, although the spread of computer viruses constitutes perhaps the most obvious manifestation of such a property. Recent advances in the science of networks [2] also brought the impact of disease interactions beyond geography to the spotlight, providing compelling evidence of the role that the networks of contacts between individuals or computers play in the dynamics of infectious diseases [3, 5] . In the majority of cases in which complex networks of disease spreading have been considered [7] , they were taken to be static entities. However, social networks are intrinsically dynamical entities. In fact, modern societies have developed rapid means of information dissemination, both at local and at centralized levels, which one naturally expects to alter individuals' response to vaccination policies, their behavior with respect to other individuals and their perception of likelihood and risk of infection [8] . In some cases one may even witness the adoption of centralized measures, such as travel restrictions [9, 10] or the imposition of quarantine spanning parts of the population [11] , which may induce abrupt dynamical features onto the structure of the contact network. Furthermore, individual knowledge (based on local information) about the health status of acquaintances, partners, relatives, etc., combined with individual preventive strategies [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] such as condoms, vaccination, the use of face masks or prophylactic drugs, avoidance of visiting specific web-pages, staying away from public places, etc., may also lead to bias in the organization of disease paths along dynamical networks.

As a result, quite a few studies have recently investigated the impact of dynamical networks on disease progression, as well as the influence of the way information (disease awareness) flows in parallel with disease progression and the role of noise in disease dynamics [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] . At par with these models, our model studies disease dynamics in a finite and constant population of individuals. Contrary to current models though (see Discussion Section for more details), our dynamical contact structure allows for a variable number of overall links between individuals, which in turn depends on the overall incidence of disease in the population. This increased complexity of the model, however, will allow us to describe analytically disease dynamics in finite populations. Infection occurs along the links of a contact network whose structure may change based on each individual's health status and the availability of information regarding the health status of others. We assume the existence of some form of (unsupervised) local information about the health status of social contacts, depending on which individuals may be more or less effective in avoiding contact with those infected while remaining in touch with the healthy. We investigate some of the most widely used models of disease spreading, such as the popular Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) model [1, 3] , the Susceptible-Infected (SI) model [1] used to study, e.g., AIDS [1, 34] , and the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model [1, 35] , more appropriate to model, for instance, single season flu outbreaks [1] or computer virus spreading [5] . We provide analytical results which show that, on finite adaptive networks, the effective infectiousness of a disease depends on i) the size of the population, ii) the number of infected and ultimately iii) on the efficiency of local information spreading. These results, obtained under the assumption that network reshaping occurs much faster than disease spreading, are shown (numerically) to remain valid for a much wider range of time scales. When combined with the analytical results already known for static networks [3] , which describe well the opposite limit in which the network dynamics is slow compared to disease dynamics, we demonstrate that one can describe analytically most of the time scale spectra. We further show how availability of information may either drastically reduce the time required to eradicate a disease (when recovery from the disease is possible), or drastically increase the time after which the entire population becomes infected (when the disease cannot be cured). Finally, we discuss the implications of assuming that individuals exhibit diverse response profiles to available information [36] [37] [38] .

Let us start by introducing the well established SIS model [1, 3] , whereby individuals can be in one of two epidemiological states: Infected (I) or Susceptible (S). Individuals occupy the nodes of a graph, whereas the links of the graph define who interacts with whom. As usual, we define a transmission probability l and a recovery probability d. We assume a population of finite and constant size N, but with variable number of links [39, 40] . Links are established and removed at rates which also depend on the health status of the individuals connected: Links of different types -SS, SI and II -will tend to last differently. The SIR model, on the other hand, requires the introduction of a new epidemiological state -Recovered (or Removed, R) -representing individuals who, once recovered from the infection, acquire immunity. In SIR, the same parameters l and d defined above remain finite, but now we have three new kinds of links -SR, RI and RR. Finally, the SI model can be viewed as the limit of the SIS model when d~0, representing diseases from which recovery is impossible.

Suppose all individuals seek to establish links at the same rate c. For simplicity, we assume that new links are established and removed randomly, a feature which may not always apply in real cases, where the limited social horizon of individuals or the nature of their social ties may constrain part of their neighborhood structure (see Discussion). Let us further assume that links may be broken off at different rates, based on the nature of the links and the information available about the neighbors: Let us denote these rates by b pq for links of type pq (p,q [ S,I,R f g). This allows us to write down a system of ordinary differential equations [39, 40] for the time evolution of the number of links of each type. These and all other technical details of the model are presented in the Methods section. In the steady state of the linking dynamics, the number of links of each type is given by L Ã pq~wpq L M pq , where w pq~c czb pq À Á are the fractions of active pq-links, compared to the maximum possible number of links L M pq , for a given number of S, I and R. In the absence of disease only SS links exist, and hence w SS determines the average connectivity of the network under disease free conditions, characterizing the type of the population under study. In the presence of I individuals, to the extent that S individuals manage to avoid contact with I, they succeed in escaping infection. Hence, the intuition is clear: Reshaping of the contact network based on available information of the health status of individuals will contribute to inhibit disease progression. In the extreme limit of perfect information and individual capacity to immediately break up contacts with infected, we are isolating all infected, thus containing disease progression. Our goal here, however, is to understand how and in which way partial individual information affects the overall disease dynamics.

Often individuals prevent infection by avoiding unprotected contact with infected once they know the state of their contacts or are aware of the potential risks of such infection [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] 28, 32] : such is the case of many sexually transmitted diseases [12, [41] [42] [43] , for example, and, more recently, the voluntary use of face masks and the associated campaigns adopted by local authorities in response to the SARS outbreak [11, [13] [14] [15] . In the present study, we assume that individuals are not centrally supervised or informed: Individual decision is based on available local information about the health state of one's contacts. To the extent that such information spreads quickly and contacts are not too frequent, one can study analytically the limit in which the network dynamics -resulting from adaptation to the flow of local information -is much faster than disease dynamics. In this case, one may separate the time scales between network adaptation and contact (disease) dynamics: The network has time to reach a steady state before the next contact takes place. Consequently, the probability of having an infected neighbor is modified by a neighborhood structure which will change in time depending on the impact of the disease in the population and the overall efficiency of local information flow. It will be shown that a quickly adapting community induces profound changes in the dynamics of disease spreading, irrespective of the underlying epidemic model. Furthermore, we will demonstrate numerically that the two limiting cases amenable to analytic treatment -static networks on the one hand, and quickly adapting networks on the other hand

During the past decade, we learned that the structure of contact networks plays a crucial role in the spread of diseases. Most theoretical studies addressing this issue assume that contact networks are static entities, whereas the actual disease paths continuously reshape based on local social dynamics. This work aims to achieve a better understanding of disease spreading in populations characterized by a dynamically structured contact network where contacts appear and disappear over time. The network dynamics are entangled with the disease dynamics, as individuals may have access to local information that makes them aware of both the existence of the disease and the health status of their contacts, allowing them to minimize exposure to infection. Here we show the equivalence between disease propagation in an adaptive contact network and that in a well-mixed population with a rescaled transmission probability, which depends also on the fraction of infected in the population. Thus, one can emulate the effect of an adaptive contact network with a simple correction of the transmission probability. This result is obtained in the limit where network adaptation proceeds much faster than disease spreading, but we demonstrate that it also holds for a much wider range of scenarios.

-remain valid for a wide range of intermediate time scales, strengthening the power of the analytical predictions derived here.

The amount of information available translates into differences mostly between the break-up rates of links that may involve a potential risk for further infection (b SI , b IR , b II ), and those that do not (b SS , b SR , b RR ). Therefore, we consider one particular rate b I for links involving infected individuals (b I :b SI~bIR~bII ), and another one, b H , for links connecting healthy individuals (b H :b SS~bSR~bRR ). In general, one expects b I to be maximal when each individual has perfect information about the state of her neighbors and to be (minimal and) equal to b H when no information is available, turning the ratio between these two rates into a quantitative measure of the amount of information available or the efficiency of information use. Note that we reduce the model to two break-up rates in order to facilitate the discussion of the results. The general principles and conclusions remain valid when all break-up rates are incorporated explicitly. It is worth noticing that three out of these six rates are of particular importance for the overall disease dynamics: b SS , b SR and b SI . These three rates, combined with the rate c of creating new links, define the fraction of active SS, SR and SI links, and subsequent correlations between individuals [44] , and therefore determine the probability for a susceptible to become infected (see Methods). This probability will increase when considering higher values of c (assuming b I .b H ). In other words, when individuals create new links more often, therefore increasing the likelihood of establishing connections to infected individuals (when present), they need to be better informed about the health state of their contacts in order to escape infection. In the fast linking limit, the other three break-up rates (b II , b IR and b RR ) influence disease progression since they contribute to altering the average degree of the network.

In the Methods, we show that disease spreading in a quickly adapting network can be studied as if it took place in a well-mixed population with same average degree SkT as the original network and transmission probability l A . Since the lifetime of a link depends on its type, the average degree SkT of the network depends on the number of infected in the population, and hence becomes frequency (and time) dependent. Similarly, fast linking dynamics leads to a rescaling of the transmission probability, l?l A~g{1 l, with g depending on the particular model of disease spreading. In the SIR model, g is given by

where i denotes the number of infected individuals in the population and r the number of recovered (immune). The rescaling parameter g for the SI and SIS models is the same, but with r~0. Note that g scales linearly with the frequency of infected in the population, decreasing the more individuals get infected (assuming w SS =w SI w1), and depends implicitly (via the ratio w SS =w SI ) on the amount of information available. We would like to stress the distinction between the description of the disease dynamics at the local level and that at the population level. Strictly speaking, a dynamical network does not change the disease dynamics at the local level, meaning that infected individuals pass the disease to their neighbors with probability intrinsic to the disease itself. At the population level, on the other hand, disease progression proceeds as if the infectiousness of the disease effectively changes, as a result of the network dynamics. Hence, analyzing an adaptive network scenario at a population level can be achieved via a correction on the transmission probability, keeping the mathematically more attractive wellmixed scenario. In this sense, from a well-mixed perspective, dynamical networks contribute to change the effective infectiousness of the disease, which becomes frequency and information dependent.

One can define a gradient of infection G, which measures the tendency of the disease to either expand or shrink in a population with given configuration (defined by the number of individuals in each of the states S, I and R). For the SIS model, eradication of the disease is favored (G(i),0), irrespective of the fraction of infected, whenever R A 0 : l d Nw SI v1 (see Eq. 35 in Text S1), indicating how the presence of information (b H ,b I ) changes the basic reproductive ratio. This is illustrated in the upper panel of Figure 1 , which depicts G for different values of b I (assuming b H ƒb I ) and a fixed transmission probability l. The corresponding quasi-stationary distributions, which characterize the relative time the population spends in each configuration (and defined in Methods), are shown in the lower panel and clearly reflect the sign of G. Whenever G(i) is positive (negative), the dynamics will act to increase (decrease), on average, the number of infected. Figure 1 indicates how the availability of local yet reliable information hinders disease progression: For b I~0 :75 the interior root of G(i) disappears, making disease expansion unlikely in any configuration of the population.

The analysis of the gradient of infection of the SIS model has the natural advantage of showing the effect of adaptive networks in a one-dimensional simplex (the fraction of infected). Yet, an analogous result holds for the SIR model. The gradient of infection now also depends on the number of recovered (r) individuals in the population and, once again, allows us to identify when disease expansion will be favored or not. Figure 2 gives a complete picture of the gradient of infection, using the appropriate simplex structure in which all points satisfy the relation i+r+s = N. The dashed red line indicates where G i,r ð Þ~0 in case individuals do not have any information about the health status of their contacts, i.e., links that involve infected individuals disappear at the same rate as those that do not (b I~bH ). Disease expansion is more likely than disease contraction (G i,r ð Þw0) when the population is in a configuration above the line, and less likely otherwise. Similarly, the solid blue line indicates where G i,r ð Þ~0 whenever individuals share information about their health status, and use it to avoid contact with infected. Once again, the availability of information modifies the disease dynamics, inhibiting disease progression for a broad range of configurations.

Up to now we have assumed that the network dynamics proceeds much faster than disease spreading. This may not always be the case, and hence it is important to assess the domain of validity of this limit. In the following, we discuss the particular case of the SIS model. An analogous study for both SIR and SI yields qualitatively similar results, as discussed in the Text S1. Figure 3 shows the average SIT of the quasi-stationary distributions (circles) obtained via computer simulations (see Methods for details) as a function of the relative time scale t of network update (taking as unit time scale that associated with disease dynamics). Whenever t??, we can characterize the disease dynamics analytically, assuming a well-mixed population (complete graph), whereas for t?0 we recover the analytical results obtained in the fast linking limit. At intermediate time scales, Figure 3 shows that as long as t is smaller than 10, network dynamics contributes to inhibit disease spreading by effectively increasing the critical spreading rate. Overall, the validity of the time scale separation extends well beyond the limits one might anticipate based solely on the time separation ansatz. As long as the time scale for network update is smaller than the one for disease spreading (tv1), the analytical prediction for the limit t?0, indicated by the lower dashed line in Figure 3 , remains valid. The analytical result in the extreme opposite limit (t??), indicated by the upper dashed line in Figure 3 , holds as long as tw10 5 . Moreover, it is noteworthy that the network dynamics influences the disease dynamics both by reducing the frequency of interactions between susceptible and infected, but also by reducing the average degree of the network. These complementary effects are disentangled for intermediate regimes, in which the network dynamics is too slow to warrant sustained protection of susceptible individuals from contacts with infected, despite managing to reduce the average degree (shown by crosses). In fact, for tw10 the disease dynamics is mostly controlled by the average degree, as shown by the solid lines in Figure 3 . Here, the average stationary distribution was determined by replacing, in the analytic expression for static networks, SkT by the timedependent average connectivity SkT Ã computed numerically.

Note that the specific behavior of SkT Ã shown in Figure 3 results from the frequency dependence of SkT. When b I wb H , the network will reshape into a configuration with smaller SkT as soon as the disease expansion occurs. For tv1, SkT Ã reflects the lifetime of SS links, as there are hardly any infected in the population. For 10 0 vtv10 3 , the network dynamics proceeds fast enough to reduce SkT, but too slowly to reach its full potential in hindering disease progression. Given the higher fraction of infected, and the fact that SI and II links have a shorter lifetime than SS links, the average degree drops when increasing t from 1 to 10 3 . Any further increase in t leads to a higher average degree, as the network approaches its static limit.

Contrary to the deterministic SIS model, the stochastic nature of disease spreading in finite populations renders certain the probability that the disease disappears after some time. However, this result is of little relevance given the associated times required to reach the absorbing state (except, possibly, in very small communities). Indeed, the characteristic time scale of the dynamics plays a determinant role in the overall epidemiological process and constitutes a central issue in disease spreading.

In the Text S1 we derive an analytical expression for the average recovery time (t i ) of a population with i infected individuals. Figure 4A shows the recovery time t 1 in adaptive networks for different levels of information, illustrating the spectacular effect brought about by the network dynamics on the recovery time. While on networks without information (b I = b H ) the recovery time rapidly increases with the rate of infection l, adding information moves the fraction of infected individuals rapidly to the absorbing state, and, therefore, to the disappearance of the disease. Moreover, as shown in the Text S1, the size of the population can have a profound effect on the recovery times. With increasing population size, the population spends most of the time in the vicinity of the state associated with the interior root of G(i). For large populations, this acts to reduce the intrinsic stochasticity of the dynamics, dictating a very slow extinction of the disease.

When recovery from the disease is impossible, a situation captured by the SI model, the population will never become disease-free again once it acquires at least one infected individual. The Markov chain that represents such diseases therefore has another absorbing state, corresponding to networks where everyone has been infected, besides the previous one in which no one is infected. The time to reach this state again depends on the presence of information. When information prevails, susceptible individuals manage to resist infection for a long time, thereby delaying the rapid progression of the disease, as shown in the inset of Figure 4B . Naturally, the average number of generations needed to reach a fully infected population increases with the availability of information, as illustrated in the main panel of Figure 4B .

Finally, in all models discussed here we also investigated the effect of allowing for different individual rates associated with the way each individual creates or destroys her social ties. Due to agestructure of most populations or intrinsic individual or cultural differences, some individuals will tend to react differently whenever they, or a contact, get infected [36, 38] . In the Text S1 we show that the disease spreading remains unaffected when individual rates (of seeking and removing links) are drawn from a normal distribution with variable variance, as long as the average value for the rate remains unchanged.

Making use of three standard models of epidemics involving a finite population in which infection takes place along the links of a dynamical graph, the nodes of which are occupied by individuals, we have shown analytically that the bias in graph dynamics resulting from the availability of information about the health status of others in the population induces fundamental changes in the overall dynamics of disease progression.

The network dynamics proposed here differs from those used in previous models of disease spreading on adaptive networks [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] . Similar to most models, the population size remains fixed. Unlike most of these studies, however, we do not impose any local or global linking constraints, meaning that individuals can create (or remove) a link without the need for removing (or creating) another one -in other words, the number of links will change in time, also adapting to the disease configuration of the population. Consequently, the average degree of the network results from the self-organization of the network structure, and co-evolves with the disease dynamics (cf. networks evolving towards critical values of connectivity, as studied in [45] ). A population suffering from high disease prevalence where individuals avoid contact in order to escape infection will therefore exhibit a lower average degree than a population with hardly any infected individuals. Such a frequency-dependent average degree prevents also that containment of infected individuals would result automatically in the formation of a dense healthy cluster, which is extremely vulnerable to future infection, as reported before in [21, 25, 26] .

The description of disease spreading as a stochastic contact process embedded in a Markov chain constitutes a second important distinction between the present model and previous studies. This approach allows for a direct comparison between analytical predictions and individual-based computer simulations, and for a detailed analysis of finite-size effects and convergence times, whose exponential growth will signal possible bistable disease scenarios. In such a framework, we were able to show that adaptive networks in which individuals may be informed about the health status of others lead to a disease whose effective infectiousness depends on the overall number of infected in the population. In other words, disease propagation on adaptive networks can be seen as mathematically equivalent to disease spreading on a well-mixed population, but with a rescaled effective infectiousness. In accord with the intuition advanced in the introduction, as long as individuals react promptly and consistently to accurate available information on whether their acquaintances are infected or not, network dynamics effectively weakens the disease burden the population suffers from. Last but not least, if disease recovery is possible, the time for disease eradication drastically reduces whenever individuals have access to accurate information about the health state of their acquaintances and use it to avoid contact with those infected. If recovery or immunity is impossible, the average time needed for a disease to spread increases significantly when such information is being used. In both cases, our model clearly shows how availability of information hinders disease progression (by means of quick action on infected, e.g., their containment via link removal), which constitutes a crucial factor to control the development of global pandemics.

Finally, it is also worth mentioning that the knowledge about the health state of the others may not always be accurate or available in time. This is for instance the case for diseases where recently infected individuals remain asymptomatic for a substantial period. The longer the incubation period associated with the disease, the less successful individuals will be in escaping infection, which reduces in our model to a lower effective rate of breaking SI links, with the above mentioned consequences. Moreover, the (social) network through which awareness of the health status of others proceeds may lead to different rates of information spread. In such cases, one may model explicitly the spread of the health state of each individual, as done in Refs. [28, 32] , and study the interplay between disease expansion and individuals' awareness of the disease. Of course, depending on the particular disease at hand and the contact network along which it propagates, one may have to take other factors into account, besides network adaptability, in order to make accurate predictions of disease progression. Creation and destruction of links may for instance not always occur randomly, as we assumed here, but in a way that is biased by a variety of factors such as social and genetic distance, geographical proximity, family ties, etc. The resulting contact network may therefore become organized in a specific way, promoting the formation of particular structures, such as networks characterized by long-tailed degree distributions or with strong topological correlations among nodes [2, [46] [47] [48] which, in turn, may influence the disease dynamics. The impact of combining such effects, resulting from specific disease scenarios, with those reported here will depend on their prevalence. A small fraction of non-random links, or of ties which cannot be broken, will likely induce small modifications on the average connectivity of the contact network, which can be incorporated in our analytic expressions without compromising their validity regarding population wide dynamics. On the other hand, when the contact network is highly heterogeneous (e.g., exhibiting pervasive longtail degree distributions), non-random events may have very distinct effects, from being almost irrelevant (and hence can be ignored) to inducing hierarchical cascades of infection [49] , in which case our results will not apply.

We define disease dynamics in finite populations of size N as a stochastic process. Time evolves in discrete steps and two types of events may occur which change the composition of the population: infection events and recovery events. Let us assume the SIR model, as this is the most general case (see Text S1 for a detailed analysis specific for each disease model). Each state of the population is characterized by two indices i,r ð Þ, where i is the number of infected individuals in the population and r the number of recovered (and immune) individuals (izrƒN). The number of infected decreases with a rate given by

where t 0 is the recovery time scale, i N the probability that a randomly selected individual is infected and d the probability that this individual recovers. Adopting t 0 as a reference, we assume that the higher the average number of contacts SkT, the smaller the time scale t INF at which infection update events occur (t INF~t0 =SkT) [3] . Hence, the rate of increasing the number of infected is given by

The first factor stands for the typical time scale at which infection events occur. The second factor represents the probability of randomly picking a healthy individual. This individual interacts with a random neighbor, who is infected with probability given by the third factor (well-mixed assumption). This contact leads to an additional infection with probability l. When r~0, Equations (M1) and (M2) describe both SIS and SI (d~0) models. We obtain the finite population analogue of the well-known meanfield equations characteristic of these models by recognizing that, in the limit of large populations, t 0 G i,r 

Equations (M1) and (M2) define a Markov chain M with variable states depending on the epidemic model (see Text S1). The fraction of time the population spends in each state is given by the stationary distribution of M, which is defined as the eigenvector associated with eigenvalue 1 of the transition matrix of M [50, 51] . In the SIS model, the state without infected (i = 0) is, however, an absorbing state of the Markov Chain. The quantity of interest is therefore the stationary distribution of the Markov chain obtained from M by excluding the absorbing state i = 0. This distribution is also known as the quasi-stationary distribution of M [52] and corresponds to the fraction of time the population spends in each state, assuming the disease does not go extinct (see Figure 1 ).

Consider a network of constant size N with variable number of links. New links are established randomly at rate c. Existing links between individuals with health states p and q (p,q [ S,I,R f g) disappear at rate b pq . The time evolution of the number L pq of pqlinks can be written as a system of ordinary differential equations _ L L pq~c L M pq {L pq {b pq L pq [39, 40] . L M pq denotes the maximum number of pq-links, which depends on the number of individuals in states p and q (L M pp~p p{1 ð Þ=2 and L M pq~p q for p=q) and thereby couples the network dynamics to the disease dynamics. In the steady state of the linking dynamics ( _ L L pq~0 ), the number of links of links of each type is given by L Ã pq~wpq L M pq , with w pq~c czb pq À Á .

When the time scale for network update (t NET ) is much smaller than the one for disease spreading (t DIS ), the number of infected increases with a rate

where we made t 0~1 . The effect of the network dynamics becomes apparent in the third factor, which represents the probability that a randomly selected neighbor of a susceptible is infected. In addition, Equation ( which shows that disease spreading in an adaptive network is equivalent to that in a well-mixed population with frequency dependent average degree SkT and a transmission probability that is rescaled according to l A~g{1 l, where

which is valid for both SIR, SIS (r~0) and SI (d~0,r~0) models.

All individual-based simulations start from a complete network of size N = 100. Disease spreading and network evolution proceed together under asynchronous updating. Disease update events take place with probability 1zt ð Þ {1 , where t~t NET =t DIS and t DIS~1 , network update events occur otherwise. For network update events, we randomly draw two nodes from the population. If connected, then the link disappears with probability given by the respective b pq . Otherwise, a new link appears with probability c. When a disease update event occurs, a recovery event takes place with probability 1zSkT ð Þ {1 , an infection event otherwise. In both cases, an individual j is drawn randomly from the population. If j is infected and a recovery event has been selected then j will become susceptible (or recovered, model dependent) with probability d. If j is susceptible and an infection event occurs, then j will get infected with probability l if a randomly chosen neighbor of j is infected. The quasi-stationary distributions shown in Figure 1 are computed as the fraction of time the population spends in each configuration (i.e., number of infected individuals) during 10 9 disease event updates (10 7 generations). The average number of infected SIT and the mean average degree of the network SkT Ã observed during these 10 7 generations are shown in Figure 3 . The results reported are independent of the initial number of infected in the network. Finally, the disease progression in time, shown in Figure 4b , is calculated from 10 4 independent simulations, each simulation starting with 1 infected individual. The reported results correspond to the average amount of time after which the population reaches a state with i infected.

Sequential Adaptive Mutations Enhance Efficient Vector Switching by Chikungunya Virus and Its Epidemic Emergence,"The adaptation of Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) to a new vector, the Aedes albopictus mosquito, is a major factor contributing to its ongoing re-emergence in a series of large-scale epidemics of arthritic disease in many parts of the world since 2004. Although the initial step of CHIKV adaptation to A. albopictus was determined to involve an A226V amino acid substitution in the E1 envelope glycoprotein that first arose in 2005, little attention has been paid to subsequent CHIKV evolution after this adaptive mutation was convergently selected in several geographic locations. To determine whether selection of second-step adaptive mutations in CHIKV or other arthropod-borne viruses occurs in nature, we tested the effect of an additional envelope glycoprotein amino acid change identified in Kerala, India in 2009. This substitution, E2-L210Q, caused a significant increase in the ability of CHIKV to develop a disseminated infection in A. albopictus, but had no effect on CHIKV fitness in the alternative mosquito vector, A. aegypti, or in vertebrate cell lines. Using infectious viruses or virus-like replicon particles expressing the E2-210Q and E2-210L residues, we determined that E2-L210Q acts primarily at the level of infection of A. albopictus midgut epithelial cells. In addition, we observed that the initial adaptive substitution, E1-A226V, had a significantly stronger effect on CHIKV fitness in A. albopictus than E2-L210Q, thus explaining the observed time differences required for selective sweeps of these mutations in nature. These results indicate that the continuous CHIKV circulation in an A. albopictus-human cycle since 2005 has resulted in the selection of an additional, second-step mutation that may facilitate even more efficient virus circulation and persistence in endemic areas, further increasing the risk of more severe and expanded CHIK epidemics.","The potential of RNA viruses to emerge into new environments often depends on their ability to efficiently adapt to new hosts. These adaptations sometimes comprise a stepwise process that includes 1) initial viral introduction/establishment in the recipient species, followed by 2) finite adjustment/optimization of the virus replication and transmission strategies for specific environments associated with a new host [1, 2] . This process has been well documented for several single-host viruses such as pandemic influenza A virus, the SARS coronavirus and canine parvovirus (reviewed in [3, 4] ) that do not rely on alternating infection of disparate hosts for their maintenance in nature. However, much less is known about the adaptive processes that mediate crossspecies jumps for double-host viruses such as arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses). Several recent studies documented that the acquisition of a single mutation in an arbovirus genome can mediate their cross-species transfer [step (1) ] [5] [6] [7] [8] . However, in none of these cases have subsequent, additional adaptive mutations been detected, posing the question of whether selection of second-step adaptive mutations is possible or necessary for these viruses to persist in nature. This information is critical for understanding and predicting the long-term consequences of pathogen emergence and maintenance in affected areas, which in turn could influence the development and success of targeted intervention strategies for managing outbreaks.

A new lineage of Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) [arbovirus in family Alphavirus, genus Togaviridae] emerged in 2004 in Kenya and subsequently spread into many countries in the Indian Ocean basin [hence the name: Indian Ocean lineage (IOL)], causing devastating outbreaks of arthritic disease [9] . In India, IOL strains were first detected in December 2005 followed by extensive geographic expansion during 2006-2011 into 19 Indian states with a total number of human cases estimated in 2007 at between 1.4 and 6.5 million [10, 11] . During 2006, the states most affected by CHIKV were Karnataka and Maharashtra, with a subsequent shift to Kerala, Coastal Karnataka and West Bengal [12, 13] . Several hypothetical factors may have contributed to the CHIKV emergence/spread on the Indian subcontinent [14] , including: 1) the use of immunologically naïve human populations for maintenance, amplification and virus dispersal among localities, 2) reliance on peridomestic and anthropophilic mosquitoes as vectors, and 3) the IOL-specific genetic predisposition for rapid adaptation to Aedes (A.) albopictus, which was previously considered only a secondary CHIKV vector [9] .

The mode of CHIKV maintenance in nature is complex and appears to be region-specific. In Africa, CHIKV is maintained in enzootic cycles involving transmission between non-human primates and canopy-dwelling, primatophilic Aedes mosquitoes, primarily A. furcifer, A. taylori, A. africanus, A. luteocephalus and A. neoafricanus [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] . In contrast, CHIKV transmission in Asia is believed to rely on humans alone as reservoir/amplification hosts, with the domestic A. aegypti and to lesser extent the peridomestic A. albopictus serving as primary urban mosquito vectors [19, 20] . Recent evidence, however, suggests the possibility of additional sylvatic, zoonotic transmission cycles [21, 22] .

In India, both urban CHIKV vectors are present, although their distributions differ, and their epidemiologic significance for CHIKV transmission probably varies locally. A. aegypti was considered to be the most important during the early phase of the CHIK epidemic in 2006 [23] . However, in subsequent years (2007) (2008) (2009) , the involvement of A. albopictus as the principal vector was documented at least in the states of Kerala and Coastal Karnataka [24] [25] [26] [27] . Interestingly, CHIKV transmission by A. albopictus was shown to be associated with the acquisition of the A226V amino acid substitution in the E1 envelope glycoprotein [24, [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] (Figure S1 ) that is responsible for alphavirus virion assembly and virus fusion in endosomes of target cells [33] [34] [35] . The role of the E1-A226V substitution on CHIKV adaptation to A. albopictus was directly demonstrated in laboratory studies, including those using reverse genetics, showing that this mutation is directly responsible for increased CHIKV infection, dissemination and transmission by this vector species [6, 36] . In India, evidence that CHIKV was undergoing genetic adaptation to A. albopictus via the E1-A226V substitution first came from Kerala State. During 2006, only the E1-226A variant was recovered there; however, during subsequent years (2007) (2008) , all isolates sequenced possessed the E1-226V residue [24] ( Figure S1 ). In 2008 the E1-A226V substitution was also found among the majority of CHIKV isolates from Coastal Karnataka, adjacent to Kerala [37] , suggesting introduction from the latter state.

In a follow-up study conducted in the state of Kerala, a novel substitution in the E2 envelope glycoprotein, L210Q, was discovered in all human and mosquito CHIKV isolates collected during 2009 [27] ( Figure S1 ). The E2 protein is located on the tips of alphavirus spikes and interacts with host cell receptors as well as with neutralizing antibodies [38, 39] . The L210Q substitution has not been reported in any other CHIKV strains, including those isolated in Kerala State during 2006-2008. This suggests that E2-L210Q substitution was selected as a result of CHIKV adaptation to specific ecological conditions present in Kerala State. Position E2-210 is located in the domain B of the E2 glycoprotein [39] , and several earlier studies demonstrated that mutations in this domain mediate host specificity of several alphaviruses [5, 7, [40] [41] [42] as well as the selection of escape mutants by neutralizing antibodies [43] [44] [45] . Moreover, we recently demonstrated that epistatic interactions between mutations at positions E1-226 and E2-211 of CHIKV influence the penetrance of the E1-226V substitution for fitness in A. albopictus [46] . The E2-I211T substitution was probably acquired by IOL CHIKV strains around 2004-2005 [47] , and provides a suitable background to allow CHIKV adaptation to A. albopictus via the subsequent E1-A226V substitution.

Considering that A. albopictus was a principal CHIKV vector in the state of Kerala in 2009, it was hypothesized that the novel substitution E2-L210Q provided an additional selective advantage for CHIKV transmission by this mosquito [27] . To test this hypothesis we undertook a comprehensive reverse genetic analysis of the effects of E2-L210Q in various CHIKV hosts. Our observations demonstrate that the E2-L210Q substitution mediates a significant increase in CHIKV dissemination in A. albopictus by increasing initial infectivity for midgut epithelial cells. In addition, we show that the E1-A226V substitution has a significantly stronger effect on CHIKV fitness in A. albopictus than E2-L210Q, probably explaining the observed time differences required for selective sweeps of these mutations in nature.

The E2-L210Q substitution is responsible for increased CHIKV dissemination in A. albopictus

To investigate the effect of the E2-L210Q substitution on CHIKV fitness in A. albopictus mosquitoes, we employed a reverse genetics approach based on the SL-CK1 strain of CHIKV (hereafter abbreviated SL07), isolated in 2007 in Sri Lanka [9] . Previous phylogenetic studies indicated that SL07 evolved from the Indian subgroup of IOL and represents one of the most closely related isolates to strains responsible for CHIKV outbreaks in India (including the Kerala state) [9, 48] . The SL07 isolate was passed only twice on Vero cells since its isolation from a febrile patient, thus limiting the potential for cell culture-adaptive mutations that can artificially influence alphavirus fitness in vertebrate and/or mosquito hosts. The SL-07 strain has an alanine residue at E1 position 226 and a leucine residue at E2-210, corresponding to prototype IOL strain introduced into India in late 2005. Since the E2-L210Q substitution was only detected in CHIKV strains form Kerala that had previously acquired the A. albopictus-adaptive E1-A226V substitution [24] , single E1-A226V and double (E1-A226V and E2-L210Q) substitutions were introduced into an infectious clone (i.c.), generated from the SL07 strain using site-directed mutagenesis. In addition, a clone with the single E1-A226V substitution (SL07-226V) was genetically marked by introducing a synonymous mutation 6454ARC that creates an ApaI restrictase site (SL07-226V-Apa). Previously we demonstrated that the 6454ARC substitution does not

Since 2004, chikungunya virus (CHIKV) has caused a series of devastating outbreaks in Asia, Africa and Europe that resulted in up to 6.5 million cases of arthritic disease and have been associated with several thousand human deaths. Although the initial step of CHIKV adaptation to A. albopictus mosquitoes, which promoted re-emergence of the virus, was determined to involve an E1-A226V amino acid substitution, little attention has been paid to subsequent CHIKV evolution after this adaptive mutation was convergently selected in several geographic locations. Here we showed that novel substitution, E2-L210Q identified in Kerala, India in 2009, caused a significant increase in the ability of CHIKV to infect and develop a disseminated infection in A. albopictus. This may facilitate even more efficient virus circulation and persistence in endemic areas, further increasing the risk of more severe and expanded CHIK epidemics. Our findings represent some of the first evidence supporting the hypothesis that adaptation of CHIKV (and possible other arboviruses) to new niches is a sequential multistep process that involves selections of at least two adaptive mutations.

influence CHIKV fitness in vitro or in vivo [6] . The infectious viruses SL07-226V-Apa and SL07-226V-210Q were rescued by electroporation of in vitro-transcribed RNA into Vero cells. The specific infectivity and viral titers in cell culture supernatants were almost identical for all constructs (Table S1 ), indicating that the introduced mutations did not attenuate CHIKV in Vero cells.

Although a variety of mechanisms may be involved, adaptation of arboviruses for enhanced transmission by mosquitoes is typically expected to result in an increased ability to develop a disseminated infection leading to salivary gland infection. To investigate the effect of the E2-L210Q substitution on CHIKV fitness in A. albopictus mosquitoes, direct competition experiments were performed using SL07-226V-Apa and SL07-226V-210Q viruses ( Figure 1 ). For these experiments, A. albopictus (Thailand strain) was presented with blood meals containing a mix of 5x10 5 plaque forming units (pfu)/mL of SL07-226V-Apa and 5x10 5 pfu/mL of SL07-226V-210Q viruses (combined titer 10 6 pfu/mL) and 10 days post-infection (dpi), the presence of disseminated viral infection as sampled from individual mosquito legs and heads was analyzed as described in the Materials and Methods. The dissemination of the SL07-226V-210Q in the Thailand colony of A. albopictus was 4.3 times more efficient compared to SL07-226V-Apa ( Figure 1A )(p = 0.021), supporting the hypothesis that glutamine at E2-210 was selected in CHIKV population in Kerala State due to its positive effect on CHIKV transmission. To corroborate these findings, the ApaI site was introduced into the backbone of SL07-226V-210Q, and the resultant virus (SL07-226V-210Q-Apa) was tested in direct competition in A. albopictus (Thailand colony) against SL07-226V that was produced by reverting the ApaI site in SL07-226V-Apa to the wild-type (w.t.) nucleotide sequence ( Figure 1B ). The dissemination of SL07-226V-210Q-Apa was 3.4 times higher than that of SL07-226V (p = 0.017), indicating that the genetic marker was not responsible for the competition outcome, and supporting the role of the E2-L210Q substitution in increased CHIKV dissemination in A. albopictus. To demonstrate that the outcome of competition experiments was not affected by CHIKV propagation in Vero cells (which were used to identify mosquitoes with disseminated infection, prior to CHIKV genotype analysis), these cells were infected at a multiplicity of infection of 0.1 pfu/cell in triplicate with 1:1 mixtures of viruses that were used in mosquito competition experiments. At 2 dpi, cell culture supernatants were collected for viral RNA extraction and processed as described in the Materials and Methods. No detectable differences in viral fitness (changes in the ratios of the 2 viruses) were observed after Vero cell passage, indicating that E2-L210Q substitution does not affect CHIKV fitness in these cells ( Figure S2 ).

Early studies of CHIKV competence to infect A. albopictus demonstrated significant variation in susceptibility among different geographic strains of this mosquito [49] . To demonstrate that the effect of the E2-L210Q substitution on CHIKV dissemination in A. albopictus was not limited to a particular geographic strain, we also compared dissemination efficiency of the SL07-226V-Apa versus SL07-226V-210Q viruses in mosquitoes derived from Galveston, USA. Similar to the results with Thailand mosquitoes, the E2-L210Q substitution provided a mean 4.5-fold increase in dissemination efficiency of CHIKV (p = 0.003) ( Figure 1A ). These data suggest that the E2-L210Q substitution would likely have a similar effect on CHIKV fitness in A. albopictus from Kerala State, India, and from other parts of the world.

To investigate if the fitness advantage associated with the E2-L210Q substitution is sufficient for selection of mutant viruses in a w.t. CHIKV population, the SL07-226V-210Q was serially passaged in the presence of a 100-fold excess of SL07-226V-Apa (surrogate ''wild-type'' virus) in an alternating cycle between A. albopictus mosquitoes and Vero cells. To initiate the cycle, A. albopictus (Galveston colony) were presented with blood meals containing 5x10 5 pfu/mL SL07-226V-Apa and 5610 3 pfu/mL SL07-226V-210Q viruses (100-fold excess of SL07-226V-Apa). After three consecutive passages, heads and legs of individual mosquitoes were processed as described above to determine if selection of virus with E2-L210Q substitution had occurred ( Figure 2A ). Despite being present in 100-fold lower quantity in the initial virus population, the SL07-226V-210Q virus alone was detected in 31.6% of mosquitoes after 3 alternating mosquito-Vero passages, whereas SL07-226V-Apa (w.t.) alone was found in 52.6% of mosquitoes, while 15.8% of mosquitoes had both competitors in their heads and legs ( Figure 2B ) (p = 0.227 onetailed McNemar test). These data indicate that the E2-L210Q substitution has the potential to be selected in CHIKV populations in locations where A. albopictus serves as the primary vector. The 31-fold increase over 3 artificial transmission cycles in the relative frequency of SL07-226V-210Q over its initial ratio in blood meals corresponds to a ca. 3-fold increase per cycle, which is in agreement with fitness advantage of the E2-L210Q substitution observed earlier in direct competition experiments ( Figure 1 ).

The E2-L210Q substitution does not alter CHIKV fitness in A. aegypti or human cells Historically, A. aegypti mosquitoes were the primary vector of CHIKV in Asia [19, 20] , and this species still plays a significant role in CHIKV transmission in India [23, [50] [51] [52] . To investigate if the E2-L210Q substitution also affects CHIKV fitness in A. aegypti, we analyzed the effect of E2-L210Q on CHIKV dissemination in this vector using competition experiments as described above. Since CHIKV transmission by A. aegypti has never been associated with the E1-A226V substitution, we first used the w.t. genetic background of the SL07 strain (E1-226A and E2-210L) to introduce the E2-L210Q substitution. Also, because A. aegypti is less susceptible to CHIKV than A. albopictus for strains with E1-226V, we used higher total oral doses up to 2.4610 7 pfu/mL ( Figure 3A , 3B). The dissemination efficiency of SL07 and SL07-210Q-Apa viruses in A. aegypti (Thailand strain) were almost identical (p = 0.395) ( Figure 3A ). Similarly, no difference in the dissemination efficiency between SL07 and SL07-210Q-Apa viruses was detected in Galveston A. aegypti mosquitoes ( Figure  S3 ). Additionally, competition between SL07-226V-210Q-Apa and SL07-226V viruses, which express E2-210Q and E2-210L residues in the background of E1-226V, respectively, was also analyzed in Thailand A. aegypti, again revealing no statistically significant differences in dissemination efficiency [p = 0.402] ( Figure 3B ). These data indicate that it is unlikely that the polymorphism at E2-210 affects CHIKV transmission by A. aegypti.

Alternatively, E2-L210Q could have been selected as a result of CHIKV adaptation to a vertebrate host in India, probably humans. Although we did not observe any fitness change associated with this mutation during propagation of CHIKV in Vero cells (derived from African green monkey kidneys), to extend our analysis we repeated competition experiments using the human-derived cell line 293 (embryonic human kidney) because earlier studies showed that CHIKV can infect and replicate in various primary human cell lines including epithelial, endothelial, fibroblast, muscle satellite and macrophages (reviewed in [11] ). No detectable difference in fitness resulting from the E2-L210Q substitution was observed in this cell culture model ( Figure 3B , 3C). Although cell lines are not ideal surrogates for in vivo infections, our data further support the conclusion that the E2-L210Q substitution was most likely selected only by A. albopictus. The E2-L210Q substitution acts by increasing CHIKV infectivity for midgut cells of A. albopictus Previous studies determined that the A. albopictus-adaptive E1-A226V substitution acts primarily at the level of midgut infectivity. It was suggested that efficient CHIKV infection of and replication in midgut cells promotes more active CHIKV dissemination and transmission by this vector [6, 36, 46] , thus allowing the selection of A. albopictus-adapted CHIKV strains in nature. To explore which step during CHIKV infection of A. albopictus mosquitoes is affected by the E2-L210Q mutation, we first compared the relative ratios of SL07-226V-Apa and SL07-226V-210Q RNAs in whole mosquitoes, mosquito midguts and mosquito carcasses (bodies without midguts) after oral infection ( Figure 4A ). We observed a marked increase in the relative amount of E2-210Q RNA in all samples analyzed, including midguts at 7 dpi. Furthermore, similar increases in the relative amount of E2-210Q RNA in mosquito midguts were observed as early as day 1 post infection, regardless of which of the two competitors was marked by the ApaI site ( Figure 4B , 4C). In contrast, no difference in the relative amounts of E2-210Q versus E2-210L RNAs were observed 2 days after intrathoracic infection of A. albopictus, when CHIKV titers peak ( Figure 4D ). When injected intrathoracically, CHIKV does not require infection of and replication within mosquito midguts to disseminate to other organs and tissues, suggesting that the initial infection/replication of the midgut epithelium is a major site of selection of the E2-L210Q substitution in A. albopictus.

To further test the hypothesis that the E2-L210Q substitution affects CHIKV fitness only during initial infection of the A. albopictus midgut, we first compared infection rates of mosquitoes presented orally with serial dilutions of the viruses expressing either E2-210L or E2-210Q residues in the backbone of the SL07 strain that has the E1-A226V substitution. The E2-210Q residue was associated with significantly higher infectivity (p = 0.006 and p = 0.034, Fishers exact test) for A. albopictus (Thailand) at the blood meal titers of 3.5 and 2.5 Log 10 (pfu)/mL, and the oral infectious dose 50% (OID 50 ) value calculated for SL07-226V-210Q was 8.9 times lower (higher infectivity) than that for SL07-226V ( Figure 5A, 5B) . The lack of a significant difference in infection rates after the highest dose (4.54 Log 10 (pfu)/mL) probably reflected the oral dose nearing saturation. By way of comparison, earlier studies, including those using the SL07 strain, determined that the well-established A. albopictus-adaptive substitution E1-A226V mediates a much greater, ,100-fold decrease in OID 50 values [6, 9] .

To directly study the effect of E2-L210Q substitution on initial CHIKV infection of A. albopictus midgut cells, we developed a replicon/helper system for the SL07 strain. Sub-genomic replicons of alphaviruses can be packaged into virus-like particles (VLPs) by co-transfection of replicon and helper RNAs into susceptible cells [53] . The helper RNA provides the structural genes that package replicon RNA into VLPs, but the helper RNA itself is not packaged into the VLPs. Therefore, the VLPs are capable of primary infection and replicon RNA replication within cells, but cannot spread to neighboring cells due to the lack of the structural genes in the replicon. Thus, replicon VLPs allowed us to investigate the effect of mutations of interest on initial infection of midgut cells.

Since transfection efficiency of viral RNA is critical in determining the efficiency of VLP production, we switched to BHK-21 cells that have superior RNA susceptibility compared to Vero cells. Earlier, we observed that CHIKV isolates that have not been passaged in rodent-derived cells lines (including SL07) are impaired in their ability to replicate in BHK-21 cells (KT, SCW, unpublished). Therefore, to ensure efficient recovery of CHIKV VLPs from BHK-21 cells, double BHK-adaptive substitutions (nsP1-L407P and nsP3-T348A) were introduced into the SL07 i.c. (see Materials and Methods for details). Although these substitutions increase replication capacity, rather than electroporation efficiency, of CHIKV in BHK-21 cells, they have no effect on mosquito infection (data not shown). The modified SL07 i.c (contains nsP1-L407P and nsP3-T348A substitutions) was subsequently used to generate all CHIKV replicons used in the mosquito infectivity study.

The SL07 replicon expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) was packaged into VLPs using w.t. SL07 helper (with E2-210L and E1-226A residues) or using a modified helper encoding E2-L210Q and E1-A226V substitutions. The SL07 replicon expressing cherry fluorescent protein (CFP) was packaged into VLPs using a helper encoding E2-210L and E1-226V residues ( Figure 6A ). In addition, the ApaI marker was introduced into the GFP-expressing replicon. The infectious titers of all recovered VLPs, as determined by titration on Vero cells, were identical ( Figure 6A ). Infection of Vero and C6/36 cells with 1:1 mixtures of GFP and CFP expressing VLPs [based on infectious unit (i.u.) titers] yielded equal number of cells expressing these fluorescent proteins (data not shown).

For mosquito experiments, GFP-and CFP-expressing VLPs were mixed 1:1 (based on i.u. titers) and presented in blood meals to A. albopictus as shown in (Figure 6A ). At 1 and 2 dpi, midguts of individual mosquitoes were dissected and analyzed by fluorescent microscopy to determine a number of cells expressing GFP and CFP in the same fields of vision ( Figure 6B ). We found that, on average, midgut cells were 4-5 times more likely to become infected with VLPs expressing the E2-210Q residue as compared with VLPs expressing E2-210L ( Figure 6D, 6E) . Similarly, 4-5 fold increases in relative amounts of E2-210Q RNA were observed after an ApaI digestion of RT-PCR amplicons derived from VLPinfected midguts ( Figure S4 ). Infectious viruses were not recovered after infecting Vero cells with homogenates of 30 mosquitoes infected with VLPs mixes (see Materials and Methods for details), indicating that the hypothetical formation of full-length viruses via recombination between helper and replicon RNAs, which could confound the interpretation of this experiment, did not occur. Altogether, these data demonstrate that the E2-L210Q substitution acts specifically by increasing initial CHIKV infectivity for midgut cells of A. albopictus.

In a parallel experiment using VLPs, we also compared the effect of the previously characterized E1-A226V substitution on CHIKV infectivity for midguts of A. albopictus ( Figure 6A ). The CFP-expressing replicon packaged using a helper encoding E2-210L and E1-226V residues (CFP/E2-210L/E1-226V) was competed against GFP-expressing replicon packaged using w.t. SL07 helper encoding E2-210L and E1-226A residues (GFP/E2-210L/E1-226A). In contrast to the polymorphism at E2-210, the valine residue at position E1-226 provided a far greater (41-43 fold) increase in a midgut cell infection compared to the alanine residue at the same position ( Figure 6C, 6D, 6E ), which agrees with previous results using infectious viruses [6, 36] . These data also indicate that the results of experiments using VLPs with 2 different fluorescent reporter proteins (GFP and CFP) cloned into replicons RNAs are not influenced by those reporter proteins themselves. The significant difference of ,10-fold between the effects of the polymorphisms at positions E1-226 versus E2-210 on CHIKV infectivity (p = 0.026 and p = 0.005 for 1 and 2 dpi respectively) ( Figure 6D, 6C) indicates that the E1-A226V substitution exerts significantly stronger selection compared to E2-L210Q, and thus would be expected to be selected faster during CHIKV transmission by A. albopictus.

To corroborate these findings we also analyzed effect of the E2-L210Q substitution on CHIKV infectivity for midgut cells of A. albopictus when this substitution is expressed in the background of w.t. CHIKV with the E1-226A residue. For this experiment, a GFPexpressing replicon was packaged using a w.t. SL07 helper encoding E2-210L and E1-226A residues (GFP/E2-210L/E1-226A), and was competed against a CFP-expressing replicon packaged using a helper encoding E2-210Q and E1-226A residues (GFP/E2-210Q/ E1-226A). The E2-L210Q substitution caused a 2.3-2.4-fold increase in CHIKV infectivity for A. albopictus midgut cells (Figure 7) , which was about 17.5 times weaker than the effect of the E1-A226V substitution in the same genetic background. Similarly, using direct competition experiments between infectious viruses SL07 and SL07-210Q-Apa (both have the E1-226A residue) we observed that the E2-L210Q substitution provided a mean 2.0fold increase in dissemination efficiency of CHIKV (p = 0.022) ( Figure S5 ) in the Thailand strain of A. albopictus. These data indicate that the E2-L210Q substitution would be selected more efficiently in CHIKV strains that previously acquired the E1-226V mutation.

In this study we showed that an E2-L210Q substitution recently identified in CHIKV populations of Kerala State, India, when expressed in the background of the initial adaptive E1-226V substitution, confers a selective advantage by increasing initial infection of A. albopictus midgut epithelial cells. Efficient infection of midguts promotes subsequent CHIKV dissemination into the hemocoel and transmission by this vector. However, the E2-L210Q substitution has no apparent effect on CHIKV fitness in the other primary mosquito vector, A. aegypti, or on fitness in cell culture models for primate infection (Vero and 293 cells) . These results as well as surveillance data indicating that CHIKV was transmitted primarily by A. albopictus in Kerala state of India when the E2-L210Q substitution was first detected [24] [25] [26] [27] , provide a comprehensive evolutionary explanation for its appearance in 2009. These results also indicate that adaptation of CHIKV to A. albopictus mosquitoes mediated by the previously characterized E1-A226V substitution was probably just a beginning of multi-step adaptive process that included the selection of a second (E2-L210Q) and possibly additional, future mutational steps by IOL strains now circulating in urban areas. These mutations, which have no deleterious effect on transmission by A. aegypti, will enable CHIKV to even more efficiently exploit urban transmission in environments populated by A. albopictus, but also to maintain the ability to utilize A. aegypti, which tends to occur in major urban centers [54] . Thus, our findings regarding the continued adaptation of CHIKV to A. albopictus raise serious public health concerns that even more efficient transmission may exacerbate the already devastating CHIK epidemics in India and Southeast Asia. Furthermore, the introduction of the E2-L210Q strain into new areas like Italy and France, where autochthonous cases have already occurred [55] [56] [57] , could spread epidemics into temperate climates where A. albopictus thrives. Considering the broad global distribution of A. albopictus, including nearly throughout the Americas, the E2-L210Q substitution may significantly increase the risk of CHIKV becoming endemic in additional locations.

Interestingly, Niyas et al. (2010) demonstrated that CHIKV strains with the E2-L210Q substitution can be isolated from adult A. albopictus mosquitoes that were reared from wild-caught larvae collected in Kerala State, suggesting that transovarial transmission (TOT) may also play a role in CHIKV maintenance, especially during dry seasons [27, 58] . Also, evidence suggests that TOT occurred in a small percentage of wild mosquitoes during recent CHIK outbreaks on Reunion Island, Madagascar, and in Thailand [59] [60] [61] . Although we did not attempt to study the effect of the E2-L210Q substitution on TOT, and at least one laboratory study failed to demonstrate TOT in A. albopictus of CHIKV strains with the E1-A226V substitution [58] , so the possibility that CHIKV mutations could influence rates of TOT warrants a thorough investigation.

The molecular mechanism explaining the effects of the E2-L210Q substitution on CHIKV infectivity for A. albopictus midgut cells remains unknown. Earlier, we hypothesized that the E2 region around position 211 could be directly involved in interactions with a specific cell surface receptor [46] . We showed that the E2-211T residue mediates a significant increase in infectivity for A. albopictus in concert with the E1-A226V substitution, and that residue E2-211I, which is common among CHIKV strains, blocks this effect. Moreover, using virus overlay protein binding assays (VOPBA) to study CHIKV binding to the proteins associated with the brush border membrane fraction of A. albopictus midguts, we demonstrated that the E2-T211I substitution dramatically alters CHIKV interactions with as yet unidentified proteins (KT unpublished). The recently determined crystal structure of the CHIKV E2 glycoprotein [39] provides additional insights into the possible involvement of residues E2-211 and E2-210 in interactions with a putative mosquito receptor (Figure 8 ). Both positions are located at the C' B sheet of the E2 protein, which is exposed on the virion surface on the lateral side of domain B, suggesting that these positions could be involved in interactions with cellular proteins. Substitutions of the aliphatic moieties with polar residues in this region may therefore be directly responsible for changing CHIKV affinities to as yet unidentified receptor(s). Interestingly, positions E2-207, E2-213 and E2-218, which have been shown to be involved in VEEV adaptation to equine and mosquito hosts [5, 7, 42] , are also located in the same lateral surface of domain B, further supporting the hypothesis that E2-L210Q enables CHIKV to interact with a particular protein expressed on the surface of midgut cells. The studies to identify these protein(s) are underway.

In the study by Niyas et al (2010) that discovered the E2-L210Q substitution in CHIKV strains from Kerala, only limited portions of CHIKV genomes including the nsP2, E2 and E1 genes were sequenced [27] . Since we did not have an access to these isolates or to complete sequence of these strains, we cannot rule out the possibility that other genome regions could be influencing CHIKV evolution in Kerala State. Epistatic mutations in different genome positions can dramatically affect CHIKV infection of A. albopictus [9] . For example, the recently determined, lineage-specific epistatic interactions between positions E1-226 and E1-98 probably limited for at least 60 years the emergence and establishment of new CHIKV strains in Asian regions inhabited by A. albopictus [9] . This suggests that Kerala strains of CHIKV might have acquired adaptive substitutions in addition to E2-L210Q that promote efficient transmission in the human-A. albopictus cycle, and indicates the need for a more detailed, continuous molecular characterization of CHIKV strains from throughout its distribution.

We also investigated if residue E1-226 has an epistatic effect on amino acid E2-210. The E2-L210Q substitution was detected only in CHIKV strains that already acquired the E1-A226V substitution. We observed that the E2-L210Q substitution mediates a 4-5fold increase in A. albopictus midgut infectivity when expressed in the background of E1-226V, whereas the same substitution caused only a 2.3-2.4-fold increase when expressed in the background of E1-226A (Figure 6 and 7) . These results indicate that selection of this mutation would have been even less efficient if it had occurred in a CHIKV strain that did not yet acquire E1-A226V change. Interestingly, our data show that, with regard to CHIKV infectivity of A. albopictus midgut cells, E2-L210Q has an approximately 17-fold (E1-226A background) or 10-fold (E1-226V background) weaker effect compared with E1-A226V ( Figure 6 and 7) . This could explain why E1-A226V was selected convergently by unrelated CHIKV strains on at least 4 well documented occasions, while selection of E2-L210Q has thus far been observed only once in Kerala State ( Figure S1 ). The stronger fitness effect of E1-A226V is consistent with its historically faster selection, which resulted in a selective sweep in parts of the Indian Ocean, India and Southeast Asia, compared with E2-L210Q, which has predominance in only one location. After CHIKV introduction into a region with large A. albopictus populations, the E. Each dot corresponds to a fold-difference in the number of cells expressing GFP vs. CFP [E2-210 (Q/L)] or CFP vs. GFP [E1-226 (V/A)] in individual mosquito midguts at 1 dpi (D) and 2 dpi (E). Red horizontal line represents the mean fold-difference for 5-10 individual midguts. The difference between strains expressing E2-L210Q and E1-A226V residues on VLP infectivity was compared for significance with a two-tailed Students t-test. doi:10.1371/journal.ppat.1002412.g006 E1-A226V substitution has consistently taken about 0.5-1 year to appear [24, 28] , whereas the E2-L210Q change was observed after at least 3 years of circulation in Kerala State [27] ( Figure S1 ). More studies are needed to determine the precise dynamics of the selective sweeps associated with both mutations.

Another interesting observation is that both A. albopictusadaptive substitutions exert their effect on CHIKV fitness primarily at the level of midgut infectivity (Figure 4 and 6) . The overall increase in the number of midgut cells infected with CHIKV VLPs expressing E2-210Q correlates with the increase in dissemination efficiency observed for infectious viruses. Also, the relative increase in the amount of E2-210Q RNA in midguts infected with VLPs is almost indistinguishable from the relative increase in amount of E2-210Q RNA in midguts exposed to infectious viruses (Figure 4 and S4) . Although we did not examine replication in a comprehensive set of mosquito tissues, these results suggest that, after establishing an initial infection from the midgut lumen, the subsequent spread of viruses among neighboring cells is not influenced by position E2-210. Moreover, no differences were observed in CHIKV replication in A. albopictus bodies after intrathoracic infection, indicating that replication of CHIKV in secondary mosquito organs also is unaffected by residue E2-210 ( Figure 4 ). Similar observations were provided earlier for position E1-226 [62] . Experimental studies of epizootic versus enzootic VEEV VLP interactions with the epidemic vector, A. taeniorhynchus, also indicated that midgut epithelia is the target organ for VEEV adaptation to this vector [63] . These findings suggest that adaptation of alphaviruses to a mosquito vector primarily occurs at the level of midgut infection.

In summary, we demonstrated that adaptation of CHIKV to a new mosquito vector can be a multistep process that, since 2005, has involved at least 2 amino acid substitutions in the envelope glycoproteins. The substitution that provides the strongest selective advantage, E1-A226V, was followed by second adaptive mutation (E2-L210Q) that has resulted in a strain circulating in India with the fittest phenotype detected yet for transmission by A. albopictus. We hypothesize that this sequential adaptation will facilitate even more efficient circulation and persistence of the A. albopictusadapted strains in endemic areas and will further increase the risk of expanded and more severe CHIK epidemics in new geographic ranges. This underscores the need for continued surveillance and studies of ongoing CHIKV evolution, as well as the molecular mechanisms that govern CHIKV adaptation to new environments.

The SL07 (SL-CK1) strain of CHIKV was isolated in 2007 from a human in Sri-Lanka (GenBank Acc. No. HM045801.1). This strain belongs to Indian subgroup of the IOL [9] and was obtained from the World Reference Center for Emerging Viruses and Arboviruses (WRCEVA) at the University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, TX after its generous submission by Aravinda de Silva of the University of North Carolina. Since its isolation the strain was passed twice on Vero cells before being used for i.c. construction. Viral RNA was extracted from lyophilized virus stock using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), reversetranscribed using Superscript III (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and cDNA was amplified using Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and PCR. To assemble the i.c., overlapping RT-PCR amplicons were cloned into modified pSinRep5 vector (Invitrogen) under the control of an SP6 promoter using a strategy described previously for strain LR2006 OPY1 [64] . Point mutations 10670CRT (E1-A226V), 9170TRA (E2-L210Q) and 6454ARC (synonymous, ApaI marker) were introduced in various combinations into the i.c. of SL07 using conventional PCR-based cloning methods [65] , and the PCR-generated regions were completely sequenced. Plasmids encoding sub-genomic replicons of strain SL07 were generated from the i.c. of the BHK-21 celladapted version of this strain [SL07-BHK that contains 1296TRC and 5087ARG (nsP1-L407P and nsP3-T348A) substitutions] which was reported previously [9] . These mutations were identified by electroporation of the SL07 i.c. into BHK-21 cells, followed by sequencing of the recovered, plaque purified viruses. Replicons were generated by replacing the structural gene region of SL07-BHK with the sequence of eGFP or CFP genes utilizing standard techniques [64, 66] . In addition, a point mutation 6454ARC (synonymous, ApaI marker) was introduced into the pRep-GFP construct that allows comparison of the relative RNA quantities in an experimental, mixed infection sample. The helper plasmids were generated by deleting the 373-7270 nt. cDNA fragment from i.c. of SL07 that has mutations of interest at E1-226 and E2-210. Plasmids were propagated using the MC1061 strain of E. coli in 2xYT medium and purified by centrifugation in cesium chloride gradients. Detailed information for all plasmids is available from the authors upon request.

Vero cells (African green monkey kidney) were propagated at 37uC, with 5% CO 2 , in Minimal Essential Medium (MEM; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS). BHK-21(S) [Baby Hamsters Kidney] and 293 (Human Embryonic Kidney) cells were maintained at 37uC with 5% CO 2 in MEM-alpha (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FBS and 1x MEM vitamin solution (Invitrogen). The Galveston colonies of A. albopictus and A. aegypti mosquitoes were established from the mosquitoes collected in Galveston, TX (USA). Thailand colonies of A. albopictus and A. aegypti mosquitoes were established from mosquito eggs collected in Bangkok, Thailand. All manipulations and handling of mosquitoes were done as described previously [67] .

Infectious viruses were generated by electroporation of the invitro transcribed RNA into Vero cells. RNA was transcribed from Positions involved in modulation of VEEV host range are in magenta [5, 7, 42] . Image is constructed based on atomic structure of CHIKV E2 protein [PDB ID:3N44, [39] ]. The 3-D model was analyzed using the PyMol molecular viewer [70] . doi:10.1371/journal.ppat.1002412.g008 SP6 promoter of the NotI linearized i.c. DNA using the mMESSAGE mMACHINE kit (Ambion, Austin TX). Ten mg of RNA were electroporated into 10 7 Vero cells using a BTX-Harvard Apparatus ECM 830 Square Wave Electroporator (Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, MS) and 2mm cuvette at the following conditions: 680V, pulse length 99 ms, 5 pulses, with an interval between the pulses of 200ms. Cells were transferred to a 75 cm 2 tissue culture flasks with 14 mL of Leibovitz L-15 (L-15) medium supplemented with 10% FBS and 5% tryptose phosphate broth (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). At 3 h post electroporation the cell supernatant was replaced with 14 mL of L-15 medium and maintained at 37 uC without CO 2 . Cell culture supernatants were collected at 24 and 48 h and stored at 280uC.

To estimate the specific infectivity of electroporated RNAs, an aliquot containing 1x10 5 electroporated Vero cells was serially tenfold diluted and cells were allowed to attach to sub-confluent monolayers (1x10 6 cells/well) of uninfected Vero cells in six-well plates [64] . After 2 h of incubation at 37uC, cells were overlaid with 0.5% agarose in MEM supplemented with 3.3% FBS and incubated for 48 h until plaques developed. The results (specific infectivity values) were expressed as pfu/mg of electroporated RNA (Table S1 ). Titers of the viruses recovered after electroporation and all experimental samples were determined by titration on Vero cells by plaque assay as previously described [7] .

To generate CHIKV VLPs expressing residues of interest in E2 and E1 glycoproteins, BHK-21(S) cells were used, which have superior RNA susceptibility compared to Vero cells. To ensure efficient recovery of CHIKV VLPs from BHK-21 cells, all CHIKV replicons were designed to include BHK-adaptive mutations (nsP1-L407P and nsP3-T348A) identified after rescue of w.t. i.c's in BHK-21(S) cells. Ten micrograms of in-vitro transcribed replicon and helper RNA were mixed and electroporated into 10 7 BHK-21(S) cells as described above for Vero cells. Cells were maintained in L-15 medium at 37uC, followed by harvesting supernatants at 30 h post-electroporation. The titer of VLPs was determined by titration on Vero cells as described earlier [68] . Briefly, 1610 6 Vero cells were seeded in six-well plates and, after a 16 h incubation at 37uC, monolayers were infected with 10-fold dilutions of the samples for 1 h at 37uC, followed by adding 2 mL of MEM. After 24 h of incubation at 37uC the numbers of GFP-or CFP-expressing cells were quantified by fluorescent microscopy and titers were expressed as infectious units (i.u.)/mL.

The role of viral mutations at position E2-210 on CHIKV dissemination in A. albopictus and A. aegypti mosquitoes was analyzed using direct competition experiment as described earlier [6, 9] . A pair of viruses that differed by mutations of interest in the E2 protein was mixed at a 1:1 ratio, with one of the viruses containing the ApaI marker. Viral mixes were used to prepare infectious blood meals by dilution in an equal volume of the defibrinated sheep blood (Colorado Serum, Denver, CO), then orally presented to 4-5 day old female mosquitoes at 37uC as described previously [6, 67] . Ten days post infection, heads and legs of individual mosquitoes were triturated in 500 mL of MEM media containing 5 mg/mL of Amphotericin B (Fungizone), and 100 mL of clarified supernatant were added to duplicate wells of a 96-well plate containing 5x10 4 Vero cells/well. At 3 dpi, supernatant from virus-induced CPE (cytopathic effect)-positive wells was used for RNA extraction followed by RT-PCR with 41855ns-F5 (5-ATATCTAGACATGGTGGAC) and 41855ns-R1 (5-TATCAAAGGAGGCTATGTC) primers sets using One-

Step RT-PCR kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). The PCR products were digested with ApaI restrictase (NEB, Ipswich, MA) and separated on 1.5% agarose gels followed by ethidium bromide staining. One PCR band in the digested sample corresponded to disseminated infection for one out of two viruses in the pair; two bands indicated that both viruses disseminated in the same mosquito. Differences in dissemination efficiencies were tested for significance with a one-tailed McNemar test.

Viral competition experiments with serial, alternating CHIKV passaging in A. albopictus and Vero cells were performed as described above with minor modifications. For the first passage, virus SL07-226V-210Q was mixed with 100-fold excess SL07-226V-Apa to generate infectious blood meals containing 5x10 5 pfu/mL (combined). The blood meal was used for oral infection of A. albopictus (Galveston colony) followed by virus extraction from combined head and leg homogenates derived from 50 individual mosquitoes in 1.5 mL of MEM medium at 10 dpi. Homogenates were filtered and used to infect 75 cm 2 flasks of Vero cells. At 2 dpi, cell culture supernatants were diluted 1:10 in L-15 medium and mixed with equal volumes of defibrinated sheep blood to prepare a blood meal for the second passage. The cycle was repeated a total of 3 times. At 10 dpi of third mosquito passage, heads and legs of individual mosquitoes were processed as described above.

For CHIKV competition experiments in specific body parts of A. albopictus, the mosquitoes were exposed to blood meals containing 1:1 mixes of [SL07-226V-Apa and SL07-226V-210Q] and [SL07-226V and SL07-226V-210Q-Apa]. Depending on the experiment, at 1, 2, 3 and 7 dpi whole mosquito bodies, mosquito carcasses, or mosquito midguts were collected in pools of ten, and were used for RNA extraction using TRIzol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). RNA was RT-PCR amplified, followed by ApaI restrictase digestion of amplicons as described above. Gel images were analyzed using TolaLab (version 2.01) and relative fitness for a given virus during competition was determined as the ratio between E2-210L and E2-210Q bands in the sample, divided by the starting ratio of E2-210L and E2-210Q in the blood meal. The results were expressed as an average value of 2 pools of 10 mosquitoes midguts per pool.

For CHIKV competition experiments in intrathoracically infected mosquitoes, 5 pfu of SL07-226V-Apa and 5 pfu of SL07-226V-210Q in 0.5 mL of L-15 media were directly injected into thoraxes of cold-anesthetized A. albopictus (Galveston colony) using capillary needles as described previously [69] . RNA from 2 pools, 5 mosquitoes/pool, was extracted at 1 and 2 dpi and processed as described above.

To investigate the relationship between the blood meal titers and infection rates in A. albopictus, the SL07-226V and SL07-226V-210Q viruses individually were serially 10-fold diluted, mixed with defibrinated sheep blood and presented orally to A. albopictus (Thailand). At 10 dpi individual mosquitoes were triturated in one mL of MEM and used to infect 5x10 4 Vero cells in duplicate in 96 well plates. CHIKV was detected by observing virus-induced CPE. The difference in the infection rates between SL07-226V and SL07-226V-210Q was tested for significance with a two-tailed Fishers exact test. The oral infectious dose 50% (OID 50 ) values were calculated using the PriProbit program (version 1.63).

For VLP experiments, A. albopictus (Thailand) were infected with 1:1 mixes (based on i.u. titers) of GFP-or CFP-expressing subgenomic replicons packaged into VLPs using CHIKV helpers that differed by substitutions at positions E1-226 and E2-210 ( Figure 6A and 7A) . At 1 and 2 dpi, 5-10 mosquito midguts were dissected in PBS, and cut longitudinally to generate monolayers of epithelial cells. These sheets were rinsed in PBS to remove residual blood and gently spread out on a glass slide. A cover slip was applied and the midgut sheets were immediately analyzed by fluorescent microscopy to determine the numbers of cells expressing GFP and CFP in the same field of vision. One or two fields of vision were analyzed for each midgut sheet. In parallel experiment, midguts infected with VLPs packaged using helpers that differ by substitutions at position E2-210 were dissected at 1, 2 and 3 dpi, collected in pools of ten, which were used for RNA extraction using TRIzol (Invitrogen). The RNA was processed as described above.

To demonstrate that replicon and helper RNAs did not recombine to generate infectious virus capable of autonomous replication, 30 mosquitoes were infected with VLPs mixes and at 7 dpi were triturated in 1 mL of MEM, filter sterilized and 300 mL of homogenate was used to infect each of 3 wells of confluent Vero cells in six-well plates. After 1 h of infection at 37uC, 2 mL of MEM was added to each well, followed by incubation at 37uC with 5% CO 2 . Cells were observed daily for signs of CPE for 5 days.

To investigate the effect of substitutions at E2-210 on CHIKV fitness in Vero and 293 cells, these cells were infected at a multiplicity 0.1 pfu/cell in triplicate with 1:1 mixtures of [SL07-226V-Apa and SL07-226V-210Q] and [SL07-226V and SL07-226V-210Q-Apa] viruses. Cells were maintained at 37 uC with 5% CO 2 in MEM and at 2 dpi, supernatants were collected for RNA extraction and processed as described above.

Black arrows correspond to the emergence and movement of the CHIKV lineages with the E1-226A residue. Red arrows correspond to the acquisition of the E1-A226V substitution. Blue arrow corresponds to acquisition of the E2-L210 substitution. The graph was constructed based on the data published in [24, [27] [28] [29] [30] .

At 2 dpi cell culture supernatants were collected for RNA extraction and viral RT-PCR analysis. The relative fitness (RF) within a given competition was determined as the average ratio between E2-210L and E2-210Q bands in the sample (r), divided by the starting ratio of E2-210L and E2-210Q bands in the inoculum (i) used for infection.

At 1, 2 and 3 dpi, mosquito midguts were dissected and 2 pools of 5 midguts per pool were used for RNA extraction and RT-PCR analysis (B). Relative fitness (RF) was determined as the average ratio between bands corresponding to VLPs expressing E2-210Q and E2-210L residues in the sample, divided by the initial ratio of E2-210Q and E2-210L bands in the BM used for mosquito infections.

Association between viral seasonality and meteorological factors,"We examined the effects of daily local meteorological data (temperature, relative humidity, ""humidity-","The common cold is typically a mild upper respiratory tract infection (URTI), with symptoms such as nasal stuffiness and discharge, sore throat, coughing and sneezing 1, 2 . URTI are mostly self-limiting but can progress to lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) particularly in those with underlying conditions 3, 4 . Adults suffer from a cold two to five times a year, and children can have 7-10 episodes annually 5 . Numerous viruses can cause URTI 6 . Rhinoviruses (also called the common cold virus), are responsible for around 30% to 70% of all respiratory infections 5, 6 . Since there are >100 different rhinovirus types, reinfections are very common 7 . Coronavirus is the second most common cause of URTI, causing 7% to 18% of cases 8 . Other viruses including respiratory syncytial viruses (RSV) types A and B, human parainfluenza viruses (HPIV) types 1-4, adenoviruses, human metapneumovirus (HMPV) and influenza viruses A-C (IAV, IBV and ICV) also cause URTI 8,9 . Most respiratory viral infections have seasonality. In temperate regions, URTI increase in frequency in autumn and spring, and remain raised through winter 8 . Three theories have been put forward to explain viral seasonality. 1: The effect of climatic conditions on host resistance to infection (low vitamin D levels following lack of sun exposure can affect our ability to fight infection) 9,10 . 2: The effect of meteorological factors (e.g. temperature, humidity) on virus survival and hence on infection rates 9, 11 . 3: The effect of behavioural changes on transmission (e.g. spending more time indoors in close proximity to others or aggregation of susceptible children at schools during the colder months) 8,9 . There are other hypothesis such as diminished immune responses in a chilled host, or the reactivation of dormant viruses by chilling for the increase in URTI during the colder months 12 .

Temperature has an important effect on viral activity, particularly in the case of enveloped viruses. In a guinea pig model, IAV transmission is more effective in cold and dry conditions 13 . Integrity of IAV envelopes are better at lower temperatures, whilst in warm temperatures, the envelope becomes disordered and the virus susceptible to damage 14 . Reports suggest that IAV survival is better associated with absolute humidity (which measures the amount of water vapour in air regardless of the temperature) rather than relative humidity 15, 16 . An association of absolute humidity with hospitalisation due to influenza LRTI (but not with LRTI due to Rhinovirus or RSV) has recently been reported 17 .

Most reports on viral seasonality concentrate on viruses that appear in the winter months, particularly influenza viruses and RSV. Here we aim to determine the seasonality of all the respiratory viruses detected over 6.5 years, and identify any associations between changes in meteorological factors (such as temperature or humidity) and the appearance of different viruses across a whole year.

Between April 2009 and November 2015, rhinoviruses and adenoviruses were present throughout the year. Rhinoviruses were present most days of the year (84.7%), followed by adenovirus which was present on 52.3% of the days. RSV (36.4%), HMPV (32.8%) and IAV (32.7%) were present in around 1/3 rd of the year. HPIV-3 was present in 24.6% of days, followed by HPIV-1 (15.5%) and IBV (15.2%). HPIV-2 was present for the fewest number of days (6.5%) ( Table 1) . Children ≤10 accounted for 45% of the number of samples tested. The age groups of those tested are in Table 2 . Figures 1-3 plot the weather conditions and the virus prevalence during the study period. Mean air temperature ( Fig. 1) showed the expected seasonality, with a peak in July (14 °C to 16 °C) and a trough in January (−1 °C to 4 °C). Mean dew point (Fig. 1 ) and the variation in humidity within a day (i.e. ""humidity-range"", Fig. 3 ) showed a similar pattern. Mean dew point was highest in August (10 °C to 12 °C) and lowest in February (−2 °C to 3 °C). ""Humidity-range"" was larger in the summer months (40% to 44%), and least variable in winter (15% to 18%). Mean relative humidity however showed the opposite pattern, typically highest in December (88% to 91%) and lowest in June (70% to 74%). Air pressure, wind speed and duration of daylight did not show clear seasonality (data not shown).

Many viruses have a definite seasonality (Figs 1-3 ). RSV and IAV have the largest seasonal peaks, appearing in November-December and December-January respectively. IBV (February-March), HMPV (March), and HPIV-3 (April-May) follow sequentially. IBV has a biennial distribution occurring every other year. HPIV-2 has two peaks, a major peak around October-November and a minor peak in July. A clear seasonality is not noticeable for HPIV-1. Adenovirus and rhinovirus are present throughout the year. Rhinovirus also has two peaks, a major peak around October-November and a minor peak in March. Adenovirus has a smaller peak in March-April.

Temperature appears to have the greatest effect on viral seasonality (Fig. 1) . The average temperature during the study was 9.2 °C. In keeping with their year-round presence, the mean temperature when adenovirus and rhinovirus are present is closer to the annual mean at 8.8 °C and 8.9 °C respectively. A preference for colder temperatures is noticeable for RSV, IAV, and IBV (6.3 °C, 6.7 °C and 6.3 °C respectively). HMPV is most prevalent when the temperature becomes slightly warmer (7.4 °C). HPIV-3 is the only virus to prefer above average temperatures (9.4 °C). The average dew point was 6.0 °C (Fig. 1) . Dew point has a similar pattern of relationship to viruses as temperature, with RSV (3.7 °C), IAV (3.9 °C), IBV (3.3 °C) and HMPV (4.4 °C) preferring lower dew points. In contrast, HPIV-3 prefers a higher dew point (5.9 °C). Temperature and dew point are both significantly lower on days adenovirus, RSV, IAV, IBV, and HMPV are present ( Table 3) .

The average relative humidity was 81% over the study period (Fig. 2) . RSV (84%), IAV (82.9%) and HPIV-1(82.6%) prefer higher relative humidity. HPIV-3 is more active when the relative humidity is lower (79.9%) ( Table 3 ). The average variation in humidity within the day (i.e. ""humidity-range"") was 25%. ""Humidity-range"" is significantly narrow for most viruses apart from rhinovirus, HPIV-2 and HPIV-3 (Table 3) . RSV (21.8%) and IAV (23.8%) prefer much narrower ranges then other viruses. HPIV-3, in contrast to the other viruses, appears to prefer a wide ""humidity-range"" (29.7%). Though HPIV-2 seems to prefer raised humidity and a narrow ""humidity-range"", the difference in these variables between days the HPIV-2 is present or absent is insignificant (Table 3) , potentially a reflection of the lower number of HPIV-2 cases. Table 4 shows the results of the binomial logistic regression carried out to determine the effect of multiple metrological factors on virus activity. It demonstrates how a unit increase in each meteorological variable (either 1 °C for mean temperature, or 1% for mean relative humidity or ""humidity-range"") alters the odds of a virus being present. Only results that were found to be significant in the t-test were examined using logistic regression (i.e. rhinovirus and HPIV-2 were excluded). Following the logistic regression, no significant association was found for HPIV-1. A mean temperature increase by 1 °C reduces the odds of detecting adenovirus, RSV, IAV, IBV and HMPV. Adenovirus has a small decrease (2.8%), while RSV (17.3%), IAV (13.7%), IBV (13%) and HMPV (9.9%) have larger decreases. A 1% increase in relative humidity reduces the odds of HPIV-3 being present (2.6%). A 1% increase in ""humidity-range"" also decreases the odds of detecting RSV (3.8%) and IAV (1.7%). Air temperature has a significant effect against the most number of viruses (n = 5) followed by ""humidity-range"" and relative humidity. The smaller effect of ""humidity-range"" in comparison to mean temperature may be due to an interrelationship between mean humidity and ""humidity-range"", since logistic regression takes multiple variables into account. Figure 4a -c are the generalised linear models (GLM), examining each virus' incidence across a year, averaged over the entire study period. This was compared with temperature over the same period. These models confirm a preference for colder temperatures for RSV, IAV and IBV, and the timings of their seasonal peaks in and around 17 th December, 12 th January and 8 th February respectively. Even though rhinovirus and adenovirus are present throughout the year, their GLM's point to periods of increased activity (around the 5 th of March for Adenovirus and around the 6 th November for rhinovirus). The GLM corroborates HPIV-3's preference for warmer temperatures and its seasonal peak around the 4 th of May. Finally, the GLM suggests that HMPV peaks around the 11 th of March, HPIV-1 peaks around the 31 st October, and HPIV-2 peaks around the 15 th of November.

From Fig. 4a -c, a rough order of seasonal peaks is noticeable for the different viruses, beginning with IAV in January. After this, there are peaks of IBV in February, HMPV and Adenovirus in March, HPIV-3 in May, HPIV-1 in the end of October, rhinoviruses, and HPIV-2 in November, and ending with RSV in December. Since temperature and humidity appear to have a significant impact on viral incidence when analysed individually, we Table 3 . Comparison of mean meteorological values on the days a virus is detectable or undetectable. CI: Confidence interval, p value from T test. Significant p values in bold. We measured the mean of each meteorological factor on days when we received positive samples for a given virus and on days where we did not receive a positive sample for that virus. Hence a larger difference in means denotes that a virus is commonly present at an extreme of that meteorological factor: e.g. RSV more often being present when temperature is lower.

Scientific RepoRts | (2019) 9:929 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-018-37481-y calculated the difference in mean temperature and humidity preferred by the different viruses and arranged them in the order as above (Table 5 ). Figure 5 represents this pattern visually using results from ANOVA. Starting with the seasonal peak of IAV in January, there is a decrease in relative humidity from 82.9% to 81.7% in February, along with a decrease in mean temperature from 6.7 °C to 6.3 °C. These changes are associated with peaks in incidence of IBV. Following this, relative humidity stabilises until March. However, the mean temperature rises significantly to 7.4 °C in March corresponding with the peak in HMPV and then further to 8.8 °C when a peak in adenovirus occurs. Next, there is a further increase in temperature to 9.4 °C along with a significant reduction in relative humidity to 79.9% in May when a peak in HPIV-3 is observed. A slight drop in mean temperature (8.4 °C) and a significant increase in mean relative humidity (82.6%), from May to October is associated with a peak in HPIV-1. With mean temperatures being fairly constant, a further drop in relative humidity (81.6%) is associated with a peak in rhinovirus activity in November. A slight increase in humidity and a drop in temperature in November is associated with the presence of HPIV-2. A dramatic drop in temperature to 6.2 °C and an increase in relative humidity to 84.0%, leads to the peak in RSV in December. Then the cycle begins anew with IAV in January.

Du Prel et al. have reported that air temperature and relative humidity were important factors affecting viral seasonality in Germany over a 6-year period 18 . As in our study, air pressure did not have a significant correlation. However, to our knowledge, this is the first study to report the association between meteorological conditions and the sequential appearance of viruses through the year and the effect of daily fluctuations in humidity (i.e. ""humidity-range"") on virus seasonality. Our data shows that all the viral agents of URTI show degrees of seasonal variation corroborated by the GLM. Based on similarity in structures and seasonality, there appear to be three groups. 1: Non-enveloped viruses (rhinovirus and adenovirus) which are present throughout the year. 2: Enveloped viruses with winter preponderance (RSV, HMPV, IAV and IBV) and 3: Parainfluenza viruses 1-3, enveloped viruses with a preference for warmer temperatures.

In our study, non-enveloped agents are present year-round with some seasonal variation. Adenovirus is known to be stable at high humidity levels (80%) 19 . Since this is very close to the mean humidity for the study period (81%), this could explain the presence of adenovirus throughout the year. Davis GW showed that adenovirus survival is better at high humidity levels (89%) than at lower humidity (50%) 20 . The peak in March found in our GLM for adenoviruses is different to the December peaks observed for enteric adenoviruses in Japan, though a peak in the winter months is seen when GLM was drawn for 2011, a year when visual peaks for all viruses were present (Supplementary Fig. 1) 21 . Our results show that adenoviruses prefer temperatures around 9 °C. The inverse relationship between adenoviruses and temperature, corroborated by the lower OR, is in keeping with the report from Germany 18 .

The year-round presence of rhinoviruses is similar to other reports 18, 22 , but the November peak found using the GLM is later than the September-October peaks found in other research. However, as these two peaks correspond to when children go back to school, it is possible that meteorological factors do not solely account for these peaks. As rhinovirus is present throughout the year, there appears to be no significant difference in meteorological factors on days rhinovirus is present or absent. This is unlike the negative correlation with temperature and a positive correlation with relative humidity reported from Germany 18 . Whether this reflects the climatic conditions of the UK (being an island) compared to Germany needs further evaluation.

In our study, enveloped viruses with peaks in the winter months, had an association with lower temperatures, dew points and humidity-ranges, and preference for higher humidity. A significant relationship with low temperature, dew point and high relative humidity have been reported for RSV 23, 24 , IAV 18,25 and IBV 25 . RSV and IAV appear to be associated with lower temperatures, dew point, ""humidity-range"" and high humidity, however, by logistic regression significant association is only seen with lower temperatures and lower ""humidity-ranges"". IBV and HMPV which appear to be associated with lower temperatures, dew point, and ""humidity-range"", are only associated with lower temperature by logistic regression. This illustrates the complex interaction between different meteorological factors and hence the difficulty in understanding their specific effects on viral prevalence. IBV has a biennial pattern in Edinburgh unlike the bimodal pattern from Okinawa, a subtropical region in Japan 26 . This suggests that local meteorological variation and factors affecting transmission and herd immunity might have a role to play in viral seasonality. Other studies have also reported early spring peaks of HMPV, Table 5 . Comparison of mean temperature and mean humidity for different viruses. To determine which variable significantly affects transition from one virus to another, we calculated the differences in mean temperature and relative humidity of virus in column minus virus in row. e.g. a decrease in temperature from autumn to winter is associated with a change from HPIV-2 to RSV. T = Temperature Difference, H = Humidity difference. Results of ANOVA. Significant p values in bold (*p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001).

Changes in mean temperature and mean relative humidity associated with sequential increase in activity of viruses between January and December (vertical lines -standard error of the mean). Each data point corresponds to the mean temperature or mean relative humidity during the period when the virus is most active (e.g. IAV in January).

Scientific RepoRts | (2019) 9:929 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-018-37481-y association with low temperature 27,28 and raised relative humidity 29 . The biennial pattern for HMPV reported from Germany 30 , Austria 30 and Sweden 31 , is not seen in our study. Both RSV and IAV appear when the relative humidity is high (83% to 84%) in Edinburgh. Others have reported variable findings, with some reporting a positive association 18 , and others reporting that enveloped viruses are better transmitted in low humidity 32 . For example, Iha Y et al. reported an inverse correlation with relative humidity for influenza A and a direct association with relative humidity for influenza B from Japan 26 . Since relative humidity is significantly associated only with HPIV-3 on logistic regression, the absolute value of humidity may be less important than fluctuation in humidity to the survival of the virus, particularly with viruses predominantly seen in the Autumn and Winter. It is possible that temperature and ""humidity-range"" could both have a combined impact on viral stability. In laboratory conditions, RSV survives for longer at lower temperatures, with infectivity falling rapidly as temperature increases. It is known that freezing and thawing leads to marked reduction in infectivity of RSV 33 . The preference for a narrow ""humidity-range"" and the change in relative humidity associated with changes in temperature 34 could explain why viruses are not stable in frost-free freezers which have to warm up regularly to prevent accumulation of ice in the freezer compartment. This needs further investigation. HPIV 1-3, despite being enveloped RNA viruses, seems to prefer warmer temperatures (8.2 °C-9.4 °C) than the other enveloped RNA viruses. Due to its low incidence over our study period, the seasonality of HPIV-1 and HPIV-2 remain unclear though the GLM suggests it is around October-November. There is a possibility of a biennial seasonality for HPIV-1, similar to that reported in the US 35 , but the trend remains unclear due to the low prevalence in our study. Unlike HPIV-1 and 2, HPIV-3 increases when temperature is highest (9.4 °C) and when relative humidity is lowest (79.9%). HPIV-3 also appears to tolerate large variations in ""humidity-range"" (29.7%). Following logistic regression, HPIV-3 is associated with lower relative humidity. The seasonal peak for HPIV-3 in May 35 , its stability at lower relative humidity 36 and higher temperatures 28, 36 have been reported previously. Our results indicate that most viruses prefer stable humidity (i.e. a lower ""humidity-range"") through the day. This requires confirmation from further studies.

There are some limitations to this study. There is a possibility that the samples tested may include those who do not live in the catchment area. As the data is anonymised, it is not possible to determine whether the individuals are tourists or residents of the area. However, since all samples tested over the time period were analysed we believe that it is as representative as it can be. And, as the incubation period in viral respiratory infections is relatively short, it is unlikely that a viral infection will have originated abroad unless the patient was infected just prior to travelling to Edinburgh, which should be a relatively small percentage of the overall population examined in this study. Another limitation is that our data only represents those who sought medical care and were then tested. Hence a time lag between the individual becoming infected, becoming symptomatic and subsequently becoming unwell enough to require medical attention is present. We have not corrected our data for incubation period or for duration of illness prior to sampling. We have analysed the proportion of positive results for each virus for each day. Since proportion depends both on the number of positive results and on the total number of samples tested, it does not directly reflect the number of positive cases. We did not analyse coronavirus seasonality as it was not part of the routine testing panel during that period. Since meteorological factors can be interlinked (e.g. dew point and relative humidity), examining the effects of individual meteorological factors on viral seasonality can lead to an incomplete picture 37 . We hence attempted to tease this out by performing logistic regression on variables which showed an association in the univariate analysis. Since dew point was removed to prevent collinearity affecting the results of logistic regression, a new regression could in the future be performed to analyse the impact of dew point by removing temperature. There is a preference for stable ""humidity-range"" in most enveloped viruses except for HPIV-3. Following a visual inspection of the minimum and maximum for each variable and comparison with virus seasonality patterns for different viruses, there appeared to be a relationship between ""humidity-range"" and viral seasonality. Hence, we investigated the relationship between ""humidity-range"" and viral seasonality. It would be interesting to assess if a similar relationship is seen with other ranges such as ""temperature-range"", ""dew point-range"", etc in the future. Relationship with other variables appears to be virus specific. Therefore, we need models which can investigate multiple variables for each virus. Changes in weather, human behaviour and the immune system can all affect an agent's seasonality and are all interlinked, as seen in the decrease in vitamin D in temperate climates due to the decrease in daylight hours (shorter/cloudier days). This also makes it difficult to describe the effect of weather on viral seasonality in isolation. Finally, the GLM used in this study has some disadvantages. The GLM used does not account for the lag period between people becoming infected and then seeking medical help, and it also cannot model the multiple peaks seen for rhinoviruses. Furthermore, average data was used to calculate the GLM. This has led to some of the curves not being as smooth as when yearly data is analysed (for e.g. from 2011 a year when peaks were seen for all viruses ( Supplementary Fig. 1) ). The two steps seen in the curves correspond to the start and end date and probably reflect the lack of samples from January to March in 2009 and the month of December in 2015 as we have analysed data from April 2009 and November 2015. Despite this, the average data over the 6.5 years is very similar to that from 2011. This helps confirm the seasonality for most viruses. There may be differences in individual years as can be seen for adenovirus which had a peak seasonality in December in 2011.

Nonetheless, our findings on temperature, humidity and ""humidity-range"" could potentially help explain the variation in seasonality between temperate and tropical regions of the world. IAV is known to occur throughout the year in South East Asian countries closer to the equator (warm, humid environment) 38 . The further you are from the equator, winter seasonality and or association with monsoon rains is notable 39, 40 . Our findings on ""humidity-ranges"" need confirmation in a tropical setting. The order of occurrence of different viruses in tropical and temperate regions needs to be investigated in relation to the parameters highlighted. Additionally, whether these peaks in viral activity change depending on the age of the population analysed could also be a topic for future research. In conclusion, non-enveloped viruses were present throughout the year. Enveloped viruses were more seasonal starting from IAV in January to RSV in December with other viruses in between. RSV, HPIV-3 and IAV and IBV showing the clearest patterns. RSV, IAV and IBV show a clear preference for colder temperature and dew point, as well as consistent humidity. In contrast, HPIV showed a preference for higher temperatures. Additionally, HPIV-3 demonstrated a significant tolerance to low humidity. Hence, meteorological factors like temperature, humidity and ""humidity-range"" have a significant effect on the incidence of the causative agents of the common cold and changes in meteorological factors could potentially predict the decline of one virus and the emergence of the next.

Meteorological data. Following discussion with the Met Office, Edinburgh Gogarbank weather station, which captures data on an hourly basis, was identified as the most representative weather station for the catchment areas examined in this study. We downloaded meteorological data collected by the Edinburgh Gogarbank weather station from the Met Office Weather Observation Website. Hourly air temperature (°C), air pressure (hPa), relative humidity (%) dew point (°C), wind speed and daylight length measurements from 1 st April 2009 to the 30 th November 2015 were available. Small periods of weather data were missing in October 2011 and June 2015 (reasons unknown). We calculated means and ranges for each variable for each day. We also created weekly and monthly aggregations of the data. As rhinoviruses and HMPV testing only started from the 4 th of September 2009, results for these two agents were only available after this date.

Virological Data. We collated anonymised virological results on all forms of respiratory samples (nose/throat swabs, nasopharyngeal aspirates, bronchoalveolar lavages, endotracheal aspirates, etc) tested at the Department of Laboratory Medicine, Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh. These included all samples from patients attending 8 hospitals around Edinburgh (Astley Ainslie Hospital, Chalmers Centre, Liberton Hospital, Royal Edinburgh Hospital, Royal Hospital for Sick Children, Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh, Royal Victoria Hospital, Western General Hospital), and 126 primary care centres across in Edinburgh and Lothian, tested at the Department of Laboratory Medicine, Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh. We had results from 36,191 individual patients over the study period. Of these patients, 17,936 were male and 18,241 were female (information on gender was not available for 14). The age groups of the cohort are in Table 2 . PCR results were available for rhinovirus, adenovirus, IAV, IBV, HPIV 1-3, RSV and HMPV. There were no major modifications to the assay in that time. Rhinovirus and HMPV data was unavailable until screening commenced in September 2009. Between 16 th -24 th February 2011, samples were not tested for rhinovirus due to high work load. Between September 15 th and December 9 th 2010, IBV was not tested due to technical reasons. We removed repeat positive samples from the same individual collected within 14 days from analysis, resulting in a total of 52060 samples for analysis. We calculated the proportion of positive results (as %) for individual viruses for each day, to help compare results over time. We used daily data for statistical analysis to avoid loss of accuracy from averaging data. To identify seasonal trends, we plotted the proportion of positive results for each day against individual meteorological factors.

Analysis. Univariate analysis of continuous variables (mean temperature, dew point, relative humidity, and the difference between maximum and minimum humidity in a day; ""humidity-range"") were compared between days where one or more samples were positive for a given virus, and days where no samples were positive for that virus using two-sample t-tests. To determine the impact of multiple factors, multivariable logistic regression was conducted using those variables with a univariate p-value of <0.1 in the t-test and models were built using the ""Enter (forced entry)"" method on SPSS. Due to the likelihood of collinearity affecting results because of the close relationship between dew point and temperature, dew point was removed from the logistic regression.

An analysis of variance (ANOVA) in conjunction with Tukey's range test were done, to determine if the mean temperature, dew point, pressure, relative humidity, and ""humidity-range"" at which individual viruses were present were different between viruses. This was performed in conjunction with post-hoc analysis.

Finally, seasonality of individual viruses identified in our study was confirmed with a generalised linear model (GLM) based on temperature following the method of Naumova et al. 41 . The GLM was calculated using daily incidence of each virus, averaged over the entire study period.

Spatially Adjusted time- varying Reproductive numbers: Understanding the Geographical expansion of Urban Dengue outbreaks,"the basic reproductive number (R 0 ) is a fundamental measure used to quantify the transmission potential of an epidemic in public health practice. However, R 0 cannot reflect the time-varying nature of an epidemic. A time-varying effective reproductive number R t can provide more information because it tracks the subsequent evolution of transmission. However, since it neglects individual-level geographical variations in exposure risk, R t may smooth out interpersonal heterogeneous transmission potential, obscure high-risk spreaders, and hence hamper the effectiveness of control measures in spatial dimension. therefore, this study proposes a new method for quantifying spatially adjusted (time-varying) reproductive numbers that reflects spatial heterogeneity in transmission potential among individuals. This new method estimates individual-level effective reproductive numbers (R j ) and a summarized indicator for population-level time-varying reproductive number (R t ). Data from the five most severe dengue outbreaks in southern Taiwan from 1998-2015 were used to demonstrate the ability of the method to highlight early spreaders contributing to the geographic expansion of dengue transmission. our results show spatial heterogeneity in the transmission potential of dengue among individuals and identify the spreaders with the highest R j during the epidemic period. the results also reveal that super-spreaders are usually early spreaders that locate at the edges of the epidemic foci, which means that these cases could be the drivers of the expansion of the outbreak. therefore, our proposed method depicts a more detailed spatial-temporal dengue transmission process and identifies the significant role of the edges of the epidemic foci, which could be weak spots in disease control and prevention.","The basic reproductive number (R 0 ) is a fundamental measure used to quantify the transmission potential of an epidemic 1 . It is defined as the number of infections caused by an index case within a completely susceptible population, i.e., a population in which there is no pre-existing immunity. R 0 is a summary index suggesting both the intrinsic transmissibility of a pathogen and the infrastructure that allows the disease to spread in a given setting. In particular, the value of R 0 is affected by transmission probability, contact rate and duration of infectiousness 2 .

Based on deterministic homogenous-mixing epidemic models 3 , public health practitioners usually regard R 0 = 1 as a useful threshold for ensuring the development of an outbreak, referred to as the epidemic threshold 4 . The health authorities also use R 0 for predicting final epidemic size 3, 5 and assessing the resources required to contain the outbreak, e.g., determining what proportion of people should be vaccinated 2 . Therefore, it is of great practical importance to estimate R 0 for a possible outbreak in public health practice. The value of R 0 is estimated from the initial growth rate of an epidemic based on mechanistic models, such as the susceptible-infected-recovered model 3, 6 . For example, R 0 has been estimated at approximately 1.5 for 2009 H1N1 influenza 7 , at 3 for the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak 8 , and at 12-18 for historical measles outbreaks 9 . As an epidemic unfolds, however, the depletion and recovery of the susceptible population cause fluctuating effective transmissibility, so the value of R 0 cannot reflect the time-varying nature of an epidemic. Moreover, when an epidemic occurs in a realistic contact network, R 0 can also fail to characterize the transmission potential at the initial stage 10 .

On the other hand, the effective reproductive number (R) is defined as the number of infections caused by any case 11 . The difference between R and R 0 is that the value of R does not depend on the assumption that the population is completely susceptible, which is often violated in later stages of an outbreak or in a situation in which the population has been exposed to the pathogen previously. Therefore, R aims to characterize the progression of an epidemic in a realistic scenario. Intuitively, counting the branches of infection on transmission trees (i.e., who infects whom 6 ) precisely quantifies the value of R; however, doing this is impractical in most circumstances except for confined outbreaks where contact tracing is feasible 12 . The epidemic curve (an illustration of the number of new infections) does not encode transmission dynamics and cannot be used to infer R directly. The renewal equation 11 , which describes the temporal transmission relationship between propagating generations of infected cases, is therefore proposed to estimate R from incidence data in different epidemic periods. More specifically, the renewal equation estimates the values of the time-varying effective reproductive number (R t ), defined as the population-level transmission potential at time t 11, 13 . In a fully susceptible population, early values of R t should approximate R 0 , but R t is more informative in that it tracks the subsequent evolution of transmission potential during the course of an outbreak. The values of R t can also reveal the time when an outbreak was contained by monitoring the epidemic threshold. During the 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa, R t captured a distinct temporal pattern of transmission potential in different countries, signaling the different levels of control measures needed 14 . As the change in transmission potential is highly correlated to control measures, public health practitioners can evaluate the effectiveness of control measures by determining the change in R t after implementation. For example, sudden drops in R t (from 3 to approximately 0.7) after the issuance of a global alert during the 2003 SARS outbreak indicated the effectiveness of the alert 15 .

Time-varying effective reproductive numbers can be estimated by the renewal equation with a weighted ratio of infectors and infectees 11 . The generation interval, defined as the infection time interval between a potential infector and an infectee, is the major component of the process of determining the temporal weights of possible transmission. A major pitfall of the renewal equation method is that it automatically assumes homogeneous mixing of individuals. In effect, the temporal weight assumes that transmission probability is determined only by the temporal difference in onset of illness between the infector and infectees, regardless of possible variations due to geographical and social proximity. Human mobility and contact patterns are highly structured in the real world [16] [17] [18] and inevitably violate the homogeneous mixing assumption 19 . Studies have demonstrated spatial heterogeneities in the transmission of dengue 20 , cholera 21 , influenza 22 , and foot-and-mouth disease 23 . Recent studies have also shown that spatial distance between cases strongly influences short-term movement 24 and, hence, the spread of these diseases. Moreover, short-range transmission has served the essential mode of disease transmission 25 , i.e., patients typically have a higher chance of infecting others nearby. Although this spatial effect has been considered in the aforementioned studies and in the transmission tree reconstruction of some diseases 26, 27 , the effect of spatial distance on the estimation of the effective reproductive number has not yet been explored. The spatial relationship between individuals can be utilized to calculate the discriminative transmission potential for each individual ( Fig. 1 ; see the methods section for details). Neglecting the spatial variation, conversely, may smooth out heterogeneities in transmission potential, obscure high-risk spreaders, and hamper the effectiveness of control measures. In summary, the effect of spatial proximity or distance should be accounted for in the estimation of effective reproductive numbers.

Therefore, the objective of this study is to propose such method for quantifying spatially adjusted reproductive numbers that reflects spatial heterogeneity in exposure risk. It generates individual-level effective reproductive numbers (R j ) and a summarized indicator for the whole population (R t ) by the transmission probability estimated for all infector-infectee pairs, based on both temporal and spatial characteristics. Temporal weighting functions account for the fact that infected cases can only transmit the disease effectively within a certain time window (the generation interval). When only temporal weighting is considered, our method is equivalent to the renewal equation, assuming homogeneous mixing. The spatial weighting function, on the other hand, accounts for the decaying chance of transmission when the distance between individuals increases. The value of spatially adjusted R j can provide more information regarding spatial heterogeneities in transmission potential and can better aid in the implementation of control measures. Data from dengue epidemics in southern Taiwan are used to demonstrate the ability of this method to identify early spreaders contributing to the geographic expansion of dengue transmission.

Study Area. Taiwan (23.778°N, 120.930°E) is an island country at the border of tropical and subtropical climate zones. Due to its geographic proximity to dengue endemic countries in Southeast Asia ( Fig. 2A) , dengue outbreaks in Taiwan are triggered by imported index cases from endemic regions. Large outbreaks have occurred in the tropical monsoon regions of southern Taiwan, particularly in the cities of Tainan (TN) and Kaohsiung (KH). These two large tropical cities feature high temperatures and high humidity, high population density, and highly urbanized landscapes, all of which provide appropriate breeding habitats for Aedes aegypti, the main vector mosquitoes of dengue virus. Thus, as dengue outbreaks occur frequently in late summer and wane in winter, the two cities form natural settings for the repetitive observation of dengue invasion and epidemic propagation.

Dengue data. Dengue fever is listed as a notifiable infectious disease in Taiwan. This means that physicians are mandated to report suspected cases in which the patient lives in or has a history of travel to a dengue-affected area and has corresponding symptoms, including fever, rash, eye pain, leukopenia, etc. The reported cases are then confirmed by standard laboratory tests, including real-time PCR, ELISA, and antigen detection 28 . These surveillance data are recorded and provided by Taiwan Centers for Disease Control, Ministry of Health and Welfare 29 . The dengue database starts in 1998, when the electronic reporting system was implemented, and we include all records since 1998-01-01. Individual-level information, including date of disease onset and X-Y coordinates of residence, is also provided. Each pair of residence coordinates is listed as the center of a basic statistical area, which is the smallest geographic unit for socioeconomic surveying in Taiwan. There was a total of 78,749 confirmed dengue cases (4.4% of them were imported cases) in Taiwan from 1998 to 2017, 92.5% of which occurred in Tainan and Kaohsiung cities. is estimated first. The sum of these probabilities is, by definition, the expected number of infectees caused by individual j, i.e., the individual reproductive number. The transmission probability itself is estimated based on solely temporal relationships (non-adjusted) or in combination with spatial relationships (spatially adjusted). In the non-adjusted method, p ·j is proportional to the temporal weight g(a) determined by the generation interval between infector j and its infectees. Cases in the same temporal cohort (i.e., with the same onset day, a 1 = a 2 = a 3 ) share the same transmission probability from previous infectors. They also share the same individual reproductive number since their relationship to subsequent cases is again identical. For the spatially adjusted method, p ·j is proportional to the spatial weights f(d), modulated by the distance between the infector and the infectees in space. Therefore, individual reproductive numbers of cases in the same cohort can be distinguished. The five most severe epidemics selected by the outbreak size were included in this study. The maps are generated by R package ggplot2, and sf (version 3.6.1, https://cran.r-project.org). Figure 2B shows the historical records of dengue epidemics in Taiwan since 1998; the five most severe outbreaks were included in this study. Among the five outbreaks, two occurred in Tainan (2007TN, 2015TN) , and three occurred in Kaohsiung (2002KH, 2014KH, 2015KH). The sizes of the outbreaks ranged from 22,784 cases in 2015TN to 1,183 cases in 2011KH. Generally, dengue outbreaks start in June, reach their peak around September, and end near the end of the year or early the next January. In this study, we analyzed the largest outbreak, 2015TN, to demonstrating our method, while detailed results for the other four epidemics are presented in our supplementary results. Of the 22,784 total infections in 2015TN, only 19 cases (<0.1%) were imported from foreign countries, suggesting that indigenous transmission was well established. In contrast with Kaohsiung city, very few outbreaks occurred in Taiwan before 2015.

Quantifying the temporal transmission dynamics. The renewal equation specifies the relationship between generations of incident cases, as shown in Eq. (1). It can be applied to estimate time-varying effective reproductive numbers due to its simplicity and generality regarding the temporal transmission dynamics 11, 13, 30 .

x a x a 0 R t represents the population-level time-varying effective reproductive number at time t. b

x denotes the number of incident cases at time x, and − b x a in the denominator denotes the number of potential infectors generated at a days (a ≥ 0) prior to time x. The hat notations stand for observed case numbers. g(a) stands for the distribution of the generation interval, which is used as a weighting function for representing transmission potential at time interval a. It can be specified by the nature of disease transmission process.

Importantly, the generation interval, also known as generation time, is the period between the infection of an infector and the infection of its infectees. It is a fundamental parameter reflecting the natural history of pathogens. Since the generation interval may vary between individuals, it can be described by a probability distribution, g(a), where a is a time interval. Therefore, the function can be regarded as the transmission weight between a pair of cases whose observed generation interval equals a (Fig. 1B) . The representation of transmission weight (also referred to as transmission likelihood 15 ) as g(a) is the basic component of the process of estimating effective reproductive numbers in the renewal equation and the following proposed method. The generation interval of dengue, in particular, is composed if four periods: host incubation, vector incubation, host infectious period and vector infectious period 31 . Nonetheless, showing compatibility with empirical data and mathematical convenience, gamma distributions are frequently used to model the generation interval of dengue collectively 32 . In this study, we used a gamma distribution with mean = 20 days and standard deviation = 9 days in our analysis, in accordance with a previous study 25 . individual reproductive number. In order to capture spatial variations among individuals, we adopted another method developed by Wallinga and Teunis 15 to estimate individual reproductive numbers (R j ). We refer to this method as the non-adjusted method (i.e., non-adjusted for spatial effect). The transmission probability between pair of cases can be described mathematically as

where p ij is the probability that case j infects case i. Note that we use superscripts to index time-invariant, individual (or pairwise) attributes (e.g., R j , p ij ) and subscripts for time-varying attributes (e.g., R t ). g(·) is the temporal weighting function, representing generation interval. Given the onset time interval = − >ˆt

ij is the transmission weight of the case pair (i, j). The pairwise transmission weight is then normalized by all received transmission weights of case i (from all potential infectors k ≠ i) to produce consistent estimation of transmission probability. The resulting p ij is interpreted as the probability of individual i being infected by individual j. Therefore, R j as the average number of secondary cases caused by individual j is the sum of all p ij involving j as the infector, as shown in Fig. 1A and Eq. (3).

Spatially adjusted reproductive number. In this study, we extend a previous method with a spatial weighting function, f d ( ) ij , in order to account for the effect of spatial variation on dengue infections. We refer to this extended method as the (spatially) adjusted method. The transmission probability for case pair (i, j) becomes

where d ij is the distance between the pair (i, j) and f is a function relating transmission weight to the distance between cases. The specifications of the temporal difference t ij and g remain the same as in the previous method. Likewise, the spatially adjusted individual reproductive number R j sp is the sum of those p ij sp involving j as the infector (Eq. 5). 

The spatial weighting function is also called the transmission kernel and is a monotonically decaying function with respect to distance, reflecting neighborhood transmission 32 . Thus, unlike the generation interval, which is typically marked with a temporally lagged effect because of the latency period of infectiousness, the spatial weighting function decreases monotonically as distance increases, which means people would be easily get infections if they live near each other. It reflects people in the nearby neighborhood may share common environmental sources of dengue infection. There are several kinds of spatial kernels used in the literature, including exponential decay 25 and power-law decay 33 . In the context of dengue transmission, we adopted an exponential decaying kernel with mean = 125 m 27 . This approach accounts for both temporal and spatial relationships when estimating individual-level reproductive numbers. Apart from the component of the generation interval inherited from the previous method, the distance-decayed spatial weighting function captures the spatial risk of dengue infection.

To calculate the population-level effective reproductive number from individual estimates, the R j values can be further aggregated to form the Adjusted R t given a specified time step τ 13 : 

Quantifying the preconditions of spreaders. To explore the phenomenon of spatial expansion, two types of spreaders are of interest: early spreaders and succeeding spreaders. Early spreaders are defined as those cases that trigger a new cluster (by introducing the disease into an unaffected area). There are usually few or no cases of the disease, and the cluster tendency is low until several early spreaders emerge. Succeeding spreaders are defined as those cases that were infected by early cases nearby. Although there is a clear distinction between the two spreaders in theory, most individuals lie on a spectrum between these two extremes. We have therefore quantified this property according to the clustering tendency at the location and time immediately before the emergence of that spreader. In other words, clustering tendency is used as the measure for the precondition of a dengue case, and the median clustering tendency is used as the cutoff to classify all dengue cases. If the precondition clustering tendency is higher than the median, the case is categorized as a succeeding spreader; otherwise, it is characterized as an early spreader. We used kernel density estimation (KDE) to quantify spatial clustering tendency in order to (1) determine the preconditions of a specific spreader and (2) compare the distributions of spatially adjusted effective reproductive numbers and case clustering patterns. The clustering tendency at the location of case j is defined as 34

where h is called the kernel bandwidth or smoothing parameter (i.e., the parameter controlling the extent of smoothness), d ij denotes the distance between case i and the locality of case j, and K(·) is a spatial smoothing function characterizing the contribution of each individual over the relative distance d h / ij .

The incidence of the 2015TN dengue outbreak are shown in Fig. 3A . The outbreak emerged in May with a handful of sporadic cases and finished the next January with a total of 22,784 cases. We divided the outbreak into six stages: emerging (I), growing (II and III), peak plateau (IV), and decaying (V and VI), to depict the spatiotemporal evolutions of the outbreak. Figure 3B shows the Adjusted R t and Non-Adjusted R t of the outbreak. These R t curves are median or mean estimates of the adjusted and non-adjusted individual reproductive numbers, summarizing the temporal evolution of population-level transmission potential. Adjusted R t provides further information: the shaded area represents the interquartile range (IQR) of adjusted individual reproductive numbers, reflecting the spatial individual heterogeneity of the transmission potential. In contrast, individual reproductive numbers of incident cases that shared identical dates of illness onset are constants in Non-Adjusted R t . This indicates that the incident cases during this period were highly geographically heterogeneous in their transmission potential. The distributions of Adjusted R j in these stages are also multimodal and right-skewed, which indicates that some incident cases could have higher transmission potential (i.e. super-spreaders). Figure 3C shows the spatial distributions of incident cases in these stages. We can identify the linkages between time-varying reproductive numbers (Fig. 3B ) and spatial-temporal distributions of incident cases (Fig. 3A,C) in different stages. In the emerging stage, the irregular growth of Adjusted R t reflects the initial growth of the outbreak with a sporadic distribution of incident cases and a small emerging cluster (Fig. 3C ). Subsequently, in the growing stages (from stage II to III), the epidemic curve started to show exponential growth (Fig. 3A) ; the larger IQR of the individual reproductive numbers (Fig. 3B ) reflects some incident cases with higher transmission potential that occurred and resulted in vigorous expansion of disease clustering (Fig. 3C ). In the stage of peak plateau (stage IV), Adjusted R t dropped under the epidemic threshold (<1), indicating that the outbreak was contained. The spatial distributions of cases also show that the clustering areas remained and stopped expanding. In sum, the time-varying reproductive numbers, Adjusted R t and Non-adjusted R t , can reflect the timing of the outbreak containment according to the epidemic threshold. The Adjusted R t can further reflect the timing of epidemic expansion when the IQR of individual reproductive numbers increases.

In Fig. 4 , the distributions of individual transmission distance were compared between the two methods: Non-adjusted and Adjusted R j . Based on the neighborhood transmission setting of Adjusted R j , the transmission distance of an infector is around 200-300 meters and few long-range transmission links (longer than 2 kilometers). Furthermore, we used Adjusted R j = 10 as a threshold to categorize super-(Adjusted R j > 10) and normal-(Adjusted R j < 10) spreaders. The figure also shows that long-range transmission links are from super-spreaders. The result indicates that dengue cases with high transmissibility have the ability to spread pathogens to geographically distant areas.

To further explore spatial relationships of super-spreaders and dengue epidemic expansion, we illustrated the locations of super-spreaders and clustering tendency of the dengue epidemic during the rapidly growing period (stages II and III), as shown in Fig. 5 . Except the very beginning of the stage II (June-25-July-6), the figure shows that super-spreaders tend to distribute at or outside the edge of the main clusters from July-06 to August-23. In addition, the circle size of the super-spreaders in Fig. 5 represent their transmission range. Therefore, the locations of larger circles would reflect long-rage transmission occurred at the edge of dengue clusters. It implied that the role of super-spreaders could be the drivers of geographic expansion of the dengue epidemic.

In order to profile the roles of different spreaders in detailed spatial transmission/expansion process, we classified the cases into two types, early spreaders and succeeding spreaders. Early spreaders are regarded as the sources of new emerging clusters, and succeeding spreaders are those that come after early spreaders. Figure 6 presents a succeeding spreader a (panel A) and an early spreader b (panel B). In each panel, we also compared different methods (spatially adjusted and non-adjusted) that estimate the transmission probability from a spreader to its potential infectees. The time of the incident cases on these maps is the 30 th day after the onset day of the given spreader. Infectees labeled with darker colors have a higher probability of becoming infected by spreader a or b. . Spatial distribution of super-spreaders (R j ≥ 10), compared with the main clusters of the dengue outbreak during the rapidly growing stages (II and III). The red area represents the most clustered region, the center of the ongoing outbreak, while the light yellow area represents the edge of the outbreak. The green circles represent the locations of the super-spreaders, with the radius being proportional to their transmission distances. The maps are generated by R package ggplot2, and sf (version 3.6.1, https://cran.r-project.org).

By the non-adjusted method, the two spreaders have identical transmission probabilities and individual reproductive number because of the homogenous mixing assumption (Non-adjusted R a = Non-adjusted R b = 4.15). However, they should play different roles in the spatial expansion of the outbreak. Spreader a (the succeeding spreader) occurred in an ongoing cluster; thus, this case is unlikely to be the primary source that triggered this local outbreak. Spreader b (the early spreader), on the contrary, initiated a new cluster where no case had occurred before, and the following cases that emerged were centered on spreader b. Thus, a subsequent local outbreak can be logically attributed to spreader b as the primary ancestor. The adjusted method (left-side maps in Fig. 6 ), which takes into account the spatial-temporal relationships of incident cases, differentiates the individual reproductive numbers of early and succeeding spreaders (Adjusted R a = 1.84, Adjusted R b = 5.74). It also yields more reasonable spatial transmission potential by upweighting the potential infectees proximity to spreader a in Fig. 6A .

To clarify the distinct roles of early and succeeding spreaders in the outbreak expansion process, we compared the distributions of Adjusted R j between different types of spreaders in Fig. 7A . We found that all the super spreaders (Adjusted R j > 10) are early spreaders and most of succeeding spreaders have low Adjusted R j . To examine the generalization of this pattern, we estimated Adjusted R j of dengue cases in top five largest dengue epidemics since 1990 in Taiwan, including KH2002, TN2007, KH2014, KH2015, TN2015, as shown in Fig. 7B . Non-adjusted R j were used as the baseline to control for the fluctuations across different stages of the outbreak. The figure showed consistent patterns among these large-scale dengue outbreaks, which means early spreaders with high transmissibility can be generally highlighted by the spatially adjusted method.

The effective time-varying reproductive number is a commonly used indicator for measuring disease transmissibility. However, the index conventionally does not capture spatial dynamics of disease transmission. We proposed a new method of calculating the spatially adjusted effective reproductive number by incorporating a spatial-weighting function that captures the nature of heterogeneous mixing. Unlike the averaged time-varying reproductive number, this method estimates different individual-level reproductive numbers (R j ) for given onset www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ times and locations of dengue infections. Thus, it can reflect spatial heterogeneity in transmission potential among individuals and identify the possible super-spreaders 35 with high R j during the rapidly growing period. Our results also reveal that dengue cases with high transmission potential and long-transmission distance are usually located at the edges of the epidemic foci, which means they could be the drivers of further outbreak expansion. Therefore, our proposed method depicts a more detailed spatial-temporal dengue transmission process and identifies the significant role of the edges apart from the epidemic foci, which could be the weak spots in disease control and prevention. Our spatially adjusted method also could further apply to assess individual-level transmission potential of other acute contagious diseases, such as influenza and Zika virus infection, with observed generation interval and the context of neighborhood transmission.

The effective reproductive number of dengue as estimated in past studies reflected an averaged overall epidemic trend, which did not take into account the spatial heterogeneity of transmissibility. Hsieh 36 estimated the effective reproductive number at the initial stage of the 2015TN outbreak to be 6.84, which is similar to our averaged estimates (Fig. 3B ). Hsieh's study also showed that Kaohsiung consistently possessed lower effective reproductive numbers (from 1.29 to 2.87), implying that Tainan city may have epidemiological characteristics, such as a lack of herd immunity, that make it more prone to dengue transmission than Kaohsiung. Internationally, Guzzetta 25 reported that the time-varying reproductive number of non-endemic urban cities in Brazil is much smaller than the estimates from Tainan and Kaohsiung cities (maximum R t is approximately 2.2). Codeco 31 and Pinho 37 also estimated time-varying reproductive numbers in Salvador and Brazil, with a maximum R t of approximately 4.5. Comparing the values of R t among different cities may be subject to possible confounding factors, such as weather conditions, host immunity and circulating viral strands.

Some studies considered location information to determine reproductive numbers for quantifying transmissibility of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) 38, 39 . These models considered spatial distribution of farms, however, it was difficult to capture FMD disease transmission process among animals. In other words, the time-varying reproductive numbers in these models are difficult to reflect nature course of FMD transmission in terms of implementing general interval and renewal equation. Furthermore, farm-level models for FMD outbreaks can be categorized the farms into infected and susceptible ones to determine relative transmissibility of each farm at a specific time. It may be difficult to estimate the amount of susceptible persons living around the infected cases for human infectious diseases, such as influenza and dengue fever. Other studies have also explored spatial heterogeneity by performing stratified analysis of R t with respect to different administrative regions and with respect to region-to-region transmission 40, 41 . These studies used a spatial weighting function to emphasize the interregional transmission process but still assumed a homogeneous-mixing model within each region. Thus, these studies did not address the spatial heterogeneous mixing issue when estimating reproductive numbers. Our study considered individual-level spatial heterogeneity and used the spatially adjusted reproductive number to measure the transmission potential of each individual.

Like the basic reproductive number, R j can be regarded as a function of duration of infectiousness, incubation period, transmission probability, vector mosquito density, and host-vector contact rate. The adjusted R j in this study could reflect vector mosquito density and host-vector contact rate, which are also highly heterogeneous in space 42 . Meanwhile, the dispersal of vector mosquitoes is largely confined to neighboring areas (average radius of 28-199 meters 43 ), providing an effective infectious zone of an infector. An exponential spatial weighting function herein represents this infectious zone. Guzzetta 25 estimated the mean transmission distance of dengue in a metropolis area to be approximately 127 m and further indicated that an exponential distribution described the data better than a radiation model which is a more dispersed distribution effectively describes human mobility 44 . Kissler, et al. 45 also reported the aptness of the exponential distribution when an outbreak is typically dominated by short-range transmission. Therefore, the exponential spatial weighting function in this study is an appropriate substitute for the effective infectious zone for measuring dengue transmission. The exponential distance-decayed www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ function also avoids overestimating the transmission probabilities of infector-infectee pairs with long geographic distances, especially for large-scale dengue epidemics. In sum, areas with high R j are potential risk areas for high dengue transmission; knowledge of such areas is important for spatial targeting during dengue epidemics.

Spatial epidemiological studies focused for many years on developing methods for identifying significant disease clustering in time and space, such as space-time scan statistics 46 or point pattern analysis 47 . Hotspot areas identified are usually regarded as significant risk areas and as high-priority sites for intervention strategies aimed at mitigating an epidemic 48, 49 . The significance of the study is to introduce the perspective of individual-level transmission potential to disease risk mapping. We found that locations of individuals with high transmission potential are usually located at the edges of growing disease clusters, which can easily be neglected when intervention resources focus on epidemic clusters. A previous study found that urban villages that were originally at the edge of the city but are now enclosed by urbanized lands act as transfer stations for dengue outbreaks 50 . In this study, we further provide a better understanding of outbreak expansion by categorizing different types of spreaders. Early spreaders with high transmission potential may initiate new source of infection at the edges of the main cluster, resulting in geographic expansion at the exponential growing stages of the outbreak. Therefore, the edge of the outbreak should be a priority of spatial targeting to contain the outbreak regarding both range and magnitude. Succeeding spreaders are indeed still important in tallying morbidity and fatality. However, their high-density clustering patterns make them prone to the depletion of local susceptible populations and degenerating transmission potential. In summary, the center and edges of epidemic clusters play different roles in developing epidemic progression in terms of different types of spreaders (succeeding vs. early) and different patterns of epidemic growth (intensifying vs. expanding). These findings provide important insights for implementing different interventions in the center and on the edges of epidemic clusters.

There are several limitations to this study. First, the method of estimating time-varying effective reproductive numbers is a retrospective procedure that uses observed infectee generation to estimate the R j of the infector generation. In other words, it cannot be used for predicting future epidemic progression in real time. Nonetheless, the method is helpful for understanding the course of an epidemic and studying the possible mechanisms of geographical expansion. Second, this study considers only geographical distance as a factor in transmission potential. Other factors influence the spatial spreading of dengue. Among these, host heterogeneity (including variations in density 51 , mobility 52 , and susceptibility 53 ) strongly modulates the transmission dynamic 42 and should be considered in further studies. Finally, the spatial weighting function reflects the assumption of distance-decayed properties (neighborhood transmission). However, the assumption may not reflect long-distance transmission 54 and complex urban transport and mobility 52 . The question of how to develop more detailed spatial weighting schemes that capture realistic mobility patterns warrants further investigation.
