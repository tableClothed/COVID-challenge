Therapeutics and Vaccines,"An emerging respiratory infectious disease with high mortality, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), is caused by a novel coronavirus (MERS-CoV). It was first reported in 2012 in Saudi Arabia and has now spread to eight countries. Development of effective therapeutics and vaccines is crucial to save lives and halt the spread of MERS-CoV. Here, we show that a recombinant protein containing a 212-amino acid fragment (residues 377-588) in the truncated receptor-binding domain (RBD: residues 367-606) of MERS-CoV spike (S) protein fused with human IgG Fc fragment (S377-588-Fc) is highly expressed in the culture supernatant of transfected 293T cells. The purified S377-588-Fc protein efficiently binds to dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), the receptor of MERS-CoV, and potently inhibited MERS-CoV infection, suggesting its potential to be further developed as a therapeutic modality for treating MERS-CoV infection and saving the patients' lives. The recombinant S377-588-Fc is able to induce in the vaccinated mice strong MERS-CoV S-specific antibodies, which blocks the binding of RBD to DPP4 receptor and effectively neutralizes MERS-CoV infection. These findings indicate that this truncated RBD protein shows promise for further development as an effective and safe vaccine for the prevention of MERS-CoV infection.","A novel human coronavirus, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus (MERS-CoV), was identified as a pathogen causing a severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like disease in the Middle East and Europe in 2012 [1] . As of October 14, 2013, the World Health Organization (WHO) had been informed of 138 confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection, including 60 deaths (a case fatality rate of 45%) (http://www.who.int/csr/don/ 2013_10_14/en/). Recent reports of family clusters and health care-associated transmission of MERS-CoV through close contact have proven its capacity for human-to-human transmission [2] [3] [4] [5] . Although its transmissibility is significantly lower than that of SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [6] [7] [8] [9] , it may gain increased human-to-human transmissibility during its further evolution and potentially cause a pandemic in the future [10] . Accordingly, development of effective therapeutics and vaccines is critical for early intervention and prevention.

Unlike SARS-CoV, which uses human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as its receptor for binding to ACE2-expressing cells [11] , MERS-CoV utilizes a different receptor, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), for binding to DPP4-expressing cells [12] . Like the spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV, the S protein of MERS-CoV also plays important roles in virus entry and infection [13] . MERS-CoV S protein contains a S1 subunit that mediates virus binding to cells expressing DPP4 through its receptor-binding domain (RBD) region and an S2 subunit that mediates virus-cell membrane fusion [12, 13] . Based on sequence alignment and homology modeling analysis and functional studies, we and Mou et al. have predicted that the RBD is located in residues 377-662 or 358-588 of the MERS-CoV S1 subunit [14] [15] [16] (Fig. 1A) . Cocrystallographic analyses of the RBD/DPP4 complexes have confirmed that the RBD is attributed to residues 367-606 or 367-588 in MERS-CoV S1 [17] [18] [19] (Fig. 1A) .

Previous studies have shown that the RBD of SARS-CoV S protein can significantly inhibit SARS-CoV infection [20] and is able to induce highly potent neutralizing antibodies protecting against SARS-CoV infection [20] . It is thus expected that the RBD of MERS-CoV, which belongs to the same betacoronavirus genus as SARS-CoV [21, 22] , may also be effective in inhibiting MERS-CoV infection and inducing neutralizing antibody responses against infection of MERS-CoV in vaccinated animals.

Indeed, our identified RBD (a 286-amino acid fragment spanning residues 377-662) could bind to DPP4 and induce neutralizing antibody response in immunized mice [15] , while the RBD reported by Mou et al. (a 231-amino acid fragment spanning residues 358-588) could inhibit MERS-CoV infection at the 40 mg/ml level and elicit effective neutralizing antibodies in vaccinated rabbits [16] . These results suggest that the overlapping region (residues 377-588) must contain the receptor-binding motif (RBM) and the major neutralizing epitope of the RBD. Crystallographic analyses indicated that the RBM is located in the middle (residues 484-567) of the RBD [18, 19] . Therefore, we designed a 212-amino acid truncated RBD sequence (residues 377-588) (Fig. 1A) and tested its ability to inhibit MERS-CoV infection and induce neutralizing antibody responses in vaccinated mice in order to identify a relatively optimized RBD sequence for developing anti-MERS-CoV therapeutics and vaccines.

Characterization of recombinant protein containing residues 377-588 of MERS-CoV S protein fused with human IgG Fc

We and Mou et al. have shown that the recombinant protein containing residues 377-662 or 358-588 of MERS-CoV S1 and human IgG Fc fragment can induce neutralizing antibody responses in immunized mice or rabbits [15, 16] . We thus believe that a truncated RBD sequence spanning residues 377-588, which includes RBM (residues 484-567) [18, 19] , may contain the major neutralizing epitope in RBD. Therefore, we expressed a recombinant protein containing residues 377-588 fused with human IgG-Fc (S377-588-Fc) (Fig. 1A) . We found that this protein could be highly expressed in the culture supernatant of transfected 293T cells and purified to high purity. Its molecular weight under the non-boiled condition was almost 1-fold greater than that under boiled condition in 10% SDS-PAGE in the presence of reducing agent 2-mercaptoethanol (Fig. 1B) , suggesting that S377-588-Fc formed a stable, dimeric structure under reducing condition.

Cross-linker analysis was then applied to characterize the conformational structure of expressed S377-588-Fc. We found that the molecular weights of the cross-linked S377-588-Fc samples were almost 1-and 3-fold higher than the samples without crosslinking (Fig. 1C) , which indicates that MERS-CoV S377-588 fused with Fc tag was able to form dimeric or tetrameric conformational structures. The bands of S377-588-Fc fusion protein in SDS-PAGE were further confirmed by Western blot using a polyclonal antibody against S1 of MERS-CoV ( Fig. 1B-C) .

To detect the interaction between S377-588-Fc protein and DPP4, the receptor for MERS-CoV, we first performed a coimmunoprecipitation analysis by mixing equal concentrations of purified S377-588-Fc with soluble DPP4 (sDPP4) in the presence of Protein A Sepharose beads. Next, we analyzed the bound proteins by SDS-PAGE and Western blot using antibodies specific for DPP4 and MERS-CoV S1 proteins, respectively. In SDS-PAGE ( Fig. 2A, left) , two clear bands respectively corresponding to the size of sDPP4 and S377-588-Fc monomer were shown in the samples co-immunoprecipitated with these two proteins, while only one band corresponding to the size of sDPP4 or S377-588-Fc was indicated in the control sample containing only sDPP4 or S377-588-Fc, respectively. The bands were confirmed by antibodies against DPP4 or MERS-CoV S1, as shown in Western and WB (right) analysis using a S1-specific polyclonal antibody. (C) Analysis of S377-588-Fc protein conformation by cross-linker. Samples were crosslinked with glutaraldehyde (with cross-linker at the final concentration of 4 mM) or without cross-linker (w/o cross-linker), followed by SDS-PAGE (left) and WB (right) analysis as described above. The protein molecular weight marker (kDa) (Invitrogen) is indicated on the left. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0081587.g001 blot ( Fig. 2A, right) , suggesting the significant binding of S377-588-Fc with sDPP4.

We next detected the interaction between S377-588-Fc protein and cellular DPP4 receptor on DPP4-expressing Huh-7 cells using approaches similar to those described above, but replacing sDPP4 with Huh-7 cell lysates, as we previously described [15] . As expected, two clear bands (corresponding to the size of DPP4 and S377-588-Fc, respectively) were detected from the Protein A beads pre-incubated with the mixture of S377-588-Fc and Huh-7 cell lysates, which reacted strongly with a polyclonal antibody against MERS-CoV S1 and a monoclonal antibody (mAb) specific to DPP4 (Fig. 2B) . These results indicated that S377-588-Fc of MERS-CoV was able to bind efficiently to the cell-surface receptor DPP4.

Subsequently, we further detected the binding of S377-588-Fc to sDPP4 by ELISA and cell-associated DPP4 by flow cytometry. As shown in Figure 2C , S377-588-Fc bound sDPP4 that was coated on the ELISA plate in a dose-dependent manner. The flow cytometric analysis also indicated a dose-dependent binding of this protein with DPP4 on DPP4-expressing Huh-7 cells (Fig. 2D) . However, the control protein hIgG-Fc did not show significant binding to sDPP4 or cell-associated DPP4 (Fig. 2C-D) . These results confirmed the binding specificity of S377-588-Fc to DPP4.

To evaluate the potential inhibitory activity of S377-588-Fc protein against MERS-CoV infection, the highly permissive human bronchial epithelial Calu-3 cells that express DPP4 [23] were incubated with MERS-CoV/EMC-2012 at 0.1 multiplicity of infection (MOI) in the presence of serially diluted S377-588-Fc protein. The viral replication, as indicated by cytopathic effect (CPE) formation, was determined at 24 h post-infection. As shown in Figure 3 , S377-588-Fc significantly inhibited MERS-CoV infection in Calu-3 cells in a dose-dependent manner, as indicated by diminished or reduced CPE formation. Specifically, S377-588-Fc at the concentrations of 25 and 12.5 mg/ml could completely, or nearly completely, block CPE formation, respectively, while this protein at 3.2 mg/ml could maintain $ 50% inhibition of CPE formation. However, the control hIgG-Fc protein at 25 mg/ml, or even higher (data not shown), exhibited no inhibition of CPE formation. These results suggest that recombinant S377-588-Fc protein has the potential to be further developed as a therapeutic against MERS-CoV infection. To evaluate the ability of S377-588-Fc protein to elicit MERS-CoV S-specific antibody responses, we immunized mice subcutaneously (s.c.) using the purified protein in the presence of Montanide ISA 51 adjuvant and detected IgG antibody response, subtypes and neutralizing antibodies in the mouse sera collected at different time points after immunization. The results demonstrated that S377-588-Fc induced increasing IgG antibody responses after each boost, reaching the highest level at day 10 post-3 rd vaccination, with the endpoint titer of IgG approaching 1:1.7610 5 67.7610 4 (Fig. 4A-B) . The antibodies in the mouse sera could bind efficiently to both S-RBD fusion protein S377-588-Fc (Fig. 4C ) and MERS-CoV S1 protein without Fc (Fig. 4D) , suggesting that the antibodies are specific for the RBD in the S1 subunit of MERS-CoV S protein. Detection of IgG subtype antibody responses revealed that S377-588-Fc was able to induce both IgG1 (Th2) and IgG2a (Th1) antibody responses in the vaccinated mice ( Fig. 4E-F) . However, the PBS control group could not induce significant antibody responses against MERS-CoV S-RBD and S1 proteins (Fig. 4) .

Neutralizing antibodies in sera of mice at 10 days post-last vaccination with S377-588-Fc protein were evaluated by a live MERS-CoV-based neutralization assay in a Vero E6 cell culture system. As shown in Figure 5A , S377-588-Fc induced high neutralizing antibody responses, with neutralizing antibody titers of 1:1.5610 3 61.2610 3 , while mouse sera from the PBS control group exhibited no significant neutralizing antibodies against MERS-CoV. These results suggest that S377-588-Fc protein could induce potent anti-MERS-CoV neutralizing antibody responses in the vaccinated animals.

Antibodies in antisera of mice immunized with S377-588-Fc protein effectively blocked S377-588 binding to DPP4 receptor To test whether mouse antibodies against S377-588-Fc could block RBD binding DPP4, we incubated S377-588-Fc with DPP4expressing Huh-7 cells in the presence and absence of mouse antisera, as described in Materials and Methods, followed by flow cytometric analysis. In the absence of antisera, strong signals were detected in S377-588-Fc-incubated Huh-7 cells, while only background signals were observed in the control hIgG-Fcincubated cells (Fig. 5Ba) , confirming that the truncated RBD (S377-588) could specifically bind to the DPP4-expressing cells. However, in the presence of antisera against S377-588-Fc, the binding of S377-588 to DPP4-expressing Huh-7 cells was effectively blocked, while the control sera from PBS-vaccinated mice showed no significant inhibition on the binding of S377-588 to DPP4-expressing Huh-7 cells (Fig. 5Bb ).

Because of the high mortality of the SARS-like disease caused by MERS-CoV and its human-to-human transmissibility [4] , development of effective therapeutics and vaccines for intervention and prevention is urgently needed [10] . Previous studies have shown that the RBD of SARS-CoV is one of the most important targets for developing SARS-CoV entry inhibitors and SARS vaccines [20, [24] [25] [26] [27] . Therefore, we used similar approaches to identify the optimal sequence of RBD in MERS-CoV S protein as a target for developing anti-MERS therapeutics and vaccines. Several groups have independently solved the crystal structure of MERS-CoV S-RBD (residues 367-588 or 367-606), which contains the RBM (residues 484-567) (Fig. 1A ) [17] [18] [19] . Mou et al. and our group have shown that the recombinant proteins containing residues 358-588 and 377-662, respectively, could induce MERS-CoV neutralizing antibody responses in immunized animals [15, 16] , suggesting that the overlapping region, which spans residues 377-588, must contain the major neutralizing epitope. Based on these findings, we designed a truncated RBD fragment containing residues 377-588, which contains the RBM (residues 484-567) of MERS-CoV S protein S1 subunit, and expressed a recombinant protein covering this region fused with Fc of human IgG. Fusion of Fc tag with S377-588 was carried out in order to 1) facilitate the affinity-purification of the Fc-containing fusion protein using protein A beads [20, 28] ; 2) increase the immunogenicity of the Fc-containing protein [15] , possibly through the binding of Fc in the protein to the Fc receptor (FcR) on the antigen-presenting cells (APCs) [29] ; and 3) increase the in vivo half-life and stability of the Fc-containing protein by the formation of stable dimeric or tetrameric conformational structure [30] .

As expected, the purified S377-588-Fc fusion protein could form a stable dimeric or tetrameric structure being able to bind efficiently to sDPP4, as well as cell-surface receptor DPP4 (Fig. 2) , resulting in the potent inhibition of MERS-CoV infection in DPP4-expressing cells (Fig. 3) . These results suggest that the formation of dimer or tetramer by S377-588-Fc does not hinder the binding to its receptor DPP4. Thus, S377-588-Fc appeared much more potent than S358-588-Fc and S367-588 in inhibiting MERS-CoV infection [16, 19] , indicating that removal of the S358-376 fragment might have an enhancing effect on RBDmediated anti-MERS-CoV activity.

Like antibodies, recombinant proteins can also be used as clinical therapeutics for the treatment of cancer [31] [32] [33] . The The data are presented as mean A450 6 standard deviation (SD) of five mice per group. Ability of IgG binding to MERS-CoV S-RBD (C) and S1 protein (D) was detected using mouse sera from 10 days post-last vaccination. Ability of IgG1 (E) and IgG2a (F) antibodies binding to MERS-CoV S-RBD was detected using sera from 10 days post-last vaccination. The data are presented as mean A450 6 SD of five mice per group at various dilution points. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0081587.g004 peptide-based HIV entry inhibitor enfuvirtide has been used for treating HIV infection [34] [35] [36] . Because of its potent inhibitory activity on MERS-CoV entry, the recombinant S377-588-Fc protein may be further developed as a MERS-CoV entry inhibitor for treatment of MERS-CoV infection in the acute stage. The major concern for use of protein drugs in clinics is their production of antibodies, which may suppress drug efficacy. However, this may not be a concern for the MERS-CoV S-RBD protein-based therapeutic. First, the human IgG Fc in the S377-588-Fc fusion protein is not expected to induce antibodies in humans. Second, S377-588-Fc will be mainly used for urgent life-saving treatment at the early stage of MERS-CoV infection. Even if it does elicit anti-RBD antibodies in the patient several weeks after use, the patient may have passed through the most dangerous acute period. The antibodies induced by the protein drug may be actually helpful for the patient to neutralize the re-entered MERS-CoV.

We then tested immunogenicity of the truncated RBD of MERS-CoV S protein in inducing anti-MERS-CoV immune responses and neutralizing antibody responses in vaccinated mice. Notably, S377-588-Fc elicited elevated MERS-CoV RBD-specific IgG antibody responses after each boost, reaching the highest level after the 3 rd vaccination (Fig. 4) . These mouse antisera exhibited potent neutralizing antibody responses with neutralizing antibody titers of ,1:1,500, which are much higher than those induced by S377-662-Fc [15] . These data suggest that the truncated RBD fragment containing residues 377-588 is more immunogenic in inducing RBD-specific neutralizing antibody response than the longer RBD fragment containing residues 377-662, possibly because the C-terminal region spanning residues 589-662 contains non-neutralizing epitopes, which may compete with the neutralizing epitopes in the residues 377-588 region in eliciting antibody responses. In addition, the residues 589-662 fragment may destabilize the core conformation of the RBD. Analysis of the crystal structure of the RBD suggests that cysteines 379 and 585 are both involved in stabilizing the tertiary structure of the RBD by forming disulfide bonds with their respective cysteine partners. A few extra residues (e.g., residues 377-378 at the N-terminus and residues 586-588 at the C-terminus) may be needed to flank these cysteines for the proper formation of the disulfide bonds (Fig. 6 ) [19] . However, the extended region at the C-terminus (residues 589-662) may have adverse effect on tertiary conformation of the core structure (residues 379-585). Therefore, this truncated RBD fragment (residues 377-588) may have reached the optimal length of RBD that contains the intact functional domain (RBM: residues 484-567) and major neutralizing epitopes, and maintains a stable core conformation.

Our previous studies have shown that SARS-CoV S-RBDinduced antibodies are effective in inhibiting SARS-CoV S-RBD- binding to ACE2, the receptor of SARS-CoV [24] . Similarly, we demonstrated here that antisera of mice vaccinated with the truncated S-RBD (S377-588) of MERS-CoV could also efficiently block the binding of MERS-CoV S-RBD to its receptor, DPP4, indicating that antibodies in the mouse antisera can neutralize MERS-CoV infection, possibly through inhibition of virusreceptor binding. Therefore, both S-RBD protein and anti-RBD antibodies can be developed as therapeutics to treat MERS-CoV infection.

It is necessary to further test the therapeutic and preventive effects of this truncated S-RBD in an animal model. Thus far, however, no small animal model has been established for a MERS-CoV challenge study [37] . While the lung cells of Syrian hamster express the receptor of MERS-CoV, it was reported that this animal model was not susceptible to the induction of MERS-CoV infection [38] . Rhesus macaques could generate pneumonialike symptoms within 24 hours of MERS-CoV infection [39] ; however, the macaque system is not as widely applicable as a small animal model. Therefore, we are awaiting the establishment of a small animal model in order to carry out viral challenge studies.

In conclusion, we have identified a 212-amino acid truncated RBD in the S1 subunit of MERS-CoV S protein fused with human IgG Fc. This protein, denoted S377-588-Fc, can effectively bind to the viral receptor, DPP4, and potently inhibit MERS-CoV infection in DPP4-expressing cells. It can also induce strong RBDspecific antibody responses with potent neutralizing activity against infection from MERS-CoV. Therefore, this truncated S-RBD linked with Fc shows potential for further development as both therapeutic and vaccine for the treatment and prevention of MERS-CoV infection.

Six-to eight-week-old female BALB/c mice were used in the study. The animal studies were carried out in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health. The protocol was approved by the Committee on the Ethics of Animal Experiments of the New York Blood Center (Permit Number: 194.14).

The construction, expression and purification of recombinant MERS-CoV S proteins were done as previously described with some modifications [40] . Briefly, genes encoding residues 377-588 of MERS-CoV S protein were amplified by PCR using codonoptimized MERS-CoV S sequences (GenBank: AFS88936.1) as the template and then inserted into the pFUSE-hIgG1-Fc2 expression vector (hereinafter named Fc; InvivoGen, San Diego, CA). The MERS-CoV S1 (residues 18-725) plus 66Histidine (His) was amplified as above and inserted into the pJW4303 expression vector (Jiangsu Taizhou Haiyuan Protein Biotech, Co., Ltd, China). The sequence-confirmed recombinant plasmids were transfected into 293T cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA) seeded 24 h before transfection, followed by replacement of culture medium by serum-free DMEM (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) 8 h later and then collection of supernatant containing expressed protein 72 h posttransfection. The recombinant proteins were purified by Protein A affinity chromatography (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ) (for proteins with Fc) or Ni-NTA Superflow (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) (for proteins with His tag), according to the manufacturers' instructions.

The human DPP4 ectodomain (residues 39-766) was expressed and purified as previously described for human ACE2 ectodomain [11] . Briefly, human DPP4 ectodomain containing an N-terminal honeybee melittin signal peptide and a C-terminal 66 His tag was expressed in insect cells using the Bac-to-Bac expression system (Invitrogen), secreted into cell culture medium, and subsequently purified by Ni-NTA affinity column and Superdex200 gel filtration column (GE Healthcare).

The purified S377-588-Fc protein was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot as previously described [40] . Briefly, the proteins were either boiled for 10 min, or not boiled, and then separated by 10% Tris-Glycine SDS-PAGE gels, which were then stained with Coomassie Blue or transferred to nitrocellulose membranes for Western blot analysis. After blocking with 5% non-fat milk in PBST overnight at 4uC, the blots were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with MERS-CoV S protein-specific polyclonal antibodies (1:1,000) developed in our laboratories. After three washes, the blots were then incubated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:5,000, Invitrogen) for 1 h at room temperature. Signals were visualized with ECL Western blot substrate reagents and Amersham Hyperfilm (GE Healthcare).

Protein cross-linker was done as previously described [40] . Briefly, 4.5 mg of purified S377-588-Fc protein was mixed with 20 ml of 0.1% glutaraldehyde (final concentration 4 mM) and left at room temperature in the dark for 3 h before SDS-PAGE using 6% Tris-Glycine gel and Western blot detection as described above. Co-immunoprecipitation assay

The binding between MERS-CoV S377-588-Fc and DPP4 was performed by co-immunoprecipitation assay as previously described [15] . Briefly, sDPP4 (10 mg) or DPP4-expressing Huh-7 cell lysates (5610 7 /ml) were respectively incubated with MERS-CoV S377-588-Fc protein (10 mg) plus Protein A Sepharose Beads at 4uC for 1 h. After washing with lysis buffer and PBS, beads were boiled for 10 min and subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot as above for detecting DPP4 using an anti-DPP4 mAb (1 mg/ml, R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) or MERS-CoV S protein using MERS-CoV S1-specific polyclonal antibodies (1:1,000) developed in our laboratory.

The binding of MERS-CoV S377-588-Fc to DPP4-expressing Huh-7 cells was also measured by flow cytometry. Briefly, cells (5610 5 ) were incubated with S377-588-Fc at various concentrations for 30 min at room temperature, followed by incubation with DyLight-488-labeled goat anti-human IgG antibody for 30 min and analysis by flow cytometry. Human IgG Fc at the same concentration was used as the control. The inhibition of S377-588-Fc binding to Huh-7 cells by mouse antisera was performed by coincubating sera with MERS-CoV S377-588-Fc (0.5 mg/ml) and cells for 30 min at room temperature. After staining with DyLight-488-conjugated goat anti-human IgG, the mixture was analyzed by flow cytometry as above.

Calu-3 cells that are highly susceptible to MERS-CoV [41] were incubated with serially diluted recombinant MERS-CoV S377-588-Fc or hIgG-Fc control protein for 1 h at 37uC. After removing media containing the protein, the cells were infected with MERS-CoV/Erasmus Medical Center (EMC)-2012 at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.1 for 1 h at 37uC. After thoroughly washing with PBS to remove unbound viruses, the infected cultures were replenished with MEM/2% FCS medium containing the aforementioned proteins diluted accordingly, followed by incubation for an additional 24 h before assessing the formation of CPE.

This was done as previously described immunization protocols with some modifications [40] . Briefly, mice were prime-vaccinated (s.c.) with 10 mg/mouse of recombinant S377-588-Fc protein formulated with Montanide ISA 51 adjuvant (SEPPIC, Fairfield, NJ) and boosted twice with the same immunogen and adjuvant at 3-week intervals. Sera from pre-immunization and 10 days posteach vaccination were heat-inactivated at 56uC for 30 minutes and detected for S-specific antibody responses, neutralizing antibodies, or blockage of receptor binding.

ELISA ELISA was carried out to detect MERS-CoV S377-588-Fc protein binding to its receptor sDPP4 or MERS-CoV S-specific antibody responses in collected mouse sera as previously described [15] . Briefly, 96-well ELISA plates were respectively pre-coated with recombinant sDPP4 (2 mg/ml, for binding), MERS-CoV S377-588-Fc or S1-His protein (1 mg/ml, for antibody response) overnight at 4uC and blocked with 2% non-fat milk for 2 h at 37uC. Serially diluted MERS-CoV S377-588-Fc protein (for binding) or mouse sera (for antibody detection) were added to the plates and incubated at 37uC for 1 h, followed by four washes. Bound antibodies were respectively incubated with HRP-conjugated anti-human IgG (1:3,000, for binding, Invitrogen), or antimouse IgG, IgG1 and IgG2a (1:2,000, for antibody detection, Invitrogen), for 1 h at 37uC. The reaction was visualized by substrate 3,39,5,59-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) (Invitrogen) and stopped by 1N H 2 SO 4 . The absorbance at 450 nm (A450) was measured by ELISA plate reader (Tecan, San Jose, CA).

The standard micro-neutralization assay was used to quantify the neutralizing potential of each specimen, as previously described [15] . Briefly, serum samples were diluted at serial 2fold in 96-well tissue culture plates and incubated at room temperature for an hour with ,100 infectious MERS-CoV/ EMC-2012 in each well before transferring the resultant mixtures to duplicate wells of confluent Vero E6 cells grown in 96-well tissue culture plates. After 72 h of incubation, when the virus control wells exhibited advanced virus-induced CPE, the neutralizing capacity of individual serum samples was assessed by determining the presence or absence of CPE. Neutralizing antibody titers were expressed as the reciprocal of the highest dilution of serum that completely (100%) inhibited virus-induced CPE in at least 50% of the wells.

Monoclonal antibody-based therapies for microbial diseases,"The monoclonal antibody (mAb) revolution that currently provides many new options for the treatment of neoplastic and inflammatory diseases has largely bypassed the field of infectious diseases. Only one mAb is licensed for use against an infectious disease, although there are many in various stages of development. This situation is peculiar given that serum therapy was one of the first effective treatments for microbial diseases and that specific antibodies have numerous antimicrobial properties. The underdevelopment and underutilization of mAb therapies for microbial diseases has various complex explanations that include the current availability of antimicrobial drugs, small markets, high costs and microbial antigenic variation. However, there are signs that the climate for mAb therapeutics in infectious diseases is changing given increasing antibiotic drug resistance, the emergence of new pathogenic microbes for which no therapy is available, and development of mAb cocktail formulations. Currently, the major hurdle for the widespread introduction of mAb therapies for microbial diseases is economic, given the high costs of immunoglobulin preparations and relatively small markets. Despite these obstacles there are numerous opportunities for mAb development against microbial diseases and the development of radioimmunotherapy provides new options for enhancing the magic bullet. Hence, there is cautious optimism that the years ahead will see more mAbs in clinical use against microbial diseases.","Historical The field of infectious diseases has largely missed the monoclonal antibody (mAb) therapeutic revolution of the past decade.

In contrast to such fields as oncology and rheumatology where mAbs have provided new effective therapies, only one mAb has pathogenic microbes, often in drug-resistant form, as exemplified by multidrug-resistant (MDR) Mycobacterium tuberculosis.

The reticence for adopting mAb therapies against infectious diseases is intriguing given that antibody therapies were the first effective antimicrobials. In the early 20th century serum therapy was used against a diverse range of infectious diseases, including pneumococcal pneumonia, meningococcal meningitis, erysipelas, anthrax and others [3, 4] . These successes established antibody therapy as a powerful tool against infectious disease. Unfortunately, the immunological complications associated with the use of heterologous sera in humans, such as serum sickness and immediate hypersensitivity, significantly limited its usefulness [4] . Importantly, the problems of serum therapy do not necessarily apply to mAb therapy. Technological developments, such as improved purification techniques and the ability to engineer humanized mAbs, have greatly reduced these complications, allowed for increased specificity and expanded the range of possible targets. However, for many infectious diseases the availability of antimicrobial therapy has proved to be too much competition, and that combined with the complexity of introducing mAbs to clinical practice has hindered the pace of mAb-based therapeutic advancements.

Despite its current underdevelopment, the potential of antibody therapy in the form of mAbs is vast, especially for combating microbes that are resistant to antibiotic therapy, for emerging viral diseases or for the organisms or toxins responsible for bioterrorist threats. We believe that mAbs are well poised to be important reagents in a new age of antimicrobial therapy [2, 5] . In this review, we focus on mAbs for infectious diseases and note that several recent reviews have addressed the topic of antimicrobial immunoglobulin therapy [6] [7] [8] . Our goal is to review the state of the field and to identify areas where the development of mAb-based therapies may be particularly valuable.

The prophylactic and therapeutic potential of immune serum was discovered by Behring and Kitasato, who showed that passive transfer of antibody from the blood of infected animals could provide immunity to diphtheria [9] . Their work led to the first instance of industrial production of protective serum from sheep for human therapy in 1893 [10] and to the first Nobel Prize in Medicine for Behring. Immune animal sera from horses, sheep, and chickens were used to treat diseases where a protective immune response could be induced in the animal host by vaccination. In cases where humans were the only hosts, such as viral diseases, human convalescent sera were successfully used. For example, in the early 1900s, serum from individuals who recovered from measles was used to treat and prevent infection. Until the 1930s, serum from animals or people was collected and pooled to treat a number of infections, from streptococcal infection to toxin-mediated diseases like diphtheria [11] . Overall, serum was effective, and for some diseases like pneumococcal pneumonia and meningococcal meningitis, the prompt administration of serum was associated with significantly improved survival [3] .

However, despite these successes, the discovery of antibiotics in the 1930s and 1940s rapidly replaced serum therapy. Antibiotics were easier to manufacture, had less toxicity in patients and produced more consistent results. In contrast to serum therapy, which depended on animal sources that exhibited great lot-to-lot variation, antibiotics were the products of industrial processes and could be formulated in preparations with consistent activity. Furthermore, serum therapy was generally effective only early in the course of infection while antibiotic therapy maintained efficacy even when given late in the course of a microbial disease. Another advantage of antibiotic therapy was that it could be used without a specific diagnosis while the use of antibody therapy required knowledge of the pathogen responsible for disease. Consequently, serum therapy was unable to compete with antibiotics, and the development of new broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy displaced antibody-based therapies (Table 1) .

Despite the general abandonment of serum therapy for bacterial diseases, certain niches developed where it continued to be used, such as the prophylaxis and treatment of a small number of viral and toxin-mediated diseases for which there were no alternative therapeutic options. This point is important because it illustrated that antibody therapy can thrive in certain situations where it lacked competition, such as in the treatment of diseases which have no other effective therapies. For example, antibody preparations continue to be used to prevent rabies and toxicity from snakebite venoms. In developed countries serum therapy was often replaced by hyperimmune serum from pooled human donors. Today, hyperimmune human sera immunoglobulin is used to treat many diseases including those caused by cytomegalovirus (CMV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), hepatitis A virus (HAV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), rabies, vaccinia, vesicular stomatitis virus (VZV), and measles, underscoring the fact that antibody therapy remains an effective means of treatment [6, 12] .

Compared to hyperimmune sera, or even to modern antibiotics, mAb therapy has many advantages and some disadvantages ( Table 1) . mAbs inherently have a high specificity for their target and, since microbes are generally antigenically distinct from humans, the cross-reactivity with host tissues is minimal. In contrast to antibiotics, which target both harmful microbes and the host flora, mAbs will only target a specific microbe and their systemic administration should not affect other resident beneficial microbes. This could prove to be a significant advantage given increasing reports associating certain chronic diseases such as asthma, atopy, and even certain forms of cancer with antimicrobial drug use [13, 14] . Microbial specificity means that mAbs are unlikely to select for drug-resistant microbes among nontargeted microbes. The ability to specifically target disease-causing microbial populations without selecting for resistance makes mAb therapy potentially superior to current broad-spectrum antibiotics that are generally used in therapy, at least for microbial diseases caused by single microbes. The increasing prevalence and rising cost of treating methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant S. aureus (VRSA), and other resistant infections in both nosocomial and community settings emphasizes the need to develop new strategies for controlling infections.

Serum therapy by definition uses immune sera-derived immunoglobulins that are polyclonal preparations consisting of many types of antibodies of which only a minute fraction is specific for the intended microbe. In contrast, mAb preparations consist of one type of immunoglobulin with a defined specificity and a single isotype. This represents both an advantage and a disadvantage when mAbs are compared to polyclonal preparations. One advantage is that mAbs, by virtue of the fact that they are chemically defined reagents, exhibit relatively low lot-to-lot variability in contrast to polyclonal preparations, which can differ over time and by source of origin since different hosts mount different antibody responses. Another advantage for mAb preparations is a much greater activity per mass of protein since all the immunoglobulin molecules are specific for the desired target. This phenomenon is illustrated by the report that two 0.7 mg doses of two mAbs provided the same protection against tetanus [15] . However, mAb preparations lack variability with regards to epitope and isotype, and consequently polyclonal preparations have potentially greater biological activity by targeting multiple microbial epitopes and providing various effector functions through different isotypes.

With the development of human and humanized mAbs, the toxicity of these agents is also relatively low. Current technology makes the production of mAbs relatively easy and effective, requiring only tissue culture or microbial expression systems, as opposed to the live human or animal donors that were required for serum therapy. Hence, the potential toxicity of human and humanized mAbs is comparable to antibiotics and lower than serum therapy, especially heterologous preparations. mAb therapies are also much less likely to inadvertently transmit other infectious diseases. However, antibody therapies remain very costly relative to antimicrobial drugs. Consequently, mAbs are unlikely to successfully compete with antimicrobial drugs against diseases for which cheap effective therapy is available unless a clear superiority is established for the immunoglobulin therapy alone or in combination with conventional antimicrobial therapy. The fact that specific antibodies are often synergistic with conventional antimicrobial therapy suggests that combination therapy with current antimicrobial regimens may confer potential advantages relative to either alone [16, 17] . Not only can mAbs make antibiotics more effective, but the research driving mAb development can also enhance other areas, such as identifying new targets for vaccine development [18, 19] . In this regard, efforts to develop mAb-based therapies have the potential of impacting many aspects of infectious disease medicine. Furthermore, some mAbs can be effective in immunocompromised hosts, as evidenced by the efficacy of palivizumab in reducing hospitalizations for RSV-associated disease in preterm infants [20] . Even in the setting of reduced immune response, mAbs can function to replace lost immunity or benefit the host by direct activity, such as neutralization. Consequently, mAbs are an attractive alternative alone or as adjuncts to current antimicrobial therapy that will be effective in hosts with different states of immunity.

Despite these strengths, mAb therapy has some inherent limitations. The cost factor has already been alluded to and remains a major obstacle to widespread mAb use. Antibodies are macromolecules that are fragile, perishable and require refrigeration, each of which contributes to their high cost. Furthermore, most mAbs require systemic administration, which complicates their delivery in many clinical settings. Finally, a mAb usually cannot be used until a specific diagnosis is made. In an era when broadspectrum antibiotics are relied upon so heavily, treatment is often begun before diagnostic identification of a disease-causing microbe is made [5] . However, recent advances in rapid diagnostic techniques provide hope for earlier specific diagnosis, which is essential for making mAb treatments more realizable. Even so, based on experience with serum therapy, one could anticipate that a mAb will only be effective when administered relatively early in the course of infection. A decrease in antibody efficacy over time occurs quickly as the duration of infection increases, highlighting the need for rapid diagnosis and treatment initiation.

Another, theoretical drawback to mAb therapy is that these reagents, by definition, target a single epitope, and provide one type of effector function corresponding to their isotype. Although the specificity of mAbs is a strength, a microbe that undergoes rapid antigenic variation poses a significant hurdle for mAb development. For example, the high mutation rate of certain viruses enables them to escape neutralization. There are numerous examples in the literature where experimental mAb therapy has resulted in the emergence of escape variants as a result of microbial mutation and/or microevolution [21] [22] [23] . This problem may be counterbalanced by selecting mAbs that target conserved areas of viral particles or by using mixtures of mAbs that target various epitopes. For example, combination therapy with mAb cocktails prevents escape variants for many viruses including influenza [24] , coronavirus [25] , and lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) [26] . Although cocktails are effective in providing protection against the emergence of resistant mutants, the inclusion of multiple immunoglobulins in any therapeutic formulation is fraught with complex regulatory and licensing issues. Nevertheless, progress in overcoming these burdensome regulatory issues is evidenced by the recent development of a mAb mixture for the prophylaxis of rabies that targets several virus types [27] . Indeed, as polyclonal sera may be beneficial due to the presence of multiple protective antibodies, a cocktail of functional mAbs could provide more protection and target more microbial strains than a single one. As experience with mAb cocktails accumulates it may be possible to design therapeutic combinations that include multiple effector functions in the form of different isotypes and epitope specificities.

Even in the face of these obstacles, mAb therapy is booming in other areas of medicine, with over 20 in clinical use, representing a market that is expected to reach $20 billion by 2010 [28] . The majority of approved mAbs treat cancer, autoimmune or allergic conditions, where they have shown considerable success and spawned a mAb 'gold rush' [29] . The antigenic differences between the host and the microbe make mAb development for infectious diseases easier than for cancer or immunity fields, where the target is often a self-antigen that is differentially expressed in transformed cells. Additionally, mAbs have direct and indirect antimicrobial mechanisms of action. Direct mechanisms include neutralizing toxins or binding to viruses to prevent host cell entry. Recently mAbs have also been shown to be directly bactericidal [30] . Indirect mechanisms involve Fc-mediated functions, such as modulation of the inflammatory response, promoting opsonic phagocytosis, and enhancing complement-mediated effects. This wide array of functions makes mAbs potentially useful against a variety of infectious diseases.

Despite these advantages, there is currently only one licensed mAb for an infectious disease, and understanding its success is instructive for the possibilities inherent in this approach. The humanized mAb palivizumab, brand name Synagis ® , binds the RSV F protein and is effective for the prevention of severe respiratory disease in high-risk infants and immunocompromised adults [31] . It received regulatory approval in 1998. Prior to palivizumab, prophylaxis of RSV disease depended on RespiGam, or RSV-IGIV, a prophylactic polyclonal RSV hyperimmune serum [1] . This prior polyclonal preparation was plagued by low specific activity, and effective dosing required the administration of large volumes of antibody, which was problematic in low weight infants. Palivizumab obviated this problem since it had 50-fold greater potency than the polyclonal serum, and this example shows how greater specific activity can translate into a superior product. The greater potency significantly reduced the volume needed to deliver a therapeutic dose to an infant and has improved treatment while avoiding the side effects of pooled serum.

In our view opportunities for the development of mAbs include niches where their use would bring a large therapeutic benefit relative to existing therapies. Although there are many diseases where mAb therapy could make a major contribution (see below) the economics are not favorable in each instance. In this regard, the exquisite specificity of antibody-based therapies means necessarily smaller markets than broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy. This combined with the relatively high costs of producing and delivering immunoglobulin therapies can make the market analysis of many reagents not economically viable. However, for microbial diseases with inadequate therapeutic options, antibody-based therapies are likely to be competitive, provided that the disease prevalence is of sufficient size to create a tenable demand.

It is noteworthy that even for diseases where there is currently adequate antimicrobial therapy, new developments could make mAb more attractive. For example, consider the case of antibiotic prophylaxis against Group B streptococcus (GBS) neonatal sepsis. Mothers carrying GBS are routinely treated with antibiotics and this has resulted in a dramatic reduction in neonatal disease. However, antibiotic therapy affects the infant microflora and has been epidemiologically linked to the development of atopy and asthma in children [14] . Furthermore, prophylactic antibiotic therapy can select for resistant microbes or disturb the flora in a manner that could make colonization with resistant microbes more likely, could be followed by superinfections, and may even have untoward consequences later in life [5] . Passive antibody therapy against GBS is also effective [32] and not encumbered by the problems of altered flora and its consequences. Hence, the economics of passive antibody and antibiotic prophylaxis are more nuanced than simply valuing the different alternatives. A truer cost comparison must take into account the complications that follow broad-spectrum therapy.

Historically, the major targets for antibody therapy have been diseases caused by encapsulated bacteria (e.g. pneumococcus and meningococcus), toxins (e.g. diphtheria and tetanus) and viruses. In general, most efforts to develop antibody-based therapies have focused on diseases where the humoral immune system was known to make a strong contribution to host defense. For these microbial diseases the efficacy of humoral immunity was implied from demonstration of passive antibody protection and/or correlation of specific antibody with resistance to disease. However, recent work has established that mAbs are effective even against microbes for which the standard studies do not clearly establish a role for humoral immunity [33] . For example, several mAbs have now been generated that are effective against intracellular pathogens and other microbes where natural Ab is not believed to have a primary role in host defense [33] . Overall, diseases which are currently not preventable by vaccination or that target populations with weak immune systems (for example, the very young or old, and immunosuppressed or immunocompromised patients) are the most valuable for which to develop mAb therapies. Here, both viral and bacterial toxin diseases that are the target of mAb development will be discussed, as well as potential targets based on need toward which efforts should be focused in the future. Our goal is to survey this field, with the understanding that cataloguing all ongoing efforts is beyond the scope of this article.

Viral targets are particularly attractive because for most viruses there is no specific therapy. The potential for mAbs to be used as neutralizing antibodies to prevent viral binding and entry to host cells makes them a good platform for prophylaxis, preemptive or acute treatment of viral illnesses [34] . There are several current areas of viral mAb development, and many in clinical trials (see Table 2 ).

While the approved drug palivizumab is effective against RSV disease in susceptible groups, there has been considerable effort to develop 2nd and 3rd generation mAbs: motavizumab (brand name Numax ® ) and Numax-YTE ® [1] . Motavizumab was engineered to have increased affinity through induced somatic hypermutation, with the hopes that increased binding will improve function in humans, and is currently being tested in phase III clinical trials. Numax-YTE is the result of additional efforts to prolong this mAb's serum half-life, another potential avenue of mAb development. Furthermore, clinical trials are underway testing both escalating doses of mAb and intramuscular (i.m.) administration, showing that the improvement of delivery and dosing of mAb drugs are an important next step in advancing therapy. These developments illustrate how technological advances may improve existing successful mAb therapeutics.

HIV has always been an area of great interest for mAb therapy [35] [36] [37] [38] . There are several mAbs for HIV in development, designed to inhibit viral entry, reduce viral load in HIV-patients, and potentially to prevent infection in certain cases [39, 40] . Viral entry inhibitor mAbs target either the cellular receptors, CCR5 and CD4, or the cognate viral protein gp120. Efforts to develop neutralizing mAbs with broader strain specificity have found success targeting the V3 loop of gp120 [41] . As is true with all mAbs designed for infectious disease, the development of a successful vaccine would reduce their need. However, given the slow progress on the front of HIV vaccine development, mAb research in the HIV field is a promising alternative. Although there are numerous antiretroviral drugs available for the treatment of HIV, the availability of effective mAb therapy could complement chemotherapy by slowing the onset of resistance and possibly enhancing therapeutic efficacy.

Another target for mAb development is CMV. Sevirumab is currently being assessed for treatment of CMV retinitis in HIV-infected individuals and neonatal congenital CMV. Another important complication of CMV infection is reactivation disease, a distinct burden on transplantation medicine. CMV infects a large portion of the population, at least 60% of adults in the U.S., and the virus can reactivate with devastating consequences during the course of immunosuppression that solid organ or hematologic transplant patients must undergo [42] . The use of mAb to control this reactivation is an area of development that could benefit a large number of patients.

Hepatitis B and C virus (HBV, HCV) infections are areas where antibody therapies offer great hope in helping to control disease and improve transplantation success. Hepatitis remains the leading indication for liver transplant, and viral reinfection of the transplanted liver is a major complication. Two different monoclonal antibodies are in clinical trials for the improving transplant success, of which neither are specific for the virus itself. Both bavituximab, specific for phosphatidylserine, a phospholipid exposed on membranes of damaged cells, and MDX-1106, specific for PD-1, an inhibitory T cell costimulation receptor, have been used to control chronic hepatitis infection, particularly in the setting of HIV-coinfection [34, 43] . The threat of a new pandemic makes influenza virus an important candidate for mAb development, with research currently being done to characterize human neutralizing antibodies and explore their therapeutic potential [24, 44, 45] . Historically, influenza virus has been extremely challenging because of its high antigenic variability. However, progress has been made in identifying antibodies that are broadly neutralizing [46, 47] . In the event of a new pandemic mAbs could provide important options for disease control since they confer immediate immunity and may be used as prophylaxis for individuals who are likely to have been exposed to infection. Considerable excitement followed the discovery of a broadly cross-reactive antibody specific for HA2 of influenza A that allows the neutralization of different viral strains, including avian H5N1 and human H1N1 [48] . Technology now exists where plasma cells secreting influenza-specific antibody can be cloned from human donors and used to generate high affinity mAbs within a matter of weeks [49] .

Another promising opportunity for antibody therapy is rabies, where current standard of care depends on administration of immune globulin and vaccination. In this regard, a major innovation was the development of the mAb cocktail CL184 [27] . This cocktail is comprised of two mAbs, specific for two different epitopes of the rabies virus, and shows good neutralizing activity in vitro and was well tolerated in patients. Its success validates the idea that cocktails of multiple mAbs represent an important logistical improvement in mAb therapy, allowing for expanded target coverage, broader specificity and a wider range of effector functions.

There is no available vaccine or specific therapeutic agent for human flaviviral infections, and after the outbreak of West Nile encephalitis in 1999, efforts were directed towards developing antibody therapies for prophylactic treatment [50] . A hyperimmune preparation derived from human convalescent sera protected mice from West Nile virus (WNV), both in the setting of induced immunocompromise and after the onset of encephalitis [51] . This observation suggested that antibody was effective at treating disease after dissemination to the brain and spinal cord had occurred. Development of mAb treatment for WNV in elderly or immunocompromised patients might prevent the debilitating disease and paralysis that can occur in these populations [52] . MGAWN1, a humanized mAb to the structural envelope protein, is currently in clinical trials, and could provide a new therapeutic option against WNV.

The ability to rapidly identify microbial targets and produce mAbs makes them a feasible tool to combat emergent situations. An excellent example of the rapidity with which mAbs can be generated in response to an outbreak was provided by the response to SARS corona virus (SARS-CoV). In early 2003, respiratory disease due to the virus broke out in human populations, and within a year the cellular receptor [53] and viral glycoprotein [54] responsible for binding were identified. By early 2004, neutralizing human mAbs had been developed and were being tested by laboratories [55] , illustrating the potential speed of bench-to-bedside transition. Human mAbs have been developed to the Hendra and Nipah viruses, which are both paramyxoviruses that can cause fatal hemorrhagic fevers and were responsible for outbreaks in the late 1990s [56, 57] . Emerging diseases are just one area where research into the specificity of mAb targets and their protective efficacy in animal models should be a priority. Other areas where mAbs targeting a needed pathogen may be in development but have not reached clinical trials yet are listed in Table 3 .

Bacterial diseases mediated by toxins have historically responded to specific antibody and consequently remain good targets for treatment with toxin-neutralizing mAbs. In addition to toxin-mediated diseases, recent studies have shown that specific mAbs can alter the course of bacterial and fungal infection, and that immunoglobulins can enhance the action of other antimicrobials. The issue of mAb synergy with conventional antimicrobial drugs is of particular importance since development of mAbs as an adjunct to existing therapy is an attractive possibility to improve therapeutic outcomes for bacterial infection. Several mAbs, targeting diseases that are in clinical trials (Table 2 ) or being developed as needed therapeutics (Table 3) , are discussed below.

The Shiga-like toxin IIB produced by pathogenic strains of Escherichia coli is responsible for organ damage in the hemorrhagic colitis and hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) that develop dur- [58, 59] . Several mAbs designed to neutralize the systemic toxin have been developed, and one is currently having success in phase I clinical trials [60] [61] [62] .

Another toxin-mediated disease of growing concern is Clostridium difficile colitis, which usually results from broad-spectrum antibiotic use [63] . Although oral antibiotics can often clear infection, there are indications that new hypervirulent strains are emerging, which increase disease severity [64] . Furthermore, for certain individuals the disease can become chronic [65] . mAbs to toxin A and toxin B are in development and currently being tested in clinical trials. Laboratory research has shown that mAbs may act by more than just direct binding and neutralization of toxin, as Fc receptors have been shown to be essential for mAb protection, presumably through increasing endocytic uptake of the toxin by effector cells [66] . The increasing prevalence and toll of this disease underscores both the dangers of antibiotic use and the potential for mAb as a new therapy platform. mAbs may become essential tools to fight this and many other hospital-acquired infections, where often antibiotics have already failed to improve outcomes [67] .

Staphylococcal disease is an example of bacterial disease where both the bacterium and disease-mediating toxins can be targeted by mAbs. Two mAbs in clinical trials recognize staphylococcal virulence factors. Pagibaximab is a chimeric mAb specific for lipoteichoic acid (LTA), which was shown to be protective against both coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) and S. aureus infection [68] . Certain populations are very susceptible to staphylococcal disease, such as very low birth weight (VLBW) newborns, where pagibaximab is currently in phase I/II clinical trials for preventing infection [69, 70] . Another target is the S. aureus protein clumping factor A (ClfA), targeted by tefibazumab (brand name Aurexis ® ) which is in phase II clinical trials for S. aureus bacteremia [71] . These two mAbs show promise and provide hope for the development of improved mAbs targeting staphylococcal species. Alpha-hemolysin (H1a) is a pore-forming cytotoxin that is an essential virulence factor for the development staphylococcal pneumonia. Researchers have recently shown that passive administration of a mAb to H1a, as well as vaccination to elicit active immunity against this antigen, afforded protection to pneumonia in mouse models [72] .

Antibodies neutralizing toxins and viruses can provide immediate defense against many biological weapons [73] . Anthrax is an example of one such disease, where current treatment recommendations are inadequate, as the anthrax vaccine is currently not indicated for post-exposure prophylaxis and antibiotic-resistant strains of Bacillus anthracis are a rising concern [74] . Protective antigen (PA) is the common subunit to the two dimeric anthrax toxins, where PA pairs with edema factor (EF) or lethal factor (LF) to form cellular toxins mediating edema and cell death, respectively. The two mAbs specific for PA currently in clinical trials are anthim, which was just announced to be restarting phase I clinical trials, and raxibacumab, which is currently maintained by the U.S. Strategic National Stockpile. Toxins from Clostridium botulinum are another example of extremely potent neurotoxins that can lead to fatal respiratory disease and are capable of being weaponized. Development of mAbs to neutralize these toxins for post-exposure treatment is an important avenue of research.

One area where antibody therapy has long provided the only therapeutic option is the neutralization of snake venoms. Most of the current preparations fall into the category of serum therapy, with immunoglobulins derived from heterologous sources. One group has developed human single chain variable antibody fragments (HuScFv) from a phage display library that are effective in neutralizing the neurotoxin and preventing lethality in mice [75] , illustrating how new mAb technology and antibody formats are able to improve and expand on current treatments. However, economics could pose a formidable problem with developing mAbs venom therapy, since the number of different poisons is great and, fortunately, the number of cases is relatively few.

Fungal diseases are a promising area for mAb therapy. Fungal diseases are chronic, difficult to treat, and carry a high mortality and morbidity despite antifungal therapy. For this group of diseases mAb therapy could find a niche because current therapies are suboptimal. To date only one mAb has been studied clinically for the treatment of cryptococcal meningitis [76] . That antibody reduced serum cryptococcal antigen but only at very high doses, which made it economically unfeasible. An antibody fragment to a surface heat shock protein showed promising efficacy against human candidiasis in a phase III trial [16] . Recently a broadly crossreactive mAb to a fungal cell wall antigen was described that was effective against experimental aspergillosis, candidiasis, and cryptococcosis [77, 78] . Another example of broadly active antifungal mAbs are those that mimic killer toxin action [79] .

The exquisite specificity of antibodies for their targets provides a means of delivering harmful cargo to their targets. This concept has long been recognized in oncology where investigators have tried to enhance the efficacy of anti-tumor antibody therapies by conjugating antibodies to bacterial toxins and radioisotopes. Like use of mAb therapy in general, the field of infectious diseases has been slow in adopting such strategies, although considerable experimental work was done to develop immunotoxins to target HIV-infected cells [80] . Nevertheless, in recent years progress has been made developing radioimmunotherapy for infectious diseases.

Radioimmunotherapy (RIT) was first developed for cancer treatment almost three decades ago [81] . RIT uses the antigen-antibody interaction to deliver radionuclides that emanate lethal doses of cytotoxic radiation to cancer cells [82, 83] , and can provide a valuable alternative to chemotherapy and external radiation beam therapy (EBRT). RIT is a successful therapy for certain cancers as evidenced by the recent approval of mAb-based drugs such as Zevalin ® and Bexxar ® (anti-CD20 mAbs labeled with 90-Yttrium ( 90 Y) and 131-Iodine ( 131 I), respectively) for the treatment of relapsed or refractory B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Recent reports on the use of RIT as an initial treatment for follicular lymphoma [84] are encouraging thus making RIT first line therapy in some types of cancer.

Until recently the potential of RIT as an antimicrobial strategy had not been explored. The reasons for this are enigmatic but could reflect the lack of awareness of the difficult problems in clinical infectious diseases by the nuclear medicine community and of RIT by the infectious diseases community. During the last 5 years RIT has been successfully adapted in our laboratories for the treatment of experimental fungal, bacterial and viral infections [85] [86] [87] [88] [89] [90] . Here we briefly review the data on efficacy and safety of RIT of infectious diseases.

The potential efficacy of RIT against an infectious diseases was first established using Cryptococcus neoformans (CN) [85] . CN is a major fungal pathogen that causes life-threatening meningoencephalitis in 6-8% of patients with AIDS. CN provided a good system to study the potential usefulness of RIT because there were excellent animal models available, well characterized mAbs to CN antigens existed, and immunotherapy of CN infection with capsule polysaccharide-binding antibody 18B7 was already in clinical evaluation [76] . In spite of high level of circulating polysaccharide in the blood of infected mice, in both pulmonary and systemic animal models of CN infection radiolabeled mAb preferentially localized to the sites of infection. mAb 18B7 radiolabeled with 213-bismuth ( 213 Bi) or 188-rhenium ( 188 Re) killed CN cells in vitro, thus providing the basis for in vivo experiments in AJ/Cr mice infected systemically with CN. Mice treated with radiolabeled CN-specific mAb 18B7 lived significantly longer than mice given irrelevant labeled IgG1 or PBS. Mice infected with CN and given RIT had significantly reduced fungal burden in lungs and brains 48 h after treatment compared to infected mice in the control groups.

The antimicrobial RIT approach was subsequently extended to another human pathogenic fungus, Histoplasma capsulatum (HC) [86] , which is the most common cause of fungal pneumonia in immunocompromised patients [91] , by treating HC in vitro with 188 Re-labeled mAb 9C7 (IgM) which binds to a protein antigen on the surface of the HC cell wall [92] . Ninety percent of HC cells were killed with 32 Ci HC-specific 188 Re-9C7 mAb. In contrast, incubation of HC with a radiolabeled control IgM with the same specific activity produced only minimal killing within the investigated range of doses. Cellular dosimetry calculations based on the mean absorbed dose to the cell showed that RIT with alpha-and betaemitting radioisotopes was approximately 1000-fold more efficient in killing CN and approximately 100-fold more efficient in killing HC than gamma radiation.

The potential of RIT against bacterial infection was established using Streptococcus pneumoniae because this is an important extracellular pathogen, and there are good animal models and mAbs available [88] . A greater percentage of mice treated with 213 Bi-D11 survived relative to the control groups, where mice in control groups succumbed to bacteremia on days 1-3, while mice treated with 80 Ci 213 Bi-D11 mice demonstrated 87-100% survival. Treatment with radiolabeled D11 was very well tolerated as no weight loss was observed in treated animals.

RIT could also be potentially effective against chronically infected cells including those with viral infections [6] . In contrast to RIT of fungal and bacterial diseases where the target is the microbe itself, in RIT of viral infections the infected mammalian cells would be targeted thus providing a general strategy for eliminating reservoirs of infected cells and viral cellular factories. This approach could be developed for the treatment of drug-resistant HIV strains [93] . The efficacy of RIT for treatment of HIV infection in vivo was explored with a radiolabeled HIV envelope-specific human anti-gp41 mAb 246-D radiolabeled with 213 Bi and 188 Re [89] . For these studies human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) infected with HIV-1 JR-CSF were injected into the spleens of SCID mice and the mice were treated with RIT. Treatment of mice with 188 Re-labeled mAb 246-D administered either before or after intrasplenic injection with HIV-1 JR-CSF -infected human PBMCs dramatically reduced the number of HIV-1-infected cells. Similar results were obtained after treatment of mice with 213 Bi-246-D. Administration of equivalent amounts of ""cold"" mAb 246-D or of a radioisotope-coupled irrelevant control mAb did not reduce the average number of infected cells detected in the SCID mouse spleens. The demonstration of efficacy of RIT against HIV provided a proof-of-principle for the concept of treating viral infections by targeting viral-infected cells and this approach could potentially be applied to other chronic viral diseases like hepatitis C.

The success of RIT approach in laboratory studies combined with earlier nuclear medicine experience on pre-clinical and clinical studies showing the utility of radiolabeled organism-specific antibodies for imaging of infections (reviewed in [94] ) provides encouragement for the feasibility of therapeutically targeting microbes with labeled antibodies. In fact, the ability of specific antibody to localize to a site of infection provides strong support for the potential usefulness of this technique as a broad antimicrobial strategy. It might be possible to create a so-called ""pan-antibody"" which would recognize an antigen shared by a particular class of human pathogens. An example of such a ""pan-antibody"" is mAb 6D2 initially developed against fungal melanin that also binds to synthetic, invertebrate (cuttlefish), murine and human melanins [95] . The availability of such antibodies would eliminate the necessity of having antibodies specific for each particular microorganism and would enormously enhance the development of RIT of infectious diseases.

Considering the breadth of research into new targets for microbial mAbs, as well as the vast need for new therapeutic modalities for infectious diseases, this area of medicine is a growing field. There are many new approaches to improving the efficacy of mAbs, such as using cocktails of mAbs or combining mAbs with existing drugs for synergistic effects. There are also many new research developments that will expand the possibilities for mAb drugs. The next generation of mAbs could be developed against novel targets, such as quorum sensing molecules, which regulate bacterial growth and virulence factor expression [96] , or type III secretion systems, which are used by a subset of microbes to infect host cells [97] . To fight MDR bacteria, some successful approaches have targeted the cellular efflux pumps responsible for antibiotic resistance [98] . In general, more of these types of ""broad-spectrum"" mAbs will enable a therapeutic mAb to be developed which could be useful against a number of microbes, thus extending its market and increasing its profit potential. Bavituximab is an example of one such mAb, specific for phospholipids on the exposed inner surface of damaged cells, where potential applications include both HIV and HCV [34] . Progress has also been made generating mAbs that have bispecificity, where mAb variants are selected that bind to multiple microbial epitopes [99] . Finally, more direct engineering of mAbs could result in enhanced efficacy, such as Fc region alterations that can extend serum half-life or influence effector function [100] . For example, alterations in Fc region glycosylation can increase antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) [101] . Although this review has focused on the use of intact mAbs against microbial diseases, we note that for some microbes the Fc region is not necessary for efficacy, providing numerous additional therapeutic options. For example, mAb fragments which lack Fc regions can be effective in situations where effector cell function is not necessary, for example in inhibiting HIV entry [102] .

We are cautiously optimistic that the mAb therapeutic revolution will make a much greater impact against microbial diseases in the years ahead. There is no shortage of targets for mAbs to treat microbial diseases. At this time, the major problem is economic and it is likely that success will come first in niche areas where there is sufficient need, urgency, and market size to support the development of mAb therapies. In the longer term, the field needs to build economic models that are suitable for the development of antibody therapies against a much broader set of microbial targets.

Vaccines and Therapeutics Against Hantaviruses,"Hantaviruses (HVs) are rodent-transmitted viruses that can cause hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome (HCPS) in the Americas and hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) in Eurasia. Together, these viruses have annually caused approximately 200,000 human infections worldwide in recent years, with a case fatality rate of 5-15% for HFRS and up to 40% for HCPS. There is currently no effective treatment available for either HFRS or HCPS. Only whole virus inactivated vaccines against HTNV or SEOV are licensed for use in the Republic of Korea and China, but the protective efficacies of these vaccines are uncertain. To a large extent, the immune correlates of protection against hantavirus are not known. In this review, we summarized the epidemiology, virology, and pathogenesis of four HFRS-causing viruses, HTNV, SEOV, PUUV, and DOBV, and two HCPS-causing viruses, ANDV and SNV, and then discussed the existing knowledge on vaccines and therapeutics against these diseases. We think that this information will shed light on the rational development of new vaccines and treatments.","In recent years, the repeated outbreak of hantavirus disease has caused a serious threat to human health. The spread of hantavirus from natural hosts to humans is a natural ecological process; however, the outbreak of hantavirus is driven by striped field mouse population cycle dynamics and seasonal climate change (Tian and Stenseth, 2019) .

Hantavirus is a virus transmitted mainly by rodent animals, mainly through urine, feces, and saliva and the aerosols produced by them, but rarely by the bites of infected animals (Brocato and Hooper, 2019) . In recent years, the infection rate of hantavirus has increased in China and Europe (Dong et al., 2019) . Hantavirus disease has turned out to be a newly identified but not a ""new"" disease in Germany (Kruger et al., 2013) . The clinical presentations may vary according to viral strains prevalence in different regions. In Asia, hantavirus infection by Hantan virus (HTNV) and Seoul virus (SEOV) targets mainly the human kidney and causes hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS). In North America, infection by Andes virus (ANDV) and Sin Nombre virus (SNV) manifests in mainly the lung and leads to hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) or hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome (HCPS), with high mortality rates; in Europe, infection by Puumala virus (PUUV) and Dobrava-Belgrade virus (DOBV) typically causes a milder form of HFRS, nephropathia epidemica (NE) (Echterdiek et al., 2019) .

Currently, there is no approved post-exposure therapeutic countermeasure against hantaviral infection, but diversified treatment strategies have been developed and applied to manage HFRS or HCPS. These strategies target viral life cycle, host immunological factors, or patient clinical symptoms. Preventive measures against hantaviral infection, especially vaccine development, are essential for future pandemics. In this paper, we reviewed the epidemiology and pathogenesis of hantavirus, and discuss the existing knowledge on vaccine and therapeutics against these diseases in order to shed light on the development of new vaccines and treatments.

China has the highest incidence and mortality of HFRS in the world, accounting for more than 90% of the total number of HFRS cases in the world (Zheng et al., 2018) . In 2004, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC) established the National Notifiable Disease Surveillance System (NNDSS) online, and HFRS cases of the whole country were reported daily through this system (Zhang et al., 2014) . From 2006 to 2012, a total of 77,558 cases and 866 deaths were reported with the average annual incidence rate of 0.83 per 100,000, mortality rate of 0.01 per 100,000 and case fatality rate of 1.13% (Zhang et al., 2014) , and its main causative pathogens are HTNV and SEOV (Tian and Stenseth, 2019) . So far, HFRS cases have been reported in 30 out of 32 provinces in China (excluding Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan) (Zhang et al., 2014) . In recent years, the incidence is still high in eastern China (Tian et al., 2017) . The distribution map of hantavirus cases reported in recent Chinese literatures is summarized in Figure 1 . More than 90% of the total cases were clustered in nine provinces and mainly reported in spring and autumn-winter seasons. We can observe that the annual average number of cases in Shaanxi Province was higher than 2000, ranking at the top of the list (Figure 1) . From 2006 to 2017, Shaanxi has gradually become the province with the highest incidence in China, with approximately 4.51 cases/100,000 cases, of which more than 90% are concentrated in the central region (Xi'an, Xianyang, Baoji, and Weinan cities) (Zheng et al., 2018) . By November 20 of 2017, 878 people were recorded infected in Shaanxi Province (Dong et al., 2019) . We also can observe that the average annual number of cases in the cities of Shannxi, Shandong, and Jiangxi Province rank the top three (Supplementary Figure 1) . Another place with a high incidence of HFRS is Qingdao city of Shandong Province, where HFRS incidence is three times higher than the national average, reaching 0.83/100,000 (Jiang et al., 2017) .

In the US, 34 states have confirmed and recorded HCPS cases since 1993 (Prince and Lieberman, 2013) . In 2008, the first locally acquired case of HFRS caused by the SEOV was confirmed. In 2017, the US CDC investigated an outbreak of SEOV infection that has infected 17 rat owners in seven states (Kerins et al., 2018) . The number of hantavirus cases by year in different states is summarized in Figure 2 . In Canada, HCPS is still very rare, but cases are recorded every year and show seasonal patterns, mainly between March and May and between September and November. A total of 64 cases have been confirmed since 2000, of which 12 were reported in 2013, most in western Canadian provinces such as Alberta, Manitoba, British Columbia, and Saskatchewan (Kerins et al., 2018) . SNV and ANDV are responsible for the majority of hantavirus cases leading to HCPS.

Outside North America, individual cases and small clusters of HCPS have been reported in Balkans, northern Sweden (Bergstedt Oscarsson et al., 2016) , Argentina (Pini et al., 2003) , Chile (Toro et al., 1998) , Poland (Gut et al., 2018) , Bolivia (1998) , Brazil (Suzuki et al., 2004; Limongi et al., 2009) , Serbia (Stanojevic et al., 2019) , United Kingdom (Duggan, 2019) , Panama (Bayard et al., 2004) , and Germany (Ettinger et al., 2012) . Overall, in Europe, the incidence of hantavirus infections has steadily increased in recent years: In 2014, a record number of 3754 infections were registered across Europe . Chile has had an average of 67 cases per year since 1995; the disease occurs mainly in spring and summer. However, between June and October 2011, there was an increase in cases and rodent populations (Toro et al., 1998) . In Paraguay, an HCPS case was first found in the Chako region in 1995. A total of 56 cases were reported in 2011, and 18 cases were reported in 2012 (Padula et al., 2007) . In Panama, HCPS first appeared in 1999, with an average of 12 patients per year. However, 16 cases were reported in 2012, and 14 cases were confirmed as of 21 August 2013. For the first time since 1997, Uruguay has experienced HCPS cases, with an average of nine cases per year. The first case was recorded in northern Uruguay in 2010. In Poland, the infections are caused by mainly the PUUV and DOBV serotypes. The morbidity is not high; it ranges between 0.02 and 0.14 per 100,000 cases, but some papers suggest that the data concerning Poland is underestimated (Gut et al., 2018) , because the number of infections then was higher, and it was most likely the epidemic year. In the following year, 2015, there were 6 infections, and in 2016 and 2017, there were 8 and 14 cases registered, respectively. In Germany, from 2001 to 2010, the incidence increased from 0.09 to 2.47/100,000 (Ettinger et al., 2012) . In United Kingdom, the virus was first identified in laboratory rats in Scotland in 1977, and all but 1 of the 15 cases of SEOV caused acute kidney injury, which were diagnosed by the Rare and Imported Pathogens Laboratory (Duggan, 2019) .

Hantaviruses belong to the Family Hantaviridae of Bunyavirales and are a kind of enveloped single negative chain RNA virus (Abudurexiti et al., 2019) . A maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree of the complete amino acid and CDS sequence of the M segment of hantaviruses was made based on the international Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) updated taxonomy of the order Bunyavirales in 2019 (see Figure 3 ). This phylogeny shows the modest genetic diversity of the virus family.

The diameter of hantavirus particles is 80-US210 nm, and the structure is spherical or ovoid. They are composed of 20-30% fat, >50% protein, 7% carbohydrates, and 2% RNA. They are very stable and can survive for more than 18 days at 4 • C and −20 • C and 10 days at room temperature . The genome comprises three negative sense, single-stranded RNAs that consist the small (S), medium (M), and large (L) segments that encode the nucleoprotein (Np), envelope glycoproteins (Gn and Gc), and viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), respectively (Graham et al., 2019) . The outer membrane of hantavirus is composed of Gn and Gc glycoprotein, which mediates the recognition of and entry into host cells. The crystal structure of HTNV Gn is very similar to that of PUUV Gn, which confirms that hantavirus Gn is conserved in hantavirus (Li et al., 2016; Rissanen et al., 2017) .

Although there have been substantial vaccines, there is no licensed vaccine against hantavirus infection that can be widely used. Despite inactivated hantavirus vaccines being licensed for human use in China and Korea, no such vaccine has been approved in the US or Europe (Tian and Stenseth, 2019) . Current clinical studies of inactivated hantavirus vaccine in China or Korea and clinical trials of DNA vaccines in the US are summarized in Table 1 .

The inactivated vaccines comprise entire virions that are inactivated physically (heat) or chemically. In Korea, Lee and An (Cho et al., 2002) first developed an inactivated HTNV vaccine (IHV), which was prepared from the HTNV strain ROK 84/105, which proliferates in the brains of lactating mice. It has been proven that it can induce protein immunization in mice and humans (Yamanishi et al., 1988) . In 1990, the Korean HFRS vaccine Hantavax was put into commercial production. The total number of HFRS patients hospitalized in South Korea fell sharply from 1234 in 1991 to 415 in 1997 (Cho et al., 2002) . To evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of Hantavax TM in healthy adults in multicenter phase III clinical trials, three dose schedules at 0, 1, and 13 months were used. The seroconversion rate was 90.14% by IFA but only 23.24% by PRNT50 after two primary doses. One month after vaccination, the positive rate of serum was 87.32 and 45.07% according to IFA and PRNT50, respectively. The neutralizing antibody response of the two initial doses of Hantavax TM was very poor. Therefore, it is necessary to carry out enhanced immunization within 2-6 months to provide timely protection for high-risk groups (Song et al., 2016) .

From January 2011 to February 2017, the South Korean military conducted a case-control study of 100 patients to evaluate the effect of an IHV on HFRS. The vaccine effectiveness (VE) value of the IHV was 59.1%, but the VE value of HFRS highincidence area was higher (78.7%) . However, in 2018, the efficacy of iHV on the progression of HFRS did not show a statistically significant protective effect. From 2009 to 2017, 18 patients inoculated with HFRS vaccine and 110 patients not vaccinated with the HFRS vaccine were recruited at Korean Army Hospital to investigate the severity (AKI) and the efficacy of dialysis events in acute renal injury. Overall, 33.3% of the effective vaccination group had three stages of AKI, compared with 54.5% for the non-vaccinated group. The curative effect of IHV on disease progression was 58.1%, but the curative effect of IHV on HFRS progress did not show a statistically significant protective effect (Yi et al., 2018) .

In China, bivalent inactivated vaccines against HTNV and SEOV infection were produced in 1994 and approved by the Pharmacopoeia of China in 2005. Since 2008, the Chinese government has implemented an expanded immunization program targeting HFRS. China uses approximately 2 million doses of HFRS vaccine every year (Schmaljohn, 2012) . HFRS cases have significantly dropped to less than 20,000 per year. Phase 4 clinical trials of inactivated hantavirus vaccine showed that the median OD values of IgG antibody were 0.005 (0.004-0.016), 0.116 (0.036-0.620), 0.320 (0.065-0.848), and 0.128 (0.011-0.649), and that the positivity rate was 7.7, 40.6, 62.2, and 48.2% at pre-vaccination, 1 month after the two primary doses, at the booster dose and at 18 months after the booster dose, respectively. Although two main doses can help healthy individuals develop immune responses, the three-dose series should be better than the two-dose series (Zheng et al., 2018) . Another clinical study in Xian Yang city in northwest China showed that the positive rate of neutralizing antibody in the unvaccinated group was 10.0%, and the positive rate was 80.0, 90.0, 50.0, and 90%, respectively, at 1, 3, 29, and 33 months after immunization with a vaccine consisting of a mixture of inactivated HTNV and SEOV. This finding indicates that the vaccination program can induce effective humoral immunity in northwestern China and can be maintained up to 33 months after vaccination (Table 1) .

At present, DNA vaccines are the most popular method in the research of HFRS and HCPS vaccines, mainly focusing on the use of a hetero-expression system to produce recombinant M protein. DNA vaccines are characterized by safety because they have replication defects, cannot restore the virulence, and cannot spread from person to person or to the environment. A variety of DNA vaccines against the hantavirus envelope glycoprotein gene were developed by Hopper's group (Schmaljohn et al., 2014) . FIGURE 3 | Hantavirus phylogenetic tree on the basis of the M segment sequences. A maximum clade credibility tree of the complete amino acid sequence of the protein encoded by the M segment of viruses belonging to Hantavirus. Different colors represent different clade. These proteins had a high similar signature domain and highly unconserved terminal sequences, which could artificially create similarities between sequences if the alignment was not properly made. Therefore, the phylogenetic tree was made with more robust methods using T-Coffee (default parameter, removed the unconserved sites by filtering the column scores < 4) for multiple sequence alignment and SMS-PhyML (default parameter, bootstrap = 1000, best model = LG +G) for ML (Maximum Likelihood) tree construction.

Their studies have confirmed that these DNA vaccines produce neutralizing antibodies in multiple experimental animal species and protected hamsters from HFRS (Schmaljohn et al., 2014) .

Next, they developed HFRS candidate DNA vaccines expressing HTNV or PUUV Gn and GC genes and evaluated them in an open-labeled single-center phase 1 study. The results showed that HTNV and PUUV DNA vaccines prepared by electroporation were safe. When mixed together, the response to PUUV was greater than that to the HTNV DNA vaccine, and both DNA vaccines had immunogenicity .

The vaccine entered phase 2a trial in 2014 to compare the immune responses to two different doses, 1.0 and 2.0 mg, and mixed HTNV and PUUV DNA vaccines in healthy participants. All groups also received booster doses 6 months after the first vaccination to determine which doses and vaccination plans will be the best way to advance the vaccine development process. To evaluate the safety, responsiveness and immunogenicity of an ANDV DNA vaccine to prevent HPS, the first phase I clinical trials of the ANDV DNA vaccine began in February 2019 1 ( Table 1) .

Similarly, all DNA vaccines developed against hantavirus target the M gene expressing the envelope GP (Gn and Gc) of hantaviruses ( Table 2 , part 1).

In the United States, a variety of DNA vaccines express the envelope glycoprotein gene of hantaviruses that were developed by Hopper's group (Schmaljohn et al., 2014) . In 1999, HFRS candidate naked DNA vaccine was constructed by the subcloning method. The subcloned cDNA represented the medium fragment The yield for all nucleocapsid proteins ranged from 0.5 to 1.5 mg per g wet weight of yeast cells Razanskiene et al., 2004 (Continued) Frontiers in Microbiology | www.frontiersin.org (M; encoding G 1 and G 2 glycoprotein) or small fragment (S; encoding nucleocapsid protein) of SEOV and was cloned into the expression vector WRG 7077. Syrian hamsters were vaccinated with the M or S vaccine with a gene gun, and hantavirus-specific antibodies were found in 5 of 5 hamsters or 4 of 5 hamsters, respectively. Evidence of infection was monitored after challenge with SEOV. Twenty-eight days later, hamsters vaccinated with M were protected hamsters from infection, but those inoculated with S were not protected (Hooper et al., 1999) . Then, HTNV M gene products G 1 and G 2 were expressed in 2001, and non-human primates were evaluated. The HTNV M gene has protective effects against HTNV, SEOV, and DOBV in hamsters. The HTNV and ANDV M genes can induce high level of neutralizing antibodies in rhesus monkeys (Hooper et al., 2001) . Next, a DNA vaccine plasmid containing the full-length M genome fragment of ANDV (pWRG/AND-M) was constructed . Rhesus monkeys inoculated with pWRG/AND-M with gene guns produced very high levels of neutralizing antibodies that neutralized not only ANDV but also other HCPS-related hantavirus strains, such as SNV. On the 4th or 5th day after injection, monkey serum protected 100% of hamsters from fatal diseases (Custer et al., 2003) .

Then the pWRG/HA-M plasmid containing the HTNV and ANDV M gene fragments was constructed. Rhesus monkeys were immunized with the pWRG/HA-M vaccine to produce antibodies binding to M gene products (G 1 and G 2 glycoproteins) and neutralize HTNV and ANDV. Subsequently, 1-2 years after the initial vaccination series, the neutralizing antibody titers induced by the double immunogen pWRG/HA-M or a single immunogen expressing only HTNV or ANDV Gp increased rapidly to a high level. This result is the first time that the hantavirus M gene DNA vaccine has been shown to elicit a strong memory response and stimulate an antibody response to neutralize HFRS and HCPS viruses (Hooper et al., 2006; Kwilas et al., 2014) detected the high-titer neutralizing antibody induced by an SNV/ANDV DNA vaccine encoding viral envelope Gp in laboratory animals and non-human primates (NHCPS). It can be delivered effectively using a disposable syringe injection (DSJI) system (Kwilas et al., 2014) . Brocato et al. (2013) cloned codon-optimized PUUV M fragments into DNA vaccine vectors to produce the plasmid pWRG/PUU-M, which can produce high-titer neutralizing antibodies in hamsters and NHCPs. The pWRG/PUU-M vaccine protects hamsters from PUUV infection and is not affected by DOBV infection. Unexpectedly, vaccination could protect hamsters in the absence of ANDV cross-neutralizing antibodies in a lethal ANDV disease model . Then, the authors tried to produce the pan-hantavirus vaccine with a mixed plasmid DNA vaccine. A study of ANDV hamster model showed that the neutralizing antibody produced by DNA vaccine technology can be used to resist the challenge of an SNV full-length M gene DNA vaccine to prevent the occurrence of HCPS. Rabbits vaccinated with SNV DNA vaccine with muscle electroporation (mEP) produced increased neutralizing antibody titers. In addition, hamsters vaccinated three times with the SNV DNA vaccine with a gene gun were completely free from SNV infection. Rabbits were vaccinated with HCPS mixture (ANDV and SNV plasmid), HFRS mixed (HTNV and PUUV plasmid), or HCPS/HFRS mixture (all four plasmids) by mEP. The results showed that the HCPS mixture and HFRS mixture produce neutralizing antibodies against ANDV/SNV and HTNV/PUUV, respectively. In addition, a mixture of HCPS/HFRS triggered neutralizing antibodies against all four viruses . Spik et al. (2008) reported that PUUV and HTNV DNA vaccines should serve as separate regulators. Both vaccines produced neutralizing antibodies when injected alone, but when they were administered as mixtures, only one of the two hantavirus antibodies could be detected. In contrast, if the DNA was administered to an animal as a separate vaccine, a reaction to both was observed. To improve the use of DNA vaccine, a multihead intradermal electroporation device was developed, which can be used to vaccinate with an increased dose of DNA vaccine to the skin.

The device will enable multiplasmid vaccine preparation to provide multiplasmid vaccine preparation without interference (Mackow et al., 2014) .

In China, a DNA vaccine targeting hantavirus Gn merges the antigen with lysosome-associated membrane protein 1 (LAMP 1), thereby changing the antigen presentation pathway and activating CD4 T cells. The LAMP 1 targeting strategy successfully enhanced the effectiveness of the HTNV Gn vaccine. Further studies showed that pVAX-LAMP/Gn established a memory response during long-term protection (6 months) in mice. Zhao et al. constructed a multi-epitope chimeric DNA vaccine-named the SHP chimeric gene, which contains 25 glycoprotein epitopes of SEOV, HTNV, and PUUV. The humoral and cellular responses were significantly enhanced in vaccinated BALB/c mice (Zhao et al., 2012) .

Subunit protein vaccines not only are safe and easy to produce but also do not easily cause interference between the components of a multivalent formulation Liang et al., 2018; Qu et al., 2018) . Because the N protein of hantavirus circulating in different continents can provide high cross-protection in animals, the N protein is considered to be an important part of a wide range of reactive vaccines against hantavirus infection (de Carvalho Nicacio et al., 2002) . Research has shown that recombinant nucleocapsid protein (rN) from PUUV, TOPV, ANDV, and DOBV could induce a cross-protective immune response to PUUV. The cross-reaction to PUUV antigen was the highest in the serum of animals immunized with ANDV rN, followed by that to TOPV and DOBV rN. In a proliferation test, T lymphocytes immunized with heterogenic rNs were effectively recalled by PUUV rN in vitro, as were animal T lymphocytes immunized with homologous proteins (de Carvalho Nicacio et al., 2002) . In addition, recombinant vaccinia virus carrying PUUV N or the first half of the G2 gene was constructed. Detection and cloning of PUUV-specific CTLs from PBMCs of patients with NE by recombinant PUUV vaccinia virus led to the isolation of an HLA-A24-restricted CTL cell line recognizing the G2 protein, and its 9-mer epitope was determined (Terajima et al., 2002) . Razanskiene et al. (2004) reported that the stability and high purity of NP of PUUV, DOBV, and HTNV ranged from 0.5 to 1.5 mg/g wet weight of yeast cells. DOBV rN protein is a promising vaccine candidate protein that can induce N-specific antibodies, and its terminal titer is as high as 1:1,000,000 in C57BL/6 mice. The antibody induced by DOBV rN protein has a high cross-reaction with rN protein of PUUV and HTNV . It was found that there might be RNA fragment exchange between the two PUUV strains. N-linked glycosylation occurred at one site of Gn (N 142, N357, and N409) and GC (N 937), and a possible O-glycosylation site was identified in GC (T 985). The study of coding gene products is of great significance for the design of new vaccines (Johansson et al., 2004) . Schmidt et al. (2005) reports that NP of SEOV reacts with SEOV-specific monoclonal antibodies and some HTNV-and PUUV cross-reactive monoclonal antibodies. Rabbits immunized with recombinant NP can induce a high-titer antibody response, and NP-specific antibodies were detected in the serum of experimental infected rats and human exposed to hantavirus from different geographical sources. Yeast-expressed SEOV N protein represents a promising antigen for serological epidemiological research and vaccine development (Schmidt et al., 2005) . Antoniukas et al. (2006) reported that the biomass and the expression level of recombinant PUUV NP were increased by adding plant extract to YNB medium. The maximum volume yield of the N protein was 316 mg L −1 (Antoniukas et al., 2006) (Table 2 , part 2).

Virus-like particle vaccines are similar to natural virus particles but lack infectious genetic material. They are composed of repetitive viral structural proteins with inherent self-assembly characteristics (Yong et al., 2019) . How to improve the immunogenicity of VLPs is very important. It was reported that either CD40L-or GM-CSF-contained HTNV VLP expression in sf9 insect cells or CHO cells (Ying et al., 2016) could enhance the activation of macrophages and dendritic cells. CD40L/GM-CSF incorporation into VLPs induced elevated levels of HTNV-specific antibodies and neutralizing antibodies in mice. The spleen cells of immunized mice had an enhanced ability to secrete IFN-γ and IL-2, increasing CTL activity . The GM-CSF and CD40L-containing VLPs expressed in a eukaryotic expression vector had a stable, long-term protective effect, with a high titer of neutralizing antibody, on mice within 6 months after immunization (Dong et al., 2019) . These results suggest that CD40L/GM-CSF-containing VLPs can be used as a potential candidate vaccine ( 

Hantaviruses primarily infect host capillary endothelial cells of various organs, especially those of kidneys and lungs, and could spark robust immune response in humans. The basic pathological feature of both old world hantaviruses causing HFRS and new world hantaviruses leading to HCPS is dramatically increased vascular permeability, the pathogenesis of which is highly involved in viral infection and excessive immune responses of the host. Extensive capillary leakage results in multiple clinical manifestations, such as hypotensive shock in HFRS and noncardiogenic pulmonary edema in HCPS, which might deteriorate into multisystem organ failure. Currently, there are no approved post-exposure therapeutic countermeasures against hantaviral infection, but diversified treatment strategies, which target the viral life cycle, host immunological factors or patient clinical symptoms, have been developed and applied to manage HFRS or HCPS (see Table 3 ). Virus-targeting antivirals, including classical antiviral drugs, antibodies, or novel small molecules, are tested mainly to block hantavirus entry or restrain virus replication. Although several antivirals have been proven to be protective in vitro or in vivo, there still exist some problems for their clinical application. Host-targeting medicines are designed to improve vascular function or rebuild immune homeostasis, while their curative effects are still under debate. Supportive care is universally applied for HFRS or HCPS, and the specific treatments depend on clinical findings of different disease phases.

The viral entry process is composed of virus attachment or absorption on susceptible cells, penetration and subsequent uncoating, which is the first step for hantaviral life cycle. Neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) could interact with viral envelope proteins and disturb their binding with receptors on host cells, thus blocking viral attachment. During hantavirus infection, the Gn and Gc glycoproteins, but not nucleocapsid proteins (NP) are considered the major antigens in inducing NAb production (Jiang et al., 2016) . High levels of NAbs could be detected in the convalescent phase of HFRS or HCPS patients, and these NAbs could protect the individual from hantaviral infection and have been used as passive immunotherapy (Manigold and Vial, 2014; Jiang et al., 2016) . Presently, there are no reported clinical randomized controlled trials using NAbs in immunotherapy for HFRS or HCPS in humans. Most studies measure antibody efficacy through the focus reduction neutralization test (FRNT) and hemagglutination inhibition (HI) test at the cellular level, as well as animal experiments against lethal hantavirus challenge (sucking mice or newborn rat models for HTNV or SEOV infection and hamster models for ANDV or SNV infection) (Zhang et al., 1989; Xu et al., 2002; Manigold and Vial, 2014) . For old world hantaviruses, 13 crude Fab preparations directed to the PUUV Gc protein were generated from splenic lymphocytes of a PUUV-immune individual and exhibited type-specific neutralization of PUUV, with a 44-54% reduction in FRNT (de Carvalho Nicacio et al., 2000) . Anti-SR-11 (SEOV) rat serum applied 4 h before or 72 h after the challenge could protect against lethal SR-11 (SEOV) infection in newborn rats, and cross-protection effects were also found against KI-262 (SEOV) and 76-118 (HTNV) (Zhang et al., 1989) . In China, 18 murine monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) targeting HTNV were prepared in our lab, among which 14 targeted NP, 4 reacted with Gc, and 1 recognized both NP and Gc. The Gc-related MAbs were active in the HI test and displayed high virus-neutralizing activity in vitro, and they could be regarded as HTNV NAbs. Consistently, administration of these NAbs within 48 hpi could protect suckling mice from lethal HTNV infection, indicating that NAbs might be a potentially treatment strategy for preexposure prophylaxis and postexposure therapy against HTNV infection (Xu et al., 2002) . Phase I clinical pharmacology and toxicity tests for HTNV NAbs in healthy volunteers were performed, and phase II clinical trials to assess the therapeutic efficacy of these NAbs in early stages of HFRS were carried out in endemic settings in China (Xu et al., 2002 (Xu et al., , 2009 . For new world hantaviruses, passive immunization with either patient-derived or vaccine-induced NAbs was capable of protecting against lethal ANDV challenge in hamsters (Manigold and Vial, 2014) . A non-randomized multicenter trial using plasma from HCPS convalescent patients for the treatment of acute HCPS has been carried out in Chile, showing that plasma containing high titers of NAbs against ANDV could significantly reduce case fatality rate from 32 to 14% (Vial et al., 2015) . Considering the limited availability of convalescent plasma from HCPS survivors, goose polyclonal antibodies were acquired from ANDV DNA vaccine, and the purified IgY/IgY Fc from egg yolks could protect hamsters from lethal ANDV infection. Recently, two NAbs, JL16 and MIB22, were developed from the ANDV GP-specific memory B cells of convalescent HCPS patients, both of which reached in a 100% protection rate against lethal ANDV challenge (Garrido et al., 2018) . Although NAbs from convalescent patient or immunized animals could obviously restrain hantaviral infection and improve disease outcome, purified human or humanized NAbs against hantaviruses with increased security and efficacy should be developed for clinical experiments. Additionally, research on broadly neutralizing antibodies against hantaviruses is still lacking. Hantaviral attachment or absorption could also be restrained by lactoferin (LF), an iron-binding glycoprotein that was reported to have broad antibacterial, antifungal, and antiviral activities. LF-pretreated Vero E6 cells showed a reduced number of SR-11 (SEOV) foci, while its antiviral effects were obviously compromised if the LF-pretreated cell monolayer was washed before SEOV infection (Murphy et al., 2000) . Further, LF could suppress viral shedding within 24 hpi, the effectiveness of which failed after 48 hpi (Murphy et al., 2001) . These results indicated that LF might adhere to cell surface and inhibit SEOV adsorption to host cells. Intriguingly, although LF could not inhibit the expression of NP and Gc, once hantaviral amplification was established in cells, LF contributed to higher survival rates, which might be due to LF-enhanced cytocidal function of natural killer (NK) cells (Murphy et al., 2001) . Even so, the specific mechanisms of how LF inhibits SEOV absorption and influences host immune responses, as well as the effects of LF on other species of hantaviruses, remain obscure.

Hantaviral fusion with cell membrane facilitates its entry process. The Hantavirus Gc envelope glycoprotein acts as a viral fusion protein that is essential for viral entry. It has been demonstrated that Gc shares similar features with class II fusion proteins, which means that three domains of viral fusion proteins are connected by a stem region anchoring in the viral envelope (Cifuentes-Munoz et al., 2011) . Exogenous protein fragments containing fusion protein domain III (DIII) and the stem region could bind to the core of the fusion protein and interfere with its conformation transition, inhibiting the membrane fusion process. Based on this effect, soluble recombinant peptides that mimic DIII and the stem region were prepared, and were proven to block both ANDV and PUUV infection in Vero E6 cells by blocking membrane fusion (Barriga et al., 2016) . The strategy using viral Gc DIII and stem fragments to suppress fusion might be feasible for other hantaviruses, while the protective effects in vivo still need further studies to confirm.

Furthermore, antivirals targeting hantaviral receptors have been synthesized. It has been demonstrated that pathogenic hantaviruses attach to the cell surface via host-specific α IIb β 3 orα v β 3 integrins while non-pathogenic hantaviruses initiate cellular entry relying on α v β 1 integrins (Jiang et al., 2016) . Based on the structure of cyclic peptides known to bind the α v β 3 receptor, a few of cyclic peptides or small molecules were designed and screened for their antihantaviral function. The cyclic nonapeptides CLVRNLAWC and CQATTARNC could inhibit SNV and ANDV infection in vitro (Hall et al., 2008) . After two rounds of biological screening, the peptidomimetic compounds 8012-0652, C481-1256, and G319-0078 were screened out with potency in the nanomolar range against infection of a panel of hantaviruses, including SNV, ANDV, and HTNV (Hall et al., 2010) . Further studies should be performed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of these small molecules in vivo.

Viral proteins are the working molecules for viral biosynthesis, among which RdRp plays an important role in hantaviral transcription and replication and is considered a desirable drug target. The pyrazine derivative Favipiravir and the nucleoside analogs Ribavirin (RBV) and ETAR have been tested effective antihantaviral drugs that directly or indirectly affect the biological function of RdRp. Favipiravir (Avigan; T-705) was initially discovered in 2002 as an antiviral drug selectively inhibiting the RdRp of influenza virus and then reported to have a high activity against a panel of Bunyaviruses (Gowen et al., 2007; Westover et al., 2016) . Favipiravir could attenuate the viral RNA replication level and decrease the progeny virus yield of SNV and ANDV in vitro. In vivo studies, including non-lethal SNV challenged and lethal ANDV challenged hamster model, demonstrated that oral administration favipiravir at the dosage of 100 mg/kg twice daily could prominently reduce viral load in hamster serum and various organs and resulted in 100% survival in the ANDV lethal infection model (Safronetz et al., 2013) . Delayed favipiravir administration after the onset of viremia exerted no protective effects against ANDV infection. Notably, there is no reported clinical trial with favipiravir as an antiviral treatment in HFRS and HCPS.

RBV and ETAR are nucleoside analogs that interfere with viral replication. They can inhibit inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase and reduce the synthesis GTP de novo, hence affecting the function of viral RdRp. As a potent mutagen, RBV could induce RNA mutagenesis in subsequent generations of HTNV virions (Chung et al., 2013) , while it is not expected that ETAR induces mutation, probably due to the lack of pseudobase pair presence (Chung et al., 2008) . Additionally, RBV was reported to modulate host immune responses by suppressing interleukin-10-producing regulatory T cells (Kobayashi et al., 2012) , while there is no evidence showing that ETAR could exert immunoregulatory effects (Szabo, 2017) . Both in vitro and in vivo antihantaviral activity of RBV and ETAR have been confirmed by a series of studies. For HFRS therapy, RBV-treated suckling mice had a higher survival rate upon HTNV infection than the placebo control group (Huggins et al., 1986) . In China, a double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial enrolled 242 HFRS patients caused by HTNV infection. The result showed that postexposure administration of RBV could decrease mortality by sevenfold and reduce the risk of entering the oliguric phase, suggesting that RBV is effective against HTNV-induced HFRS (Huggins et al., 1991) . However, a clinical trial for HFRS caused by PUUV infection in Russia showed that RBV could not improve patient condition, especially reducing viral load, and that RBV could increase the occurrence of side effects of RBV, including rash, sinus bradycardia, hyperbilirubinemia, and reduced hemoglobin. These data suggested insufficient efficacy and safety of RBV in the treatment of HFRS caused by PUUV (Malinin and Platonov, 2017) . For HCPS treatment, two studies confirmed that RBV could protect hamsters from lethally intraperitoneal or intranasal ANDV challenge without toxicity, and even abbreviated treatment regimens from 7 days to 3 days worked if therapy commenced 1 day following virus challenge (Safronetz et al., 2011; Ogg et al., 2013) . Unfortunately, two clinical trials for the treatment of HCPS using RBV did not show any improvement in survival rates compared with those for patients during the same time frame or receiving placebo treatment. It is speculated that RBV treatment might be ineffective once HCPS progresses to the cardiopulmonary phase. ETAR showed an EC(50) value of 10 and 4.4 µmol/L for HTNV and ANDV in Vero E6 cells, respectively, which is much lower than its toxic dosage of 880 µmol/L (Chung et al., 2008) . Moreover, ETAR administration in sucking mice with a dosage of 12.5 or 25 mg/kg at 10 days post HTNV infection could significantly increase the survival rate from 10 to 25%, an effect equal to that of RBV (Chung et al., 2008) . To date, there were no studies on the antiviral activity of ETAR on other hantaviruses. Hantaviral NP could bind to an evolutionary conserved sequence at the 5 terminus of hantaviral genomic RNA. The interaction of NP with the viral genome could protect viral RNA from host recognition and degradation, facilitate the N-mediated viral RNA translation process, and help package the viral genome into nucleocapsids. Several compounds, namely, lead inhibitor K31, K34, and 103772, were reported to interrupt the NP-RNA interaction against SNV and ANDV infection. They could abrogate both viral RNA synthesis and translation without affecting the normal biological process of host cells, among which K31 showed antiviral activity similar to that of RBV (Salim et al., 2016) . However, K31 failed to affect the replication of HIV or adenovirus, demonstrating its selectivity for hantaviruses. Arbidol, an immunomodulator developed in Russia, was also found to protect against HTNV infection both in vivo and in vitro (Deng et al., 2009) .

Targeting viral RNAs is the most direct and effective way to curb hantaviral replication. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) directed against hantaviral genes could facilitate viral RNA clearance based on the RNA interfering (RNAi) mechanisms and has been tested as a potential antiviral strategy in vitro and in vivo. It has been demonstrated that siRNAs targeting the S, M, or L segment of ANDV could reduce viral replication in Vero E6 cells or human lung microvascular endothelial cells and that an S-targeted siRNA pool seemed to be more efficient in reducing viral transcription and replication than M-or L-targeted siRNA in Vero E6 cells. Importantly, these siRNAs could inhibit ANDV replication even if given after infection (Chiang et al., 2014) . Although siRNAs could effectively suppress hantavirus amplification in host cells most likely through promoting viral RNA clearance, their antiviral activity might be greatly compromised considering their poor biological stability and targeting ability in vivo. One strategy is to combine siRNAs targeting encoding sequences of HTNV genome with recombinant antibodies (3G1-Cκ-tP) recognizing HTNV Gc, which were applied by intraperitoneal injection in an HTNVinduced encephalitis mouse model. The result indicated that through combination, siRNAs could be specifically delivered to the HTNV-infected brain cells and protect against HTNV intracranial infection . On all accounts, novel delivery system should be developed to ensure the stability and selectivity of siRNAs, and the efficacy and safety of these systems remained unclear for the treatment of HFRS or HCPS.

Increased capillary leakage due to hantaviral infection is the basic pathogenic feature for both HFRS and HCPS. Therefore, treatment strategies improving microvascular endothelial cell function seem to be feasible in mitigating disease severity and reducing mortality (Alkharsah, 2018) . Hantavirus-disturbed vascular function is a multifactorial event whose complicated mechanisms still need to be elucidated, and two kinds of hypothesis have been developed. The vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) theory was first proposed and studied in depth. VEGF binding to VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2) could activate SFK (Src family kinases) signaling, which may result in dissociation, internalization, and degradation of VEcadherin. Altered expression and localization of VE-cadherin contributed to impaired barrier structure of adherent junctions, which could lead to incremental cellular permeability (Jiang et al., 2016) . It has been demonstrated HTNV or ANDV infection could disrupt the interaction of β3 integrin with VEGFR2 and induce VEGFR2 hyper phosphorylation, which may enhance the permeability of infected endothelial cells by sensitizing them to VEGF (Gavrilovskaya et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2012) . As increased VEGF content has been noted in the plasma of HFRS and HCPS patients and is closely related to disease severity in the acute phase (Bird et al., 2016; Pal et al., 2018) , it is feasible to repurpose those FDA-approved drugs targeting vasoactive mediators for use as hantaviral infection therapy. In line with this strategy, one study reported that the VEGFR2 kinase inhibitor, as well as SFK inhibitors, could obviously stabilize ANDV-induced endovascular permeability, among which the SFK inhibitors dasatinib and pazopanib blocked VE-cadherin dissociation by more 90% (Gorbunova et al., 2011) . Another study also indicated that application of vandetanib, a tyrosine-kinase inhibitor preventing VEGFR2 phosphorylation, before ANDV infection could delay animal lethality and increase total survival by 23% in ANDV-challenged hamsters (Bird et al., 2016) . In contrast, similar small molecules administered after the onset of viremia failed to protect hamsters from lethal ANDV challenge (Brocato and Hooper, 2019) . Moreover, some other small molecules, such as angiopoietin 1 (Ang-1) and sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P), were found to inhibit hantavirus-directed endothelial cell permeability in vitro (Gavrilovskaya et al., 2008) , while further research in vivo should be performed to confirm their efficacy.

Another promising theory is increased activation of the kinin-kallikrein system (KKS) during hantavirus infection. One study using a model with co-cultured endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cells demonstrated that activation of KKS and subsequent liberation of bradykinin (BK), but not VEGF, were mainly responsible for the dramatic increase in endothelial cell permeability after hantavirus infection (Taylor et al., 2013) . BK, a nonapeptide that binds BK type 2 receptor, could induce blood vessel dilatation and vascular permeability increase, resulting in collapsed blood pressure. Icatibant is a peptidomimetic drug that can block the interaction of BK with the BK type 2 receptor by binding to this receptor itself. One case reported that a 37-yearold male who once underwent splenectomy due to congenital spherocytosis manifested with severe capillary leakage syndrome caused by PUUV infection. With a single dose of icatibant, the condition of the patient stabilized, followed by gradual improvement and full recovery (Antonen et al., 2013) . Another case report also confirmed the efficient treatment of icatibant in a 67-year-old female HFRS patient (Laine et al., 2015) . These clinical data indicated that BK receptor antagonist might be a novel treatment strategy for hantavirus diseases. Nevertheless, it should also be noted that the foresaid two patients had spleen abnormalities, which might be related to the curative effect of icatibant. Clinical trials enrolling a large number of HFRS or HCPS patients should be performed to further identify the remedy effects of bradykinin receptor antagonists.

It is wildly accepted that HFRS and HCPS are caused by uncontrolled systemic inflammatory responses, in which multiple inflammatory cytokines, especially TNF-α, IL-8, and RANTES, contributed to disease progression (Manigold and Vial, 2014; Schonrich and Raftery, 2017) ; however, immunoregulation treatment in HFRS or HCPS is undesirable. A recent study with depletion of alveolar macrophages, which are considered the main resource for proinflammatory responses, could not prevent ANDV-caused pathogenesis in hamsters (Hammerbeck et al., 2016) . The immunomodulatory treatment of corticoids was firstly performed during the Korean war, but the case fatality rate was not improved (Sayer et al., 1955) . In Chile, a retrospective analysis suggested that a high dose of methylprednisolone could reduce mortality in 22 HCPS patients (Brocato and Hooper, 2019) . However, a double-blind clinical trial in Chile failed to observe a significantly improved outcome between methylprednisolone recipients and placebo recipients for HCPS. Similarly, another randomized prospective study did not show any benefit from corticosteroid treatment in HFRS patients (Qian et al., 1990) .

The initiation of careful observation and prompt but judicious supportive treatment is crucial to improve patient survival condition for both HFRS and HCPS (Sargianou et al., 2012) . It has been demonstrated that admission to the ICU and supportive treatment could greatly reduce the mortality rate of HFRS (Huggins et al., 1991) . In general, the treatment principle for HFRS patients is using intravenous hydration and electrolyte therapy to maintain physiological blood pressure. Platelet transfusions can be applied to reduce the mortality in patients with severe thrombocytopenia. Intermittent hemodialysis (IHD) is the first choice to improve uremia condition and rectify kidney dysfunction in patients with acute kidney injury. Continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) should be applied for those critical HFRS patients, especially when they have a complication, such as multi-organ injury pulmonary edema, or cerebropathy (Jiang et al., 2016) . Treatment of patients with HCPS should also be performed in the ICU with continuous cardiac monitoring and respiratory support. The palliative treatments for HCPS usually include mechanical ventilation, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, and hemofiltration (Sargianou et al., 2012) .

HFRS and HCPS caused by hantavirus infection are reemerging infectious diseases that greatly threaten global public health. At present, there are currently no US FDA-approved treatments or vaccines available; only the whole virus-inactivated vaccine against HTNV or SEOV is available in China and Korea. With the implementation of intervention measures, the incidence of hantavirus infections seems to have shown a decline in recent years. In China and Korea, the number of HFRS cases has been drastically reduced. But the vaccines elicit suboptimal immune responses, confer inadequate protection, and may cause safety concerns. In 2017, the recurrence of global outbreak of HFRS has drawn renewed attention to this old disease, which seriously threatens human health. HFRS in China was still a natural focal disease with relatively high morbidity and fatality, and its distribution and epidemic trends had also changed. Surveillance measures, together with prevention and control strategies, should be improved and strengthened to reduce HFRS infection in China. Therefore, the best solution is to develop a functional vaccine to prevent hantavirus infection. Among the three types of vaccines discussed above, only DNA vaccine candidates have progressed to clinical trials. Subunit protein vaccines not only are safe and easy to produce but also do not easily cause interference between the components of a multivalent formulation Liang et al., 2018; Qu et al., 2018) . To resolve the above problems, we propose to construct a universal genetic engineering novel subunit protein vaccine against HTNV and SEOV by combining bioinformatics methods, viral surface protein structure biology knowledge, and molecular biology tools. Antiviral treatment only works when applied during the early infection stage, possibly because uncontrolled immune responses occur and predominate the pathogenesis process post-acute infection. Immunomodulatory therapy hardly improves the patient survival rate, possibly because suppressed inflammatory responses inhibit prompt viral clearance and enhance virus-caused injury increase. Therefore, based on rapid supportive care, effectively combining antiviral treatment and immunomodulatory therapy is a potential strategy for HFRS and HPS. 3G1 and 3D8, the mice MAbs against HTNV developed by our team, have been used for HFRS treatment and the result indicated that application of 3G1 and 3D8 at early stage of disease could significantly improve the patient condition and increase survival rates, especially for those severe or critical HFRS patients (data unpublished). Hence, NAbs might be the most promising treatment for HFRS or HPS, and the effective humanized neutralizing antibodies should be further developed.

Moreover, it is universally acknowledged that type I IFN responses are essential for hosts to defend against hantaviral infection. Multiple IFN stimulated genes (ISG) were confirmed to have antihantaviral activity. The interferon-induced MxA protein, a GTPase with extensive antiviral activity, notably against influenza viruses, was reported to inhibit HTNV and PUUV replication in Vero cells (Frese et al., 1996) . The interferoninduced IFITM3 protein was able to inhibit HTNV infection in both HUVEC and A549 cells by inhibiting virus entry (Xu-Yang et al., 2016) . Several studies have shown that pretreatment with type I IFN could effectively inhibit hantaviral infection. Pretreating endothelial cells (ECs) with IFNα blocks hantavirus replication, and this inhibitory effect is still observed when IFNα is added to ECs within 12 hpi; however, the addition of IFNα 15-24 h after infection had little effect on hantavirus replication. Clinical data indicated that IFN treatment is only effective prophylactically or shortly after hantavirus infection. In fact, during the natural infection process, compared with nonpathogenic hantaviruses, pathogenic hantaviruses could inhibit host IFN production at an early infection stage, but the specific mechanism remains ambiguous. Our team recently found that HTNV could induce complete autophagy at an early phase, which promotes host MAVS degradation and disturbs RIG-I-MAVS signaling-mediated IFN production. The application of autophagy inhibitors, including 3-MA and CQ, could significantly enhance type I IFN responses and inhibit HTNV replication both in vitro and in vivo. We also demonstrated that lncRNA NEAT1 could positively regulate RIG-I-DDX60mediated IFN responses during HTNV infection and that overexpression of NEAT1 could restrain HTNV amplification both in vitro and in vivo. These results suggest that enhancing host IFN responses during the early infection phase may be a novel therapeutic strategy for HFRS and HCPS, while there is still much work to be done to translate basic medicine research to clinical practice.

molecules Pharmacological and Biological Antiviral Therapeutics for Cardiac Coxsackievirus Infections,"Subtype B coxsackieviruses (CVB) represent the most commonly identified infectious agents associated with acute and chronic myocarditis, with CVB3 being the most common variant. Damage to the heart is induced both directly by virally mediated cell destruction and indirectly due to the immune and autoimmune processes reacting to virus infection. This review addresses antiviral therapeutics for cardiac coxsackievirus infections discovered over the last 25 years. One group represents pharmacologically active low molecular weight substances that inhibit virus uptake by binding to the virus capsid (e.g., pleconaril) or inactivate viral proteins (e.g., NO-metoprolol and ribavirin) or inhibit cellular proteins which are essential for viral replication (e.g., ubiquitination inhibitors). A second important group of substances are interferons. They have antiviral but also immunomodulating activities. The third and most recently discovered group includes biological and cellular therapeutics. Soluble receptor analogues (e.g., sCAR-Fc) bind to the virus capsid and block virus uptake. Small interfering RNAs, short hairpin RNAs and antisense oligonucleotides bind to and led to degradation of the viral RNA genome or cellular RNAs, thereby preventing their translation and viral replication. Most recently mesenchymal stem cell transplantation has been shown to possess antiviral activity in CVB3 infections. Taken together, a number of antiviral therapeutics has been developed","Myocarditis is defined as a subclinical inflammation of the heart muscle and may be induced by infectious, toxic or immunologic agents. Among the different infectious pathogens viruses are the most common causes of myocarditis [1] and serological studies, nucleic-acid hybridization and PCR-based studies of endomyocardial biopsy and autopsy specimens have shown that enteroviruses represent one of the most common groups of viruses detected in the myocardium [2] . Although myocarditis is a frequent disease, it often goes unrecognized. Based on more than 12,500 randomly selected routine autopsies performed over a 10 year period about 1% of the population were found to have lymphocytic myocarditis [3] . In most cases myocarditis is detected in the group of young adults between the ages of 20 and 39 [4] .

Coxsackieviruses belong to the family Picornaviridae and the genus enterovirus. The viruses have a positive-stranded RNA genome of about 7.4 kb encoding a monocistronic polyprotein [5] which is processed into mature peptides during translation by viral proteases [6] . Four capsid proteins (VP1 to VP4) and seven nonstructural proteins (2A, 2B, 2C, 3A, 3B, 3C, and 3D) are found during coxsackievirus infection of cells [7] . Based on different organ tropism and differences in organ damage observed in mice, coxsackieviruses can be classified into two groups. The group A coxsackieviruses (CVA) has 23 members, whereas the group B coxsackieviruses (CVB) has only six members [8, 9] . Coxsackieviruses commonly induce mild disease, but under some circumstances, which seem to depend on genetic and individual predispositions, the viruses overcome local host defenses and can induce severe infections of the heart, pancreas, and brain [9] . The CVB group includes serotypes, in particular CVB3, that are frequently associated with infections of the heart. The course of CVB3 heart infections in patients may be different. Typically CVB3 induces acute myocardial infections and, in most cases, patients undergo a complete recovery. Fulminant infections, however, can occur and can result in sudden death. If the virus cannot be eliminated by host immune defense mechanisms, a persistant CVB3 infection and dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), one of the leading causes for heart transplantation, can be developed. The incidence of enteroviral infections in the hearts of patients with myocarditis and DCM is variable but infection rates of up to 40% have been observed [2, 10, 11] . Although DCM has multiple causes, there is evidence that 30% of DCM patients are infected with enteroviruses [12, 13] .

The pathogenic mechanisms of CVB3 induced myocarditis are yet not fully understood. That enteroviruses play an active role in development of myocarditis in humans, especially in fulminant and acute courses of infections, is supported by detection of enteroviral replicative intermediates (minus-strand enteroviral RNA) in 50% of patients with left ventricular dysfunction and suspected clinical myocarditis [10] . In contrast, in patients with idiopathic DCM and chronic coronary disease (CCD), representing end-stage cardiac diseases, 36% and 33% of the patients were positive for enterovirus genomes, but only a small percentage (6.5%) of them had an active enteroviral replication in the myocardium. Moreover, no fully replicative virus could be isolated from myocardium of the patients [14] . In chronic heart infections, coxsackieviruses persist in a latent form and animal models have shown that virus persistence can result from production of stable double-stranded RNA [15] or is associated with deletions in the 5'-non-translated region of the viral genome [16] . Based on these observations, it was important to determine whether replication deficient coxsackievirus variants are able to induce DCM. To prove this Wessely et al. generated transgenic mice that expressed a replication restricted CVB3 cDNA exclusively in the heart. These animals expressed the coxsackieviral genomes in their cardiomyocytes at low-level without forming infectious virus particles. Histopathological analysis of transgenic hearts revealed typical morphologic features of myocardial interstitial fibrosis and degeneration of myocytes, resembling DCM in humans. Functionally these changes were accompanied by decreased systolic functions and excitation-contraction coupling abnormalities similar to pressure overload models of DCM [17] . Thus, this study confirmed that non-replicative coxsackieviruses are sufficient to induce DCM.

Studies in in vitro and in vivo models carried out over the last 25 years have contributed significantly to elucidating important aspects of the molecular pathogenic mechanisms of the cardiac coxsackievirus infection. Based on these studies, it is clear that both direct virus induced injury as well as immune and autoimmune mechanisms triggered by viral infection are involved in development of coxsackievirus induced myocarditis [18, 19] . The impact of direct virus induced cytotoxicity is supported by the fact that CVB3 RNA is detected at all stages of CVB3 heart infections [20] and that the virus replication correlates with negative clinical outcome, suggesting that continued replication of the virus is involved in the progression of the disease [21] . Furthermore, it has been shown that enterovirus induced cytotoxicity is directly related to expression of viral proteins. CVB3 expresses two viral proteases, 2A and 3C. Both can induce apoptosis through activation of the extrinsic caspase-8-mediated pathway and the intrinsic mitochondria-mediated apoptosis pathway [22] . The protease 2A also cleaves the eukaryotic translation initiation factors (eIFs) eIF4GI and eIF4GII, leading to cessation of host protein synthesis [23, 24] and is able to cleave dystrophin in CVB3 infected cultured myocytes and in infected mouse hearts [25, 26] . The latter is thought to play a role in release of the virus from the myocyte [27] since viral infection is increased in the absence of dystrophin [28] . More importantly, impaired dystrophin functions lead to the disruption of the extra-sarcomeric cytoskeleton and loss of transmission of mechanical force to the extracellular matrix [29, 30] which seem to be important factors contributing to the development of DCM [31] [32] [33] [34] .

Although therapeutic approaches aiming at modulation or inhibition of the immune system, such as immunoglobulin therapy, immunoabsoption or specific antibody therapy hold also promise for the treatment of myocardial enteroviral infections [35] [36] [37] , this review will focus on direct pharmacological and biological therapies targeting specific points of the virus replication cycle to inhibit coxsackievirus-induced myocarditis.

Infection and replication of any virus, including CVB3, starts with interaction of the virus and its cellular receptor on the host cell, and ends with the release of viral progeny. Every step during this life cycle is a potential target for inhibiting viral infection. Based on their targets, pharmacologically active low molecular weight substances that are able to selectively inhibit the replication of coxsackieviruses can be divided into three groups. The first group consists of small molecules witch interfere with the viral capsid and prevent attachment/internalization or uncoating of the virion in the host cell. Substances of the second group inhibit viral replication by directly interfering with viral proteins and those of the third group interact with cellular proteins which play an important role in viral replication.

The first essential step of viral infection is the interaction of the viral capsid with the receptor on the surface of the host cell. Coxsackievirus capsids are assembled from 60 identical protomers, each composed of the four structural proteins VP1-VP4. The viral shell is formed by VP1 to VP3, and VP4 lies on the inner surface and establishes a connection between the capsid and the RNA genome [7] .

The surface of the virion shows a five-fold axis of symmetry, surrounded by a large depression termed the ""canyon"" which contains a hydrophobic pocket [38] . The coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptor (CAR) is the primary receptor of CVB [39, 40] and its binding to the pocket on the canyon floor of CVB mediates the internalization of the virus into the host cell [41] .

Several drugs have been developed that selectively inhibit the interaction of CVB with CAR. The WIN compounds are antiviral drugs interacting with the hydrophobic pocket at the bottom of the canyon [42] ( Figure 1 ). They were discovered initially by the Sterling-Winthrop Research Institute and first used for inhibition of rhinovirus infections [43] . These small molecules inhibit interaction of the virion with the cellular receptor molecule and thus prevent virus binding to the target cell receptors [44] . Furthermore, binding of specific WIN molecules in the pocket results in an increase in protein rigidity and stabilizes the entire viral capsid against enzymatic degradation so that uncoating and release of viral RNA into the cytoplasm is prevented [45] [46] [47] . In the last 25 years many WIN based drugs have been tested regarding their inhibitory effects against different members of the picornavirus family such as rhinovirus [48] , poliovirus [49] , echovirus [50] , and enterovirus [51] . WIN 54954, a broad-spectrum anti-picornaviral drug, was one of the first WIN compounds to be clinically tested. Its effectiveness against human rhinovirus, echovirus 9 and also enterovirus infections has been shown in vitro and in vivo [51] [52] [53] [54] . In vitro studies demonstrated that WIN 54954 can reduce picornavirus titers by 1 to 2 orders of magnitude [51, 52] . In vivo administration in mice experimentally infected with CVB3 led to a reduction of the proportion of cardiomyocytes containing viral RNA by about 90% and significantly inhibited cardiomyocyte apoptosis [55] . Moreover, administration of the drug resulted in complete protection against mortality of CVB3 in infected mice [56] . The latter study revealed that a strong decrease of virus induced mortality occurred when the treatment was started concomitant with CVB3 infection. When onset of therapy was delayed for one day, 85% survival was observed, whereas in the non-treatment group no animal survived, demonstrating significant, if no longer complete, protection from the virus. A therapeutic effect was still notable when treatment was initiated 4 days after virus inoculation [57] . Thus WIN 54954 therapy was almost fully effective within 24 hours after CVB3 infection, but the beneficial effect declined over time [57] . WIN 54954 treatment did not, however, abrogate the inflammatory reaction in the myocardium in CVB3 infected animals [55, 56] . As shown in a phase 1 clinical trial against rhinovirus infections and in a myocarditis model of mice infected with coxsackievirus A9, low doses of WIN 54954 were well tolerated [53, 58] . At higher doses of 100 to 200 mg/kg/day, however, neurological toxicity was observed in the murine myocarditis model in vivo [53] . Moreover, the compound is rapidly metabolized and induces reversible hepatitis, which made this compound uninteresting for further studies in the end [59] . WIN 63843 (pleconaril) represents a novel, orally available, systemically-acting compound of the WIN series with a high oral bio-availability and long plasma half-life. The compound has a broad spectrum of antiviral activity against clinical isolates and prototypic strains of enteroviruses, including CVB1-CVB5, in vitro [60, 61] . Pleconaril has been more extensively evaluated in clinical studies than any other anti-picornavirus drug and shows clear efficacy in the treatment of various picornavirus-associated illnesses, whereas side effects are rare [4, [62] [63] [64] . In one study Rotbart et al. investigated the therapeutic response after pleconaril treatment in a follow up study in 38 patients with potentially life-threatening enterovirus infections. About 80% of the patients had a clinical response temporally associated with pleconaril therapy and to a similar degree patients showed virological, laboratory and radiological responses [4] . Clinical trials, however, revealed that therapeutic efficacy of pleconaril depends on the virus species targeted. A significant therapeutic effect was apparent during treatment of rhinovirus and several enterovirus infections [59, 65, 66] . In 2002 the Federal Drug Administration (FDA) of the USA declined to approve pleconaril for treatment of the common cold, as the panel remained unconvinced about the drug's safety profile [67] . Pleconaril has not yet been used in clinical trials explicitly for the treatment of enterovirus induced myocarditis. In vivo studies carried out by Pevear et al., however, demonstrated an efficient antiviral efficacy of the compound in enterovirus induced mouse myocarditis. Mice showed reduced mortality and a reduction of the CVB3 titer in the heart by about 4 to 7 orders of magnitude [60] .

Several studies demonstrated naturally occurring mutants resistant to pleconaril and, moreover, pleconaril treatment seems to result in rapid emergence of resistant CVB3 mutants [68, 69] . Such mutants predominantly contain a single amino acid substitution, Ile-1092 Leu/Met in the hydrophobic pocket of the canyon which prevents efficient binding of the compound, while it does not impair binding of the virus to cellular receptors [69] . In order to overcome virus resistance, new pleconaril derivatives have recently been synthesized and successfully tested against pleconaril-resistant mutants [70] .

In the last few years several additional new drugs have been developed which are functionally similar to the WIN compounds and have good antiviral efficacy against rhinovirus infection but less activity against coxsackievirus infections [71] . Thus, the search for more potent, highly bio-available compounds with a broad antiviral spectrum and high efficacy goes on.

The second class of picornavirus inhibitors comprises drugs that interfere with viral proteins during replication. These compounds interact with non-structural proteins, viral proteases or the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and thereby inhibit viral replication in infected cells. A series of compounds, such guanidine hypochloride, HBB, MRL-1237 and TBZE-029 interact with the viral protein 2C, resulting in inhibition of the viral RNA synthesis and leading to protection of cells from virus-induced cell lysis [71, 72] (Figure 2 ). Their antiviral activity against coxsackieviruses was only investigated in in vitro experiments. These experiments, however, revealed that a single mutation in the viral 2C protein is sufficient to confer resistance against the antiviral treatment [71] . Nitric oxide (NO) donors form another class of molecules which interfere with the functions of viral non-structural proteins ( Figure 2 ). They inhibit enterovirus proteases 2A and 3C by S-nitrosylation [73, 74] . Both proteases are involved in host cell shut-off and lead to the development of the cytopathic effects [75] [76] [77] . The NO donors GTN and ISDN are able to inhibit coxsackievirus proteases and induce a significant antiviral effect in vitro. Furthermore, GTN significantly reduced signs of myocarditis after administration by decreasing immune cell infiltration and virus-induced fibrosis up to day 14 post-infection (p.i.) [78] . In another study the NO-donor was NO-metoprolol, a novel NO-releasing derivative of the β1-selective adrenergic receptor agonist metoprolol. It has been shown that metoprolol improves the survival, remodeling, fibrosis and left ventricular systolic function in a knock-in mouse model for inherited dilated cardiomyopathy [79] . In the CVB3 myocarditis mouse model treatment with NO-metoprolol displays an enhanced therapeutic benefit compared to metoprolol, with significant reduction of viral RNA copy numbers, body weight loss, infiltration and fibrosis score [80] .

Several nucleoside analogues were analyzed with respect to their anti-picornaviral potency. The most intensively studied drug is ribavirin, a synthetic nucleoside, structurally related to inosine and guanosine. When ribavirin is incorporated into viral RNA it induces mutations that can be lethal for the virus (Figure 2 ). It has been shown that ribavirin has a broad antiviral activity against several RNA viruses in vivo, e.g., RSV, measles, lassa, and hepatitis C viruses [81] [82] [83] . In vitro activity of ribavirin against enteroviruses has been demonstrated by several groups [84] [85] [86] , and treatment of murine CVB3 myocarditis led to significantly decreased myocardial virus titer, inflammation, necrosis and myocardial calcification [86] . One side effect of ribavirin treatment, however, is hemolytic anemia [87] , so ribavirin may be contraindicated in patients with acute and chronic myocarditis. In a further study, Harki et al. synthesized cytidine analogues and evaluated them for antiviral activity. One of the tested molecules, a 5-nitrocytidine, decreased viral titer in CVB3 infected cells with 12-fold higher efficiency than ribavirin, but so far the results of in vivo studies, if any, have not been reported [88] .

A third group of antiviral drugs includes molecules which interact with cellular proteins and thereby interfere with viral replication. Several studies have shown that ubiquitination is required for effective replication of different viruses, among them coxsackievirus [89] [90] [91] . The ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) is a major intracellular pathway for protein degradation, with over 80% of cellular proteins being recycled through this pathway. UPS thus plays a key role in the regulation of a variety of fundamental cellular processes, such as signal transduction, cell cycle regulation, apoptosis, antigen processing, transcriptional regulation and DNA repair [92] [93] [94] . In the last few years several inhibitory substances targeting the UPS were analyzed for their ability to inhibit coxsackievirus infections ( Figure 2 ). Pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC) and curcumin, a natural polyphenolic compound extracted from Curcuma longa, reduced coxsackieviral RNA synthesis, protein expression and progeny release up to 170-fold and 20-fold, respectively, in vitro [95, 96] . Other UPS-inhibitors, the peptide-aldehyde MG132 and lactacystin, reduced CVB3 infectivity in the murine cardiomyocyte cell line HL-1 and increased cell viability [90] . Treatment of CVB3 infected mice with the proteasome inhibitor MLN353, however, resulted in an only slight decrease of viral-induced mortality and myocardial injury. Significant inhibition of viral replication in the heart was not detectable [97] . Although UPS inhibitors may be potential therapeutic tools for treatment coxsackievirus infection their relatively low efficiency and possible drug-induced side effects may limit their use for treatment of coxsackievirus infections in humans.

In summary, over the last 25 years many pharmacologically active low molecular weight substances have been developed, concomitant with the improvement of our knowledge of picornavirus structure and replication cycle. Adverse properties in bio-availability and safety of these drugs, rapid development of escape mutants and, in part, low efficacy currently limits their use in treatment of myocardial coxsackieviral infections in humans.

Interferons (IFNs) belong to the group of the cytokines and have antiviral and immunomodulating activities. Suspected from early investigations demonstrating the release of cytokines from CVB3 infected human monocytes [98] , the role of IFNs in CVB3 infections became obvious when IFN-β knockout mice proved to be highly susceptible to CVB3 infections and developed a breakdown and disruption of cardiomyocytes [99] .

In vivo and in vitro studies demonstrated the antiviral efficacy of IFN treatment for coxsackievirus infections of the heart. Heim et al. showed antiviral activity of recombinant IFN-β and IFN-γ and ribavirin and natural human IFN-α co-treatment in a CVB3 carrier state infection of cultured human myocardial fibroblasts in vitro [85, 100] . In another study, Wang et al. confirmed antiviral and cardio-protective efficacy of murine IFN-β and IFN-α 2 in an CVB3 induced mice myocarditis model in vivo [101] . The potency of IFNs for treatment of myocardial enteroviral infections in humans was demonstrated several years ago. Twenty-two patients with entero-or adenoviral myocardial persistence were treated with IFN-β over a period of six months. Enteroviral genomes were eliminated from all patients. The viral clearance was paralleled by a significant decrease of left ventricular end diastolic and end systolic diameters of the heart and by an improvement of left ventricular function. Moreover, IFN-β was well tolerated in this study. Patients only showed flu-like side effects during the first 3 weeks of IFN-β treatment that could be efficiently suppressed by non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Further investigations of the therapeutic potential of IFN-β are currently being carried out in an ongoing multicenter randomized Betaferon ® (Bayer Schering Pharma AG) study in patients with chronic viral cardiomyopathy (BICC study) [102] .

Antisense approaches have proven to be promising strategies to inhibit viruses. Conventional antisense oligonucleotides are single-stranded molecules composed of DNA monomers and modified variants thereof. These antisense oligonucleotides bind to a complementary (virus) RNA and prevent its translation or induce its degradation by RNase H [103] . The only antisense oligonucleotide that has been approved by the regulatory authorities to date is fomivirsen, a phosphorothioate-modified DNA oligonucleotide which was used to treat retinitis induced by cytomegalovirus, but was discontinued since the drug's market shrank [104] .

Antisense oligonucleotides have also been considered as novel tools to inhibit CVB3. In an initial screening, seven antisense oligonucleotides were designed to target the 5' and 3' UTR of CVB3 and evaluated with respect to their antiviral activity in HeLa cells [105] . Phosphorothioate-modified oligodeoxynucleotides were used that are resistant to degradation by cellular nucleases. Efficient virus inhibition was achieved with antisense oligonucleotides directed against either of the two untranslated regions. The most efficient antisense molecule targeting the 3' UTR was subsequently used to inhibit CVB3 in HL-1 cells and in vivo [106] . This antisense oligonucleotide strongly inhibited viral RNA and protein synthesis in cell culture and its intravenous administration into A/J mice decreased the viral titer by 0.5 log 10 . To improve the in vivo delivery, a cell-penetrating arginine-rich peptide was conjugated to a morpholino oligomer [107] . Since morpholino oligomers do not induce RNase H cleavage of the target RNA, their mechanism of action is based on a steric blockade of the target RNA function. Intravenous administration of the oligomer once prior to and once after CVB3 infection resulted in an enhanced, approximately 2 order of magnitude decrease in viral titer and in significantly less damage to cardiac tissue.

A decade ago short double-stranded RNA molecules were found to efficiently inhibit gene expression in mammalian cells [108] . These so-called small or short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) are usually 21 nucleotides in length, 19 of which form a duplex. After introduction into cells, siRNAs elicit efficient induction of post transcriptional gene silencing known as RNA interference (RNAi). They are incorporated into a multimeric protein complex named RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). While one of the two RNA strands is discarded, the antisense strand guides RISC to the complementary target RNA and induces its endonucleolytic cleavage (Figure 3) . Comparative studies revealed a significantly higher efficacy of RNAi compared to the application of antisense oligonucleotides [109] . The RNAi approach can either be directed against the virus itself or against the virus's receptor, whose silencing will prevent virus entry into the cell.

The duration of gene silencing mediated by siRNAs is limited to a few days at most. Therefore, an alternative approach was developed to express self-complementary short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) intracellularly. These shRNAs are exported from the nucleus and processed into siRNAs, which can then be incorporated into RISC as described above. In addition, the shRNA strategy opens up the possibility of delivering expression cassettes into the target cells by viral vectors. The most commonly used vectors are based on retroviruses (including lentiviruses), adenoviruses and adeno-associated viruses (AAV) [110] .

Soon after its discovery, RNAi was considered a novel option to treat viral infections. Successful RNAi applications have been reported for most classes of medically relevant viruses including HIV-1, HBV, HCV, SARS-coronavirus, influenza virus und poliovirus [111, 112] . Some of these approaches have already reached the stage of clinical testing. While RNAi-mediated therapies against HIV-1 and HBV are based on shRNA expression systems [113] , the most advanced clinical phase II trial makes use of chemically synthesized siRNAs against RSV, which are administered by a nasal spray [114] .

Because of the highly efficient nature of RNAi, it comes as no surprise that RNAi has been evaluated as novel strategy to inhibit CVB3 [115] [116] [117] [118] [119] [120] . All of the initial studies showed that only siRNAs against the coding region of the virus genome revealed significant antiviral activity, but not those against the untranslated regions. In order to investigate the mechanism of RNAi-mediated inhibition of CVB3 in more detail, siRNAs were intentionally designed to target either the viral plus strand or the minus strand or both [121] . This study provided clear evidence that silencing of the viral plus-strand is the key to inhibit CVB3, most likely because the minus-strand might be inaccessible to the silencing machinery.

A major problem for the long term inhibition of viruses is the emergence of escape mutants. This limitation, which is well known for conventional antiviral therapy with low-molecular weight drugs, is applicable to RNAi approaches as well. Virus escape as a consequence of the accumulation of point mutations in or close to the siRNA target site has been observed for various types of viruses, including poliovirus [122] and HIV [123, 124] . Three counter-strategies have been followed to counter the problem of viral escape: (1) targeting of conserved regions of the virus genome; (2) combination of efficient antiviral siRNAs; and (3) silencing of host factors that are essential for the viral life cycle.

Mutations in highly conserved regions of the virus genome are likely to cause a loss of virulence. Comparison of silencing by siRNAs against different genomic regions of CVB3 revealed that targeting of nonstructural protein coding regions is superior to selecting structural protein coding regions, since enzymes often lose activity when mutations occur [125] . Several groups have initially directed siRNA against the 5' untranslated region (5'UTR) of the CVB3 genome, which harbors the internal ribosome entry site (IRES). Interestingly, none of the tested siRNAs exerted significant antiviral activity [118, 119, 125, 126] . A possible explanation for this unexpected finding is that tight structures such as the IRES are detrimental to siRNA-mediated gene silencing [127] . Only after laborious screening for accessible sites for complementary oligonucleotides in the 5' UTR could siRNAs targeting the IRES be developed that were capable of inhibiting CVB3 [128] . The antiviral activity of the siRNA was improved further by its partial modification with locked nucleic acids (LNA), which have a high affinity towards complementary RNAs. Another highly conserved region of the CVB3 genome is the cis-acting replication element (CRE) located in the 2C protein coding region. An siRNA directed against this region conferred sustained protection against CVB3 and prevented the emergence of viable escape mutants [129] . Since the CRE sequence is identical in other enteroviruses such as echoviruses 6 and 7 and A-type as well as other B-type coxsackieviruses, the siRNA has a universal and persistent anti-enteroviral activity.

A widely employed strategy to minimize viral escape in conventional virus therapy is to combine various agents with antiviral activity. For HIV, this approach is known as highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART) or combined anti-retroviral therapy. The adaptation of this idea to RNAi is the combination of two or more active siRNAs or shRNAs. Combination of two shRNA expression cassettes in one vector was found to maintain silencing activity against mutated target RNAs of CVB3 in a reporter system, since the second shRNA can compensate for the loss of silencing activity of the shRNA directed against the mutated target site [115] . A systematic investigation of viral escape in cell culture revealed that cocktails of three siRNAs targeting distinct sites of the virus genome could maintain therapeutic efficacy, while virus inhibition with dual-or single-molecule-based RNAi was abrogated by viral escape [125] .

In the long run, however, resistant mutants are likely to develop even against combinations of three or more site-specific siRNAs. Therefore, recently the idea was advanced to use a pool of siRNAs covering 3.5 kb of CVB3 genomic sequence [130] . The pool was generated by synthesizing a long double-stranded RNA covering the region encoding most of the non-structural proteins of CVB3, which was subsequently cleaved into siRNAs by recombinant Dicer. The pool was found to be significantly more effective than single-site siRNAs. Although this strategy can be expected to prevent viral escape, its therapeutic application is questionable since the antiviral agent consists of a heterogeneous mixture of hundreds of different siRNA molecules. It is currently unclear whether the pool of siRNAs will induce more severe off-target effects than single siRNAs, since it consists of numerous sequences, each of which can potentially regulate non-target RNAs.

The third strategy for sustained inhibition of viral spread is silencing of genes of the host cells that are required by the virus to enter cells and replicate (Figure 3 ). The advantage of this approach is that viruses have a limited capacity to adapt to host cell changes. CVB3 initially attaches to the decay-accelerating factor (DAF), which serves as a co-receptor, prior to the virus entering the host cells via CAR. Whereas CAR is essential for cardiac CVB3 infection [131] most or all CVB2, 4, 6 as well as some strains of CVB1, 3 and 5 do not bind DAF [132] . As expected, silencing of CAR was found to prevent infection of the treated cells by CVB3 [119, 133] . Whether CAR can be considered a therapeutic target is debatable, since an essential prerequisite for the medical application of this strategy would be that the factor is dispensable. CAR is located in the tight junctions of epithelial cells [132, 134] and its constitutive knockout was found to result in an embryonic lethal condition associated with cardiac defects [135] . In contrast, animals with a conditional knockout of CAR at a later time point of embryonic development (E11) survived to adulthood and did not have evident cardiac abnormalities [136] . Very detailed investigations of heart function, however, revealed a block of atrio-ventricular conduction developed in the absence of CAR in the adult mouse heart, which may lead to arrhythmia [137, 138] . This finding was confirmed more recently with conditional knockout mice that exhibited a complete atrio-ventricular block and various phenotypes in other organs as well [139] . It should, however, be noted that no direct conclusions can be drawn from knockout experiments for RNAi applications, since knock-out animals completely lack CAR while RNAi only results in a partial knockdown of target gene expression, possibly leaving enough to prevent these defects from occurring.

Since CAR might have essential cellular functions, other host factors should be considered as targets for inhibitors that block CVB3 indirectly. In a recent study, an RNAi screen covering the druggable genome was carried out to identify cellular factors required for CVB3 infection of human cells [140] . With this approach, a set of genes could be identified whose depletion inhibited infection. Further studies will now be necessary to evaluate whether any of these genes are suitable candidates for the development of inhibitors with antiviral activity.

Cellular delivery, potency and specificity of siRNAs can be improved by chemical modification of the double-stranded RNA [141] . In addition to LNA-modified siRNAs, which were mentioned above, siRNAs containing LNA, as well as unlocked nucleic acids (UNA), have been tested against CVB3 [142] . In this study, a design pattern could be elucidated in which the UNA monomers do not compromise the high antiviral siRNA activity. Further studies have shown that the introduction of UNAs into an siRNA minimizes off-target activity [143] , which constitutes one of the major challenges associated with the clinical use of RNAi. A second major hurdle for the application of RNAi is efficient cellular delivery of the siRNAs. Attachment of lipophilic molecules such as cholesterol or receptor ligands like folate have been shown to improve, in some cases cell-type specifically, cellular uptake of a given siRNA, even in the absence of delivery agents. A folate-linked bacterial phage packaging RNA was used as a vehicle to deliver double-stranded RNA into HeLa cells, a folate receptor positive cancer cell line widely used as an in vitro model for CVB3 infection [144] . As a further development of this strategy, an artificial micro RNA (amiRNA) targeting the 3' untranslated region of the CVB3 genome instead of standard siRNAs was used as the silencing mediator [145] . The amiRNA was designed to contain mismatches to the central region of the target site and was shown to tolerate mutations, thus having the potential to suppress viral escape mutants.

A major challenge in the development of new therapeutic strategies is the translation of knowledge gained with cell culture experiments to the in vivo situation. An siRNA targeting the 2A protease encoding genomic region was found to lead to significant reduction of viral tissue titers, attenuate tissue damage, and prolong survival in highly susceptible type I interferon receptor-knockout mice [116] . As outlined above, prolonged silencing can be achieved by continuous intracellular generation of shRNAs from expression cassettes. As a proof-of-principle for this approach, plasmid-derived shRNAs were used to inhibit CVB3 in Balb/c mice [126] . Two of the tested shRNAs exerted strong antiviral effects accompanied by attenuated pancreatic tissue damage. For both of the aforementioned studies, however, the siRNAs and shRNA expression plasmids, respectively, were applied by hydrodynamic transfection. This method involves high pressure injection of the nucleic acid into the tail vein, which does not lend itself to a therapeutic setting for humans. It was therefore necessary to develop alternative application routes for efficient RNAi-mediated inhibition of CVB3. Since delivery of chemically synthesized siRNAs across the endothelial barrier to cardiomyocytes is inefficient, even in the presence of transfection agents, transfer of shRNA expression cassettes by viral vectors appears to be the method of choice.

Kim et al. used a lentiviral vector to deliver the expression cassette for the above mentioned shRNA against the highly conserved CRE region [146] . Mice were injected intraperitoneally with the lentiviral vector and were subsequently challenged with CVB3. Treated animals had significant reductions in viral titers, viral myocarditis, and pro-inflammatory cytokines and, most importantly, the survival rate was improved from 20% to 50% at day ten after infection. Since retroviral vectors bear the risk of insertional mutagenesis and adenoviral vectors induce a strong immune response, vectors based on adeno-associated viruses (AAV) are considered promising vehicles for gene transfer. While the wild type virus is single-stranded, the more recently used viral vectors contain a self-complementary double stranded genome, which ensures rapid onset and a high level expression of the transgene [147] . Furthermore, tissue tropism of the viral vector can be directed by the use of pseudotyped AAV vectors, which consist of a genome based on the standard serotype 2 and capsid proteins from a different serotype. We could show that delivery of the shRNA double expression cassette by a pseudotyped, self-complementary AAV vector into primary rat cardiomyocytes inhibited CVB3 replication by about 3 orders of magnitude. Moreover, in mice with CVB3 myocarditis, the RNAi treatment significantly attenuated cardiac dysfunction [120] .

Taken together, the in vitro studies demonstrate that RNAi is an efficient approach to inhibit CVB3 and subsequent in vivo studies confirmed viral vectors to be suitable vehicles for the delivery of shRNA expression cassettes to the heart. The technology thus has the potential to develop into a therapeutic option to treat humans with virus-induced myocarditis [148] .

A prerequisite of successful virus uptake is the specific binding of the virus to a cellular receptor. Soluble receptors analogues (SRA) bind to the virus before the virus interacts with their cellular receptors, thus preventing binding of the virus and subsequent uptake into the target cells. SRA can be found as naturally occurring cellular proteins generated by alternative splicing of the cellular receptor transcripts or are artificially designed as recombinant proteins by genetic engineering [149, 150] . Many SRA lack the transmembrane domain. This domain is necessary for anchoring the natural receptor protein in the cell membrane and its absence enables SRA to pass through the cell membrane and accumulate in the extracellular space. In general, SRA that exclusively consist of virus binding sites are sufficient to neutralize the target virus. Their efficiency, however, is sometimes too poor to allow their use in therapeutic treatments [151, 152] . Genetic engineering can increase SRA efficiency. The most common modification represents the fusion of the virus binding domain with the carboxy-terminus of the human IgG1 Fc region, resulting in generation of a dimeric antibody-like molecule [153] . Important effects result from this modification. The antibody Fc-region promotes the solubilization of the SRA, the half-life of the fusion protein increases up to 100-fold in vivo [154] and recognition of the IgG-Fc domain by Fc receptors expressed on the surface of macrophages enables clearing of the virus shortly after the virus is bound to the soluble receptor peptide by phagocytic cells [155] . Moreover, large amounts of soluble IgG-Fc can easily be purified using a protein A-coupled sepharose [150] . In this context it was shown that CVB3 neutralization was 125-fold more efficient with soluble DAF-IgG Fc fusion proteins (sDAF-Fc) than with the monomeric sDAF homologue comprising only of the cellular DAF ectodomain [156] . Alternatively the virus binding domain of a virus receptor can be fused to the C-terminal part of the C4b binding protein (C4bp) α chain leading to production of a disulfide-linked homo-octamer soluble protein with a spider-like structure [151] . Christiansen et al. reported that a fusion protein encompassing the CD46 ectodomain linked to C-terminal part of the C4bp α chain (sCD46-C4bpα) was able to bind to the measles virus hemagglutinin protein expressed on murine cells with a higher avidity than soluble monomeric CD46 (sCD46). Moreover, sCD46-C4bpα, but not the sCD46, fully protected CD46 transgenic mice against a lethal intracranial measles virus challenge [151] .

Competitive inhibition, as well as steric problems during the entry or uncoating steps, seem to be the main mechanisms responsible for blocking of viruses by SRA [157] . Another significant blocking mechanism was elucidated for SRA targeting viruses of the picornavirus family. In analogy to the physiological mechanism occurring during natural virus binding to cell receptor, it has been shown that the exposure of coxsackieviruses to virus specific SRA can induce the formation of altered (A)-particles [156, 158] (Figure 4) . A-particles have low buoyant density and lack the viral VP4 and the RNA-genome. These particles have lost their capacity to infect cells and their formation is an irreversible process [132, 157] .

The protective effect of SRA has been described for several viruses including HIV [159] , adenovirus [160] , measles virus [152] and human herpesvirus 6 (HHV6) [161] . Its effectiveness was also demonstrated for several members of the picornoviridae including entererovirus 71 [162] , rhinovirus [157] , and polioviruses [163] . To test their potential for inhibition of coxsackievirus myocarditis, SRA of CAR (sCAR-Fc) and DAF (sDAF-Fc) were developed and analyzed in different CVB3 myocarditis models [150, 154, 160, 164] . Yanagawa et al. injected recombinant sDAF-Fc in mice 3 days before, concurrent with or 3 days after CVB3 infection. Histological examination demonstrated a significant reduction in lesion area, cell necrosis, calcification, and inflammation in hearts of animals treated before and concurrent with CVB3 but not in the post-infection group. However, all groups had a similar reduction of infectious CVB3 in the heart [150] . Very similar results were subsequently obtained with sCAR-Fc. The therapeutic effect induced by sCAR-Fc, however, seemed to be stronger than that observed for sDAF-Fc, especially in the pre-and concomitant treated groups [154] . Moreover, sCAR-Fc inhibited CVB3 induced pancreatitis in vivo, which was not found for sDAF-Fc [150, 154] . Differences in efficiency can be explained by the fact that sCAR-Fc bind to CVB3 with 5,000-to 10,000-higher affinities than the equivalent form of DAF [156] but also the fact that sCAR-Fc induces A-particles, whereas sDAF-Fc forms reversible complexes with CVB3 [158] , may contribute to this observation ( Figure 4) . Although these results convincingly demonstrate that sDAF-Fc and sCAR-Fc can efficiently inhibit CVB3-induced myocarditis, a comprehensive assessment regarding the impact on contractile heart parameters, the most important parameters from the clinical perspective, was not carried out in these studies. We therefore aimed at characterizing the protective effect of sCAR-Fc treatment in more detail. To this end, we cloned sCAR-Fc and inserted it into an adenoviral vector under control of a doxycycline (Dox) inducible promoter. Following systemic application, sCAR-Fc expression was induced by addition of Dox 2 days before, concomitant and 1 day after CVB3 infection. Induction of sCAR-Fc prior to infection completely blocked the virus and even concomitant and post-infection induction strongly reduced cardiac CVB3 infection, myocardial injury, and inflammation. Moreover, a significant improvement of systolic and diastolic cardiac parameters was detected in animals in which sCAR-Fc expression was induced prior to or concomitant with the CVB3 infection [164] . As Dox induction results in therapeutic serum levels of sCAR-Fc (ranging between 20-100 ng/mL [160] ) 16 to 24 hours after induction at the earliest, the improvement in hemodynamic parameters in the concomitant group revealed that sCAR-Fc had a distinct therapeutic effect on heart function.

In a further approach aimed at generating sCAR-Fc/sDAF-Fc variants with increased efficiency, Lim et al. constructed sCAR-sDAF receptor chimeras containing the virus binding sites from hCAR and hDAF fused to the human IgG1 Fc region. One of this fusion proteins, hCAR:hDAF-Fc, showed stronger CVB3 neutralizing activity than sCAR-Fc in vitro and its employment in vivo resulted in significantly higher survival rates of CVB3 infected mice than observed for sCAR-Fc [160] . Finally, one study analyzed the potential of the naturally occurring sCAR variant CAR4/7, originally detected as a CAR splice variant in HeLa cells [149] , for inhibition of CVB3 myocarditis. Although the viral load in hearts of CVB3 infected animals treated with CAR4/7 was significantly reduced, surprisingly the animals developed signs of autoimmune myocarditis characterized by aggravated myocardial inflammation, tissue damage and presence of CAR-specific antibodies which were autoreactive against myocardial tissues [165] . The mechanisms leading to these auto-immunologic side effects induced by CAR4/7 are not yet understood. There may be specific immunological reactions related to the specific sequence of CAR4/7, or perhaps it relates to the fact that recombinant CAR4/7 was produced in bacteria, which altered its glycosylation pattern and increased the risk of co-purifying pro-inflammatory substances. In this regard it should be noted that the other approaches employing sCAR or sDAF variants in CVB3 infected mice in vivo did not lead to these side effects, as mentioned above, demonstrating that it is not a general feature of sCAR, sDAF.

The therapeutic potential of the combination of sCAR-Fc or sDAF-Fc with other therapeutical approaches (pharmacologically active low molecular weight substances, RNAi, immunomodulators) in CVB3 myocarditis remains to be uncovered. As one initial example, we have recently demonstrated that the simultaneous application of sCAR-Fc and siRNAs against CVB3 exerts synergistic antiviral activity in the treatment of a persistently infected cardiac cell line in vitro [166] . Further studies are currently underway to verify these results in CVB3 myocarditis models in vivo.

Summarizing these data, it can be concluded that sCAR-Fc and sDAF-Fc represent novel promising biologics that may potentially be used for treatment of coxsackievirus infections in humans. However, several questions are still unanswered and must be addressed in further research. Can coxsackieviruses develop resistance against sCAR and sDAF? What is the safety profile after long term application? Can sCAR or sDAF inhibit the development of chronic forms of CVB3 myocarditis?

Due to the great progress made in the understanding of stem cell therapy in recent years, application of stem cells is considered as one of the most promising strategies for therapeutic interventions in the future. Regenerative approaches aim at the restoration of the physiological cellular composition of diseased organs. Recent research indicates that the mammalian heart can be repopulated by cells from extra-cardiac sources. Transplantation of exogenous cells is therefore considered to be the likely next generation of cardiac cell therapies [167] .

Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) have the particular advantage of being non-immunogenic and thus allow the use of allogenic MSCs for clinical applications. In a recent preclinical study, the potential of MSCs to improve myocarditis induced by CVB3 was demonstrated for the first time [168] . As a prerequisite for the clinical application of this strategy, MSCs were shown not to be infected by CVB3, most likely due to a low expression level of CAR. In co-culture experiments with the cardiomyocyte cell line HL-1, MSCs reduced CVB3-induced apoptosis and oxidative stress. Furthermore, MSC diminished viral progeny release by approximately 5-fold. Importantly, intravenous injection of MSCs decreased cardiac apoptosis and improved left ventricular function in an experimental model of murine acute CVB3-induced myocarditis. A detailed mechanistic analysis revealed that the protective effect of the MSCs is mediated in an NO-dependent manner and requires priming via IFN-γ. Further research, however, will be required to investigate possible side effects and the potential of MSC transplantation for the treatment of CVB3 induced myocarditis.

Coxsackieviruses are one of the most important infectious agents associated with acute and chronic myocarditis in humans. Based on the elucidation of the coxsackieviral replication cycle a wide panel of pharmacologically active low molecular weight substances with strong antiviral activity have been developed but to date none are in routine clinical use. More recently biologics such as SRA, siRNAs or MSC have been found to be suitable to inhibit viral replication and inhibit coxsackievirus myocarditis ( Table 1) , but further investigation is necessary to elucidate their full therapeutic potentials and safety profiles. Based on our understanding of the pathogenesis of coxsackievirus-induced myocarditis, considering that both viral and immune and autoimmune mechanisms are involved in progression of the disease, antiviral therapy and its combination with immunomodulatory therapies may hold the greatest potential for improving the therapeutic outcome of coxsackievirus infection.

New Class of Monoclonal Antibodies against Severe Influenza: Prophylactic and Therapeutic Efficacy in Ferrets,"Background: The urgent medical need for innovative approaches to control influenza is emphasized by the widespread resistance of circulating subtype H1N1 viruses to the leading antiviral drug oseltamivir, the pandemic threat posed by the occurrences of human infections with highly pathogenic avian H5N1 viruses, and indeed the evolving swine-origin H1N1 influenza pandemic. A recently discovered class of human monoclonal antibodies with the ability to neutralize a broad spectrum of influenza viruses (including H1, H2, H5, H6 and H9 subtypes) has the potential to prevent and treat influenza in humans. Here we report the latest efficacy data for a representative antibody of this novel class.","A novel class of human monoclonal antibodies against influenza has been recently discovered [1] . These antibodies bind to the membrane-proximal stem of haemagglutinin, the major viral surface protein, and neutralize the influenza virus by blocking its fusion with the host cell [2] . A panel of antibodies with a similar mode of action was reported subsequently by Sui et al. [3] . Due to the high conservation of their recognition site, this class of antibodies has shown the ability to neutralize a broad spectrum of influenza subtypes, including H1, H2, H5, H6 and H9 [1] , and can be expected to also neutralize viruses from subtypes H4, H8, H11-H14 and H16, as well as their future antigenic drift variants [2] . One of these antibodies, CR6261, was investigated in mice and shown to be protective when given before and after lethal challenges with H1N1 and H5N1 virus, suggesting that it has potential as the first-ever broad-spectrum monoclonal antibody for prophylaxis and treatment of influenza virus infections [1] .

According to the World Health Organization, seasonal influenza causes up to 500,000 deaths worldwide each year [4] . Immunologically naïve infants, immunocompromised individuals and the elderly are particularly susceptible to illness caused by seasonal influenza viruses, with 90% of deaths occurring in the latter group [4, 5] . In addition, subtypes of influenza A viruses that have not previously circulated among humans occasionally cross from animal reservoirs, raising the spectre of a pandemic.

Over the past decade, the most prominent pandemic threat appeared to be posed by highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses of subtype H5N1. However, it was a new strain of human H1N1 that emerged in Mexico and the United States in March and April 2009 and rapidly spread across the globe that caused the WHO to declare a pandemic on June 11th [6, 7] . Although the virulence of this virus is currently moderate, particularly compared to the case fatality rate of over 60% of human H5N1 infections, this may change over time. Meanwhile, the threat from highly pathogenic avian H5N1 viruses persists as they continue to circulate and evolve in bird populations.

Preventive vaccination has historically been the primary means of influenza control, but this approach has important limitations. Vaccines typically elicit a potent neutralizing antibody response only to the specific viral strains they contain, and closely related viruses [8, 9] . Furthermore, influenza vaccines have suboptimal immunogenicity and efficacy in the groups at highest risk of severe disease: the very young, the elderly and immunocompromised individuals [10] .

The current therapeutic regimen for influenza A is limited to two classes of drugs: the adamantanes (amantadine and rimantadine) and the neuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir and zanamivir). Adamantanes rapidly elicit viral resistance, and resistance rates are high among H3N2 viruses and certain clades of H5N1 viruses [11] [12] [13] [14] . The use of oseltamivir, the leading antiviral influenza drug, has been limited by the sudden and widespread emergence of resistance among circulating H1N1 influenza strains [15, 16] . Oseltamivir resistance has also been observed during treatment of H5N1 infection [17, 18] . Zanamivir is still effective against H1N1 viruses and resistance to this drug is less likely to arise [19] . However, its use is limited to patients who can actively use an inhaled drug, which excludes young children, impaired older adults, or patients with underlying airway disease [16] -once again, the group of patients most vulnerable to serious complications from influenza infection.

In the absence of reliable antiviral drugs and vaccines, development of alternative strategies for influenza prophylaxis and therapy is urgently required. In order to assess whether CR6261 may be a viable option for human treatment, we evaluated the prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy of this human monoclonal antibody in a highly stringent lethal H5N1 influenza ferret model. The ferret is the most suitable disease model for human influenza infection as it displays very human-like disease [20] [21] [22] .

Four groups of 6 ferrets each received 30, 10, 3 or 1 mg/kg CR6261 via an intravenous injection and were challenged the next day with the highly pathogenic avian A/Indonesia/5/2005 (H5N1) virus. A control group of 6 ferrets received 30 mg/kg of the irrelevant isotype-matched antibody CR3014.

All ferrets that received 30 or 10 mg/kg CR6261 survived, compared to only 33.3% of the control animals ( Figure 1A) . A further reduction of the dose to 3 mg/kg was clearly correlated with a lower survival rate of 66.7%. Though not statistically significant different from survival observed in control animals, there is a 50% mortality reduction. The lowest dose of 1 mg/kg CR6261 was not associated with survival benefit compared to control animals. Survival times differed significantly between groups receiving 30 or 10 mg/kg CR6261 and the control group (p = 0.020).

Moribund animals showed general depression, anorexia and lethargy, and exhibited clinical signs of respiratory disease, including dyspnoea. Animals treated at efficacious dose levels (30 and 10 mg/kg) did not loose body weight, whereas the mean weight loss in the control group was 10.5% by the time the ferrets died or were euthanized ( Figure 1B ). An exception was one control ferret that succumbed to infection within 48 hours after challenge and lost hardly any weight before. Ferrets that received 3 or 1 mg/ kg CR6261 showed similar declines in body weight as the control animals.

One day after challenge the maximum body temperature was observed; for each ferret the maximum body temperature is depicted in figure 1C . The groups treated with 30 or 10 mg/kg had mean temperatures of 39.4uC and 40.7uC, respectively, which were significantly lower than the mean of 41.7uC observed in the control group (p,0.001 and p = 0.015, respectively). The mean temperature observed in animals treated with the lower doses of CR6261 (41.3uC and 41.5uC for 3 and 1 mg/kg, respectively) did not differ significantly from the control group.

The mean temperature in animals observed 3 days before challenge was similar across the 5 groups, ranging from 37.6uC to 38.4uC. Individual body temperature varied considerably within one healthy ferret over 24 hours (standard deviation 0.7uC).

Ferrets treated with 30 or 10 mg/kg CR6261 did not shed infectious virus in the upper respiratory tract at any time, whereas animals in the control group did ( Figure 1D ). Treatment with 3 and 1 mg/kg did not prevent shedding, but reduced the proportion of ferrets with infectious virus in nasal and/or throat swabs.

After necropsy, all ferrets were assessed for viral load in the lungs (figure 1E), and the animals that received 30 mg/kg CR6261 or control antibody were also assessed for viral load in the brain, liver, spleen, blood and kidney. The levels of virus replication in the lungs of ferrets treated with 30 and 10 mg/kg CR6261 were 3.9 and 2.9 log 10 TCID 50 /g lower than that in the control group (both p,0.001). No infectious virus was detected in any of the other organs of the ferrets that received 30 mg/kg CR6261, whereas infectious virus was found in the brain of 2, the liver of 3, and the spleen of 5 of the 6 control animals (data not shown). There was no significant difference in lung viral load in the groups receiving 3 or 1 mg/kg CR6261 compared to the control group (p = 0.74 and p = 0.91, respectively).

Histopathological results were in accordance with the findings described above; animals that received 30 and 10 mg/kg CR6261 showed much less pulmonary lesions such as primary atypical pneumonia, subacute bronch(iol)itis, emphysema and congestion, or showed such lesions at a lower grade of severity, compared to animals from the other groups. Bronchiolitis obliterans was not observed in any animal that received 30 mg/kg CR6261. Compared to this higher-dose group, animals that received 10 mg/kg CR6261 showed more regenerative response (diffuse grey/red area and bronchioloalveolar hyperplasia) in the lungs, and more inflammatory changes in the trachea. Pulmonary oedema was not observed in animals that received 30 or 10 mg/kg CR6261, but was observed frequently in all other groups. These findings were in agreement with mean lung weights, which were lowest in the animals treated with 30 or 10 mg/ kg CR6261 (6.3 g and 7.6 g, respectively) and significantly lower in this group than in control animals (15.0 g; both comparisons p,0.001). No significant difference in lung weight was found between the groups receiving 3 or 1 mg/kg CR6261 (14.1 g and 15.4 g, respectively) and the control group (15.0 g).

These findings show that, in a dose dependent way, prophylactically administered CR6261 confers protection against lethal H5N1 challenge, prevents morbidity and viral dissemination and reduces pulmonary pathology.

To assess the therapeutic efficacy of the monoclonal antibody CR6261, two groups of 10 ferrets were challenged as above and given 30 mg/kg of CR6261 either 4 or 24 hours later. A comparator group of 10 ferrets received 30 mg/kg of the control antibody 4 hours after challenge.

Survival rates in the groups receiving CR6261 at 4 and 24 hours after challenge were 100%, whereas only 20% of the animals in the control group survived (p,0.001) (Figure 2A ). Mean decline in body weight at the end of the experiment was 6.2% in the group of ferrets that received CR6261 4 hours after challenge ( Figure 2B) , which was significantly less (p = 0.025) than the 10.1% observed in control animals. Animals treated 24 hours post challenge showed a mean body weight loss of 8.4%, which was not significantly different from the control animals (p = 0.427). The group of ferrets treated with CR6261 4 hours post challenge had a mean maximum temperature of 40.0uC, compared to 41.8uC in the control group (p,0.001). In line with the rapid rise in temperature after challenge observed in the prophylaxis experiment ferrets treated with CR6261 24 hours after challenge showed a mean maximal temperature of 41.5uC before CR6261 was administered (p = 0.15 versus 41.8uC of the control group, figure 2C ).

Ferrets treated with CR6261 at 4 hours post challenge did not shed infectious virus in the upper respiratory tract throughout the study ( figure 2D ). In the group treated with CR6261 at 24 hours post challenge, one ferret had a low concentration of infectious virus (2.8 log 10 TCID 50 ) in the throat on day one, but no virus was detected on subsequent days. In contrast, all animals in the control group shed virus during one or more days. Accordingly, the mean viral loads in the lungs of ferrets treated with CR6261 at 4 and 24 hours post challenge were considerably lower than that in the control group (differences were 3.9 and 4.5 log 10 TCID 50 /g, respectively, both comparisons p,0.001; Figure 2E ).

The lungs of animals that received CR6261 at 4 hours post challenge showed less pulmonary lesions (alveolar oedema, bronchiolitis obliterans, congestion, emphysema, bronchioloalveo- lar hyperplasia and primary atypical pneumonia), or showed such lesions at a lower grade of severity, compared to the lungs of animals from the other two groups. Animals of the control group were most affected by primary atypical pneumonia. These findings were in accordance with the observation that the mean lung weights of ferrets treated with CR6261 at 4 hours post challenge were lower compared to the control group (5.7 g versus 14.9 g, p,0.001; Figure 2F ). Animals that received CR6261 at 24 hours post challenge showed most regenerative response (bronchioloalveolar hyperplasia) in the lungs, suggesting damage to the lung parenchyma with subsequent regenerative response. The mean lung weight in this group was significantly higher than that of the group receiving CR6261 at 4 hours post challenge (8.4 g versus 5.7 g), but lower than that of the control group (p,0.001).

From the study outset, one animal had been added to each of the two treatment groups to be sacrificed for gross-pathology and histology on lungs as soon as 50% of the control animals died. The purpose was to test for possible bias due to differences in the timing of death. Infectious virus titres in the lungs of the treated ferrets sacrificed at day 3 were identical to those in treated animals sacrificed at the end of the study (open circles in figure 2E) . Similarly, there were no differences in lung weight and pathology between animals sacrificed at day 3 or after day 5 ( figure 2F ). This indicates that the results were not biased by differences in the timing of euthanasia or spontaneous death.

CR6261 represents a new class of human monoclonal antibodies that exhibits immediate and potent efficacy for the prevention or treatment of influenza in a clinically relevant model for severe disease. The results presented here also confirm previously reported data demonstrating the prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy of CR6261 in mice challenged with H5N1 influenza viruses. Together with the H1N1 challenged mice data published earlier [1] these findings indicate that CR6261 is effective across a broad spectrum of influenza viruses, including seasonal and potentially pandemic strains.

Passive immunotherapy would be particularly beneficial for the groups at highest risk of severe disease due to seasonal influenzathe elderly and immuno-compromised-but may also be indispensable for the general public in the event of a pandemic disease outbreak caused by high-risk pandemic candidates such as H2, H5, H6 and H9.

Monoclonal antibodies against influenza viruses have been studied for decades, but their potential-and thus development-as 'passive' immunotherapy for influenza has been inhibited by the lack of monoclonal antibodies with broad neutralizing activity. This lack is due to the tolerance of influenza virus for genetic changes in the most immunogenic regions on its surface. The recent discovery of broadly neutralizing human monoclonal influenza antibodies [1] and the demonstrated efficacy of a representative of this novel class of antibodies against lethal viral challenge in a clinically relevant model, as presented in this paper, create an opportunity for the prevention and treatment of influenza infections, regardless of the causal strain. The possibility of a potent and broadly neutralizing agent that would equip clinicians and public health workers to deal effectively with the influenza viruses of the future represents a paradigm shift in the approach to influenza control.

Influenza illness observed in the ferrets infected with H5N1 virus in this study closely resembles influenza in humans with H5N1 infection, who present with fever, cough, shortness of breath, and radiological evidence of pneumonia [23] . Besides respiratory symptoms, gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhoea, vomiting and abdominal pain are often present. In severe cases, the pneumonia rapidly progresses to acute respiratory distress syndrome and multiorgan failure. High viral loads, extrapulmonary virus dissemination and hypercytokinaemia are associated with fatal outcome (reviewed in [24] [25] [26] ). Autopsies of patients who succumbed to influenza A (H5N1) virus infection have shown diffuse alveolar damage, patchy interstitial lymphoplasmacytic infiltrates, bronchiolitis with squamous metaplasia and pulmonary congestion with various degrees of haemorrhage [27] [28] [29] . The clinical signs observed in the control animals of this ferret study correspond to the most severe influenza pathology in humans [23] . The efficacy of CR6261 in preventing these clinical signs in the prophylactic and therapeutic ferret model presented here, together with the efficacy shown in mice after lethal challenges with different viruses, strongly indicate that CR6261 can be expected to be efficacious against disease caused by the other, less virulent viruses it neutralized in vitro [1] .

In a meta-analysis of experimental influenza infection of placebo-treated and untreated healthy volunteers, Carrat et al. [30] studied 1280 participants who were challenged with either influenza type H1N1, H3N2 or B. Interestingly, viral shedding was highly correlated with the presence of clinical symptoms such as fever, runny nose, sore throat, sneezing, cough and shortness of breath. The authors concluded from their meta-analysis that subjects with symptomatic illness shed virus in amounts 100 to 1000 fold higher than subjects who were not ill. The fact that CR6261 after intravenous administration instantaneously reduces viral shedding indicates that in man CR6261 might reduce clinical symptoms in subjects infected with influenza virus. In addition, studies in guinea pigs showed that a reduction in nasal wash titers correlate with a decreased efficiency of viral transmission by aerosol [31] . The ability of CR6261 to abolish shedding of virus in pharyngeal secretions strongly suggests that antibodies like CR6261 might prevent or reduce virus spreading at the onset of an epidemic influenza outbreak in nursing homes or in case of a pandemic.

In this study, we assessed the efficacy of the human monoclonal antibody CR6261 against a highly pathogenic avian H5N1 virus, as this provides a stringent disease model for severe influenza. However, the potential use of this antibody is not limited to viruses of this subtype or to other avian strains that may pose a pandemic threat. CR6261 has been shown to recognize H1 viruses that have emerged over a time span of 90 years from the H1N1 virus which caused the 1918 'Spanish flu' pandemic to the latest Brisbane viruses. Since the epitope is conserved CR6261 is predicted to bind to future antigenic drift variants. This means that CR6261 could be used to protect against all H1 influenza viruses, including the ones resistant to oseltamivir. Use of CR6261 in combination with effective medication against H3, such as oseltamivir or zanamivir, would effectively protect against all seasonal influenza viruses, without a need for prior knowledge of the virus subtype or strain.

In the present study ferrets were challenged with an inoculum which is probably much higher compared to the viral exposure in naturally infection in humans. The rapid deterioration in ferrets with death occurring within 3 days underpins this hypothesis since humans exposed to H5N1 develop the first symptoms 2-4 days after the last exposure and even periods of up to 8 days have been reported [25] . The clinical signs in this model are quite extreme, but important for establishing the efficacy of the antibody as proof of concept. The data of these two experiments demonstrate the prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy of this new class of human monoclonal antibodies in a highly stringent and clinically relevant ferret model of human influenza.

The human monoclonal antibody CR6261 was isolated from the IgM+, CD27+ B cell repertoire of a healthy individual who was recently vaccinated with the seasonal influenza vaccine, using phage display selection on recombinant H5 haemagglutinin [1] . CR3014, an isotype-matched antibody with the ability to neutralize SARS corona virus-which has similar tissue/organ tropism as that of H5 viruses-was used as a control antibody [32] . Both antibodies were produced on PER.C6H cells.

The study was performed with outbred ferrets (Mustela putorius furo, female, age approximately 8 months, Schimmel Farms, Uddel, the Netherlands). Ferrets were screened for the presence of serum antibodies against Aleutian Disease virus, circulating seasonal influenza virus strains (A/H1N1, A/H3N2 and B) and the challenge virus (H5N1, A/Indonesia/5/2005), and only seronegative animals were used in the study. The animals were housed in study groups of 6 (prophylactic experiment) or 10 (therapeutic experiment).

Antibodies were administered by intravenous injection in the jugular vein. Viral challenge was performed intratracheally with 10 5 TCID 50 A/Indonesia/05/2005 in 3 mL of PBS [33] . Clinical observations were performed twice a day on days of intervention and once daily on other days. In the prophylactic experiment, animals were weighed 2 weeks before viral challenge (day 214), immediately prior to antibody administration (day 21), and after challenge (days 2, 4, and 5 or on the day of premature death). In the therapeutic experiment, animals were weighed on day 214 and day 22, immediately prior to challenge and antibody administration, and on days 2, 4 and the last study day. Body temperature was recorded every 15 minutes throughout both experiments using a device (DST micro-T, Star-Oddi, Reykjavik, Iceland) implanted in the peritoneal cavity 14 days before challenge.

The animal experiments were carried out in the central animal facilities of the Netherlands Vaccine Institute (NVI, Bilthoven) under conditions that meet the Dutch legal requirements for animal experimentation and are in accordance with the 'Guide for the care and use of laboratory animals', the recommendations of the Institute for Laboratory Animal Research (US National Institutes of Health), and Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International (AAA-LAC) standards.

Viral titrations were performed as described elsewhere [34] . Briefly, pharyngeal and nasal swabs were collected from all animals at day 21, day 2, day 4, and day 5. Individual swabs were homogenized and resuspended in 3 ml medium and stored at 280uC until analysis. Viral titres were determined by virus titration on Madine Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells. Viral shedding from the upper respiratory tract was analysed by calculating the proportion of ferrets with detectable levels of infectious virus in nasal and/or throat swabs relative to the number of living ferrets.

After necropsy, the cranioventral, craniodorsal, caudoventral and caudodorsal sections of the right lung were collected from each animal, weighed, homogenized and resuspended in 3 ml medium, and stored at 280uC until analysis. Viral titres were determined after thawing of the tissue sections followed by homogenization and resuspension by virus titration on MDCK cells. In addition, viral titres in tissues of brain, spleen, liver, kidney, and plasma from animals that received either 30 mg/kg of CR6261 or CR3014 one day prior to challenge were determined using the same method.

A complete macroscopic post-mortem examination was performed on all animals. This included examination of the external surfaces and all orifices; the thoracic, abdominal and pelvic cavities with their associated organs and tissues; and the neck with its associated organs and tissues. Lungs were weighed and all lung lobes were inspected and lesions described. The left lung (including trachea) was collected during autopsy, inflated with 10% neutral buffered formalin for fixation/histology and microscopic examination. Paraffin embedded tissue sections (left cranial lobe, left caudal lobe, right cranial-, middle-and caudal lobes and accessory lobe) were stained with haematoxylin and eosin and assessed by light microscopy for aspects like congestion, emphysema, presence of foreign body, haemorrhagy, bronchioloalveolar hyperplasia and inflammation, and oedema.

Prior to blood sampling, the taking of nose and throat swabs and euthanasia, the ferrets were anaesthetised with ketamin (25 mg/ kg; i.m.). For implantation of temperature sensors, antibody administration and viral challenge, the animals were anaesthetized with a mixture of ketamin (12.5 mg/kg; i.m.) and domitor (7.5 mg/ kg; i.m.), followed by antisedan (0.5 mg/kg; i.m.).

Survival times after viral challenge were analysed using the logrank test and survival proportions using the Fisher's exact test. Body weight expressed as percentage change from baseline was calculated at the end of the study period (or earlier in the event of earlier death). Maximum body temperatures were observed during day one and these values were subsequently used for calculating the mean maximum body temperature for each group. Variables were analysed in an one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with post-hoc testing to compare to the control group using Dunnett's adjustment for multiple comparisons.

Lung weight and lung viral titres were compared across arms using ANOVA, with day of necropsy entered as a covariate. Differences between treatment groups were estimated using marginal means, with Sidak's adjustment for multiple comparisons. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 15.0 (SPSS Inc. USA). Statistical significance level was set at a = 0.05.

Therapy with CTLA4-Ig and an antiviral monoclonal antibody controls chikungunya virus arthritis,‡,"www.sciencetranslationalmedicine.org/cgi/content/full/9/375/eaah3438/DC1 Fig. S1 . RANKL and OPG expression in CHIKV-infected joints. 

Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a mosquito-transmitted alphavirus that causes severe acute and chronic polyarthritis. CHIKV was first isolated in Tanzania in 1947 (1), but the virus has emerged rapidly over the last decade, causing outbreaks in the islands of the Indian Ocean, in Southern Europe, and in Southeast Asia (2) . In 2013, CHIKV spread to the Western Hemisphere and, by the end of 2015, had infected more than 1.8 million people in North America, Central America, and South America. The acute symptoms of CHIKV infection include fever and rash, which typically resolve within a few days, and joint and muscle pain (3) . CHIKV and other arthritogenic alphaviruses directly invade the synovium to cause inflammatory arthritis (4) , which is characterized by articular swelling and prolonged morning stiffness (3) . CHIKV-induced arthritis in humans can persist, with as many as 60% of individuals progressing to chronic disease that lasts from months to years (3, (5) (6) (7) . Epidemiological projections suggest that there are currently about 400,000 individuals in the Western Hemisphere with chronic CHIKV arthritis (8) .

Chronic CHIKV arthritis clinically is similar to seronegative rheumatoid arthritis (RA) (3, (9) (10) (11) , an autoimmune disease characterized by symmetrical joint pain, swelling, and morning stiffness. Treatment with newer disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) has been effective in preventing the bone erosions and deformities seen in patients with untreated RA. Whether chronic CHIKV arthritis causes erosive disease remains controversial, although there are reports of bone erosions in patients infected with CHIKV (9) . Effective treatment of RA relies on early diagnosis, because erosions can occur within months of onset of the disease (12) . Because CHIKV and RA exhibit significant clinical overlap, there is potential for confusing the diagnoses and inadvertently treating CHIKV arthritis with DMARD therapy (3) .

(TNF-α) and anti-interleukin-6 (IL-6) receptor]. Other biological DMARDs block T cell costimulation (CTLA4-Ig) or deplete B cells (anti-CD20). Among the newest drugs used to treat RA is tofacitinib, an oral DMARD that inhibits JAK (Janus kinase)/STAT (signal transducers and activators of transcription) signaling and broadly blunts cytokine responses (13, 14) . However, many DMARDs, by virtue of their immunosuppressive properties, may predispose to serious microbial infections. Thus, there is a need to determine whether DMARDs are effective, benign, or deleterious in the treatment of CHIKV arthritis. The current standard of care for CHIKV arthritis is treatment with non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (15) , although these often do not ameliorate symptoms (3). One trial compared chloroquine (a DMARD) to meloxicam (an NSAID) and found no difference in efficacy (15) , although a placebo group was not included in the trial design. Another open-label study examined a combination of hydroxychloroquine and methotrexate in the treatment of CHIKV arthritis and found that some patients partially responded to therapy, although ~50% of patients did not achieve significant improvement in disease score (16) .

Subcutaneous inoculation of young wild-type (WT) immunocompetent C57BL/6 mice with pathogenic strains of CHIKV results in acute foot swelling, myositis, and arthritis (4, 17) . In this model, swelling resolves within the first 2 weeks of infection (17, 18) , although mild chronic disease can be observed histologically for weeks to months (4) . This finding contrasts with the disease in humans, which are natural hosts and frequently have a protracted clinical disease course. Human patients with CHIKV arthritis have increased numbers of circulating, activated cytolytic CD8 + T cells, as do patients with untreated RA (3).

Gene expression signatures observed in mouse models of CHIKV arthritis and RA suggested overlapping contributions of T cell-associated pathways in these diseases (19) . Mice lacking or depleted of CD4 + Tcells have reduced foot swelling and arthritis during acute CHIKV infection, suggesting that CD4 + T cells contribute to the pathology of arthritis (20) . Inflammatory monocytes also are thought to play an initiating role in CHIKV arthritis in mice, because inhibiting production of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) with bindarit (21) improved the disease. Finally, treatment of mice with anti-CHIKV monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) 1 day before infection prevents arthritis (22) (23) (24) , but whether therapy after infection is effective has not been studied. Moreover, no previous study has tested the efficacy of clinically available DMARDs against CHIKV arthritis in mice.

Here, we examined the efficacy of several U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)approved RA therapies in a mouse model of CHIKV infection. We identified two DMARDs (CTLA4-Ig and tofacitinib) with efficacy during acute CHIKV arthritis. In particular, CTLA4-Ig, when paired with the neutralizing anti-CHIKV human mAb 4N12, was highly effective at reducing joint inflammation, periarticular swelling, migration of inflammatory leukocytes, and infection even when administered several days after virus inoculation. Thus, combination of anti-inflammatory and antibody-based antiviral therapy may serve as a model for treating humans with arthritis caused by CHIKV or other related viruses.

On the basis of previous data showing that immune cells and proinflammatory cytokines contribute to CHIKV arthritis in mice (20) and our study showing that CHIKV arthritis clinically can mimic seronegative RA (3), we hypothesized that some of the existing FDAapproved therapies for RA might ameliorate acute CHIKV arthritis. To test this idea, we performed a multiarm prospective study (Fig. 1A ) by inoculating 224 4-week-old WT mice subcutaneously in the left rear foot with 10 3 focus-forming units (FFU) of a pathogenic clinical isolate of CHIKV (La Reunion, 2006) . Mice were divided into groups of 28 animals that received one of the following treatments beginning on day 3 after infection: methylprednisolone, naproxen, methotrexate, etanercept (soluble human TNF-α receptor), CTLA4-Ig (abatacept), oral gavage vehicle control, or tofacitinib (JAK inhibitor). All of the biological agents that we used have been shown previously to have activity in mice (13, 25, 26) . We chose day 3 after infection to initiate treatment, because this represents the time point of the first peak of clinically apparent foot swelling in the WTC57BL/6 mouse model of CHIKV infection (Fig. 1B) . Animals were followed for clinical joint swelling in the ipsilateral foot and viral yield at different times after infection and treatment.

Treatment with CTLA4-Ig or tofacitinib at day 3 ameliorated foot swelling on day 7 after infection at the point of peak clinical disease [ Fig. 1 , C to F; 9.0 mm 2 (injection control) versus 7.8 mm 2 (CTLA4-Ig), P < 0.005 and 9.3 mm 2 (oral control) versus 8.5 mm 2 (tofacitinib), P < 0.005]. Other treatments had no significant effect at the dose tested in our experiments. To assess the systemic and local impact on viral burden of DMARD treatment, we evaluated CHIKV RNA levels on day 7 in serum and joint tissues. Remarkably, none of the therapies affected viral RNA levels in the right ankle or left ankle at day 7 or day 28 after infection compared to controls (Fig. 1 , G to J; P > 0.1). Thus, CTLA4-Ig and tofacitinib ameliorate joint and periarticular inflammation in mice during the acute phase without substantively altering the viral burden in inflamed tissues. The beneficial effect of CTLA4-Ig, which blocks T cell activation (25) , is consistent with data suggesting that CD4 + T cells contribute to immunopathology associated with CHIKV arthritis (20) .

We next tested whether combination immunomodulatory and antiviral therapy might have greater beneficial effects. Potently neutralizing human anti-CHIKV mAbs previously were shown to protect against CHIKV-induced lethality in immunocompromised Ifnar1 −/− mice, even when administered at late time points after infection (27) . We administered either a single 600-μg dose of a control immunoglobulin G (IgG), 300 μg of CTLA4-Ig, 300 μg of anti-CHIKV mAb (4N12, a neutralizing anti-CHIKV human mAb), or 300 μg each of CTLA4-Ig + anti-CHIKV mAb ( Fig. 2A) 3 days after CHIKV infection. Whereas either anti-CHIKV mAb or CTLA4-Ig partially reduced foot swelling at day 7, the combination completely abolished it (10.8 mm 2 versus 6.6 mm 2 , P < 0.0001) relative to untreated or control IgG-treated animals (Fig. 2, A and B) . Thus, anti-CHIKV mAb therapy initiated after disease onset can partially treat the acute clinical arthritis associated with CHIKV infection, and combination therapy with anti-CHIKV mAb and the immunomodulator CTLA4-Ig completely resolves clinical disease in mice within a few days of treatment.

To confirm the activity of the anti-CHIKV mAb in this model, we assessed its effects on viral burden. Treatment with anti-CHIKV mAb (alone or in combination with CTLA4-Ig) at day 3 eliminated infectious virus in the joints of infected mice within 2 days, as we observed a ~10,000-fold reduction in the ipsilateral ankle ( Fig. 3A ; P < 0.0005) and a ~100-fold reduction in the contralateral ankle ( Fig. 3A ; P < 0.05). Viral burden in mice treated with only CTLA4-Ig was not reduced in either the ipsilateral or contralateral ankle (Fig. 3A) . Although infectious CHIKV cannot be detected after day 7 in this mouse model [or during the chronic phase in humans (3, 4) ], CHIKV RNA persists in joint tissues for months (28) . Because persistent viral RNA is a pathogen-associated molecular pattern and may contribute to CHIKV arthritis (3, 28) , we tested whether anti-CHIKV mAb treatment would reduce viral RNA levels. Although we did not observe a reduction in viral RNA levels in the ipsilateral foot joints (P > 0.1), other extremity joints exhibited a ~10-fold reduction in viral RNA on day 7 after infection, including the contralateral ankle and ipsilateral wrist ( Fig. 3B ; right ankle, P < 0.005; left wrist, P < 0.05). On day 28, there was a trend toward reduced RNA in distal joint tissues of animals treated with anti-CHIKV mAb, although this did not attain statistical significance ( Fig. 3C ; P = 0.2). Collectively, these results show that treatment with an anti-CHIKV mAb (alone or in combination with CTLA4-Ig) rapidly eliminates infectious virus within 2 days and reduces but fails to clear viral RNA in affected tissues.

To begin to define the basis for reduced joint swelling associated with treatment, we analyzed the effects on local cytokine and chemokine production. Using a multiplexed assay, we measured cytokine and chemokine levels in the ipsilateral foot on day 7 after infection in animals that received either control mAb, CTLA4-Ig, anti-CHIKV mAb, or combination therapy with CTLA4-Ig and anti-CHIKV mAb. Monotherapy with CTLA4-Ig reduced levels of CXCL10 and macrophage inflammatory protein-1β (MIP-1β) ( Histological analysis of joint tissues in the ipsilateral foot revealed reduced leukocyte infiltration into the midfoot joints of mice receiving CTLA4-Ig and combination therapy with CTLA4-Ig and anti-CHIKV mAb (Fig. 5 , A to F; yellow arrows, moderate to severe synovitis; white arrows, absent or mild synovitis). We next quantitated the number of inflammatory cells per high-power field (HPF) in the synovial space of the midfoot. CTLA4-Ig and combination therapy with CTLA4-Ig and anti-CHIKV mAb resulted in decreased inflammatory cell infiltration into the synovial space (52 cells per HPF in the control group, 22 cells per HPF in CTLA4-Ig group, and 9 cells per HPF in the CTLA4-Ig + anti-CHIKV mAb group, P<0.05 and P < 0.0001, respectively). Histological analysis did not reveal evidence of bone erosion, proteoglycan loss, or effects on expression of receptor activator of nuclear factor κB ligand (RANKL) and osteoprotegerin (OPG) (fig. S1 ). Consistent with a role for CTLA4-Ig in modulating immune cell recruitment, administration of CTLA4-Ig 1 day before infection resulted in reduced swelling on day 7 but not on day 3 ( fig. S2) , a time point at which subcutaneous edema but not immune cell infiltration is observed. To quantitate differences in immune cell infiltration into the entire foot at day 7 after infection, we analyzed by flow cytometry how CTLA4-Ig and anti-CHIKV mAb treatments affected the total numbers of immune cells in the soft tissues of the ipsilateral foot, which included the skin, muscle, and joints. After treatment with CTLA4-Ig or a combination of CTLA4-Ig and anti-CHIKV mAb, we observed about a three-to fourfold reduction in the number of total CD45 + leukocytes (Fig. 6 , A and B; P < 0.0005) with markedly reduced numbers of Ly6C + CD11b + inflammatory monocytes, natural killer cells, and CD8 + T cells, and a nearly complete absence of CD4 + T cells (Fig. 6 , B to G). By contrast, treatment with the anti-CHIKV mAb alone did not reduce the number of infiltrating CD45 + cells or individual leukocyte subsets into the infected foot (Fig. 6 , A to G).

CTLA4-Ig blocks T cell costimulation, but it can also have immunomodulatory effects on antigen-presenting cells (APCs) (25, 29) . Human CTLA4-Ig, which was used in our studies, binds murine B7.1 and B7.2 antigens and can modulate APC function (30, 31) . We assessed APC activation on day 7 after infection but saw no difference in CD80, CD86, and class II major histocompatibility complex marker expression in APCs isolated from the spleen and feet of control and CTLA4-Ig-treated mice ( fig. S3 ). To test whether CTLA4-Ig exerted its therapeutic benefits via T cells, we compared the response to CTLA4-Ig and a control mAb in CHIKV-infected WT and TCRβδ −/− mice, the latter of which lack both αβ and γδ T cells. As we observed a beneficial effect of CTLA4-Ig in WT animals (Fig. 7 , A and C; P < 0.005) but not in TCRβδ −/− mice (Fig. 7 , B and C; P > 0.9), CTLA4-Ig reduces swelling during acute CHIKV infection in part via its action on T cells.

The worldwide emergence of CHIKV has created a need to identify treatments, as epidemiological estimates suggest there are millions suffering from acute arthritis and at least ~400,000 people in the Western Hemisphere suffering from chronic CHIKV arthritis (5, 8) . We reasoned that established therapies used to treat other forms of inflammatory arthritis (for example, rheumatoid or psoriatic arthritis) also might mitigate CHIKV arthritis. Our experiments identified CTLA4-Ig and tofacitinib as candidate DMARD therapies based on efficacy against acute CHIKV arthritis in mice.

Immunopathology likely contributes to the pathogenesis of CHIKV arthritis. Previous studies using Rag2 −/− animals suggested that the response depends on B and T cells, because Rag2 −/− animals had no ipsilateral foot swelling (20) . Leukocyte subsets infiltrating the peripheral joints of CHIKV-infected mice primarily consist of T cells, inflammatory monocytes, and macrophages (4). When we blocked T cell costimulation with CTLA4-Ig, we observed reduced infiltration of T cells and inflammatory monocytes into the joints of infected animals, although this was not sufficient to eliminate the clinical disease completely. Treatment of TCRβδ −/− mice with CTLA4-Ig had no effect on joint swelling, suggesting that CTLA4-Ig ameliorates clinical disease primarily via its action on T cells. These findings are consistent with previous studies suggesting that joint swelling in the foot of CD4 −/− animals is reduced in severity but not completely controlled (20) . Our findings suggest that other inhibitors of CD4 + T cell function also might limit musculoskeletal disease associated with CHIKV infection. Teo et al. (32) recently demonstrated that treatment with fingolimod, an agonist of the sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor, limited infiltration of CD4 + T cells into CHIKV-infected joints and adjacent muscle in mice, resulting in reduced joint swelling and muscle necrosis.

Previous studies showed that mouse and human antiviral antibodies could prevent CHIKV arthritis in mice when administered before infection (28) or protect against lethality in highly immunocompromised Ifnar1 −/− mice (22, 27) . We found that treatment of WT mice 3 days after CHIKV infection with an antiviral human mAb reduced but did not eliminate joint swelling, although infectious virus could not be detected in the joints within 2 days of therapy. Foot swelling likely depends on multiple factors including synovitis, myositis, and edema resulting from production of proinflammatory cytokines (4). The anti-CHIKV mAb eliminated infectious virus within 2 days of its administration and reduced foot swelling without altering leukocyte infiltration into joints of infected animals, suggesting that leukocyte recruitment is not the only factor that affects disease severity in this model. Local cytokine production in specific compartments (for example, serum, muscles, or joints) independently may affect the virus-induced swelling or edema. Future histological studies may define better the precise mechanism by which neutralization of infectious CHIKV by antiviral antibodies ameliorates foot swelling.

The type I interferon (IFN) response is important in controlling CHIKV infection. Ifnar1 −/− mice lacking type I IFN signaling are highly vulnerable to disseminated infection with CHIKV and succumb within days due to high levels of virus in the brain and spinal cord (33) . Remarkably, treatment with tofacitinib, which blocks JAK/STAT signaling that is downstream of Ifnar1 and other cytokine receptors, reduced clinical disease without ostensible effects on morbidity or mortality. This result may be related to the pharmacodynamics of tofacitinib including its short half-life (13) . Tofacitinib therapy may blunt cytokine production and/or leukocyte infiltration without enhancement of CHIKV replication. Nevertheless, because tofacitinib is known to enhance the risk of some viral infections, including varicella zoster virus (34) , future combination therapy studies with tofacitinib and an antiviral mAb may be warranted.

Anecdotal reports in humans have suggested that methotrexate may be effective for treatment of CHIKV arthritis (16, 35) . In our studies, a low dose of methotrexate did not provide benefit against acute arthritis. It remains possible that methotrexate would show greater benefit if higher doses were used. Mouse models of Ross River virus arthritis previously revealed exacerbation of disease after treatment with etanercept (36), whereas an uncontrolled study in humans suggested that blockade of TNF-α provided some benefit in 13 patients who were diagnosed with a ""chronic rheumatologic disease"" after acute CHIKV infection (35) . However, it is important to note that some patients infected with CHIKV may develop rheumatologic disease sporadically or coincidentally after CHIKV infection. In a controlled study of mice infected with CHIKV, we did not find a benefit of etanercept therapy with acute CHIKV arthritis, but we were unable to assess chronic disease because of the histopathological absence of frank arthritis during the chronic phase. In light of our animal model results and the anecdotal nature of previous human studies, it seems that rigorous, blinded, placebo-controlled studies in human patients are necessary to define which DMARD therapies may be safe and optimal in patients with chronic CHIKV arthritis. CHIKV and related arthritogenic alphaviruses directly invade the joints and leave persistent viral RNA in the joints and surrounding tissues even in the absence of detectable infectious virus (28) . In previous studies, we found that most CHIKV-infected control C57BL/6 mice did not exhibit histopathological evidence of chronic arthritis 1 month after infection, although there was mild chronic tenosynovitis and myositis in some animals (4) . Because we could readily detect viral RNA in the joints at day 28, our studies suggest that persistent viral RNA may not be sufficient to cause clinically apparent chronic arthritis in mice and that other factors must contribute to pathogenesis. Thus, it remains to be determined whether our combination treatment with an antiviral antibody and CTLA4-Ig has beneficial effects in chronic CHIKV arthritis. Other animal models with more severe chronic disease (for example, nonhuman primates) may be required to address these questions.

The beneficial effects of CTLA4-Ig and antiviral antibody therapy on CHIKV arthritis must be interpreted with caution because there are limitations with the mouse model. Unlike humans, mice are not natural hosts for CHIKV and therefore do not develop the severe, debilitating arthritis that is commonly observed in humans. Because CHIKV causes less severe disease in mice, it remains possible that immunomodulatory therapies, including CTLA4-Ig, may have no or even deleterious effects in humans.

The concept of combination antiviral and immunomodulatory therapy is a unique approach for the treatment of infectious diseases. The near-complete effectiveness of combination therapy in our mouse model of acute CHIKV arthritis has implications for treatment of other viral infections in which both virus-and immune-mediated pathology result in morbidity and mortality (for example, influenza and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus). Given the large number of clinically available biological and small molecular DMARDs, this work may provide greater impetus for studies that test combination antiviral and immunomodulatory therapies for the treatment of infectious diseases.

We initiated this study to determine whether anti-inflammatory and antiviral therapy control acute CHIKV arthritis in mice. Our initial observation was that treatment with antiviral antibody reduced infectious viral burden in the ipsilateral joint and that therapy with CTLA4-Ig diminished recruitment of T cells and inflammatory monocytes as well as the accumulation of proinflammatory cytokines. Subsequent histological analysis confirmed these findings. We measured viral titers and RNA in tissues, immunologic parameters (including influx of specific cell subtypes into the joints and surrounding tissues), and cytokine levels. Sample sizes and end points were selected on the basis of our extensive experience with these systems. Mice were age-and sex-matched between groups. Histological analysis was performed in a blinded fashion. Initial footpad measurements were performed by three individuals in an unblinded fashion. However, the measurements after CTLA4-Ig treatment were reproduced by a fourth individual who performed a blinded assessment. Investigators were not blinded when conducting virus tissue burden analysis, cytokine measurements, or flow cytometry analysis. All primary data are in the Supplementary Materials (table S1).

All animal experiments were performed in accordance and with approval of Washington University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee guidelines, and all mouse infection studies were performed in an animal biosafety level 3 laboratory. All experiments were performed with 4-week-old C57BL/6 mice or with TCRβδ −/− mice that were obtained commercially (The Jackson Laboratories).

A recombinant LR2006 OPY1 strain of CHIKV was provided by S. Higgs (Kansas State University) and generated from in vitro transcribed cDNA, as previously described (37) . At 4 weeks of age, mice were inoculated in the left rear footpad with 10 3 FFU of the LR2006 OPY1 strain of CHIKV in a volume of 10 μl. Infected mice were monitored daily for foot swelling with digital calipers for 28 days. At the termination of experiments, mice were sedated with a ketamin-exylazene cocktail and euthanized, and perfused via intracardiac injection with PBS. Tissues (injected left ankle, contralateral ankle, and ipsilateral wrist) were harvested and snap-frozen on dry ice and stored at −80°C until processing for RNA isolation. For serum analysis, blood was collected at the time of sacrifice and centrifuged for 10 min at 10,000 g and stored at −80°C. In some experiments, serum and joint tissues were isolated from mice on day 5 after infection for subsequent analysis by focus-forming assay.

Focus-forming assays were performed as previously described (22) . Briefly, tissue homogenates or serum were incubated for 90 min on a monolayer of Vero cells in 96-well plates, and then cells were overlaid with 1% (w/v) methylcellulose in modified Eagle media supplemented with 4% fetal bovine serum(FBS). Plates were harvested 18 to 24 hours later and fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS. The plates were incubated sequentially with chimeric CHK-9 (500 ng/ml) (22) and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat antihuman IgG in PBS supplemented with 0.1% saponin and 0.1% bovine serum albumin. CHIKV-infected foci were visualized using TrueBlue peroxidase substrate (KPL) and quantitated on an ImmunoSpot 5.0.37 macro-analyzer (Cellular Technologies Ltd).

RNA was extracted from tissue using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). The quantity of CHIKV RNA was determined by qRT-PCR using the TaqMan RNA-to-CT 1-Step Kit (Applied Biosystems) with an E1-specific primer/probe set (38) . Two microliters of the isolated RNA was analyzed by qRT-PCR and compared to a standard curve generated from RNA isolated from a CHIKV stock to determine FFU equivalents.

4N12 is a human IgG1 mAb that neutralizes CHIKV infection and has been described previously (27) . Antibody was purified from hybridoma supernatants by protein G affinity chromatography. Methotrexate, CTLA4-Ig (abatacept), and etanercept were obtained from the Center for Advanced Medicine Rheumatology Clinic (St. Louis, MO). Naproxen sodium and methylprednisolone acetate were purchased from Sigma. The isotype control antibody [humanized anti-West Nile virus antibody (E16)] was produced in Chinese hamster ovary cells and purified by protein G affinity chromatography (39) .

Infected mice were sacrificed and perfused by intracardiac injection of 4% PFA at the indicated days after infection. The infected ankle/foot tissue was dissected and fixed in 4% PFA/PBS for 48 hours, followed by decalcification in 14% acid-free EDTA for 10 to 14 days. Decalcified tissues were embedded in paraffin, and 5-μm sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and evaluated by light microscopy. Embedding, sectioning, and staining were performed by the Musculoskeletal Histology and Morphometry Core at Washington University School of Medicine. All samples were visualized using a Nikon Eclipse microscope equipped with a QICAM 12-bit camera (QImaging) and processed with QCapture software using the same exposure times.

Ankles were harvested from euthanized infected mice at day 7 and collected in 500-μl PBS and homogenized using a MagNA Lyser (Roche). Cytokine levels were measured using Luminex technology with a Bio-Plex Pro mouse cytokine 13-plex assay (Millipore).

Mice were sacrificed 7 days after inoculation and perfused with PBS. The inoculated foot was disarticulated at the ankle without fracturing the bone. Cutaneous and subcutaneous tissue were everted but still attached to the distal foot and digits during digestion. Tissues were incubated for 2 hours at 37°C in digestion buffer [RPMI, type I collagenase (2. 

All data were analyzed with GraphPad Prism software. For viral burden analysis, cytokine measurements, and numbers of infiltrating leukocytes, data were analyzed by the Mann-Whitney test, ANOVA, or Kruskal-Wallis test with a Dunn's post hoc analysis. P < 0.05 indicated statistically significant differences. Results in (C) to (J) are from at least two independent experiments with n = 28 per treatment group for measurement data from days 0 to 7 and n = 7 or 8 for viral burden analysis on days 7 and 28.

Clinical development of monoclonal antibody- based drugs in HIV and HCV diseases,"Today there are many licensed antiviral drugs, but the emergence of drug resistant strains sometimes invalidates the effects of the current therapies used in the treatment of infectious diseases. Compared to conventional antiviral drugs, monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) used as pharmacological molecules have particular physical characteristics and modes of action, and, therefore, they should be considered as a distinct therapeutic class. Despite being historically validated, antibodies may represent a novel tool for combatting infectious diseases. The current high cost of mAbs' production, storage and administration (by injection only) and the consequent obstacles to development are outweighed by mAbs' clinical advantages. These are related to a low toxicity combined with high specificity and versatility, which allows a specific antibody to mediate various biological effects, ranging from the virus neutralization mechanisms to the modulation of immune responses. This review briefly summarizes the recent technological advances in the field of immunoglobulin research, and the current status of mAb-based drugs in clinical trials for HIV and HCV diseases. For each clinical trial the available data are reported and the emerging conceptual problems of the employed mAbs are highlighted. This overview helps to give a clear picture of the efficacy and challenges of the mAbs in the field of these two infectious diseases which have such a global impact.","The innate immune response is the first-line defense in determining the outcome of an infection. Infectious agents contain conserved motifs on their surface that react with conserved pattern recognition Toll-like receptors of the host. This interaction initiates a powerful innate immune response. Moreover, the infectious agent's surface proteins and carbohydrates come into contact with B-cell receptors, membrane-bound immunoglobulin of isotype M (IgM) or D (IgD), and often induce potent antibody responses, which take some weeks to fully develop [1] .

When a vertebrate organism encounters a pathogen, such as a virus or bacteria, it generates a polyclonal antibody response against numerous epitopes on different antigens during infection; therefore, polyclonal serum contains a large and diverse population of antibodies, which also include neutralizing antibodies (nAbs). Thus, polyclonal serum-derived biotherapeutic products can contain various nAbs against multiple and distinct epitopes; these nAbs provide strong protective activity due to additive or even synergistic effects on neutralization. However, in this type of product the vast majority of their constituent specific antibodies are non-neutralizing, since they are directed against misfolded protein or against epitopes on native surface proteins for which antibody binding is not protective [2, 3] . Furthermore, for some viral and bacterial infections, no correlates of protection have been established; therefore, the significance of antibody titers, apart from indicating past exposure, is not clear.

Mechanisms of immunological escape can explain why total antibody titers are not always protective. Many infectious organisms, including viruses, can constantly mutate surface proteins and exploit glycans to shield important epitopes, diverting the antibody response away from functionally important epitopes in favor of immunogenic irrelevant epitopes [4] .

Thanks to their protective properties, the administration of hyperimmune sera from immunized animals or immune human donors, named 'serum therapy', was the first effective treatment of infectious diseases. Later, the advent of antibiotic therapy with the advances in vaccine design has meant that serum therapy was almost abandoned for many infectious diseases. Nevertheless, hyperimmune human sera immunoglobulin preparations are still used to treat different bacterial toxins and virus related diseases, including those caused by cytomegalovirus (CMV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), hepatitis A virus (HAV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), rabies, vaccinia, vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and measles, underscoring the fact that antibody therapy remains an effective means of treatment [5, 6] .

Today, the ability to rapidly generate and manipulate antibodies with a defined epitope recognition, named ""monoclonal antibodies"" (mAbs) (Figure 1 ), has opened a new window of opportunity for a rematch of antibodies in clinical practice. This achievement has been possible thanks to advances in cellular biology and biotechnology (Figure 2) , and also to improved purification techniques which have made these therapeutics safer, less immunogenic and more effective. MAb preparations have many advantages over immune sera-derived preparations which can vary due to both time and the source of origin, since different hosts mount different antibody responses. One advantage is that mAbs, by virtue of the fact that they are chemically defined reagents, exhibit relatively low lot-tolot variability and low risk of pathogen transmission. Another advantage for mAb preparations is the much Figure 1 Schematic structure of a mAb. All immunoglobulins are composed of two identical light (L) chains and two identical heavy (H) chains, linked by disulphide bonds (black dashed bars). The heavy chains contain one variable domain (VH) and three or four constant domains (CH1, CH2, CH3 and CH4) depending on antibody isotype. By contrast, the light chains contain only one variable domain (VL) and a single constant domain (CL). Within the Fab region, at the end of the two arms of the Y-shaped molecule, the variable domain of a heavy chain pairs with the light chain variable domain to form the antigen-binding site. In more detail, within the matched V regions, three short polypeptide segments on the heavy chain and three on the light chain form the complementarity-determining regions (CDRs), which dictate the precise antigen-binding characteristics of the antibody. On the other end, the Fc domain, which includes the sites for interaction with the complement system and Fc receptors, mediates effector functions determining the fate of the bound antigen.

greater activity per mass of protein since all the Ig molecules are specific for the desired target. This phenomenon is illustrated by the report that two 0.7 mg doses of two mAbs provided the same protection against tetanus toxin as 100 to 170 mg of tetanus immunoglobulins [7] . Neither does mAb therapy have the immunological complications associated with the use of heterologous sera in humans, such as serum sickness and immediate hypersensitivity, which significantly limited the latter's usefulness [8] .

In recent years, mAbs have emerged as a new class of biological drugs in oncology as well as in immune and inflammatory diseases, albeit their development in infectious diseases has been slower. To date, the only mAb approved in this field is palivizumab, an anti-RSV mAb licensed for prevention of severe respiratory disease in high-risk infants and immunocompromised adults. Now the scenario is gradually changing and there are many antibodies against viruses and bacteria in various stages of clinical development. This trend has also been influenced by the development of different scientific disciplines, which makes it possible to study and dissect the function of individual microbial structures supporting Figure 2 Evolution of mAbs linked to the need to decrease their immunogenicity. Different methods to obtain mAbs are depicted. Mouse mAbs, the 'hybridoma' cells derived from the stable fusion of immortalized mouse myeloma cells with lymphocytes from immunized mice, are screened to identify individual clones producing identical antibody to a single antigenic determinant [118] . Chimeric mAbs, the murine constant regions of both heavy and light antibody chains (mCH and mCL), are replaced with human counterparts (hCH1, hCH2, hCH3 and hCL1), leaving intact the murine variable portions (mVH and mVL) [119] . Humanized mAbs, only the CDRs of the murine mAbs (mCDRs) from both the mVH and the mVL, are 'grafted' into a human backbone antibody [120, 121] . Human mAbs, 1)Human memory B-cells isolated from patients are immortalized by Epstein Barr Virus (EBV) and CpG oligodeoxynucleotide, and then screened for specific antibody production [122] . 2) Transgenic mice, obtained by a genetic replacement of the mouse immunoglobulin genes with human counterparts, are used to obtain fully human mAbs by traditional hybridoma technology [123] . 3) Antibody libraries, constructed by in vitro combinatorial assembly of human immunoglobulin variable-region gene (V genes) and cloned to provide the display onto phage surfaces, are subjected to a panning against an antigen in order to select specific clones [124] . The first mAbs of each category approved for clinical use are shown. Palivizumab is the first and, so far, only mAb approved for infectious diseases. The endings used to name the different types of mAbs are also indicated. the development of more targeted drugs. There are excellent reviews about this topic [6, 9] .

In this review we focus on the mAb-therapies now underway in clinical trials (Table 1 ) designed for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infectious diseases. Both these worldwide epidemics require new strategies due to the lack of a definitive cure and effective vaccines, to the continuous emergence of drug resistant variants, to the toxicities of licensed drugs and to the need to ensure a treatment for all patients. In this context, antibodies represent an intriguing alternative as therapeutics; in their favor are their different resistance mechanisms and a more favorable toxicity profile when compared to other available drug classes, fitting them for use in conjunction with the current chemotherapy by slowing the onset of resistance and possibly enhancing therapeutic efficacy.

The antibody structure comprises a pair of identical heavy and light chains linked by disulphide bonds held in a Yshaped arrangement (Figure 1 ). The fragment antigen-binding (Fab) portion, the region that binds the antigen, is composed of one variable and one constant domain of both the heavy and the light chain. The remaining constant sections of the longer heavy chains form the tail of the Y, termed the crystallizable fragment (Fc) region, which provides the signal for effector functions.

Antibodies can provide protective effects through various mechanisms [10] . Viral neutralization is generally meant as the ability of an antibody to provide sufficient steric interference to disrupt the interaction between a microbic antigen and its ligand in experimental conditions in vitro. This activity is clearly associated with protection, thanks to their Fab domain alone, both in natural infection and after immunization. Virus infection includes sequential steps beginning with attachment to cell-surface receptors and ending with delivery of the viral genetic material into the cytoplasm [11] . Fusion of viral and cellular membranes is a basic entry mode for enveloped viruses, such as HIV and HCV [12] , which still differ in specific aspects of viral entry and assembly, thus offering unique therapeutic opportunities. The cell surface is certainly more directly accessible for the action of the antibodies; therefore, the phase of virus entry is one of the most important targets in preventing viral infection at the origin, and many known nAbs act at this step. For the same reason, inhibition of the release of progeny virus is another possible mechanism of neutralization, as demonstrated by antibodies directed against influenza A virion surface neuraminidase [13] . In HIV and HCV fields, no virus release inhibiting antibodies have been identified to date. The interaction of HIV envelope surface protein gp120 with its host receptor, CD4, on human T cells triggers conformational changes in the envelope, resulting in exposure of a transient binding site for co-receptor CCR5 or CXCR4. This in turn promotes additional conformational changes in virus gp41 protein which allow it to insert its fusion peptide into the target cell membrane to initiate membrane fusion and viral entry into host cells. NAbs can inhibit viral infection by several different mechanisms in parallel with the steps that allow the viruses to enter into cells ( Figure 3 ). They can directly block virus attachment to target cells by interfering with virus-receptor interactions, as in the case of nAbs against the CD4-binding site on HIV gp120 [14] . This same goal can also be achieved by directing the antibodies to the virus receptor and/or co-receptor on host cells. MAbs can also block fusion at the cell membrane at the post-binding/pre-fusion stage, as exemplified by anti-CD4 [15] and/or anti-CCR5/CXCR4 (CCmotif receptor 5/CXC-motif receptor 4) mAbs, under development [16] . Again, mAbs directed to the external proximal membrane region of HIV gp41 can interfere with conformational changes needed for membrane fusion [17] .

Unlike HIV, HCV entry into target cells occurs via clathrin-mediated endocytosis of the viral particle [18] . Subsequent release of the viral genome into the cytosol requires the pH-dependent fusion of viral and cellular membranes. Current models suggest that HCV circulate as LipoViral-Particles (LVPs) in the vascular system, these consisting of lipoproteins in complex with virus particles. Following localization to the surface of hepatocytes through interactions of LVPs with glycosaminoglycans and the low density lipoprotein receptor, specific binding of the E1 and E2 virus surface glycoproteins with the host SR-B1 scavenger receptor and CD81 occur [19] . Subsequently, viral particles are translocated to regions of the membrane possessing tight junction proteins occludin and claudins; the binding to these receptors results in clathrin-mediated endocytosis. As for HIV, mAbs directed against spike viral proteins, as well as against host receptors, may act at an early stage of infection by preventing the binding of the virus on the cell surface. For example, antibodies recognizing the CD81-binding site within the envelope glycoprotein E2 have been shown to block viral entry, as have a number of anti-receptor antibodies targeting CD81 [20, 21] and SR-BI [22] . Some antibodies may act by blocking conformational changes and/or the requisite interactions between the viral and endosomal membranes required for fusion; although as yet no fusion determinant within the envelope glycoproteins has been defined.

Host protection in vivo is more complex and involves the interaction of antibodies with cells and molecules of the innate immune system. The antibody can exert protective actions through an Fc region-mediated recruitment of other components of the immune system, including antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC), complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) and antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis. Receptors for the Fc segment of IgG (Fcy receptors; FcγRs) are expressed on the surface of different types of cells, including natural killer cells (NK), monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells and neutrophils. With the exception of γδT cells, FcγRs are not normally found on T lymphocytes. Similarly, the receptor for Fc segment of IgA, the FcαR, involved in phagocytosis and induction of microbe killing, is expressed on monocytes, macrophages and neutrophils [23] .

The ADCC process is triggered by the interaction between the Fc region of an antibody bound to a nonself antigen exposed on host cells, and the Fc receptors on immune effector cells. The subsequent release of cytokines and cytotoxic granules containing perforins and granzymes promotes the death of the target cell. CDC is initiated by complement component C1q binding to the Fc region of IgG, which is in turn bound to the foreign antigen on the cell surface. This triggers a proteolytic cascade to activate the complement, so leading to the formation of a membrane attack complex that kills the target cell by disrupting its cell membrane. The Fc region can also mediate complement binding to and deposition on free virions, which can cause a direct virotoxic effect or inhibit virus binding to cells. Moreover, the so-called opsonization process, consisting of the binding of antibody Fab portion to the antigen following by the interaction of Fc domain to an Fc receptor on phagocytes, is a powerful mechanism to enhance the phagocytosis [9] .

With respect to HIV, a potential role for ADCC in modulating the course of HIV infection was first proposed on the basis of studies showing an inverse association between ADCC antibody levels and the clinical stage of disease. The strongest evidence for a role for ADCC antibody in disease progression comes from a study by Baum et al. of the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study [24] . In that study, rapid progressors had significantly lower ADCC antibody titers against CEM. NKR cells coated with gp120 than did non-rapid progressors at corresponding visits or non-progressors at any visit. Morever, HIV-infected individuals with spontaneously undetectable viremia were shown to have higher ADCC antibody levels than viremic subjects [25] .

In the context of HCV infection, Fc-mediated effector functions, although less well understood, can still have an important role. Sera from both the acute and chronic phase of infection can mediate ADCC via binding to viral protein E2 expressed at the cell surface [26] , while several E2-specific mAbs are able to induce CDC of E2-expressing cells [27] . Optimizing non-nAb effector functions, such as ADCC, CDC and fagogocytosis, may prove critical in the design of new effective anti-HCV therapeutic antibodies [28] . (1), as well as by binding to the viral receptor or co-receptor on host cell surface (2) . Some antibodies, can neutralize viral infection through interfering with conformational changes required for membrane fusion and subsequent release of the viral core into the target-cell cytoplasm; this postbinding neutralization may occur at the cell surface (3), or inside the endosomes for the viruses (for example, HCV) whose entry into the cell requires an endocytosis step (4). Antibodies recognizing viral or host proteins expressed on infected cell surface can exert protective actions through the Fc-mediated effector functions (for example, CDC, ADCC) (5). Again, mAbs may prevent the release of progeny virions (6) . At the bottom the antibody neutralizing effects on the viruses before cell binding, including the direct virolysis by CDC and the mAb-mediated enhanced phagocitosis, are shown (7) . In Panel B, the possible mAb-mediated immunomodulary therapies are depicted. In some chronic viral infections, virus-specific immune cells may persist in a 'non-functional' state, because of an imbalance of immunoregulatory signals involving multiple inhibitory and activating receptors, triggered by soluble factors and/or cell surface ligands. Therapeutic approaches using specific mAbs to block host immunosuppressive molecules (antagonism) or to trigger activating receptors (agonism) may be a valid strategy to restore immune cell function and treat various chronic viral infections.

system is the exhaustion of virus-specific T cells. Exhaustion consists of a progressive dysfunction characterized by the inability to proliferate and to produce key antiviral and immune stimulating cytokines (for example, interleukin (IL)-2, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a, interferon (IFN)-γ), or to lyse infected cells [29] .

A feature of functional exhaustion is that it affects many antiviral properties of both mouse and human CD8+ T cells. Loss of effector functions proceeds in a hierarchical manner starting with defects in IL-2 production and proliferation, followed by the decrease of TNF production. Cytotoxic activity is also lacking in exhausted human CD8 + T cells. At a severe stage of exhaustion, IFN-γ production is eventually compromised, with exhausted T cells ending up deleted if the high antigenic load persists [30] . Exhaustion can also occur in CD4+ T cells in both mice [31] and humans [32] . Probably the best explanation for this progressive dysfunction and loss of effector T cells is the continuous triggering of virus-specific T cell receptors owing to a high antigenic load in persistently infected hosts without a critical rest period. The current consensus is that functional exhaustion is a way of limiting the magnitude of effector T cell responses. Although this may safeguard against autoimmune responses, it may also compromise effective immunity against persistent infectious agents and tumors [29] .

Exhausted T cells are subject to complex layers of negative regulation. This involves signaling through multiple inhibitory receptors that inhibit functional and proliferative responses. The CD28 family member programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) has been shown to be the most highly expressed inhibitory receptor on CD8+ T cells during chronic infection, and to have a major role in regulating T cell exhaustion during infection [33, 34] . Increased expression of PD-1 by T cells also occurs during HBV and HCV infections [35] [36] [37] . Several other inhibitory receptors have also been shown to induce T cell unresponsiveness during chronic infections. These receptors include cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4) [31, 38, 39] , T cell immunoglobulin domain and mucin domain protein 3 (TIM3) [40, 41] , and lymphocyte activation gene 3 (LAG-3) [38] . In addition, certain cytokines, such as IL-10 and transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ) as well as regulatory T cells, may also contribute to the lack of T cell functionality during situations of high antigenic burden [42] .

There is intriguing evidence that blockade of the inhibitory receptor could restore antigen T cell responses. For example, blockade of the PD-1 signaling pathway improves antigen-specific T cell proliferation and cytokine secretion in lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV)-infected mice [31, 34] and in humans with chronic HIV [32, 43, 44] , HBV [45] and HCV [36] infections. This effect was synergistically improved in LCMV infected mouse following the simultaneous blockade of the T cell inhibitory receptors PD-1 and LAG-3, thanks to which a diminished viral load in vivo was observed, although blocking LAG-3 pathway alone had little effect on the severity of exhaustion [34] . Moreover, mAbmediated blocking of CTLA-4 pathway in vitro augments HIV-specific CD4+ T-cell function suggesting that the immune modulation of this target may also provide a clinical benefit in infected individuals [39] . Another example is the manipulation of signals mediated by glucocorticoid-induced TNF receptor (GITR), a recently identified member of the TNF receptor superfamily, preferentially expressed on subset CD4 +CD25+ regulatory T cells. GITR signals break the suppressive activity of this subset. In fact, an agonistic anti-GITR mAb immediately injected after viral infection significantly increased the number of activated CD4+ and CD8+ T cells secreting IFN-γ [46] .

One must remember that the manipulation of immunological responses could have detrimental effects on the host, as highlighted by the recent tragic human trial of TGN1412. This is a mAb against human T cell costimulatory molecule CD28 developed by TeGenero to treat B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, on the basis of its capability of inducing preferential activation and expansion of immunosuppressive regulatory T (Treg) cells, as observed in rodent models. TGN1412 has been termed a 'superagonist' because it binds to CD28 and activates T cells without the need for prior T cell antigen receptor (TCR) signaling. In a Phase I clinical trial (in March 2006), following administration of TGN1412, six healthy young men suffered a life-threatening cytokine-release syndrome (CRS) involving multi-organ failure, something unpredicted by the preclinical studies. It is now clear that in the presence of TGN1412, activated CD4+ effector memory T (T EM ) cells were the source of the cytokines that mediated the CRS observed in the volunteers. Treg cells were not able to prevent systemic inflammation, probably because the balance between activated Treg cell and T EM cell numbers is disadvantageous for humans compared with laboratory rodents. Furthermore, in macaques, but not in humans, CD4+ T cells lose CD28 expression during their differentiation into T EM cells; this detail, however, had gone unnoticed despite many years of primate testing. In conclusion, this model failed to prevent the disastrous case above [47] .

In view of these events, such a risk needs to be carefully assessed if the modulation of immune inhibitory or activating receptors is used for increasing the functional activity of virus-specific T cells in order to avoid nonspecific inflammation. These therapeutic approaches are being carefully evaluated for cancer as well as for HIV and HCV chronic viral disease.

Given the potential antiviral effect of the antibodies, viruses have evolved multiple mechanisms to protect themselves from antibody binding. One of these, the viral receptor glycosylation, is widely shared among different viruses. Carbohydrates are poorly immunogenic and, therefore, do not stimulate the response of type B lymphocytes and simultaneously hide the underlying protein structures. HCV E2 protein contains up to 11 potential Nlinked glycosylation sites. Specific glycans mask the CD81binding site and, therefore, nAb epitopes [48] . Lipid shielding may represent an additional strategy used by HCV to evade the antibody response. Current data suggest that key neutralizing epitopes are less accessible on LVPs. More recently, HCV has been found capable of direct cellto-cell transmission, which is largely resistant to antibody neutralization [49, 50] . HIV envelope protein is also glycosilated and changes occur in the frequency and position of glycans HIV gp120; these 'evolving glycan shields' have been shown to decrease sensitivity to antibody neutralization [51] . Other factors of antibody escape for HIV are: trimerization of the gp 120 and gp 41 that can shield vulnerable epitopes better exposed on the individual monomeric subunits; kinetic and spatial constraints that impede antibodies from accessing potentially vulnerable sites during receptor binding and membrane fusion process; the variable loops of gp120 that are a prime target for nAbs, which usually have a very narrow breadth of reactivity [52] . Finally, the high mutation rate of many viruses, including HIV and HCV, which undergo rapid antigenic variation, allows them to escape neutralization, constituting a significant hurdle for nAbs development.

All these problems may be counter-balanced by selecting nAbs which target conserved and more accessible areas of viral particles, and/or by using mixtures of nAbs which target various key epitopes. In fact, it has been demonstrated that combination therapy with mAb cocktails prevents escape variants for many viruses, including influenza [53] , coronavirus [54] and LCMV [55] , and that broad neutralization in the sera of most of some individual HIV infected donors can be associated with single or four to five principal specificities [56] .

Recent studies have indicated that nAbs play a critical role in HCV disease outcome. Viral clearance was associated with a rapid induction of neutralizing antibodies in the early phase of infection with some evidence that these antibodies are broadly reactive [57, 58] . In contrast, chronic HCV infection was characterized by absent or low-titer neutralizing antibodies in the early phase of infection and the persistence of infection, despite the induction of crossneutralizing antibodies in the later phase of infection. Current understanding of the nAb response raised against HCV suggests that E2 is the major target, and that multiple epitopes within E2 may be targeted by both linear-and conformation-dependent antibodies. Predominantly, these neutralization epitopes overlap with CD81binding sites and clearly demonstrate a role in inhibition of entry. Currently, one of these mAbs, MBL-HCV1, is being investigated in clinical trials in the prevention of liver re-infection after transplantation, for which novel antiviral preventive and therapeutic strategies are urgently needed. In fact, re-infection of the graft is universal, being characterized by accelerated progression of liver disease; IFN-based therapies exhibit enhanced adverse effects and limited efficacy in these patients [59, 60] . MBL-HCV1 is a fully human monoclonal antibody isolated from transgenic mice and directed to a highly conserved linear epitope of HCV E2 glycoprotein. It is able to neutralize pseudoviruses from multiple HCV genotypes and has demonstrated efficacy in preventing HCV genotype-1 infection in HCV naïve chimpanzees. A phase I open-labeled, dose escalation study was performed in healthy adult volunteers starting with 1 mg/kg and escalating to 3, 10, 30 and 50 mg/kg after a 10-day post-infusion safety review. MBL-HCV1 was well-tolerated without any seriously adverse effect event. Based on the favorable safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics data, a phase II study of MBL-HCV1 in chronically infected HCV patients undergoing liver transplantation has been planned [61] .

In the context of HIV disease, despite intensive study over two decades, only a small number of broadly neutralizing mAbs have been identified from infected patients and little is known about their activity in vivo. These antibodies are able to inhibit viral entry of most primary HIV isolates in vitro [17, [62] [63] [64] and the exceptionally high level of mutation found in their genes may reflect chronic immune responses to HIV and persistent hypermutation and selection [65] . A number of trials evaluating different formulations of anti-HIV monoclonal antibodies are now in progress.

The first trial assessed a chimeric monoclonal antibody CGP 47,439 to the V3 loop of the HIV-1 envelope gp120 over 21 weeks [66, 67] . Subsequent studies evaluated the kinetics of monoclonal antibody F105 directed to the CD4-binding site of gp120 [68, 69] , a humanized antibody binding to the V3 epitope GPGRAF [70] . Finally, a humanized mAb, KD-247 is under evaluation in clinical trials. Its epitope was mapped to 6 aa, IGPGRA, at the tip of the V3 loop of Envelope protein and demonstrates crossneutralizing activity against HIV-1 isolates in clade B [71] .

A drug based on the mAb cocktail mode is also currently in clinical development. In this regard it has already been observed that in HIV neutralization assays the effectiveness of a mix of broadly neutralizing antibodies increased synergistically compared to the effect of the individual antibody. The synergy effect was relatively weak, with a maximum of two-to four-fold enhancement, between antibody pairs, thereby increasing neutralization titers about 10-fold in triple and quadruple antibody combinations [72] . However, the use of antibodies in the cocktail mode, as an approach to improve their effectiveness, is already recognized for other pathogens or toxins. In the case of tetanus toxin, it has been reported that combining the action of three out of four antibodies increased the neutralizing activity up to 200 times [73] . In the case of botulinum toxin, neutralizing activity has been reported up to 20,000 times higher when using a mixture of three monoclonal antibodies [74] . Instead, other studies have demonstrated that the combination of two potent neutralizing mAbs against HIV, VRC01 and PG9, although not synergistic, can mediate additive neutralization viral activity and provides an improved neutralization coverage of 90% to 97% of viral strains by combining independent epitope targeting [75] .

In a proof-of-concept passive immunization trial with humans, it has been demonstrated that a cocktail of the three broadly neutralizing mAbs -2G12, 4E10 and 2F5was able to delay viral rebound in patients whose infections were fully suppressed by antiretroviral treatment before administration of the antibodies [76] . Interestingly, the main antiviral effect observed was primarily attributable to the 2G12 antibody, a mAb that binds to a noncontinuous epitope composed of glycosylation residues distributed over the envelope protein gp120 [64] , whereas the other two mAbs, 4E10 [77] and 2F5 [78] , recognize two adjacent highly conserved epitopes on the membrane-proximal ectodomain of the HIV-1 envelope protein gp41. In earlier phase I clinical trials, safety and tolerability were demonstrated [79, 80] . During a longterm multiple dose phase II clinical trial, high doses of the three neutralizing antibodies were given in combination to 14 HIV-1-infected individuals at weekly intervals over three months. Pharmacokinetic analysis revealed that repeated infusions at high dose levels were well tolerated by the patients and did not elicit an endogenous immune response against the monoclonal antibodies. The antibodies showed distribution and elimination kinetics similar to those seen for other human-like antibodies, though monoclonal antibody 2G12 had a significantly longer elimination half-life (21.8 +/-7.2 days) than monoclonal antibodies 4E10 (5.5 +/-2.2 days) and 2F5 (4.3 +/-1.1 days) [81] . Furthermore, analyses of the emergence of mutations conferring resistance to these three mAbs were performed. Sequence analysis of the 2G12 epitope relevant N-glycosylation sites of viruses derived from 13 patients demonstrated that mutations in these sites are associated with resistance. In vitro selection experiments with isolates of four of these individuals corroborated the in vivo finding that virus strains rapidly escape 2G12 pressure. Importantly, in vitro selection with 2F5 and 4E10 demonstrated that resistance to these nAbs can be difficult to achieve and can lead to selection of variants with impaired infectivity [82] . Moreover, generation of viruses resistant to the triple-combination was a slower process characterized by recurrent loss of virus replication; some generated triple-resistant viruses seemed to be impaired in their replicative fitness, and none of the patients developed detectable viruses that escaped neutralization by all three mAbs within the 77day observation period [83] .

As is true with all mAbs designed for infectious disease, the development of a successful vaccine would reduce the need for them. However, given the scarcity of drugs in the field of virology and given the slow progress on the HIV vaccine front, the development and use of microbicides, compounds that could be applied topically to prevent HIV transmission, is one of the possible strategies to counter the spread of HIV. In this regard, mAbs could be proposed as suitable components of microbicides to fight HIV entry at mucosal surface. A safety study of P2G12 mAb administered vaginally in healthy women has been completed. P2G12 is the broadly neutralizing 2G12 mAb manufactured from tobacco plants [84] . Most mAbs in clinical trials have been produced using a system called Chinese Hamster Ovary cell (CHO-Cell) fermentation [85] , including 2G12 used along with 2F5 and 4E10 antibodies as a cocktail. The CHO-Cell fermentation production method is very expensive and cannot produce enough mAbs on a scale required for the global market; therefore, plant manufacture of such mAbs may hopefully offer some solutions to lower production costs and improve output. The process yields five grams of purified antibody from 250 kg of tobacco and production costs could be 10 to 100 times lower than when using conventional bioreactors. This study has been designed to confirm the safety of a vaginally delivered mAb P2G12 derived from plants and manufactured to Good Manufacturing Practice (a quality standard used for the manufacture of medicinal products). The medicine is the first plant-produced antibody to be greenlit for clinical testing by Britain's Medicines and Healthcare products Agency (MHRA). It took about a year to get that agency's stamp of approval because it required assurances that the drugs did not contain allergenic plant sugars or pesticides. No matter how it is produced, P2G12 antibody has not been shown to actually prevent HIV-1 infection in clinical trials; thus a version made from tobacco plants would not see approval any time soon. P2G12 would also likely be just one ingredient in a cocktail of plant-produced antibodies [84] .

To eliminate or reduce the development of escape variants it has been proposed that targeting the conserved cellular receptors of the virus may open new avenues for a viable antibody therapy for HIV infection. HIV entry into CD4+ T cells requires the presence of a co-receptor, either CCR5 or CXCR4, on the target cell. Thus, based on this hypothesis, mAbs directed against CD4 and against the co-receptor CCR5, have been developed and are being analyzed in clinical trials.

CD4 functions as a co-receptor, physically associating with the TCR during Ag recognition by binding to a nonpolymorphic component of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules on the surface of the antigen-presenting cell. Ibalizumab, a humanized mAb, binds CD4 on T cell surface away from the binding site for MHC class II molecules. It does not inhibit gp120 binding to CD4 but appears to exert its antiviral property by post-binding conformational effects that prevent CD4bound gp120 from interacting with CCR5 or CXCR4 [19, 86] . By contrast, other monoclonal antibodies, that competitively inhibit gp120 binding, interfere with MHC class II immune function [87, 88] . The reported human experience with Ibalizumab consists of three clinical trials. During phase I study, it was observed that peak mean reductions in viral load occurred later in the higher dose cohorts, whereas the extent and duration of viral suppression correlated with the degree of CD4+ cell coating by ibalizumab, which was maintained longer in the higher dose cohorts, with a duration of 15 to 34 days. Peak increases in CD4 counts at one day after infusion, well before the peak declines in viral load; this suggests that the increase may have been due to redistribution of CD4+ cells from lymphoid tissue rather than regeneration of CD4+ cells in the setting of viral suppression. A multidose study demonstrated continued safety over an extended treatment period and provided data on the development of ibalizumab resistance. Resistance testing showed reduced susceptibility relative to baseline. Resistant isolates remained dependent on CD4 for viral entry, suggesting that resistance did not develop through the use of alternative receptors. Genotypic analysis was unable to identify mutations, diagnostic of ibalizumab resistance. Consistent with the allosteric mechanism of ibalizumab's anti-HIV-1 effect, the development of resistance is associated with a reduction in the maximum percentage inhibition rather than the shift in the IC50 characteristic of competitive inhibitors [89, 90] . The half-life of IgGs under normal physiological circumstances is two to three weeks [91] . In contrast, the average half-life of ibalizumab is 3 to 3.5 days [89] . This is consistent with observations of other anti-CD4 antibodies, in which internalization or shedding of the receptor results in more rapid antibody degradation. A randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, phase IIa study has evaluated the ibalizumab efficacy, the results showing a considerable viral load reduction with respect to the placebo arm [92] .

CCR5 is a chemokine receptor that mediates activation and migration of T cells and other leukocytes. CCR5using (R5) viruses typically mediate transmission and then predominate through the progression to symptomatic disease. Viruses can use an alternative chemokine receptor, CXCR4, either exclusively or in addition to CCR5. The CXCR4-using virus can be present initially, but tends to result in an increasing proportion of subjects in the later stages of the disease [93] . CCR5 co-receptor antagonists represent an emerging antiretroviral treatment class and the first to target a host molecule.

Currently, two anti-CCR5 mAbs are being investigated. One of these is CCR5mAb004, a fully human IgG4 monoclonal antibody with robust activity against a diverse panel of HIV-1 isolates; it synergizes in vitro with other ARV classes and appears safe and effective in reducing HIV viral load. High levels of receptor occupancy were observed for 14 to 28 days with the highest dose cohorts, suggesting the potential for weekly, fortnightly or even monthly dosing [94] .

The other anti-CCR5 mAb is PRO 140, a humanized mAb that also synergizes with small-molecule CCR5 antagonists in laboratory studies [95] . PRO140 is being investigated in two modes of administration: the classical intravenous (IV) form, and subcutaneous (SC) form. The trial involving SC administration is the first to bear the proof of concept for a mAb administered subcutaneously in HIV-1 infected subjects as a potent and longacting antiretroviral agent.

An IV form of PRO 140 tested as monotherapy in HIV-1 subjects with only R5 virus detectable [96] demonstrated potent and prolonged antiviral activity, with a 1.83 log10 mean reduction in HIV-1 RNA and safety relative to placebo. The successive randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled IIa trial examined the antiviral activity, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of single intravenous infusions of up to 10-mg/kg of mAbs. All PRO 140-treated subjects treated with 10 mg/kg experienced a 1-log10-unit reduction in HIV-1 RNA level, there being just one exception; a post-study analysis using the enhanced-sensitivity Trofile assay determined that this subject had dual/mixed virus at screening. There was no change in co-receptor tropism or emergence of PRO 140-resistant virus during the course of this study, supporting the view that PRO 140 broadly inhibits R5 HIV-1 with a high barrier to resistance. The maximum tolerated dose of IV PRO 140 has not been determined, suggesting a sizeable margin of safety for PRO 140 SC administration study [97] .

The study involving PRO 140 SC administration showed virologic suppression between successive doses and no changes in R5 viral susceptibility to PRO 140 following three weeks of monotherapy, indicating no adaptation of virus to use CCR5 in the presence of drug. Pharmacokinetic data suggest the possibility of a drug regimen administered fortnightly for HIV infected individuals. Proteins and other macromolecules drain from SC sites into both blood capillaries and the lymphatic system. In animals, proteins with molecular weights of greater than 16,000 daltons have been observed to drain primarily into the lymphatic system following SC administration [98] . Such proteins transit through lymph fluid and typically are not absorbed significantly into the blood until they reach the thoracic duct. Since the molecular weight of PRO 140 is approximately 150,000 daltons, a substantial amount of SC PRO 140 can be expected to drain into the lymphatic system and potentially encounter CCR5+ cells in lymphoid tissues prior to reaching the bloodstream. For these reasons, serum concentrations may not provide a full picture of the overall exposure following SC dosing of PRO 140. SC infusion is currently used by individuals with primary immunodeficiency to self-administer at home significantly larger amounts (approximately 11 grams) and volumes (approximately 70 mL total, up to 15 mL/site) of the weekly SC-administered immunoglobulin [99] . Self-administration of 324 mg SC PRO 140 would be much simpler in comparison. Therefore, SC PRO 140 offers the potential for significant dose-dependent HIV-1 RNA suppression and may offer greater convenience for many patients in terms of patient selfadministration [100] .

The SC injection mode was chosen in order to evaluate PRO140 safety and efficacy as an adjunct to an oral antiretroviral regimen in HIV-infected injection drug users with viral rebound and documented poor adherence to the previous antiretroviral regimen. Therefore, a phase IIb, national, multicenter, randomized, doubleblind, placebo-controlled study was initiated and is currently recruiting participants. Given the complications that arise from the occurrence of drug resistances, the use of antibodies together with combined therapy increases the drug number and, therefore, the therapeutic opportunities. In particular, in the case of CCR5 inhibitors, one report has demonstrated that resistance to CCR5 inhibitors may increase the sensitivity of the resistant virus to certain neutralizing antibodies [101] .

Compared to CCR5, CXCR4-based blocking agents as therapy against HIV are less attractive due to the crucial role of CXCR4 in many biological processes, and the absence to date of known naturally occurring mutations leading to the inactivation of CXCR4 gene in humans. Moreover, one major problem is linked to the fact that, whereas R5 viruses are found on their own in 50% or more of patients, viruses that using CXCR4 co-receptor (X4) usually are present mixed together with R5 viruses; therefore, the use of CXCR4 specific mAbs could result in only little or transient effect on the overall viremia, also complicating the evaluation of pharmacological activity. However, antibodies against CXCR4 might still provide some benefits for some HIV positive patients when co-administrated with CCR5 antagonists, if the safety of such combinations is established [93] .

There is a pressing need for antiviral agents that are effective against multiple classes of viruses. Broad specificity might be achieved by targeting phospholipids that are widely expressed on infected host cells or on viral envelopes. Phosphatidylserine (PS), the most abundant anionic phospholipid of the plasma membrane, is segregated at the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane of resting mammalian cells. Loss of PS asymmetry occurs during apoptosis, cell injury, cell activation and malignant transformation, and results from inhibition of the translocases or activation of PS exporters, or lipid scrambling enzymes, such as scramblases. After enveloped viruses replicate within the host cell, they create their 'envelope' by carrying along part of the host cell's membrane upon exiting. As a result, the target phospholipid becomes exposed on the surface of the virus as well as on the infected host cell [102] .

Bavituximab is the first in a new class of patented antibody therapeutics that target and, preferentially bind, to these exposed phospholipids. It has demonstrated broad therapeutic potential across multiple oncology indications and represents a new approach to treating viral disease, too. Bavituximab is currently being evaluated in randomized phase II clinical trials for non-small cell lung cancer and pancreatic cancer, for therapy of chronic HCV infection and for HIV/HCV co-infection. The therapeutic effect of bavituximab appears to be due to ADCC of tumor and virus-infected cells. Since PS exposure is an early event during virus infection, ADCC may limit virus spread. Furthermore, in the infectious disease setting, bavituximab causes opsonization and clearance of infectious virus from the bloodstream, leaving less virus to infect other tissues. Three completed phase I HCV clinical trials have shown that bavituximab is generally safe and well-tolerated. Reductions in serum HCV RNA levels were also observed. A randomized phase II clinical trial with previously untreated HCV genotype-1 infected patients was designed to determine the early virologic response (EVR) rate after 12 weeks of therapy with bavituximab in combination with the antiviral drug ribavirin and safety profile versus pegylated IFN-α-2a and ribavirin. The results show that the combination of bavituximab with ribavirin has a better safety profile than an IFN-containing regimen. However, the EVR development in the bavituximab-containing arm was later than the IFN-containing group; therefore, a longer-term evaluation is needed to adequately compare their effectiveness. In addition, the lower dose level appears to be more active in HCV patients than the high dose does. Such results suggest that future studies evaluating longer bavituximab treatment durations at or around the lower dose level in combination with ribavirin and potentially direct acting antivirals in certain patient populations may hold promise as IFN-free HCV therapeutic regimens [103] .

Targeting PS on cells infected with multiple different viruses and on virions themselves is a promising antiviral strategy. Although resistance has developed in monotherapy trials with ibalizumab (an anti-CD4 antibody), host-derived antigen, such as anionic phospholipids, on virus-infected cells are independent of the viral genome and as a consequence the acquisition of drug resistance should be theoretically less problematic than with agents that target virus-encoded components.

Since the discovery of PD-1 as an inhibitory receptor associated with T-cell dysfunction, the roles of various inhibitory receptors on virus-specific CD8+ T cells have been extensively studied in human chronic viral infections, such as HCV, HBV and HIV infections. As blocking the inhibitory receptors in vitro restores the functions of virus-specific T cells, novel HIV and HCV treatments based on blockade of several immune checkpoint molecules are being investigated. In particular, mAbs interfering with two major inhibitory networks of the B7:CD28 family, namely the PD-1 and CTLA-4 pathways [104] , are currently being studied in clinical trials, to evaluate their safety and efficacy. These mAbs recognize the PD-1 or CTLA-4 receptor and neutralize the binding with their respective ligands.

The PD-1:PD-L1 pathway delivers inhibitory signals which regulate T cell activation. As a result it performs a key role in various processes, namely in multiple tolerance checkpoints that prevent autoimmunity, in the suppressive tumor microenvironment, in the immune-mediated tissue damage, in host defenses aimed at eradicating microbial pathogens and tumors and finally, in T cell exhaustion that contributes to both lack of viral control during chronic infections and to T cell unresponsiveness [105] . In cancers, a strong correlation between increased PD-L1 expression on tumors and a negative survival prognosis in patients has already been observed. Various studies indicate that mAbs targeting the PD-1 signaling pathway reinvigorate antigen-specific T-cell responses and promote an immune response to fight tumors [106] . In HCV infection the relationship between the PD-1 expression and the outcome of the acute HCV infection was questioned; subsequently, recent studies have shown that the progression of acute HCV infection to the chronic stage is associated with a high level of PD-1 on HCV-specific CD8+ T cells, whereas the clearance of HCV infection is associated with lower levels of PD-1 expression [36] .

Given these premises, MDX-1106, a fully human antibody also known as ONO-4538, and CT-011, a humanized antibody, both interacting with PD-1 receptor, are being developed as a treatment for cancer disease and for therapy of chronic HCV infection [107] . To date, most clinical experience with PD-1 blockade has been gained with MDX-1106 in the tumor setting. Drug-related grade 3 or 4 toxic effects occurred in 14% of patients, in whom there were drug-related adverse events of special interest, those with potential immune-related causes; they included pneumonitis, vitiligo, colitis, hepatitis, hypophysitis and thyroiditis. Pneumonitis (3%) ranged from isolated radiographic abnormalities to progressive, diffuse infiltrates associated with clinical symptoms in a small number of patients. Although three deaths occurred, mild-to-moderate pneumonitis was managed successfully with either observation or glucocorticoids. However, objective responses were observed in approximately one in four to one in five patients with non-small-cell lung cancer, melanoma, or renal-cell cancer; overall, an adverse-event profile does not appear to preclude its use [108] . Besides these studies, an ongoing phase I safety trial with active hepatitis C genotype 1 infected patients has been designed to assess the safety and tolerability profile of MDX-1106 [109] . Clinical studies to evaluate the use of CT-011 in HCV disease have also been initiated [110] .

CTLA-4 is up-regulated on activated T cells and inhibits T cell activation by reducing the production of IL-2 and arresting cell cycle progression. CTLA-4 has also been shown to have an impact on T cell responses in animal tumor models and humans [111, 112] . Human trials that used a blocking anti-CTLA-4 mAb demonstrated a reduction in tumor mass and clinical benefit in a substantial minority of treated subjects. Studies of the role for CTLA-4 in chronic infections have produced mixed results. In chronic HIV infection, many studies indicate that impaired CD4+ T cell function is associated with viral persistence [113] , although the function of CTLA-4 in causing HIV persistence by suppressing T cell function remains unclear [114] . On the other hand, CTLA-4's role in chronic HCV infection seems to be more defined. The HCV-specific CD8+ T cells found in the livers of chronic HCV patients overexpressed not only PD-1, but also CTLA-4. Co-expression of PD-1 and CTLA-4 was observed in liverinfiltrating lymphocytes, but not in peripheral blood lymphocytes [36] , suggesting the phenotypic differences of virus-specific CD8+ T cells in different in vivo compartments. PD-1 and CTLA-4 expressing HCV-specific T cells were profoundly dysfunctional [115] .

Tremelimumab is a fully human IgG2 mAb directed against CTLA-4. While a phase II study for HIV disease with this drug has been withdrawn prior to enrollment, clinical trials for HCV disease are still underway. Tremelimumab binds to activated T lymphocytes and results in inhibition of B7-CTLA-4-mediated down-regulation of Tcell activation. It also acts as an IL-2 stimulant. It was generated, using XenoMouse technology (Figure 2) , as an anticancer agent and is currently in worldwide phase III development for malignant melanoma, phase II development for colorectal cancer, gastrointestinal cancer, gynecological cancer and non-small cell lung cancer in the US and other countries. It is also being investigated for prostate, breast and pancreatic cancer in various countries. As for anti-PD-1 antibodies, immune-related adverse effects of tremelimumab are of special interest because of its presumed mechanism of action. Most of the experience in identifying and managing CTLA-4 treatment-related side effects has derived from studies in cancer, particularly in melanoma. These effects mainly include colitis/diarrhea, dermatitis, hepatitis and endocrinopathies; uveitis, nephritis and inflammatory myopathy also have been occasionally reported. These unique side effects are likely a direct result of breaking immune tolerance upon CTLA-4 blockade; they are generally mild, reversible and manageable, following specific treatment guidelines that include symptomatic therapies or systemic corticosteroids [116] . In December 2008, Pfizer initiated a phase II trial in patients with latestage unresectable liver cancer who also have hepatitis C infections. The primary endpoint of this single-armed study is the ability of tremelimumab to produce tumor responses among HCV-infected patients with hepatocellular carcinoma and to produce changes in hepatitis C viral load. The first results indicate that tremelimumab demonstrated an excellent safety profile, with a promising antitumor efficacy against HCC in 17 patients, as well as an intense antiviral activity. In fact, a significant and progressive decline in serum HCV viral load was observed, this being associated with an increase in anti-HCV immune response in 76% of patients [117] .

Since there are multiple levels of immunoregulation, a synergistic use of antibodies against different checkpoint molecules might represent the next stage in immunotherapy for chronic infectious diseases, as evidenced from ex vivo studies about the combined PD-1/CTLA-4 blockade in HCV disease [36] . Furthermore, because the host mechanisms that inhibit T cell activity are common and conserved aside from specific virus-encoded immune evasion strategies, the antibodies targeting inhibitory receptors may prove extremely versatile drugs potentially effective against multiple classes of viruses.

The need to treat HIV and HCV infectious diseases, two epidemics of global impact, has reawakened interest in mAb-based therapy, supporting a variety of clinical studies. The results that are emerging, will help to create models for the further development of such drugs and extend their use against other viruses as well.

Although the mAb production costs are high, increasing advances of biotechnology and production systems will make them more competitive on the market, and new approaches, such as using mAb cocktails or combining mAbs with available drugs, will improve effectiveness. Treatment with mAbs as part of a drug regimen is the most likely future for mAbs that block HCV and HIV infection in order to avoid viral escape, while chronic treatment could attract further investments from pharmaceutical companies. Furthermore, broad spectrum mAbs, such as bavituximab and immunomodulatory mAbs, could be useful against a whole range of diseases, thus extending marketability and profit margins.

This review has focused on the use of intact mAbs as a novel emerging and versatile class of pharmaceuticals. It is important to note, however, that biotechnology also provides the opportunity to build various antibody formats whose improved pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamic properties could be co-opted in the fight against infectious diseases. resistance to antiretroviral drugs; the mechanisms of immune reconstitution; and, finally, operational and implementation research in resource limited settings. He chaired or participated in many international clinical studies on antiretroviral therapy, and he is currently the coordinator of the -European Commission-funded HIV Clinical Trials Network (NEAT).

Human monoclonal antibodies as candidate therapeutics against emerging viruses,"The emergence of new pathogens, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and Ebola virus, poses serious challenges to global public health and highlights the urgent need for novel antiviral approaches. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have been successfully used to treat various diseases, particularly cancer and immunological disorders. Antigen-specific mAbs have been isolated using several different approaches, including hybridoma, transgenic mice, phage display, yeast display, and single B-cell isolation. Consequently, an increasing number of mAbs, which exhibit high potency against emerging viruses in vitro and in animal models of infection, have been developed. In this paper, we summarize historical trends and recent developments in mAb discovery, compare the advantages and disadvantages of various approaches to mAb production, and discuss the potential use of such strategies for the development of antivirals against emerging diseases. We also review the application of recently developed human mAbs against SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and Ebola virus and discuss prospects for the development of mAbs as therapeutic agents against emerging viral diseases.","Emerging infectious diseases are infectious diseases caused by previously unknown or unnoticed pathogenic microorganisms. Such pathogens, which are mostly viruses, could be newly discovered or are previously known and under control but have recently reemerged with rapidly increasing incidence and/or geographic ranges. Outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases pose serious challenges to global public health. Three recent examples illustrate the challenges presented by emerging infectious diseases. First, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), which emerged as a pandemic in 2002 and 2003, was caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), a previously unknown virus. This virus was first isolated in 2003 from the specimens of three patients with SARS [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] . According to the World Health Organization (WHO), SARS infected more than 8000 people and caused at least 813 deaths [6] . A specific therapeutic agent or effective vaccine against SARS was unavailable at the time of the initial outbreak. Fortunately, SARS was successfully contained, and no additional SARS outbreaks have been reported since 2004. The second example comes from the Ebola virus outbreaks. Although the first recognized outbreak of Ebola virus occurred in 1976, a novel variant of the Ebola virus emerged in West African nations in March 2014 [7] . WHO estimated that as of March 27, 2016, 28 646 cases and 11 323 deaths have occurred during this recent outbreak [8] . The third example is Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), which is caused by Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), a novel coronavirus. A decade after the SARS epidemic, MERS first appeared in Saudi Arabia and soon spread to 26 other countries, including the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Oman, Jordan, Kuwait, Yemen, and Lebanon. MERS led to the infection of over 2000 individuals with~35% fatality rate (http:// www.who.int/csr/don/21-september-2017-mers-uae/en/). These three recent outbreaks clearly showed that emerging diseases pose a considerable threat to public health.

Effective treatments need to be developed in the face of the tremendous challenges posed by emerging infectious diseases. Monoclonal antibody (mAb)-based therapies have been recently used in the treatment of various infections. For example, mAb treatment is correlated with increased antibody levels and decreased Ebola viral load without observed adverse effects [9] . This review focuses on the application of mAbs as therapeutic agents against emerging viruses, as exemplified by SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and Ebola virus. We begin with brief historical remarks and then highlight important characteristics of these three emerging viruses and their candidate mAbbased therapies.

Historical perspective: from antibodybased serum therapy to mAb therapy Active vaccination stimulates the production of antitoxins (antibodies) in serum. In the 1890s, Emil von Behring and Paul Ehrlich first used serum from immunized horses to treat diphtheria [10] . The serum contained a small amount of neutralizing antibodies that could neutralize toxins associated with the pathogenesis of diphtheria. Serum therapy thus provided a new treatment option against severe bacterial infections. Antibodies of the immunoglobulin G (IgG) class are typically preferred as therapeutic antibodies. IgG is one of the most abundant proteins in human serum. IgG has neutralizing effects, activates complement systems and effector cells to kill pathogens and infected cells, and triggers phagocytic cells [11] .

After its initial successes, serum therapy was extensively used for the prophylaxis and therapy of viral and bacterial diseases. Although it was effective against several diseases, it had numerous side effects and thus was almost abandoned after the discovery of antibiotics in the 1930s. Moreover, antibiotic therapy was more desirable than serum therapy for the treatment of bacterial infections given its lower production costs and toxicity and fewer side effects. However, antibiotics are ineffective against viral infections. In addition, the extensive use of antibiotics has led to the development of multidrug-resistant bacteria. Therefore, despite its toxicity-related problems, including the risk for allergic reactions, lot-to-lot variation, and uncertain dosing, antibody-based serum therapy is still being used for the prevention or treatment of several viral diseases, including cytomegaloviral infection, hepatitis A, hepatitis B, rabies, and measles [12] [13] [14] .

The fundamental limitation of serum therapy is attributed to the polyclonal nature of antibodies. Functional antibodies in a polyclonal preparation typically account for a small portion of the total antibodies; the remaining antibodies are not only ineffective but may even be toxic or immunogenic [12, 13] . Therefore, the clinical application of antibodies remained limited until the 1970s when antibody-based therapies were rejuvenated by the discovery of technologies for mAb production.

In the 1970s, Kohler et al. generated mouse hybridoma cells through the fusion of mouse myeloma cells with mouse spleen cells after immunization with sheep red blood cells [15] . Hybridoma cells could specifically produce anti-sheep erythrocyte antibodies. The development of hybridoma technology allowed the production of mAbs, which are homogenous antibodies with the same specificity and a single Ig class and isotype. These mAbs were quickly applied in clinical settings. However, the application of these mAbs to humans led to a human antimouse antibody response (HAMA reaction). The strategy for attenuating or avoiding the HAMA reaction is to either humanize the mouse mAb or develop fully human mAbs (hmAbs). With the development of hmAbs over the 1970s to the 1990s, mAbs have been used in the treatment of various diseases, including cancer, auto-immune diseases, and infectious diseases [13, 14] .

Although human-mouse chimeric mAbs (by replacing mouse IgG Fc with that from humans) or humanized mAbs (by replacing human complementarity-determining regions with that from mice) are effective in clinical settings, they still contain portions of mouse origin, which can induce immunogenicity and HAMA reaction. In 1985, Smith et al. developed the phage display technique [16] . This technique is mainly characterized by expression of a specific protein on the phage surface and the integration of the protein gene into the phage DNA [17, 18] . These processes led to the generation of phage-displayed antibody libraries with random pairs of antibody heavy and light chains, enabling the use of appropriate target antigens to screen specific antibodies with high affinity to the antigen ( Fig. 1) [19, 20] . The phage display technology is extensively used to generate fully human antibody libraries, which consequently provide a rapid and highly effective approach for obtaining specific antibodies against infectious diseases.

Humanized transgenic mice also provide a valuable platform for the generation of fully human therapeutic antibodies. In humanized transgenic mice, the endogenous mouse antibody gene is replaced by human Ig loci [21, 22] . Transgenic mice are then immunized with the target antigen to ensure the expression of specific human antibodies against the target antigen. Kymab and VelocImmune mice are representative transgenic mouse models [21, 22] that produce high yields of high-affinity human antibodies. However, the effects of the differences between mouse and human immune systems, especially antibody affinity maturation pathways, on clinical outcomes remain unknown.

Several other methodologies, including yeast display and single B cell isolation, have been recently used to successfully identify candidate therapeutic antibodies. The principles of yeast display are similar to that of phage display. The most common yeast surface display system involves the connection of the displayed antibody fragment to the C terminus of the Aga2p subunit, which is linked to Aga1p subunit by two disulfide bonds [23, 24] . The yeast display system is ideal for antibody affinity maturation due to the effectiveness of flow cytometry in discriminating between strong and weak affinity binders [25, 26] .

The initial step in single B-cell isolation is the selection of antigen-positive B cells through fluorescence-activated cell sorting, antigen-coated magnetic bead systems, microengraving, or cell-based micro-array chip systems [27] [28] [29] . B cells could be immortalized through Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) transformation [30, 31] . Heavy-and light-chain sequences are then obtained through reverse transcriptionpolymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Although this single B-cell isolation can be used to efficiently isolate potent neutralizing antibodies, it is time-consuming and requires a Fig. 1 Workflow of mAb discovery using a phage display library. First, human heavy and light chain genes are obtained from the B cells of donors and are then inserted into a phagemid vector. Antibodies in Fab or single-chain variable region fragment (scFv) format are displayed on the surfaces of phages. The target antigen is coupled to magnetic beads or coated on plates, then cyclically panned for the selection of phages with the desired target specificity and affinity. Enriched binders are selected for subsequent cloning, expression, and characterization. [34, 35] . The virulence of these five Ebola viruses varies, and ZEBOV has the highest mortality rate of 90% [7] .

The genome of the Ebola virus encodes seven structural or multifunctional proteins: envelope glycoprotein (GP); nucleoprotein (NP); RNA polymerase L; and viral proteins vP30, vP24, vP35, and vP40 [36, 37] . GP is embedded on the virion surface and is a type I transmembrane glycoprotein. It is encoded by 676 amino acids. After transcriptional modifications, GP consists of soluble GP and small soluble GP. GP function is closely associated with receptor binding and viral entry and with coagulation abnormalities in patients infected with the Ebola virus. In addition, GP-mediated cytotoxicity is associated with the pathogenesis of different Ebola subtypes. GP is thus an ideal target for anti-Ebola drugs [38, 39] . Furthermore, theoretical analysis has revealed that the antigenic epitope of GP is largest out of all epitopes in the Ebola virus [40] [41] [42] . A vaccine test based on GP and NP showed that GP has good immunogenic effects. In other words, GP alone is enough to induce the production of protective antibodies against a fatal Ebola virus attack. Meanwhile, immunization with NP alone does not exert a protective effect, further suggesting that GP is an ideal target for the development of neutralizing antibodies against Ebola [40, 43, 44] .

The development of mAb therapies against EVD is urgently needed to prevent further EVD outbreaks. Highaffinity neutralizing mAbs that specifically target the main GP epitopes of the Ebola virus have been identified. KZ52 is an antibody obtained from phage display libraries that were generated using the RNA of donors who had recovered from Ebola infection. KZ52 could neutralize Ebola virus to 50% at 8 nmol/L and could also protect guinea pigs from lethal ZEBOV challenge. However, this antibody failed to provide protection when tested in a rhesus macaque model. To better understand the mechanisms that underlie the neutralization effects of anti-Ebola mAbs, researchers analyzed a panel of mAbs that reacts with GP. They found that two neutralizing mAbs, KZ52 and JP3K11, neutralized the Ebola virus through two fundamentally different mechanisms. Specifically, KZ52 inhibits the cathepsin cleavage of GP, whereas JP3K11 recognizes post-cleavage GP. This result suggested that multiple epitopes need to be targeted for successful Ebola treatment. A promising approach is to develop a multi-mAb cocktail against the Ebola virus.

MB-003 and ZMAb are representative cocktail antibodies against the Ebola virus. ZMAb, a cocktail antibody developed by Mapp Biopharmaceutial, consists of three monoclonal neutralizing antibodies: 1H3, 2G4, and 4G7 [45] . MB-003, which is also composed of three mAbs, namely, c13C6, h-13F6, and c6D8 [46] , was developed by the Canadian Public Health Agency. These two cocktail antibodies were isolated from mice immunized with ZEBOV GP protein trimer [45, 46] . In the cynomolgus macaque infection model, when treatment was initiated at 48 h post challenge, ZMAb exhibited 50% protection rate, while MB-003 showed 67% protection rate [45, 46] . However, the virus escaped in one of the Ebola virusinfected animals treated with MB-003, resulting in five nonsynonymous mutants in the antibody-targeting sites. These mutants decreased antibody binding in vitro [47] . This finding highlights the importance of selecting different targeting sites for antibody cocktails to minimize the potential of viral escape.

2G4, 4G7, and c13C6 have been combined into a novel cocktail antibody called ZMapp [48] . In contrast to ZMAb, ZMapp contains the c13C6, not 1H3, antibody. ZMapp exhibits potent neutralizing activity against the Ebola virus. A rhesus macaque primate infection model showed that the protective effect of ZMapp is stronger than those of MB-003 and ZMAb. Eighteen Ebola virus challenged macaques received intravenous injections of ZMapp at 5, 8, and 11 days post-infection (50 mg/kg per dose) [48] . Compared with previous EVD treatment methods, the time of injection was several days later in this model, but all 18 rhesus macaques were cured after treatment [48] . Two American patients, Dr. Kent Brantly and Nancy Writebol, were infected with the Ebola virus while working in West Africa and returned to the United States for treatment [9] . They were treated with ZMapp, representing the first time that ZMapp was used in humans. The physical condition of the two patients improved after treatment with ZMapp [9] . This finding suggested that in an emergency case, antibodies that are effective in several animal models could be used to save human lives. However, in these cases, whether the antibody or the immune system is responsible for recovery remains unclear.

Recently, another neutralizing antibody against Ebola virus, mAb114, was isolated from the blood of two survivors of the 1995 EVD outbreak in Kikwit; this antibody could protect macaques five days after infection with the Ebola virus [49] . Structural analysis revealed that mAb114 mediates virus neutralization by inhibiting the binding of protease-cleaved GP to its receptor [50] . In addition, heterologous (animal-derived) polyclonal antibodies exerted neutralizing effects on the Ebola virus, and 100% survival was achieved in an animal study in which Ebola virus polyclonal antibodies were delivered 6 h after viral challenge [51] .

In November 2002, a SARS outbreak, which was initiated by SARS-CoV, first occurred in Guangdong Province, China [4] . SARS-CoV is highly contagious and causes severe clinical symptoms that could result in death. According to the WHO, SARS-CoV spread to 32 countries and regions and led to the infection of more than 8000 people and the death of 813 people, with a mortality rate close to 10% [2, 3, 52] .

SARS-CoV belongs to the Coronavirus family, Coronavirus genus. Its genome is approximately 30 kb in length. Given that the nucleotide composition of the SARS-CoV genome is drastically different from any known coronavirus sequence, it could not be attributed to any known group of existing coronaviruses at that time of initial outbreak [2, 53, 54] . The SARS-CoV genome encodes more than 10 proteins. Previous studies on coronaviruses have shown that their envelope protein has a strong immunogenic effect [55, 56] . SARS-CoV binds to its receptor, angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), through the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of its envelope glycoprotein [52] . Early work showed that hmAbs exhibited inhibitory effects on SARS-CoV. Thus, the development of potent inhibitory mAbs against SARS-CoV is of high priority.

Several groups have successfully developed hmAbs against SARS-CoV. 80R, which was identified from two nonimmune human antibody libraries, is a recombinant human scFv against the S1 domain of the spike (S) protein of the SARS-CoV [57] . 80R has a potent neutralizing effect on SARS-CoV and strongly inhibits syncytia formation between cells expressing the S protein and those expressing ACE2 [2] . In another study, EBV was used to immortalize memory B cells from a patient who had recovered from SARS-CoV infection. Through this strategy, the mAb S3.1 was isolated, which exhibited high viral neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV [30] . In a SARS-CoV infection mouse model, S3.1 was transferred to naïve mice through an intraperitoneal route. After two days, the mice received an intranasal challenge dose of 10 4 TCID50 of SARS-CoV. S3.1 injection protected all the mice from the recurrence of viral challenge [30] . However, 80R and S3.1 were unable to neutralize the GD03 strain of SARS-CoV, which was isolated from an index patient of the second SARS-CoV outbreak [58, 59] . Therefore, our group expressed a fragment containing residues 317-518 of the SARS-CoV RBD in insect cells [60] . Using this selecting antigen, we then identified m396 from a large human antibody Fab library constructed from the B lymphocytes of healthy volunteers [60] . We found that m396 achieved 100% inhibition of different SARS-CoV subtypes at a low concentration and that m396 injection completely protected mouse models of SARS-CoV against SARS-CoV infection [60] . Thus, 80R, S3.1, and m396 have the potential to be used alone or in combination to develop potent antibody-based therapeutics against SARS-CoV.

In September 2012, the Erasmus Medical Center isolated a new β-coronavirus from a patient in Rotterdam City. The isolated β-coronavirus was later named MERS-CoV by the International Commission for Classification of Coronavirus Study Group [61, 62] . The symptoms of patients with MERS-CoV are similar to those of patients with SARS-CoV and mainly include fever, coughs, and shortness of breath; patients with severe MERS-CoV infection experienced renal failure [63] . The lethal rate of MERS-CoV is approximately 35%, which is considerably higher than SARS-CoV [64, 65] . As of September 21, 2017, 2081 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection, including at least 722 related deaths, have been reported to the WHO (http://www.who.int/csr/don/21-september-2017-mers-uae/en/). MERS-CoV belongs to lineage C of β-coronaviruses. The MERS-CoV genome encodes highly conserved polymerases and helicases, a highly differentiated spike protein (S), five helper proteins, a highly conserved envelope protein (E), membrane protein (M), and nucleoprotein (N) [61] . The S protein exists as a trimer on the viral surface and contains two functional subunits, namely, S1 and S2. The S1 subunit is responsible for receptor binding, and the proximal membrane side of the S2 subunit is responsible for mediating membrane fusion [66] . MERS-CoV interacts with receptor dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4, also known as CD26) through the RBD on its S protein [67] to mediate its adsorption onto the cell. DPP4 is highly conserved in mammals and is mainly expressed in the lung, kidney, liver, small intestine, pancreas, and other epithelial cell surfaces [68] . After adsorption, the virus then fuses into the cell membrane and enters the cell to initiate infection [66] .

In 2014, several different groups developed potent neutralizing antibodies against MERS-CoV [69] [70] [71] . For example, we isolated dozens of antibodies with high neutralizing activity against MERS-CoV from a fully human antibody library, which we established using phage display [69] . Among those antibodies, we found that mAb m336 has the strongest neutralizing activity that reached the pmol/L level [69] . The structure of Fab m336 in complex with the MERS-CoV RBD suggested that the m336 epitope almost completely overlaps with the natural RBD on the viral surface [72] . Except for one amino acid mutation in its heavy chain and several in its light chain, the sequence of the m336 antibody is almost the same as that of the native germline predecessor antibody. m336 can be used to develop a highly effective anti-MERS-CoV drug given that germline antibodies usually have low immunogenicity and high safety level. In another study, Jiang et al. described the development of potent MERS-CoV-neutralizing mAbs using the yeast display method [70] .

The mAb LCA60 was rapidly generated by using Cellclone technology from immortalized B cells derived from human donor recovering from MERS [73] . LCA60 has subnanomolar (0.12 nmol/L) affinity for the S protein of MERS-CoV [73] . Pascal et al. also generated hmAbs from humanized mice by using VelocImmune technology; these mAbs also showed therapeutic efficacy in a mouse model of MERS-CoV infection [74] .

Given the developments in the field of inhibitory mAbs, the influence and use of mAbs in the development of diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for emerging infectious diseases are expected to expand.

Research on inhibitory mAbs has flourished given the rapid development of novel technologies for the production of antigen-specific mAbs and the increasing need for novel mAb-based therapies against infectious diseases. Antiviral mAbs can be generated using several different methods (e.g., phage display, humanized mouse) with varying advantages and disadvantages (Table 1) . Among these methods, large naïve antibody phage library-based technologies have enabled the rapid development of highaffinity hmAbs against emerging viral diseases that occur in an outbreak setting. This low-cost method can be used to isolate candidate mAbs within several weeks without the need for blood from infected patients or elaborate screening and animal feeding facilities.

Numerous mAbs with inhibitory effects on infectious diseases are now available and are promising candidate therapeutics. Their clinical applications, however, are hindered by the expenses associated with their development and production. African countries, where infectious diseases are highly prevalent, constitute the largest market for mAb-based therapies. However, many patients in these countries cannot afford mAb-based therapies. In the long run, governments should subsidize treatment cost, while companies and academics should improve technology to decrease the cost of therapy. For example, the American and Australian governments supported the development of m102.4, a potent mAb against the Hendra virus. m102.4 has been approved for human use after being successfully tested in two animal models [75, 76] and the completion of human phase I clinical trial with 40 volunteers.

Another promising avenue is the development of small antibody constructs, such as single-domain antibodies, which are significantly cheaper to produce than conventional full-sized mAbs. Currently, the therapeutic use of such antibody constructs has been limited by their unsatisfactorily short in vivo half-lives. This disadvantage may be overcome by antibody engineering technologies, e.g., by conferring neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) binding capabilities to enable FcRn-mediated recycling and prevent endosomal degradation [77, 78] . Low-cost and long-lasting novel antibody constructs may have great potential and extensive application in the treatment of emerging viral diseases.

Clinical Medicine Review Advancements in Nucleic Acid Based Therapeutics against Respiratory Viral Infections,"Several viruses cause pulmonary infections due to their shared tropism with cells of the respiratory tract. These respiratory problems due to viral infection become a public health concern due to rapid transmission through air/aerosols or via direct-indirect contact with infected persons. In addition, the cross-species transmission causes alterations to viral genetic makeup thereby increasing the risk of emergence of pathogens with new and more potent infectivity. With the introduction of effective nucleic acid-based technologies, post translational gene silencing (PTGS) is being increasingly used to silence viral gene targets and has shown promising approach towards management of many viral infections. Since several host factors are also utilized by these viruses during various stages of infection, silencing these host factors can also serve as promising therapeutic tool. Several nucleic acid-based technologies such as short interfering RNAs (siRNA), antisense oligonucleotides, aptamers, deoxyribozymes (DNAzymes), and ribozymes have been studied and used against management of respiratory viruses. These therapeutic nucleic acids can be efficiently delivered through the airways. Studies have also shown efficacy of gene therapy in clinical trials against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) as well as models of respiratory diseases including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), measles and influenza. In this review, we have summarized some of the recent advancements made in the area of nucleic acid based therapeutics and highlighted the emerging roles of nucleic acids in the management of some of the severe respiratory viral infections. We have also focused on the methods of their delivery and associated challenges.","Many viruses show tropism for cells of the respiratory tract that supports viral entry and subsequent infection. Infection with such respiratory viruses often leads to seasonal epidemics and in some cases threatening pandemics casing significant morbidity and mortality. Respiratory viruses generally spread rapidly due to their mode of transmission which can be as simple as inhaling droplets containing the viral particles or through physical contact with contaminated items. The spread can be Dicer binds to double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) and cleaves it into short pieces of ∼20 nt called siRNA.

One strand of the RNA associates with the RNA induced silencing complex (RISC) proteins and binds to the target mRNA. The mRNA is then cleaved by the nuclease activity of the RISC.

The long dsRNA introduced in cells directly or via any virus or transposons, is immediately recognized by RNA binding domain (RBD) of the enzyme Dicer, which contains an endonuclease catalytic domain. The dsRNA then gets cleaved into the short siRNA molecule which gets bound by a multiprotein component complex referred to as RISC (RNA induced silencing complex). One of the siRNA strands then guides and aligns the RISC complex on the target mRNA. Thereafter, the Dicer recruited Argonaute protein (which is also an RNase) slices the target mRNA thus causing gene suppression and consequent decrease in protein levels ( Figure 1 ). The highly specific cleaving ability of the siRNAs makes them a potent prophylactic and therapeutic treatment option in targeting the disease-causing genes. However, optimization is required during siRNA design to avoid any offtarget effects and minimize the possible side effects in the host cells. The presence of a double stranded RNA as a consequence of viral infection triggers RNA interference (RNAi). The host enzyme Dicer binds to double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) and cleaves it into short pieces of ∼20 nt called siRNA. One strand of the RNA associates with the RNA induced silencing complex (RISC) proteins and binds to the target mRNA. The mRNA is then cleaved by the nuclease activity of the RISC.

Bacteria and viruses cause respiratory infections in the airways [25] . Antimicrobial resistance has made treatment difficult for many infectious diseases including respiratory infections and RNAi therapeutics have proven to be effective against infections [26] . Since RNAi therapy target RNA, these are very advantageous over conventional small molecule drug used for therapy against respiratory diseases. Since the first time RNAi was used against P and F sequence of the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) [27] , there has been an increase in the number of studies related to the potential of RNAi technology in the treatment of other respiratory viral infections including influenza [28] [29] [30] [31] and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) [32] . RNAi molecules are designed specifically to target specific sequences of viral mRNA and thus can also be used efficiently against mutated viral strains when compared to other antiviral drugs.

Seasonal influenza viruses are one of the foremost public health concerns, especially influenza type A viruses that have been associated with the annual epidemics worldwide [33] . The recent 2009 H1N1 pandemic caused high morbidity [34, 35] and mortality [36] [37] [38] , and was a reminder that influenza viruses are highly unpredictable [3, [39] [40] [41] and continuous efforts are needed to manage pandemic scenarios in short time. Antiviral drugs that are currently approved to treat influenza include the Adamantanes (M2 ion-channel protein inhibitors) and the neuraminidase inhibitors such as zanamivir and oseltamivir [42] . Few viral strains have now been found to be resistant to these drugs [43] [44] [45] , thus emphasizing the need for urgent development of new antiviral drugs. Though the virus can sometimes inhibit the effect of host gene silencing, there has been studies using synthetic siRNA [46] . Due to the importance in viral replication and progression, the most commonly targeted viral regions are the nucleocapsid protein (NP), the polymerase basic protein (PB1), and the polymerase acidic protein (PA) which are highly conserved across different subtypes of influenza virus strains [47] . The first animal study using RNAi against influenza was described in 2003 where authors showed the targeted mRNA degradation using NP-and PA-specific siRNAs resulting in global inhibition of other viral RNA transcription. The reason for such significant inhibition is that the newly synthesized NP and PA proteins are indispensable for most influenza viral strains [48] . In another study, the polyethyleneimine (PEI) complex containing siRNA against NP and PA were administered intravenously to the mice either 3 hours (h) before or 5 h after influenza virus (Strain A/PR/8/34 (H1N1)) infection. The combination of these siRNAs enhanced the antiviral effect. The study also indicated that RNAi mediated by these siRNAs could partially control influenza virus even when administered after the viral infection in mice. The study also emphasized on long lasting effect of short hairpin RNAs (NP and PB shRNAs) expressed from DNA vectors [49] . These observations suggested that the siRNAs, when coupled with appropriate carriers and optimized formulations, may provide the basis for preventive treatment against influenza virus. Administration of siRNAs using lipid carrier to influenza-infected mice by hydrodynamic injection and intranasally has efficiently saved animals against highly pathogenic avian influenza A viruses (IAV) such as the H5N1, H7N7, and H9N2 subtypes [50] . Studies have also targeted the NS1 gene of influenza A virus and demonstrated a significant decrease in viral replication in experimental mice [51] . In a follow-up study from the same group, the M1 gene of Influenza A virus was targeted using siRNA-Rz chimeric construct which lead to a considerable decrease in virus titer in experimental conditions [52] . There is a growing numbers of studies in search of potential usage of siRNAs both in vivo and in vitro models for the treatment of influenza [50, 53] . Although there are few setbacks in the usage of these therapies due to the innate immune response rather than RNAi mediated viral inhibition, the advanced chemically modified RNAi molecules with a potential to trigger less immune response could be helpful in addressing this concern [54, 55] . Some studies have also carried out siRNA mediated knockdown of cellular proteins. The authors targeted the Ran-binding protein 5 which resulted in the delayed accrual of the viral RNA polymerase complex in the infected cells thereby confirming that cellular genes along with viral genes, can also be targeted for therapeutic intervention in viral diseases [56] .

RSV infection is one of the leading causes of respiratory distress in children [57, 58] and in adults, the infection leads to self-limited upper respiratory illness [59] . However, premature infants and immunocompromised patients especially those with heart and lung disease can have severe RSV infection [60] . Current treatment plans for RSV are of limited benefit and include bronchodilators, corticosteroids, and antibiotics [57] for bacterial co-infections. To date, there is unavailability of a licensed vaccine available against RSV [61] thus presenting the urgent need to develop effective RSV therapeutics and vaccines to protect both the pediatric and the adult population. Since RSV replication takes place in respiratory epithelium, the nasal delivery of the RNAi molecule can be helpful in inhibiting RSV replication [62] . In a study in the year 2005, siRNA against viral phosphoprotein (P protein) was given intranasally to mice, with and without the help of transfection agent and was proved to be effective against both RSV and parainfluenza virus (PIV). The antiviral activity of the siRNA on the animal model was comparable to that in cell culture. The experiment also revealed competitive RNAi machinery when siRNAs against two different viruses were used in dual infection setting. It was observed that an excess of one siRNA toned down the inhibitory effect of the other. The study also suggested that if properly designed, low dosages of inhaled siRNA might prove to be an effective antiviral treatment against respiratory viral infections in humans. When compared to complexed siRNA, the naked siRNA showed approximately 70-80% efficiency. Moreover, the study also revealed that the administration of siRNA before RSV infection was more effective than treatment after infection [63] . Since siRNA to P protein could target only a few viral strains, another siRNA that could target viral nucleocapsid protein (N protein) was designed. The usage of this siRNA (ALN-RSV01) developed by Alnylam Pharmaceuticals not only decreased the viral load significantly in animal model but also the phase I clinical study of ALN-RSV01 proved to be successful with less side effects. The phase II trial has also been successful where ALN-RSV01 was given to the healthy adults in the form of nasal spray daily for two days prior to and for three days after RSV infection. The results showed that, compared to the placebo group, the subjects treated with ALN-RSV01 had a significantly lower number of RSV infections [64] showing the antiviral efficacy of ALN-RSV01. Reduced acquisition of the viral infection was observed within 3-4 days after virus inoculation and continued till the end of the study. The ALN-RSV01 also entered phase II b clinical trial in the RSV-infected lung transplant patients [65] . Though the marginal reported decrease in new or progressive bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS) in these patients was statistically non-significant, it was still promising and futuristic. ALN-RSV01 has not been associated with any significant adverse event in adult population; however, safety and efficacy of the drug is yet to be disclosed for the highly susceptible pediatric population. Since the usage of siRNAs targeted against cellular proteins required by influenza virus showed significant results, the same approach can be applied in case of RSV too. However, it should be kept in mind that these cellular genes/proteins should not be indispensable for cell survival. Among such proteins are the actin regulatory proteins, VASP (vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein) and Zyxin, and thus siRNA against these proteins can be used against RSV [66] [67] [68] [69] . These proteins are non-essential for cell survival but they are required for maintaining normal physiological conditions; hence, only a short exposure of specific siRNAs can be afforded under critical conditions. SARS-CoV is another major cause of respiratory distress. As there is no good vaccine or effective treatment for SARS-CoV infection, relying on RNAi therapy to counter the infection may prove to be an important tool to counter infection. Detailed description of the SARS-CoV genome allowed immediate advancement in the SARS-CoV RNAi based therapeutic. Clinical trials are underway, but some success has been achieved in cell culture models [70] [71] [72] . Identification of candidate nucleic acid paves the path for rational design of siRNAs against viral segments. Wang et al., in 2004, generated six antiviral RNAi activators that targeted various specific sites within the SARS-CoV genome [70] . pSR02 and pSR03, had similar antiviral effect against the ORF 1b sequence. In studies using Vero cell cultures and animal models, these RNAi activators decreased viral replication and weakened the cytopathic effects demonstrating high efficacy of the designed synthetic siRNAs against the virus [71] . The inhibitory effect of the siRNA designed against S sequence was remarkable [72] . Recently, the effect of these synthetic siRNAs with cognates in the ORF 1b and S regions of the SARS-CoV genome have also been investigated on murine and rhesus macaque models [32, 73] . The otherwise unmodified short duplexes had dTdT overhangs at their 3 ends. The intranasal administration of the dextrose soluble siRNAs to SARS-CoV-infected cells inhibited replication of SARS-CoV effectively [73] . In another study, siRNAs specific for protein responsible for viral entry (HCoV-NL63 S glycoprotein), showed a significant inhibition of viral replication in virus-infected cells [74] .

Adenoviruses are also known to cause mild respiratory and gastrointestinal infections. Several studies have utilized siRNAs against adenovirus to inhibit their replication. In one such study, the authors designed several siRNAs against the early (E1A) and the late (hexon, IVa2) genes of adenovirus 5 [75] and showed variable degree of inhibition of virus replication. The study also revealed that silencing the late gene was more efficient than silencing the early gene in obstructing virus replication [75] .

Ribozymes are RNA molecules that have catalytic activity just like the DNAzymes. Since their discovery, the role of RNA catalysis has been shown in several biological processes such as the RNA splicing, RNA processing and the replication of RNA genomes [76] . The Rz occur in nature and mainly cleaves the phosphodiester bonds of nucleic acids. There are several classes of ribozymes, of which only the hammerhead and hairpin ribozymes have received a great deal of attention because of their smaller size. The hammerhead Rz has a 22-nt-long conserved catalytic core, that target RNA with NUX (N-any nucleotide and X-any nucleotide except guanosine) sequence, along with two flanked hybridizing arms (complimentary to target RNA) ( Figure 2 ) [77] . Several studies have utilized the hammerhead Rz for catalytically cleaving the target RNA due to its high catalytic activity. The hammerhead and hairpin ribozymes in different studies have been used to significantly disrupt and reduce viral replication hence effectively inhibiting pre-genomic RNA levels of infecting viruses. dextrose soluble siRNAs to SARS-CoV-infected cells inhibited replication of SARS-CoV effectively [73] . In another study, siRNAs specific for protein responsible for viral entry (HCoV-NL63 S glycoprotein), showed a significant inhibition of viral replication in virus-infected cells [74] . Adenoviruses are also known to cause mild respiratory and gastrointestinal infections. Several studies have utilized siRNAs against adenovirus to inhibit their replication.

Several studies have utilized the hammerhead Rz for catalytically cleaving the target RNA due to its high catalytic activity. The hammerhead and hairpin ribozymes in different studies have been used to significantly disrupt and reduce viral replication hence effectively inhibiting pre-genomic RNA levels of infecting viruses. The ribozyme binds to its target mRNA and makes an mRNA-ribozyme complex. The catalytic motif of the ribozyme then cleaves its target RNA into pieces, thus inhibiting gene expression. After cleaving the RNA target, the ribozyme becomes free again to enter into the next cycle. The ribozyme binds to its target mRNA and makes an mRNA-ribozyme complex. The catalytic motif of the ribozyme then cleaves its target RNA into pieces, thus inhibiting gene expression. After cleaving the RNA target, the ribozyme becomes free again to enter into the next cycle.

The propensity for high mutation in RNA viruses lead to the emergence of drug resistant strains which is a major challenge in antiviral chemotherapy. To overcome the toxicity and resistance concerns, naturally occurring molecules such as the ribozymes in the host cells are being extensively explored as potential therapeutic agents.

Tang et al., in their study, showed the ribozyme mediated inhibition of influenza virus infection in both in vitro and in vivo experiments [78] . They designed both the hammerhead and the hairpin ribozymes to cleave the viral RNA-segment 5 of influenza A virus and observed the effect of hammerhead Rz better than the hairpin Rz [78] . In another study by Motard et al., SOFA-HDV-Ribozymes were engineered as therapeutic agent to recognize conserved regions of the influenza virus sequences and to catalytically cleave the corresponding viral mRNA targets and disrupt viral replication [79] . Further characterization of the ribozyme's antiviral effect in cell culture and in mice supported the prophylactic potential of SOFA-HDV-Ribozyme combinations as influenza anti-infective and served as novel strategy for antivirals against genetically and highly variable respiratory viruses [79] . A study also showed the utilization of external guide sequences (EGS) and ribonuclease P (a type of ribozyme) to inhibit the influenza virus production in mouse cells [80] . In yet another study, the Influenza virus PB1 gene was targeted by Rz directed to cleave the PB1 mRNA [81] . The target cells were made to express the designed Rz and its effect on inhibition of influenza A virus strains A/Singapore/1/57 and A/WSN/33 production and subsequent virus-specific protein synthesis was evaluated. The study showed a significant 93.5% inhibition in virus reproduction with designed Rz as compared to control cells [81] . In another novel mechanistic study, authors designed the siRNA-chimeric-ribozyme constructs to inhibit influenza virus replication [52] . Both the designed siRNA and hammerhead Rz were directed to cleave the M1 RNA of influenza A virus. The chimeric construct demonstrated a >80% protection against the virus challenge; however, the selectively disabled mutant constructs were far less effective [52] . In another follow-up study, the same group showed that effect of several Rz designed to target multiple sites in the M1 mRNA of influenza virus [77] . The study demonstrated that Dz132 and Rz163 when used together gave an enhanced cleavage effect than when they were used individual or additive effect [77] . The study also showed that antisense molecules designed to hybridize to specific sequences upstream and downstream of the Rz163 gave significant cleavage effect than Rz163 alone [77] . The ribozymes have also been reportedly used to generate recombinant influenza viruses [82] . The study dealt with transfection of plasmids carrying the human RNA polymerase I promoter and hepatitis delta virus ribozyme sequences in in vero cells in order to rescue influenza A viruses by reverse genetics [82] .

A study performed on SARS-coronavirus using a chimeric DNA-RNA hammerhead ribozyme showed the usefulness of Rz in inhibiting virus replication upto 60% [83] . The authors further showed that the chimeric construct targeting SARS-CoV significantly reduced the expression of SARS-CoV RNA in 3T3 cells transfected with the recombinant plasmid, thus proving a feasible treatment option for SARS [83] .

A virus infection in any target cells begins with the step of successful entry followed by trafficking in the cytosol before the viral genome reaches its destination. During these events, specific viral proteins interact with several host proteins in order to initiate signaling required for the infection. One such study focused on the identification of the most optimal Rz target sites within the fusion gene of Adenovirus E1A-Associated 300 kDa Protein [84] and suggested that Rz mechanism can also be exploited for studying the functionality of host proteins required for viral infections [84] .

DNA was first isolated 150 years ago and identified by James Watson and Francis Crick 65 years ago. Initially, the only function attributed to DNA was to carry and pass genetic information from one generation to another. However, with advancements in science, DNA molecules got recognition for having a new role in the field of materials science [85] .

Deoxyribozymes, also known as DNAzymes or DNA enzymes, are synthetic catalytic single-stranded deoxyribonucleic acid molecules that display precise substrate recognition and have the ability to cleave sequence-specific mRNA molecules with greater biological stability [86] . A Dz molecule has one central catalytic motif flanked by two arms. Both the arms (I and II) are designed complimentary to the target RNA molecule so that the designed Dz binds to it on a Watson-Crick basis ( Figure 3 ). Of the several types of DNAzymes known to catalyze functions like RNA ligation [87] , carbon-carbon bond formation [88] and the hydrolytic cleavage of DNA, the best characterized one is still the RNA-cleaving DNAzymes. DNAzymes have not been reported to occur naturally as DNA molecules are predominantly double stranded; however, Breaker and Joyce generated a DNAzyme de novo by an in vitro selection process in the year 1994. Further in vitro selection experiments generated two prototypes denoted as the ""10-23"" and the ""8-17"" RNA-cleaving DNA enzymes. The 10-23 Dz studied by several researchers, has been shown to cleave the target RNA between a purine and pyrimidine both under the in vivo and in vitro conditions. The 8-17 Dz also cleaves the RNA, however it is less popular because of its less established efficacy. The 8-17 Dz cleaves between A and G nucleotides and require a rG-dT wobble pair in the enzyme-substrate complex, located immediately after the cleavage site for its cleavage activity.

DNA-based drugs have notable advantages over currently available low molecular weight pharmaceuticals because of their specific recognition of molecular targets resulting in pinpoint action [89] . Several studies have demonstrated the effect of DNAzymes specifically targeting vital genes of influenza virus, RSV, and SARS-CoV to inhibit their replication in cell line and mice models.

Toyoda et al. investigated the use of 10-23 Dzs targeting PB2 mRNA to inhibit virus replication as potential therapeutics against respiratory infections caused by influenza A virus [90] . Dzs, especially those with longer substrate-binding domains, were able to inhibit influenza virus 

DNA-based drugs have notable advantages over currently available low molecular weight pharmaceuticals because of their specific recognition of molecular targets resulting in pinpoint action [89] . Several studies have demonstrated the effect of DNAzymes specifically targeting vital genes of influenza virus, RSV, and SARS-CoV to inhibit their replication in cell line and mice models.

Toyoda et al. investigated the use of 10-23 Dzs targeting PB2 mRNA to inhibit virus replication as potential therapeutics against respiratory infections caused by influenza A virus [90] . Dzs, especially those with longer substrate-binding domains, were able to inhibit influenza virus replication in cells.

Modified anti-PB2 10-23 Dzs was similarly shown to inhibit influenza A virus. The most active analogues containing N3 -P5 phosphoramidate linkages reduced the level of influenza A virus replication by 99% but demonstrated no activity towards influenza B virus [91] . Likewise, catalytically inactive mutants showed 20-50% inhibition perhaps due to their antisense action.

Several novel Dz and hammerhead ribozymes (Rz) have been constructed to cleave the conserved domains of the influenza virus M1 RNA as an antiviral strategy to reduce the infectiousness of the virus. A real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) study showed that both Dz and Rz can inhibit replication of the virus individually with a substantial decrease (54%) in virus replication when used simultaneously. The authors concluded that combining catalytic Dz and Rz with antisense molecules lead to a more efficient gene suppression and complete inhibition of virus replication in host cells [77] . Various Dz have also been studied for activity against influenza B virus targeting the BM2 ion channel protein. BM2 has a highly conserved sequence and is crucial during the uncoating process of the influenza virus. One of the Dz (Dz209) demonstrated significant intracellular reduction of BM2 gene expression in transient-expression system and provided protection against influenza B virus challenge in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells [92] . In a follow-up study from same group, the Dz114, among several others, exhibited 70% inhibition of influenza A virus M2 gene expression as shown by the PCR and Western blot analysis. The activity of the designed Dz was further shown to be dependent on the Mg (2+) in a dose-dependent (10-50 mM) manner [93] .

RSV has also been targeted using DNAzymes. A series of Dzs were designed and synthesized to silence RSV N, M2 and F genes. One Dz (DZn1133) cleaved the RSV RNA in vitro, inhibited the transcription and expression of F viral gene, reduced the RSV production by about 7 logs and protected more than 90% of RSV-infected Hep-2 cells from the cytopathic effect when used at the concentration of 8 µM. Additionally, 10 wild RSV strains (including both subgroups A and B) isolated from patients showed significant suppression by DZn1133 with higher anti-RSV activity than that for ribavirin (1-β-D-ribofuranosyl-1H-1,2,4-triazole-3-carboxamide) or an antisense oligonucleotide (ODN) complementary to the same region of the N RNA [94] . Treatment with Dzn1133 reduced viral plaque formation in the lungs of RSV-infected BALB/c mice. Additionally, it was observed that the designed Dz significantly reduced the viral mRNA expression, alleviated the airway inflammation, and reduced the leukocyte counts in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of RSV-infected mice. The DZ1133 showed a dose-dependent (0.2-0.8mg) antiviral effect and was observed to be more efficient than the antisense oligonucleotide mediated inhibition of gene expression even though levels of cytokines such as the TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, IL-12, and IL-10 induced by the RSV infection were unaffected. The overall results demonstrated that DZ1133 can be used as a potential therapeutic agent against infections with both subgroups A and B of RSV in vivo [95] .

SARS-CoV has also been targeted using Dz molecules. The use of a Dz to target the 5 -untranslated region (5 -UTR) of a highly conserved fragment in the SARS-CoV genome to suppress viral replication has been reported. A study showed the efficacy of a mono-DNA enzyme (Dz-104) possessing the 10-23 catalytic motif, both in vitro and in cell culture experiments. The Dz-104 showed an in vitro cleavage of the SARS-CoV RNA substrate and reduced the expression of the SARS-CoV 5 UTR-eGFP fusion RNA in the mammalian cells. The results provide a basis for the potential therapeutic usage of DNA enzymes to combat SARS infection [96] .

Antisense oligonucleotides are small synthetic pieces of single-stranded DNA that are normally 15-30 nucleotides in length. ASOs specifically bind to complementary DNA/RNA sequences by Watson-Crick hybridization and once bound to the target RNA, inhibit the translational processes either by inducing cleavage mechanisms or by inhibiting mRNA maturation [97] . The use of ASOs was first reported by Zamecnik and Stephenson in 1978 as a potential antiviral therapeutics. They utilized a phosphodiester oligodeoxynucleotide composed of 13 nucleotides (a 13-mer) that was designed to block Rous sarcoma virus replication [98, 99] . Since then, ASOs ability to selectively inhibit gene expression has generated noteworthy enthusiasm in the scientific and medical community because of its specificity and the breadth of its potential applications as therapeutic agents. An extensive range of oligonucleotide analogs has become available over the past decade and this lead to target validation and development of ASO-based antiviral agents whose efficacy have been reported against various virus types, both in vitro as well as in vivo [100] . For ASOs to be used empirically, modifications of DNAs or RNAs were needed to retain hybridization capacity at the same time increasing stability. Major alterations have been introduced in the phosphodiester bond, the sugar ring, and the backbone to result in three generations of nucleic acid analogs for the synthesis of ASO oligomers. ASO-based antiviral agents are specifically designed to block the translational processes either by (i) ribonuclease H (RNAse H) or RNase P mediated cleavage of mRNA or (ii) by sterically (non-bonding) blocking enzymes that are involved in the target gene translation [97] .

Antisense oligonucleotides have been studied extensively against several respiratory viruses with promising results.

The earliest studies using oligonucleotide ('oligo') to inhibit synthesis of virus-specific proteins, including influenza, in MDCK cells were reported in the 1990s. Researchers observed that the modified oligos could effectively suppress the influenza A/PR8/34 (H1N1) virus production [101] . Since then several other ASOs have been synthesized and studied for efficacy against influenza. Ge et al. showed that siRNAs specifically designed to target the conserved regions of the viral genome can potently inhibit influenza virus production in cell lines (Vero, MDCK) as well as embryonated chicken eggs [48] . Wu et al. showed that in vivo treatment with three doses of RNA oligonucleotides conferred significant protection to the infected chickens from H5N1 virus-induced mortality at a rate of up to 87.5%. The authors used mixed RNA oligonucleotides targeting the NS1 gene to show a significant reduction in the plaque-forming unit (PFU) and viral RNA levels in the lung tissues of the infected animals by plaque assay and real-time PCR analysis. Their study demonstrated that RNA oligonucleotides targeting at the viral NS1 gene could potently inhibit highly pathogenic avian H5N1 influenza virus reproduction and thus, could potentially be used as prophylaxis and therapy for H5N1 influenza virus infection in humans [102] . In another study, Gabriel et al. used three peptide-conjugated phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers (PPMOs), to selectively target the translation start site region of PB1 or NP mRNA or the 3 -terminal region of NP viral RNA, to prevent virus replication in MDCK cells. The study further utilized the primer extension assays to show that treatment with any of the effective PPMO markedly reduced the levels of mRNA, cRNA, and vRNA [103] . Another study by Duan et al. used a novel antisense oligonucleotide (IV-AS) specifically designed against the 5 -terminal conserved sequence found in all the eight viral RNA segments of influenza A virus. They monitored the activity of IV-AS both in vitro in the MDCK cells and in vivo using a mouse model. IV-AS was administered intranasally to the H5N1-infected mice once daily for 6 days starting 6 h post-infection. IV-AS, at 50% effective concentration (EC50) ranging from 2.2 to 4.4 µM, inhibited influenza A virus induced cytopathic effects in MDCK cells. IV-AS was also effective against H5N1 virus in preventing death, reducing weight loss, reducing lung consolidation and decreasing the lung virus titers [104] . Lupfer et al. showed that antisense-PPMOs, delivered through the intranasal route, were able to inhibit the replication of equine influenza A virus A/Eq/Miami/1/63 (H3N8) in mice by over 95% compared to the controls [105] . In another study, a group of authors designed antisense oligonucleotides against the common 3 NCR of segments of the IAV genome to inhibit its replication [106] . The AS molecules demonstrated a drastic reduction in the cytopathic effect caused to the 3 end of its coding region (nucleotides 2279-2293), proved noticeably inhibitory. Similar to other related studies, the antiviral activity of 5-15b was also observed to be dose-and time-dependent; however, it was independent of the cell substrate and multiplicity of infection used in the study [107] . In another follow-up study, Giannecchini et al. investigated whether analogous inhibitory S-ONs targeting PB1 and PA gene segments could be identified and if virus can develop resistance to S-ONs. The authors observed that the 20-mer S-ONs reproducing the 5 ends of PB1 and PA gene segments exerted a dominant antiviral activity against several influenza A virus subtypes in MDCK cells. Their findings suggest that the packaging signal at the 5 end of the PB2 vRNA can be a potential therapeutic target for the design of novel anti-influenza compounds. Also, antivirals against this region could be beneficial owing to less changes of mutation in these viral genes [108] .

Recently RSV has also been targeted by several designed ASO molecules. Jairath et al., in their study investigated the use of oligodeoxyribonucleotides to inhibit RSV replication in cell culture. Human epithelial type 2 (HEp-2) cells were infected with RSV strain A2 and treated with the designed oligonucleotides. A 0.5-1 µM 50% effective concentration (EC50) values were obtained for the designed antisense oligonucleotide targeted to the start of the viral NS2 gene. The ELISA and PT-PCR analyses showed that all the oligonucleotides inhibited virus antigen production and demonstrated sequence specific depletion of the genomic RNA target. The target RNA was observed to be cleaved at the specific antisense oligonucleotide binding site. The results suggest that antisense oligonucleotides could have therapeutic value against RSV infections [110] . PPMOs have the ability to readily enter cells and interfere with viral protein expression through steric hindrance of the complementary RNA. Lai et al. designed two antisense PPMOs to specifically target the 5 -terminal region and translation start-site region of RSV L mRNA [111] . Both PPMOs demonstrated minimal cytotoxicity when tested for anti-RSV activity in two human-airway cell lines. One PPMO (AUG-2), reduced the viral titers by >2.0 log10. Intranasal administration of AUG-2 in BALB/c mice before the RSV infection showed a reduction in viral titer of 1.2 log10 in lung tissue at day 5 post-infection, and further reduced pulmonary inflammation at day 7 post-infection. The overall results show that PPMO has a potent anti-RSV activity and the potential to be a therapeutic regimen against RSV infections [111] .

Neuman et al. designed specific PPMOs against specific sequences in the SARS-CoV (Tor2 strain) genome [112] . The PPMOs were analyzed for their capability to inhibit infectious virus production and were further investigated to determine the function of conserved vRNA motifs and their secondary structures. Several virus specific PPMOs along with a random-sequence control PPMO were designed that showed low inhibitory activity against SARS-CoA. The virus-targeted PPMOs further reduced the cytopathology due to viral infection and reduced cell-to-cell spread because of reduction in viral replication. The active PPMO were found to be most effective when administered any time prior to the peak viral synthesis and exerted a sustained antiviral effect in the culture medium. The study demonstrated the antiviral effects in vitro for the PPMO designed complementary to the AUG translation start site region of a murine coronavirus replicase [112] and suggested a therapeutic potential of ASOs against coronavirus infection [113] . In another study, Ahn et al. evaluated the antiviral effects of antisense peptide nucleic acids (PNAs) targeting a highly conserved RNA sequence on the programmed −1 ribosomal frameshifting (−1 PRF) that is utilized by eukaryotic RNA viruses [114] . Cells transfected with a SARS-CoV-replicon, treated with the PNA (50% inhibitory concentration of 4.4 µM) fused to a cell-penetrating peptide (CPP), showed a significant suppression of the replication of the SARS-CoV [114] .

Aptamers are 20-90 nucleotides long, synthetic single strand nucleic acid molecules (DNA or RNA). They are designed to bind to various organic or nonorganic molecules-ranging from single atoms to a wide range of proteins (Figure 4 ). Aptamers are highly specific to target molecule and are generated by the SELEX (systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment) method [115] . For the last 20 years, aptamers have been used as a diagnostic tool for the treatment of viral diseases.

Owing to pandemic nature of the disease and constant mutation in virus, identification of different subtypes becomes essential. In most cases antibodies are used to distinguish influenza A and B but most successful probes to distinguish different subtypes are aptamers. That is why aptamers to most common subunits of the virus are being used to develop sensors for influenza detection. Hemagglutinin (HA), is influenza viral surface glycoprotein responsible for fusion of virus with the host cell. In case of influenza, at least 18 different HA antigens has been identified which are not only responsible for diagnosis but identification of different influenza types and subtypes. Since 2004, more than 40 DNA and RNA aptamers against recombinant hemagglutinins (H1, H3, H5, H9, and HA from influenza virus B) and to whole viruses (H5N1) [116] have been constructed. Misono and Kumar used SPR-based SELEX to design and select an RNA aptamer and showed its activity against HA of A/Panama/2007/1999 (H3N2) [117] . Gopinath et al. constructed two targeted RNA aptamers, P30-10-16 and A-20, used to differentiate influenza type A from type B and closely related strains of the influenza subtypes [118, 119] . RNA aptamer P30-10-16, was found to be 15 times more specific to H3N2 of influenza A virus than to any conventional anti-HA monoclonal antibody [119] . Subsequently, several aptamers were constructed to detect influenza virus type A (H1N1 and H3N2) , as well as avian influenza virus, H5N1 [120, 121] . These aptamers can prove to be helpful in diagnosing and distinguishing all the dangerous influenza strains with potentially high epidemiological risk. In 2013, Wang and Li generated biosensor based on quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) technique where they modified DNA aptamer by cross linking it to quartz particles to detect avian influenza virus more specifically [120] . Similarly, Bai et al. 2012 also suggested usage of an SPR aptasensor directed against avian influenza H5N1 [122] . Later on, the impedance-based aptasensor with microfluidics chips, with a lower detection limit than the SPR-based aptasensor and the same sensitivity as the QCM aptasensor, were used to detect H5N1 avian influenza virus [123] . Recently, Nguyen et al. used a SPR based sandwich type sensor to detect H5Nx viruses [124] . The sensitivity of this dual aptamer-based sensor increased many folds when the secondary aptamer was conjugated with gold nanoparticles. These chemical modifications of aptamers reduce selection time and increase their biostability in vivo. The early diagnosis and identification of subtypes, help target viral strains specifically and rationally.

The sensitivity of this dual aptamer-based sensor increased many folds when the secondary aptamer was conjugated with gold nanoparticles.

These chemical modifications of aptamers reduce selection time and increase their biostability in vivo. The early diagnosis and identification of subtypes, help target viral strains specifically and rationally.

Aptamers have been developed against influenza for therapeutics purposes. Many of these aptamers developed against HA could prevent the entry of the virus to the cells by blocking hemagglutinin activity which could be measured in vitro using hemagglutination inhibition assay. The usage of DNA aptamer A22 showed reduction of 95% of viral infection when administered concomitantly with the viral infection in the mice model. A22 was less effective when it was given prior to the infection [125] . In 2014, Musafia et al. used the modified A22 which had 10-15 times more potent antiviral activity in animal models than A22 aptamer. Many aptamers targeting other subunits important for viral replication and progression have also been studied [126] . Woo et al. successfully studied a DNA aptamer against NS1 subunit. This particular aptamer maintained the cell viability and induced IFN-β production while inhibiting the viral replication [127] . Later on, aptamers against subunits of polymerase complex of influenza virus, PA, PB1, and PB2 were also studied; and finally, the aptamers with a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) around 10 nM was identified that exhibited cross-protection against infections of H1N1, H5N1, H7N7, and H7N9 influenza viruses [128] .

Few aptamers targeting host cell factors important for viral replication have also been studied. ApPABP7 and ApPABP11 aptamers which inhibit viral protein-host translation factor interactions have been useful against influenza [129] . Similarly use of a specific RIG-I aptamer efficiently blocks the replication of influenza and other viruses in infected cells through IFNα/β immune responses [130, 131] .

In case of yet another respiratory virus SARS, nucleocapsid (N) protein, one of the most abundant proteins, is the target choice for developing aptamers. Ahn et al. have developed a nanoarray aptamer chip with the RNA aptamer which can proficiently detect SARS nucleocapsid protein at a concentration as low as 2 pg/mL [132] . Likewise, ssDNA aptamer proficiently detects N protein by Western blot [133] . RNA aptamer ES15 used to target nsP10 (nonstructural protein 10) by Jang et al. inhibited viral enzyme activity in a dose-dependent manner (with IC50 = 1.2 nM) [134] . Yet another study showed that DNA aptamers against the non-structural nsp13 protein, inhibiting helicase activity of nsp13 protein required for SARS viral replication [135] .

A recent study on RSV demonstrated that aptamers can be selected based on the rationally designed SELEX protocol against whole virus and that the specific aptamers can potentially be utilized for detecting the respiratory syncytial virus [136] .

RNA interference mediated by tools like shRNA, ribozymes, and DNAzymes has emerged as an important technology not only to study gene functions but also for therapeutic purpose to manage viral infections and restrict the growth of cancerous cells. The biggest hurdle in the use of these tools is the in vivo delivery to target cells. Major challenges in in vivo delivery of the nucleic acids include their immunogenicity, enzymatic digestion in body fluids, phagocytosis by the immune cells, and renal clearance. Moreover, highly charged nature of nucleic acids does not allow them to cross the cell membrane by free diffusion. Intracellular challenges to the delivery of these molecules include endosomal and lysosomal escape in the cell cytoplasm. Several strategies have been developed for efficient in vivo delivery of nucleic acids which include use of both viral as well as non-viral vectors as the delivery vehicles.

With reference to respiratory viruses, numerous studies have been reported for non-viral vector mediated in vivo delivery of siRNA and ribozymes targeting the respiratory virus genome. Cationic systems like liposomes and polymers have been successfully used for systemic administration of siRNA molecules. Liposomal vectors being positively charged can efficiently form a complex with negatively charged effector nucleic acids on one side and interact with negatively charged cell membrane on the other side. The size of the vector also needs to be kept below 100 nm to prevent renal clearance after systemic administration. A polymer, polyethyleneimine (PEI), could be used as a carrier of shRNA targeted to mRNA encoding PA, PB1, and PB2 protein of influenza A virus. It was observed that shRNAs cloned in pSilencer2.1-U6 puro plasmid vector had a prophylactic effect on the mice infected with A/WSN/33 (H1N1) when delivered as shRNA-jetPEI complex through intra-tracheal route. However, these complexes could not show any therapeutic efficacy [137] . Another study was done on siRNA designed against gene encoding phosphoprotein of RSV. It was shown that siRNA delivered through intranasal route prior to infection, either naked or in complex with transfection reagent viz. TransIT-TKO reagent, could significantly reduce the viral titer and disease outcome in mice. However, again the effect of siRNA was very low when delivered after virus infection [63] . Alnylam Pharmaceuticals translated the results of study done by Bitko et al. into human trials to evaluate the antiviral activity of the siRNA under the name ALN-RSV01 which has crossed the Phase 2a clinical trial and found to be safe when delivered to healthy human individuals as nasal spray (aerosols) [65] . There are several other reports showing the efficacy of intranasal administration of siRNA in complex with transfection reagents to reduce viral titer in lungs of infected mice and to relieve the symptoms [50, 138] . However, administration of siRNA complexed with polyethyleneimine or other transfection reagent like lipofectamine through intravenous route has also been shown to exert inhibitory effect on the virus replication in lungs of treated mice leading to more than 30% inhibition in the lung virus titer [49, 53, 139, 140] . In the study done by Tompkins et al., the direct intravenous injection of siRNA-oligofectamine in PBS aided the effect of intranasal inoculation of the siRNA complex (targeted to nucleoprotein and acidic polymerase gene) thus reducing the pathogenicity of highly virulent influenza A virus strains [50] . Though PEI and other transfection reagents have been shown as effective carrier of RNAi tools in mice model, these are not feasible for clinical use because of their proinflammatory effect. Li et al. demonstrated that siRNA complexed with carriers like D5W solution and Infasurf solution is safe for clinical use. Intra-tracheal administration of siRNA-D5W solution complex targeted to spike coding gene and NSP12 region of SARS coronavirus (SCV) genome showed efficient inhibition of SCV replication and suppression of SARS like symptoms in monkey model [32] .

Apart from the above-mentioned polymer or lipid-based delivery of shRNA, therapeutic RNA molecules can also be delivered through intranasal route in complex with chitosan nanoparticles. In a study done with chitosan nanoparticles, it was shown that intranasal inoculation of chitosan complexed with plasmid encoding shRNA targeted to NS1 gene of RSV could reduce RSV infection and lung pathology in rat model. The complex was also successful in modulating the immune response to RSV infection [141] .

The role of ribozymes as therapeutic tool was shown by Motard et al. who designed SOFA-HDV-Rzs targeted to all the mRNA except that of hemagglutinin and neuraminidase gene of influenza A virus. The ribozymes targeted to conserved regions of mRNA corresponding to nucleoprotein and non-structural gene of influenza A virus were found to inhibit virus replication in the lungs of treated mice when delivered intra-nasally in complex with in vivo-jetPEITM. Although the extent of reduction in viral titer in the lungs of infected mice was low, the ribozymes could significantly affect the clinical outcomes of the infected mice [79] . In the same year, another study revealed an approach to manage respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection using ribozymes. The ribozyme was designed against the L gene mRNA of RSV and expressed via an inducible RSV minigenome replicon system which generated pseudovirus particles (defective RSV particles) expressing therapeutic ribozymes. The minigenome system could be induced by actual RSV infection and had the potential to inhibit virus replication when delivered intra-nasally via pseudovirus particles as delivery vehicles [142] .

Viral vectors for delivery of RNAi tools for respiratory viruses are relatively less discussed. Baculovirus is one such vector. It is an insect virus vector known for its safety and high packaging capacity. The vector is considered safe as the recombinant baculovirus is replication incompetent in mammalian cell and does not produce immunogenic viral proteins. It is reported that recombinant baculovirus vector could exhibit transient but effective expression of shRNA targeted to influenza A and B virus under in vitro condition. The duration of expression could be increased by insertion of Epstein-Barr virus sequences into the vector [143] . The use of this vector for in vivo expression of RNAi tools needs to be examined.

Although RNAi has received significant attention in the basic and applied research related to biological systems, the RNAi associated immune stimulation may pose hurdle in clinical applications. The possibility of innate immune response induced by siRNAs/shRNAs or its delivery vehicles is yet another obstacle that needs to be addressed very carefully [144] [145] [146] . Recent studies have shown that advanced chemically modified RNAi molecules can be designed to trigger less immune response. Furthermore, the potential benefits of immunostimulatory siRNAs can be beneficial in case of viral infections and antagonistic cancers (reviewed in [147] ). In spite of associated innate immune responses, the nucleic acid-based strategies still hold a lot of importance and most of them are currently undergoing various phase of clinical trial. They are not only shown to be effective against viruses, but they have also been used to target non-viral diseases ( Table 1) . 

Respiratory viruses have been a global concern for decades and are the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in both children and adults. Some of these viruses show seasonality in pattern of outbreaks [150] and can be managed if proper precautions and preventive measures are initiated in time. The major ones, influenza and RSV, are the leading causes of respiratory disease and a continuous surveillance system is required to understand their changing pattern year after year. They both have coinciding seasonality which aggravates the scenario. Although several studies have focused on techniques that can help diagnose these viral infections in a short time [35, [151] [152] [153] , and symptomatic treatments are available, prevention is still better than cure. Vaccination is considered the most effective tool; however, the need for annual vaccine formulation against highly mutating influenza viruses is a reason to continuously try to develop novel strategies [154] to combat frequent epidemics. RSV does not have a successful vaccine yet [61] , and only a few vaccine candidates are in clinical trials [155] .

Nucleic acid-based therapeutics gained popularity because of its ability to target genes and inhibit translation. Strategies like antisense technology, ribozymes, DNAzymes as well as the RNAi-based therapeutics have greatly improved in the recent years. New studies have also developed improved strategies for overcoming the issues relating to instability by utilizing various types of modifications such as phosphorothioate (PS) DNA or 2-O-methyl-RNA (OMe) which proved to be more stable than normal DNA/RNA oligonucleotides. Several pathogens, including viruses, have been targeted utilizing one of these nucleic acid based silencing strategies. Numerous studies conducted in experimental animal models as well as in cell culture systems have evaluated the efficiency and efficacy of these molecules in post-transcriptional silencing of crucial viral genes to obstruct protein translation and inhibit viral replication. Some of these strategies have already made their place in clinical trials.

The efficacy of the nucleic acid-based molecules is dependent on their expression, stability, and accessibility to the target sites. If properly designed and modified, all these nucleic acids may have significant inhibitory effect on relevant target but combination of more than one type of therapeutic can always show synergistic effect against the virus propagation in host cells.

Although the discussed therapeutic nucleic acids are highly specific for their target and are optimized for nil off-target effect, hence, their side effects including effect on cellular metabolism is expected to be negligible. The risk factor associated with these molecules can be their delivery vehicles especially the viral vectors but if appropriately chosen, the related risk can be minimized.

The available literatures on such strategies show tremendous potential; however, the development of such molecules is not very simple and requires extensive optimizations in respect of their stability and modes of delivery. Any new discovery of antiviral compounds brings with it associated challenges; still, the effort of such discoveries is essential and potentially offers more effective and better tools to manage viral infections.

Therapeutic Applications of Monoclonal Antibodies,"Researchers have sought therapeutic applications for monoclonal antibodies since their development in 1975. However, murine-derived monoclonal antibodies may cause an immunogenic response in human patients, reducing their therapeutic efficacy. Chimeric and humanized antibodies have been developed that are less likely to provoke an immune reaction in human patients than are murine-derived antibodies. Antibody fragments, bispecific antibodies, and antibodies produced through the use of phage display systems and genetically modified plants and animals may aid researchers in developing new uses for monoclonal antibodies in the treatment of disease. Monoclonal antibodies may have a number of promising potential therapeutic applications in the treatment of asthma, autoimmune diseases, cancer, poisoning, septicemia, substance abuse, viral infections, and other diseases.","I n 1975, Kohler and Milstein revolutionized the field of immunology by developing monoclonal antibodies (MAbs). Since that time, many MAbs have been developed for use in diagnostic procedures and in immunotherapy. Ever since it was observed that the therapeutic use of heterologous MAbs elicited immunogenic responses in humans, significant research efforts have been devoted toward creating chimeric and humanized antibodies for use in human patients. Major achievements have been in the production of MAbs in transgenic plants and animals. The use of phage display libraries has created customized antibodies with defined affinity and specificity. This review describes how rodent, chimeric, and humanized antibodies have each been used, with varying degrees of success to treat cancer, septicemia, autoimmune disorders, and infectious diseases. We also describe here recent applications of antibody engineering, such as the use of bispecific antibodies and antibody fragments in immunotherapy.

Von Behring and Kitasato discovered in 1890 that the serum of vaccinated persons contained certain substances, which they termed ""antibodies."" In 1895, they treated diphtheria with an antiserum raised against the toxin. On the basis of research on tetanus toxin and trypanosome parasites, Ehrlich proposed in 1900 the ""side-chain theory"" of antibody formation, which hypothesized that physiologically active substances, including toxins, attach to cell surface receptors that are produced in response to toxin-cell interactions and then ejected from the cells into the bloodstream, leading to circulating antibodies. 1, 2 Not until the 1950s, however, did scientists' understanding of antibodies become sufficient to lay the foundation for the development of MAbs. Jerne 3 postulated in 1955 a theory of natural selection for antibody formation. Animals vaccinated with an antigen were expected to produce several distinct antibodies against several epitopes of the antigen. Frank Macfarlane Burnet subsequently refined and expanded Jerne's theory. 4 Burnet's ""clonal selection theory,"" as it is generally known, postulates that cells specific for synthesizing 1 type of antibody are spontaneously generated due to random somatic mutations during the maturation of the immune system and that these cells proliferate when exposed to an antigen. At about the same time, Porter isolated fragment antigen binding (Fab) and fragment crystalline (Fc) from proteolytically cleaved rabbit ␥-globulin. 5 Until the 1960s, antibody-producing cells were difficult to maintain in culture, because they died after a few days. In addition, only polyclonal antibodies could be obtained. In 1964, Littlefield 6 developed a way to isolate hybrid cells from 2 parent cell lines using the hypoxanthine-aminopterin-thymi-dine (HAT) selection media. In 1975, Khler and Milstein 7 provided the most outstanding proof of the clonal selection theory from results of heterokaryons-cell hybrids formed by the fusion of normal and malignant cells. Twenty-five years after Kohler and Milstein produced the first monoclonal antibodies, dramatic progress has been made in using antibodies for diagnostic purposes, but the uses of MAbs to treat disease have-until recently-remained somewhat limited. 8, 9 However, as this review indicates, the potential of MAbs to aid in the treatment of a wide range of diseases is now beginning to be realized.

Antibodies are Y-shaped proteins composed of peptides called heavy and light chains, the ends of which vary from antibody to antibody. Each combination of heavy and light chains binds to a particular antigenic site. These glycoprotein chains are folded into domains of about 110 amino acids that become twisted into the immunoglobulin (Ig) fold and are stabilized by disulfide bonds. Structurally, each Ig molecule consists of 2 50-kD heavy chains and 2 25-kd light chains, linked by disulfide bonds.

Human immunoglobulins are divided into 5 classes or isotypes based on the amino acid composition of their heavy chains: ␣, ␦, ⑀, ␥, and , denoted IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG, and IgM, respectively. There are 2 kinds of light chains, (k) and (l), which are common to all 5 classes. Four subclasses of IgG (IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, and IgG4) and 2 subclasses of IgA (IgA1 and IgA2) exist, each with a distinct function. Secretory IgA exists in dimeric form held together by a J chain and is associated with a secretory component that helps it pass through the cell membrane. 10, 11 Each chain has a constant domain to bind host effector molecule and a variable domain to bind to the target antigen. Light chains have 1 variable (V L ) and 1 constant domain (C L ), whereas heavy chains have 1 variable (V H ) and either 3 (␣, ␦, and ␥ chains) or 4 constant domains (⑀ and heavy chains) depending upon the isotype class. Each variable domain contains 3 regions known as ""hypervariable loops,"" also known as complementarity-determining regions (CDRs), that identify the antigen. The other amino acids in the variable (Fv) domain are known as framework residues and act as a scaffold to support the loops. The V L and the V H , the C H 1 and the C L , and the 2 C H 3 domains are paired; the 2 C H 2 domains have carbohydrate side chains attached to them and are not paired. The folded constant domains may be homologous among different species, allowing hybrid domains (eg, mouse-human) to be produced. The variable domain confers specificity and affinity. The CDR amino acid sequences are extremely variable and play a large role in interac-tion with the targeted antigen. The chain type, region, and distance from the amino terminus characterize the domains. Thus, C H 2 domain refers to the second constant domain of the heavy chain.

Upon digestion with papain, the antibody molecule is cleaved on the amino-terminal side of the disulfide bridges into 2 identical Fabs and an Fc fragment, whereas pepsin cleaves the antibody on the carboxy-terminal side of the disulfide bridges into 1 F(ab') 2 fragment containing both the arms of the antibody, and many small pieces of the Fc fragment. Currently, the following are available: whole antibodies, enzymatically produced 50-kd Fab fragments, engineered 25-kd single-chain Fv (scFv) antibodies consisting of the V H and V L connected by a flexible peptide linker, diabodies (noncovalent dimers of scFv), minibodies (scFv-C H 3 dimers), and heavy chain IgGs found in species of the Camelidae family, which are devoid of light chains and are referred to as V HH .

The first MAb described by Kohler and Milstein was created by the fusion of murine myeloma cells with murine-antibody-secreting lymphocytes. 7, 8 Myeloma cells are immortalized B lymphocytes capable of secreting homogeneous antibodies. The immortal myeloma cell lacks the enzyme hypoxanthine guanosine phosphoribosyl transferase (HGPRT) and is sensitive to the HAT media. However, a hybrid cell known as a hybridoma, generated by the fusion of myeloma cell and an antibody-producing B cell, can survive in the HAT media. The spleen B lymphocytes contribute the HGPRT gene to the hybrid cell and, hence, unfused myeloma cells and spleen cells die in the HAT media.

The conventional method of generating MAbs is the hybridoma technology in which spleen cells from immunized mice are fused with murine myeloma cells. Whereas the myeloma cell imparts immortality to the hybridoma allowing cells to be cultivated indefinitely, the immune spleen B-cell confers antigen specificity. Because each hybridoma is derived from a single cell, the cells within a hybridoma cell line are identical and make the same antibody molecule with same antigen-binding site and isotype, hence it is called a MAb. Among several excellent reviews that detail MAb production with hybridomas is a recent review by Dean and Shepherd. 12 Initial attempts to bypass the mouse to make human MAbs involved fusion of human immune spleen lymphocytes with nonsecreting human myeloma partners to obtain hybrid cells that continually secrete a specific antibody. However, poor fusion of human myelomas, unsatisfactory performance of the hybrid cells, and the difficulty in accessing immune lymphocytes have prevented success. Although heteromyelomas-which are fusions of hu-man and mouse myelomas-work better, these hybrids are usually unstable. Attempts to use mouse myeloma cells to create hybrids and derive human MAbs led to the loss of human chromosomes and the inability to make human Igs. 13 Unfortunately, in vitro immunization is limited by its inability to produce a secondary response and by the absence of the affinity maturation process that occurs in vivo. 13 Affinity maturation process is a complex phenomenon, a consequence of intense Bcell proliferation, somatic hypermutation of Ig variable domain genes, and selection for B cells with high-affinity antigen binding, all occurring in the specialized microenvironment of the germinal center within the lymphoid tissue. Thus, the search for an ideal fusion partner for generating human MAbs has been difficult, which is why the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) technique for immortalization of B lymphocytes is preferred. But immortalized B cells do not always replicate exactly the in vivo antibody response, because the tissues from which these cells were selected and the manipulations to which they are subjected to in the laboratory may alter the antibody specificity. 14, 15 Protocols for the preparation of EBV virus, B cells, and cell fusion have been described elsewhere. 14, 16, 17 Methods used for large-scale production of MAbs may include the generation of ascites tumors in mice or in vitro mammalian cell culture fermentation by using bioreactors and continuous perfusion culture systems. 18, 19 The key issues in scale-up productions are the growth media, fermenter size, fermentation time, and purification procedures. 19 Purification or downstream processing is accomplished by chromatography, fragmentation, conjugation with chelating agents, ultrafiltration, and controlled precipitation. 18

A more recent technique for producing antibodylike molecules uses what is known as the Phage Display Library. It involves the construction of V H and V L gene libraries and their expression on the surface of a filamentous bacteriophage. Developed in the 1990s, the phage display method requires repeated ""panning"" or screening of different antibodies based on their affinity for a specific antigen. Antibody genes are linked to bacteriophage coat protein genes and the bacteriophages with the fusion genes are used to infect bacteria to create the phage display library. The resulting bacteriophages express the fusion proteins and display them on their surface, and the phage display library comprises recombinant phages, each displaying a different antigenbinding site on its surface. The phage expressing an antigen-binding domain specific for a particular antigen can be detected and isolated by binding to the surface coated with that antigen. Libraries of V H and V L genes may be generated from nonimmunized donors, immunized donors who have an immune response against a particular antigen or from a synthetic library consisting of antibody fragments. 20, 21 One promising way to increase antibody yield or develop new antibodies may be by using genetically altered animals and plants. Abgenix, a company in Fremont, CA, has developed the transgenic ""Xeno-Mouse,"" in which the mouse antibody-producing genes have been inactivated and functionally replaced by approximately 90% of the human Ig gene loci in germline configuration, coding for the heavy and light chains. 22, 23 Upon immunization with any specific human or nonhuman antigens, the ""Xeno-Mouse"" generates MAbs, which are fully human Igs, with high affinities and antigen-binding specificities. ""XenoMouse"" strains producing specifically IgG1, IgG2, or IgG4 isotypes have also been created to generate panels of diverse and highly specific MAbs.

Kirin Brewery Company, Japan, has developed another transgenic mouse known as the ""Trans-Chromo"" mouse. The endogenous IgH and IgG loci of the ""Trans-Chromo"" mouse were inactivated, but it harbors 2 individual human chromosome fragments, derived from human chromosomes 2 and 14, that contain whole human Ig light-and heavy-chain loci, respectively. 24 These mice are capable of producing every subtype of fully human Ig, including IgA and IgM. In these transgenic mouse models, human antibodies with high affinity to an immunized antigen are naturally selected by the murine immune system via an affinity maturation process, and thereby show increased diversity of the MAbs.

Transgenic mice may be a suitable alternative to chimeric or humanized antibody production or the use of phage display systems to create less immunogenic or novel antibodies. 25 For instance, transgenic mice that express MAbs to coronavirus in their milk have been developed. 26, 27 Because ruminant animals, such as cows, goats, and sheep, produce relatively large amounts of milk, genetically-modified members of these species could also be used to produce large quantities of therapeutic proteins, including MAbs. 28 Plants may be a potential source of recombinant proteins, including MAbs. 29 -31 Plant virus vectors, such as the tobacco mosaic virus, may be used to make MAbs. Transgenic tobacco plants may also be used for large-scale production of recombinant IgA, which is used in passive mucosal immunotherapy. 30, 31 This MAb could be added to toothpaste to effectively protect against bacteria that cause tooth decay. 31, 32 Recombinant antigens obtained from plants may also have therapeutic applications. For instance, attempts to immunize mice with Escherichia coli heat labile enterotoxin B produced in transgenic tobacco and potato plants have proved promising. 33

Hepatitis B viral surface protein produced in transgenic tobacco plants has been shown to be immunogenic in mice. 32 The genes coding for murine malignant B-cell specific markers are inserted into tobacco mosaic virus to cultivate an immunogenic protein in tobacco plants that may eventually be used in developing a vaccine against non-Hodgkin lymphoma. 34, 35 Other immunotherapeutic proteins under development include Norwalk virus capsid proteins produced in tobacco and potatoes, cholera toxin and CT-B produced in potatoes, hepatitis B antigen produced in tobacco, anti-human IgG used to detect nonagglutinating antibodies produced in alfalfa, and humanized anti-herpes simplex virus (HSV)-2 grown in soybeans. 36 -39 

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) considers antibodies to be ""biopharmaceuticals""; as such, MAb applications are regulated by the agency's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) and the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. 40, 41 The FDA has created a ""Points to Consider"" document advising manufacturers of factors to consider in the production and testing of MAbs intended for human use and identified information that should appear in Investigational New Drug or biologics license applications. 40 The ""Points to Consider"" document serves to ""indicate the agency's current thinking on MAb products for human use."" 40 The agency's recommendations are aimed at protecting human health because viruses and cellular DNA from antibody-producing cells with malignant phenotypes may be integrated into host cells after transformation. Accordingly, among the Points to Consider are several steps-such as taking care to ensure purity of immunoconjugates and demonstrating the ability of any purification scheme to remove adventitious agents-designed to prevent contamination of the final product by human pathogens. 40 Manufacturers must also adhere to animal care standards and detail steps to prevent contamination of cell culture.

The Points to Consider document includes a list of normal human tissues used in cross-reactivity testing, tests for murine viruses, and organs to be considered in dosimetry estimates. The FDA recognizes that because of species differences, animal models expressing the antigen of interest or cross-reactive epitopes are not always available.

The agency has also published a guidance entitled S6 Preclinical Safety Evaluation of Biotechnology Derived Pharmaceuticals based on International Conference of Harmonization technical requirements. 41 Before beginning phase 1 clinical studiesconducted to assess the safety of the drug and its mechanism of action-the FDA recommends that researchers conduct in vivo and in vitro testing of the MAb to assess cross-reactivity with human tissues or non-target-tissue binding. Preclinical safety testing aims to evaluate the immunogenicity, crossreactivity, stability and effector functions of MAbs. The metabolism, carcinogenicity, and genotoxicity of the product should also be evaluated. 41 Guidance has also been published for MAbs used as reagents in drug manufacturing. 42 The guidance emphasizes biological safety, performance characteristics of the reagent, and potential presence of residual amounts of the reagent in the final product.

The FDA general principles for testing and manufacturing are broadly applicable to many classes of antibodies, including those produced by phage display systems or transgenic plants and animals. Depending on the expression system being used, other FDA guidance documents, such as CBER's Points to

Produce Biologicals should also be referenced. [43] [44] [45] Humanizing Monoclonal Antibodies Rodent MAbs with excellent affinities and specificities have been generated using conventional hybridoma technology, but their use in clinical medicine is limited due to the immune responses they elicit in humans. For instance, the human antimouse antibody (HAMA) response can compromise the clinical effectiveness of murine MAbs. Although HAMA responses are directed against the murine constant regions, which represent the major antigenic features of the mouse Ig, significant responses are also directed toward the murine variable regions. As a result, patients may mount an immune response against the injected murine antibodies, leading to allergic or immune complex hypersensitivities, rapid clearance of the antibody, and reduced clinical efficacy. 13,46 -51 Initially, Morrison and colleagues 48,52 introduced chimeric MAbs in 1984, which showed several advantages over unmodified rodent antibodies. Generally, chimeras combine the human constant regions with the intact rodent variable regions, replicating the rodent antibody variable regions by PCR and then cloning them into eukaryotic expression vectors containing human constant regions. 49 Ideally, this allows better interaction with human effector cells and the complement system. Because the Fc region has little influence on the structure of the Fv region, the chimeric constructs' affinity and specificity are virtually unchanged, and both rodent and chimeric antibodies cause apoptosis at a similar rate and intensity against target cells in vitro. 50, 51, 55 Although chimeric antibodies have helped solve some of the problems associated with the use of rodent MAbs, they still show significant immunogenicity in humans; because of their approximately 30% mouse sequence, they cause an human-antichimeric antibody response.

Humanized antibodies containing only the CDRs of the rodent variable region grafted onto the human variable region framework have been introduced to overcome these deficiencies. 53 The early work on recombinant, chimeric, and rodent/human antibodies happened during the mid 1980s and, by the late 1980s, Greg Winters and his colleagues demonstrated that a functional human-like antibody could be created by grafting the antigen-binding CDRs from variable domains of rodent antibodies onto human variable domains. Numerous humanized antibodies have now been designed and constructed, and many are currently being evaluated in clinical trials. 13, 14, 39, 47, 54 Efficient procedures for constructing humanized antibodies have been developed. 13, 14, 47, 55 The first step is to clone and sequence the complementary DNAs (cDNAs), coding for the variable domains of the mouse antibody to be humanized. The mouse hybridoma cell line is grown in an appropriate culture medium, and cells are harvested for RNA isolation. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primers that hybridize to the 5' ends of the mouse leader sequences and to the 5' ends of the mouse constant regions are designed for cloning light chain variable regions and heavy chain variable regions. cDNA is synthesized from total RNA, followed by PCR amplification with light and heavy chain specific primers. Positive bacterial colonies containing mouse variable regions are then screened.

Construction of a chimeric antibody involves modifying the cloned mouse leader-variable regions at the 5'-and 3'-ends, using PCR primers to create restriction enzyme sites for convenient insertion into expression vectors, to incorporate sequences for efficient eukaryotic translation, and to incorporate splice-donor sites for RNA splicing of the variable and constant regions. The adapted mouse light and heavy chain leader-variable regions are inserted into vectors containing, for example, human cytomegalovirus enhancer and promoter for transcription, a human light or heavy chain constant region, a neomycin gene for selection of transformed cells, and the simian virus 40 origin of replication in COS cells. These vectors are designed to express chimeric or reshaped human light and heavy chains in mammalian cells.

The design and construction of an engineered human antibody require an analysis of the primary amino acid sequences of the mouse variable regions to identify the residues most critical in forming the antigen-binding site. A structural model of the mouse variable region is built on the basis of homology to known antibody variable regions. The framework regions (FRs) of the new variable regions are modeled on FRs from structurally similar immunoglobulin variable regions. The design process involves selecting human light and heavy chain variable regions that will serve as templates for the construction of a reshaped human antibody. The mouse CDRs are then joined to the FRs from selected human variable regions. The primary amino acid sequences are then carefully analyzed to ascertain whether they would recreate an antigen-binding site that mimics the original mouse antibody.

Within the FRs, the amino acid differences between the mouse and the human sequences are examined, and the relative importance of each amino acid in the formation of antigen-binding site is evaluated. Minimum changes in the FRs are desirable and should closely match the sequences from natural human antibodies. Any potential glycosylation site in the FRs of either mouse or human sequence needs to be identified and its influence on antigen binding considered.

The DNA sequences coding for the reshaped human variable regions, either made synthetically or based on an existing sequence that is very similar to the newly designed reshaped human variable region, are modified by PCR with specially designed oligonucleotide primers. The human variable regions together with their leader sequences are then cloned into a mammalian expression vector that already contains human constant regions. Each human variable region is linked to the desired constant region via an intron.

Preliminary expression and analysis of the reshaped human antibodies are done by cotransfection of mammalian cell-expression vectors, 1 coding for human light chain and 1 coding for human heavy chain. The vectors will replicate in the COS cells and transiently express and secrete reshaped human antibodies. The concentration of the antibody produced can be analyzed by using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Specific changes in the amino acids of the framework region may also be required to preserve the orientation and structure of the rodent CDR required for binding. Computer modeling using databases containing human variable genes will identify sequences homologous to the rodent V regions. 13, 47 A computer model of the rodent Fv can identify the non-CDR residues that interact with the CDR sequences, and choices can be made regarding which residues need to be included in the variable region.

Antibodies humanized in this way may have binding affinities up to one-third greater than the corresponding murine antibodies. 49 Allergenicity is also significantly reduced. About 20 to 40% of patients exhibit a HAMA reaction to murine antibodies, whereas only about 7% have a similar reaction to humanized antibodies. 47,53,56 -58 Humanization of MAbs still has several practical difficulties. First, a detailed knowledge of the antibody structure and function is required. Second, methods for efficient construction of humanized MAbs are limited. Third, unpredictable immunogenicity may result when a new amino acid sequence is introduced to balance affinity retention. Fourth, the antibody repertoire is limited to the animal in which the progenitor MAb originated. Fifth, the rodent MAb producing hybridoma must be isolated and thoroughly characterized.

However, obstacles to humanization are gradually being surmounted. Karpas et al 15 reported creating a HAT-sensitive and ouabain-resistant human myeloma cell line that can fuse with human lymphoblast cells. A HAT-sensitive subline of the myeloma cells that secreted only light chains was fused with EBV-transformed white blood cells that produced IgG MAbs to HIV-1 gp41. Eventually, a clone was isolated that was polyethylene glycol-resistant and would not revert when placed in HAT medium. Standard polyethylene glycol fusion protocol was followed to fuse the myeloma cells with both EBVtransformed white cells and fresh white cells obtained from the peripheral blood of adults and tonsil cells from 2 children. The authors reported promising rates of hybridoma formation, stable Ig production, and high yield of secreted antibodies compared with antibody-producing cell lines from mouse myeloma cells. The authors have now developed 40 hybridomas that have been secreting cells for more than 5 months.

A human myeloma cell line may eventually prove useful in creating MAbs against certain autoimmune diseases and cancers. This technique may also make it easier for other researchers to generate human MAbs for use in therapy.

Antibodies may act directly when binding to a target molecule by inducing apoptosis, inhibiting cell growth, mimicking or blocking a ligand, or interfering with a key function. 53, 59 In addition, antibodies may modulate or potentiate drugs or other therapies. The antibody may itself act as an effector-as in antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) or antibody-dependent complement-mediated cascade-or it may involve effector elements such as cytotoxins, enzymes, radioactive isotopes, signals for other parts of the immune system, and/or cytotoxic drugs. 49,50,60 -62 ADCC occurs if Fc regions on the antibodies are recognized by receptors present on cytotoxic cells, such as natural killer cells, macrophages, granulocytes, and monocytes. Complement-mediated cytotoxicity ensues if the antibody binding prompts a complement cascade to occur. Active immunotherapy can be accomplished if the antigen can provoke a long-lasting T-cell response, which may be achieved by administering whole cancer cell extracts or by using small antigenic peptides isolated from tumors in experimental patients or animals. 58 For instance, MAbs mimicking breast cancer-specific antigens elicit anti-idiotype antibodies; this is another way of creating active immunity, which can lead to a humoral auto antibody-like immune response. 58 The use of bispecific molecules that recognize antigens on both the target cell and effector cell can increase ADCC. The most effective mechanisms are blockade of a crucial ligand or growth factor or ADCC in which tumor cells are killed by Fc receptorbearing cytotoxic effectors. Cell killing by ADCC is proportional to the amount of antibody bound to a cell, whereas the blockade of an essential growth factor may not show effects until most of its receptor is saturated. A higher antigen expression by the target cell will increase antibody binding and subsequent ADCC. But high receptor expression will also make it difficult to prevent the binding of a cytokine or ligand at minimum threshold. 53, 59, 63 With a bispecific antibody, the specificity of MAb is combined with the cytotoxicity of immune effector cells, for instance, to neutralize a tumor. 9, 45, 63, 64 Bispecific antibodies link the tumor cell directly to the killer cell via cytotoxic trigger molecules, such as T-cell receptors or Fc receptors, leading to lysis and/or phagocytosis by the effector cells. Although bispecific antibodies can enrich effectors at the tumor site and activate tumor bound effector cells by enabling cross-linking between effector and target cells, they can cause system-wide immune activation because of T-cell receptor cross-linking. Bispecific antibodies can also mediate cellular cytotoxicity via various effector cells, including phagocytes, natural killer cells, and T-lymphocytes.

Another way to use the binding properties of antibodies is by conjugating antibodies to cytotoxic drugs, radioisotopes, or toxins. 49, 58, 63, 65, 66 Techniques for conjugation have been described in several recent reviews and articles. 49, 58, 67, 70 MAbs can be conjugated to chemotherapeutic drugs such as doxorubicin, mitomycin, and methotrexate. Chemotherapeutic agents constitute cytotoxic or cytostatic drugs that can be conjugated to antibodies; thus far, however, these drugs have shown poor specificity for target cells and frequently lead to toxicity. 55, 62, 65 Often, antibodies may lose reactivity upon conjugation with such agents. Immunotoxins used in cancer therapy are conjugated antibodies that combine plant (ricin, gelonin, saponin, abrin, pokeweed antiviral protein) or bacterial (diphtheria toxin and pseudomonas toxin A) toxins with antibody specificity. 52, 59, 62, 63, 65, 66, 68, 69 Toxins may inhibit protein synthesis even at picomolar concentrations. Natural toxins, such as diphtheria toxin, can act at low concentrations, enter cells, and disrupt key cellular processes. 69 Enzymes may also be conjugated to antibodies in antibody-directed enzyme-prodrug therapy. 55, 61, 62, 66, 71 An enzyme that can convert a prodrug to an active form may be conjugated to an antibody and targeted to a desired location using the antibody-binding region. They may more effectively localize tumors than chemical conjugates, and a prodrug is converted to an active drug by the enzyme at the target cells.

Another therapeutic technique relies on using antibody fragments, which may be produced by the traditional method (proteolytic digestion with papain) or with newer methods that may reduce damage to the binding sites. 66, 71 Some newer methods attempt to construct mimetics that combine multiple CDRs from several antibodies into single molecules with molecular weights substantially lower than single chain fragments. Because of their smaller size, antibody fragments may be able to penetrate tissues and tumors more readily and be less immunogenic than whole MAbs. However, although antibody fragments may have better penetration than whole antibodies, their shorter half-lives may compromise clinical usefulness. 68 Heteropolymerized antibodies have recently been developed by chemically linking a mouse IgG MAb, specific to a complement receptor site (CR1) on the human or nonhuman primate erythrocyte, to a second mouse IgG MAb that is specific to the targeted antigen. 72 The heteropolymer technique is based on immune adherence, in which antibody-antigen immune complexes bind to a complement receptor on the red blood cell, facilitating the phagocytosis of these complexes. 72 Once introduced into the patient, the heteropolymers will bind to both the red blood cells and the targeted antigen. The antigen-antibody heteropolymer complexes are then transported to the liver and spleen, where the complexes are destroyed by macrophages, whereas the red blood cells return to the circulation unharmed. [72] [73] [74] [75] A wide variety of conditions, of both autoimmune and foreign origin, may potentially be treated with this method, including HIV infection, systemic lupus erythematosus, Marburg virus infection, and myasthenia gravis. 76 -78 Although mouse antibodies are currently being used with this technique, chimeric mousehuman antibodies could also be constructed. 72 It may also be possible to use the heteropolymers as ""sentinels"" by injecting them before antigen exposure. In 1 recent study, multiple infusions of heteropolymers provided nonimmunized monkeys with protection against an antigen (⌽174) for as long as 2 weeks. 79

When Milstein and Kohler announced their isolation of a MAb in 1975, many thought MAbs would provide an effective cancer treatment. However, early clinical trials were disappointing. 80 -81 Producing MAbs to tumor antigens is a complex process. First, proteins peculiar to human cancer cells are identified; then, mice are injected with human tumor cells (antigen) to stimulate an immune response. After about 30 days, the mouse lymphocytes are removed and fused with myeloma cells to isolate and reproduce hybrid cells specific to a predetermined antigen. Rodent antibodies alone have been used in several trials, but the clinical effects are often minimal because of poor activation of human effector or complement cells by the Fc region of the murine antibody and the accompanying HAMA responses. 55, 57 Substituting the rodent Fc region with a human Fc fragment may help overcome these effects. 81 With the discovery of proto-oncogenes, secondgeneration trials in the 1990s turned to more specific tumor antigens that could be potential targets. 58 In 1994, MAb 17-1A, an antibody to epithelial cell surface antigen expressed on human colorectal carcinomas, was approved for the identification of adenocarcinomas; MAb17-1A may reduce the mortality and occurrence rate of colorectal cancer. 82, 83 In 1997, rituximab, a mouse-human chimeric anti-CD20 antibody, was approved for the treatment of non-Hodgkin B cell lymphoma. 53, 83 Rituximab binds to CD20 antigen on B cells and B cell tumors and then elicits a natural immune response that can kill malignant cells. Recent animal trials have shown the potential of MAb therapy in cancer. 52 Increases in epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor expression have been found on many human cancers, and a fully human anti-EGF receptor IgG2 MAb has been shown to inhibit human cancer growth in vitro and in vivo. 22 Other efforts are focusing on antibody to HER2 antigen in breast cancer. Patients with cancer often mount an immunologic response to tumor-associated antigens with increases in cytotoxic lymphocytes and antibodies. 14 Several tumor-reactive antibodies have been cloned against melanomas, colon carcinomas, ovarian, breast, and lung tumors. Often, these antibodies cross-react with other malignant tissues or cell lines. 14 Recently, trastuzumab (Herceptin), a humanized MAb that binds directly to the C-erB2 protein (HER2), has been approved by the FDA for the treatment of breast cancer. 52,84 -89 Herceptin can be used to treat metastatic breast cancer in patients whose tumors overexpress the HER2 protein (about 30% of breast cancer patients) and may be used in conjunction with other therapies such as paclitaxel (Taxol). 89 Antibody was developed by humanizing murine MAb 4d5 by inserting antigen-binding regions of MAb 4d5 into the framework of a consensus human IgG1, resulting in rhuMab-Her2 or trastuzumab. 85 Cancer cells have antigens that are specific to the tumor (tumor-specific antigens) or are present in greater concentration than normal (tumor-associated antigens). Antibodies may eliminate target cells by complement action or through ADCC. The variable region of the antibody recognizes and attaches to a specific antigen and the constant region, then joins with an effector cell capable of killing the targeted cancer cell. When the antigen and antibody bind, precipitation and agglutination may isolate the complex. Anti-idiotype MAbs that mimic-tumor associated antigens also may be used in cancer therapy. 82 The idiotype network hypothesis, formulated by Lindemann and Jerne, suggests that because each mature B cell secretes an antibody with unique antigenbinding specificity in the variable domain (referred to as the idiotype), anti-idiotype MAbs can be generated and used as surrogate antigens or vaccines for immunization against the tumor. 82, 90 A murine anti-idiotype MAb, ACA125, which mimics the tumor-associated antigen CA125, was recently found to induce a specific anti-anti-idiotypic immune response in 28 of 42 patients with platinum-pretreated recurrent ovarian cancer enrolled in a phase I/II clinical trial. 90,91 A positive immune response was associated with statistically significant (P Ͻ 0.0001) prolonged survival times (19.9 Ϯ 3.1 months in patients shown to have an anti-antiidiotypic response compared with 5.3 Ϯ 4.3 months in patients who were anti-anti-idiotypic negative). 90, 91 In addition, peripheral blood lymphocyte mediated lysis of CA-125 expressing tumor cells increased in 9 of 18 patients after vaccination with the MAb. 91 Despite the use of a murine antibody, both this study and a previous phase I study involving patients with ovarian cancer found minimal side effects. 90, 91 Promising early results have also been demonstrated in patients with advanced colorectal carcinoma who received a murine anti-idiotype MAb that mimics an epitope of carcinoembryonic antigen (CeaVac) 82, 90 and in patients with malignant melanoma who received an anti-idiotype MAb (TriGem) that mimics disialoganglioside GD2 92 Despite promising developments, however, there are still several obstacles to effective cancer therapy with MAbs. Problems with the tumor, the MAb, or conjugate characteristics all continue to challenge researchers. 52, 63, 84 Thus far, chemotherapeutic MAb therapies have faced obstacles due to the poor ability of agents to affect tumor cells preferentially over healthy cells, the intrinsic insensitivity of many tumors to these drugs, and the rapid development of resistance in tumor cells. 65, 66, 93, 94 MAbs often decrease the size of tumors, but rarely lead to complete remission of solid tumors. 59 At the cellular level, MAbs at low doses ideally should bind with excellent affinities. Because no antigens have been identified that are expressed exclusively on tumor cells, cross-reactivity of MAbs must be examined with histochemical tests on tissue sections or in animal models. Careful testing must also be done to ensure that the effector molecules such as drugs, toxins, or isotopes in the conjugates do not inadvertently target healthy cells. Although humanized antibodies have greater affinity than murine antibodies, this potential has yet to be translated into improved clinical outcomes against cancer. 52 However, recent success using the XenoMouse technology to develop a fully human IgG2 MAb specific to epidermal growth factor receptor indicates the potential for future advances in this area. 22

Recombinant immunotoxins, fusion proteins containing the Fv of a MAb and a bacterial toxin, are under development for cancer therapy. Because immunotoxins exploit only the variable region-binding function of the MAb, in theory just a fragment of the binding region, such as the bivalent F(ab')2 fragment, monovalent Fab, scFV, or disulfide-stabilized Fv fragments may be used as opposed to the larger and probably more immunogenic whole antibody. Disulfide-stabilized fragments may be more stable or have higher affinity for the antigen than scFV, in which the linker may interfere with binding or fail to stabilize the fragment. 66 Recombinant immunotoxins derived from Pseudomonas enterotoxin have been shown to be active against lymphomas, solid tumors, and leukemias. 66 Because binding specificity and affinity are the key elements, it is not known which form of the immunoconjugate is usually more effective in treating human tumors; some animal tests suggest that the whole antibody, with its longer half-life and bivalent binding, is more effective than the antibody fragments with decreased binding affinity.

Bispecific antibodies and single chain FVs are being developed that may be more effective because they clear faster from nontumor tissues and more deeply penetrate tumors than whole antibodies. 49, 64, 70 Bispecific antibodies may be used to target tumor vascular endothelial cells, thereby limiting the tumor's blood supply and possibly inhibiting its spread. 70

Advances in radiolabeling have allowed immunoconjugates to be delivered to cells and showed promise in clinical trials. 14, 63, 80, 95, 96 Radioimmunotherapy uses a radiolabeled MAb to deliver radioactive isotopes to targeted cells. Radioisotopes such as iodine-131 and yttrium-90, which are ␤ emitters, can cause damage not only to the bound cell but also to cells adjacent to tumor cells that antibodies may not be able to reach within the tumors. Lack of knowledge about the appropriate dose, biodistribution, and shedding of antigen hinders use of radioisotopes.

Radiolabeled MAbs may also affect normal cells, depending on the extent to which reticuloendothelial cells expressing Fc receptors bind to the constant regions of intact antibody molecules. Using antibody fragments or constructs may modify this nonspecific uptake. 63, 68, 82, 93 Radiotherapy exerts most of its effect by emitting a low dose, which exponentially decreases continuous radiation, but the antibody per se may have a cytotoxic effect. The duration of radiotherapy is determined by the half-lives of the antibody and the isotope used. The success of radioimmunotherapy is affected by the specificity, affinity, dose, and immunoreactivity of the antibody, heterogeneity of antigen expression, diffusion rate, tumor volume, blood supply and tumor location, dose rate effects, and variability in dose deposition. The choice of radionuclide, selection of the chelate used to link the MAb to the radionuclide, and the MAb selected are critical in development of radiolabeled MAbs. 80 Suitable radio nuclides include yttrium-90, iodine-131, and copper-67. Iodine-131 was the first radioisotope to be used in treatment of Hodgkin disease and other lymphomas. 68 Yttrium-90 is potentially useful for lymphoma therapy because it decays with ␤, but not ␥, emissions that may kill other tumor cells in a cross-fire effect. 68 The energy released by yttrium is 5 times higher than that of iodine-131, which degrades rapidly after uptake into a tumor cell, causing toxicity. 80 In addition to their uses in radiotherapy, radiolabeled MAbs can also be used to diagnose cancer. 18, 56, 57, 82, 94 Radioactive isotopes linked with MAbs may help localize tumors in a form of diagnostic imaging called immunoscintigraphy. For instance, OncoScint, a MAb coupled to indium-111, may be used to detect an antigen (TAG-72) found on colorectal adenocarcinomas. 56

MAbs may potentially be used to suppress the immune system after transplant or to induce tolerance to transplanted organs or tissues. Thus far, however, only antibodies to CD3 and CD25 are licensed for clinical use. 97 OKT3, a murine IgG2a antibody to human CD3, and antibodies to CD25 (Il-2 receptor) have been used to reduce allograft rejection. 97 Graft-versus-Host Disease (GVHD) is a complication of allogeneic stem cell transplant that occurs despite histocompatibility testing and use of cyclosporine and its analogs. 98 GVHD is a frequent cause of illness or death in allogeneic transplant patients and occurs when alloselective donor T cells recognize and interact with major and minor histocompatibility antiigens in the host, leading to cytokine release.

MAb therapy against GVHD is most effective when it is administered after a bone marrow transplant but before GVHD development by targeting T-cells before their activation. 99 For instance, 1 target is the interleukin-2 receptor ␣-chain (IL-2R␣ Tac protein or CD25), whose expression is a crucial step in the activation of alloreactive T cells. 97, 100 Recently, it was reported that daclizumab, a humanized anti-IL-2a antibody, was an effective complement to dual immunosuppression therapy in renal transplant patients. 101 Because only activated cells express IL-2, antibodies to this cytokine might inhibit T cells during allograft rejection and prevent generation of cytotoxic T cells. The development of HAMA response in patients and the decreased effectiveness of murine MAb relative to human MAb have thus far compromised the effectiveness of this approach. However, humanized anti-Tac MAbs, with better human effector functions, may survive longer in vivo and may prove less immunogenic than its murine counterpart. Short-term CD4 antibody therapy may also contribute to long-term acceptance of skin and islet allografts, even after gaining immunocompetence. 102 More generally, the ability of MAbs to induce tolerance to transplanted tissues and self-antigens may hold great therapeutic potential. 97, 102 MAbs to CD4 and CD8 have been studied, although thus far these have not resulted in clinical success. 97 Depletion or blockade of T cells by antibodies may facilitate tolerance by preventing T cells from attacking the graft, and recent T cell depletion studies in primates have proven promising. 97 MAb treatments for other complications after transplants are also under study, including potential treatment of posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder with the anti-CD20 MAb rituximab and the use of anti-LFA-1 MAb (odulimomab) to protect against ischemia-reperfusion injury after kidney transplants. [103] [104] [105] Daclizumab, a humanized antibody that targets the anti IL-2 receptor, may reduce the risk of acute rejection of a renal transplant and also lower cytomegalovirus infection rates among transplant recipients. 106 The inflammatory bowel disorder known as Crohn disease has also been treated with MAb therapy. 107 A chimeric IgG1k antibody, infliximab (Remicade), acts by binding to soluble and transmembrane tumor necrosis factor ␣ (TNF␣), preventing it from binding to its receptors on activated macrophages. The anti-TNF␣ antibody may provide relief to patients with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease. In addition, the FDA recently approved infliximab for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis in combination with methotrexate. 108 -111 

High levels of IgE may cause bronchial hyperresponsiveness, a risk factor for asthma. [112] [113] [114] Im-Therapeutic Applications of Monoclonal Antibodies mune responses mediated by IgE are important in the pathogenesis of allergic asthma. In 1 recent study with subjects reporting moderate to severe allergic asthma, twice-weekly injections of recombinant humanized anti-IgE antibody (rhuMAB-E25), which forms complexes with free IgE and blocks its interaction with mast cells and basophils led to a fall in serum IgE levels and slightly decreased asthma symptom scores relative to the placebo group. 112 Patients receiving anti-IgE were able to reduce reliance on corticosteroids. Although the study must be interpreted cautiously, it is nonetheless a promising step in finding more effective asthma therapies. 112, 114, 116 

Approximately 400,000 cases of sepsis in the US and about 25,000 cases in the UK are reported each year. 116, 117 The mortality rate could be as high as 40 to 70%, depending on the population studied. 117, 118 MAbs have been targeted to TNF␣ and TNF␣ receptors, which are key elements of the inflammatory response. Unfortunately, this may inhibit many cytokines, which can impair the patients' ability to fight infection and increase the risk of secondary sepsis; also inhibiting a few cytokines may not be sufficient. Although MAbs targeted toward components of the host immune system, such as individual receptors or mediator cells, help in the treatment of septic shock, targeting the bacterial endotoxin or lipid A of gram-negative bacteria with MAbs may be more efficacious. Lipopolysaccharide endotoxin, a component of the outer cell membrane of Gramnegative bacteria, consisting of a highly variable O-linked polysaccharide chain, an R core region, and lipid A, which in turn is composed of a glucosamine disaccharide backbone substituted with amide-and ester-linked long-chain fatty acids, is believed to be important in many cases of septic shock and septicemia, and can trigger an inflammatory cascade that can cause serious injury and even death. 119, 120 Lipid A is linked by the core region to the O-linked side chain, and variations in the O-linked side chains result in an enormous diversity among Gram-negative bacteria, making adoptive immunotherapy against the O-linked antigenic determinants difficult. 114 Directing antibodies to the core region or lipid A, which tend to be more conserved, would allow for therapy against a diverse array of Gram-negative bacteria. Favorable results with polyclonal J5 antibody have spurred attempts to develop a MAb. 116, 117 A murine IgM MAb, E5 (XOMA, Berkeley, CA) binds to an epitope on lipid A of E coli J5. A human IgM, HA-1A (Centoxin) is derived from a heterohybridoma fused from spleen cells of a patient vaccinated with E coli J5 before splenectomy. 116, 117, 119, 121 Both the antibodies have thus far shown mixed success in patients with sepsis and neither is currently cleared by the FDA for therapeutic use. Because patients with bacteremia often have endotoxemia, HA-1A, an IgM antibody to endotoxin may be effective against endotoxin in the bloodstream as well. Unfortunately, the high cost of antibody ($3500/dose in Europe) combined with the uncertainty that the sepsis is caused by Gram-negative bacteria has hindered the widespread use of HA-1A. 112, 115, 117 Although it is less efficacious, the only other option may be to target TNF␣, but 1 recent study reported a high (54.1%) rate of adverse reactions in patients receiving an anti-TNF␣ antibody. 118 The antibody was no more effective than the placebo given to control subjects. However, research on a MAb for the treatment of septicemia continues.

Cytomegalovirus (CMV) causes serious illness affecting the immunocompromised, such as patients with AIDS and those undergoing organ transplants. Infection rates may be up to 75% in those negative for CMV who receive kidneys from seropositive patients. 122 CMV infection can result in retinitis and gastroenteritis in HIV-infected patients and may also cause chronic intrauterine infection. 122, 123 Up to 40,000 cases of congenital CMV infection are reported each year; mental retardation and hearing loss may occur in about 25% of these cases. 122 Currently, there is no vaccine against CMV. Ganciclovir, foscarnet, and (S)-1-[3-hydroxy-(2 phosphonylmethoxy)propyl]cytosine are some of the potential treatments for CMV infection. 122 Another mode of treatment is via administration of anti-CMV hyperimmunoglobulin, derived from pooled sera of CMVseropositive persons. Passive immunization has been shown to reduce the severity of CMV and prevent mother-to-infant transmissions. 122 Moreover, antibodies may be able to clear the virus from infected tissues, a function previously thought to be exclusive to cytotoxic T lymphocytes. Many physicians use a combination of antiviral agents and immunoglobulins in patients at risk for CMV infection. MAbs may also decrease the amount of antiviral agents required for treatment. MAbs against murine CMV polypeptides have been shown to be protective in animal models. 124 Although MAbs may act synergistically with foscarnet or ganciclovir in vitro, it is unclear whether this advantage could be extrapolated to in vivo conditions. Experiments in which murine CMV is used as a model system suggest that high concentrations of antibody, along with ganciclovir or (S)-1-[3-hydroxy-(2 phosphonylmethoxy)propyl]cytosine, synergistically inhibit the growth of murine CMV in cell culture, whereas lower antibody concentrations produce only an additive effect. However, antibody ad-ministered along with ganciclovir in severe combined immunodeficient mice also produced only an additive effect. 123 The extent to which a MAb can protect the host from CMV infection cannot reliably be predicted from its immunoreactivity, neutralizing titers in vitro, or from its antigen-binding data, because the mechanism of action of a MAb in vitro and in vivo may be entirely different. 124 If an antibody is used along with drugs, not only is the treatment efficacy improved but also the side effects of a high drug concentration may be avoided. For instance, 25 mg of ganciclovir/kg of body weight, along with an antibody, was almost as effective as 50 mg/kg ganciclovir administered alone in CMV-infected severe combined immunodeficient mice. 124 The MSL109 antibody, a human IgG1 directed against human CMV glycoprotein, is marginally synergistic in inhibiting CMV in vitro when conjugated to ganciclovir or foscarnet. In a recent trial involving 209 AIDS patients with active CMV retinitis, the rate of retinitis progression was similar in the group receiving the antibody (60 mg, intravenous) for 2 weeks and the placebo control group. 125 Surprisingly, mortality increased in the MSL-109 group, and the poor performance of MSL-109 in this trial may have been due to the inability of the antibody to neutralize the established CMV infection in AIDS patients or its failure to cross the blood-ocular barrier in sufficient quantities.

Liver transplant patients are also at risk of CMV infection and may require treatment with the murine MAb OKT3, an anti-T cell antibody that is directed to CD3 antigen, along with ganciclovir to mitigate transplant rejection. 126 Human MAbs neutralizing CMV were tested for their safety and pharmacokinetics over a period of 3 to 73 days in bone marrow transplant recipients and were found to be safe and efficacious, as evidenced by a steady increase in the neutralizing activity. 127 Also, a human anti-CMV MAb designated C23 that was purified from hybridomas generated by the fusion of human lymphocytes with mouse myeloma cells has virus neutralization titers about 1000-fold higher than those produced after conventional human ␥ globulin used in humans. 128 A humanized MAb has been developed that binds to the 86-kd glycoprotein, gpUL75 (gH), of CMV, recognizes a variety of virus strains, and neutralizes clinical isolates of CMV; it could be used as a potential agent for the prevention or treatment of CMV infections in humans. 129 Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) causes serious lower respiratory tract disease requiring considerable supportive care, administration of humidified oxygen, and respiratory assistance. The FDA approved the use of a humanized MAb against RSV, which afflicts mostly infants and children younger than 24 months of age. 130, 131 Known as palivizumab, the antibody (produced by Synagis and MedImmune, Inc.) treatment showed a 55% reduction in RSV infection in hospitalized patients. 130, 131 The American Academy of Pediatrics' Committee on Infectious Diseases has published recommendations on the use of this antibody in children at risk for RSV infection. 130, 131 MAbs have also been used in the therapy of HSV infections. The incidence of neonatal herpes is 30 to 50% in babies born vaginally to mothers with primary infection but only 1 to 3% in babies born to mothers with recurrent infections. 132 This difference is attributed to the passive transfer of protective antibodies to the fetus. Antibodies to HSV-1 may also confer partial protection against type 2 strains. Based on this observation, the potential of MAb therapy against herpes has been studied for more than a decade. Experiments in mice, for instance, indicate that microgram quantities of antibodies may promote healing of corneal opacity and blepharitis caused by herpes simplex. 133 However, attempts to confer immunity in humans and other higher animals by passive immunization alone have been disappointing, because antibodies to HSV are restricted to only a few specific epitopes. 133 Among the 11 glycoproteins expressed by the herpes virus on its surface, 5 glycoproteins (gB, gD, gH, gK, and gL) are thought to be crucial to infection. The initial step in HSV infection seems to be the binding of gC to heparan sulfate proteoglycans followed by the binding of gB, and the binding of gB and gC is stabilized by gD. gH is involved in initiation of viral fusion and other glycoproteins may help in expanding the fusion process.

Evidence that neutralizing antibodies to gH, gD, and gB prevent membrane fusion but not viral attachment is consistent with this model. 133 Most human antibodies are directed against gD and gB epitopes. MAbs can target at least 7 different antigenic sites on HSV glycoprotein D in the murine model. 133, 134 Glycoprotein D is necessary for virus replication in tissue culture. Yamamoto et al 135 reported the antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity effect of HS1, a neutralizing MAb to glycoprotein B of HSV, in athymic nude mice inoculated with HSV intracutaneously. When HS1 is administered, the skin lesions healed in 50% of the mice given the antibody. Also, latent infection in the ganglia was prevented in mice that survived, as evidenced by the failure to detect HSV upon co-cultivation with Vero cells. Administration of HS1 after development of zosteriform lesions (5 to 9 days after infection) reduced the virus in the ganglia and prolonged survival time; however, the disease was not totally avoided and eventually the mice succumbed to the disease. The antibody therapy could prevent or decrease the severity of herpetic keratitis, iritis, and blepharitis after corneal infection by HSV. 136, 137 Thus, MAbs could potentially be used to prevent congenital herpes and sexual transmission of the herpes virus. 47, 133, 138, 139 

Currently, no treatments exist for the hemorrhagic fever caused by the filovirus Ebola. Recently, a team of researchers at the US Army's Medical Research Institute identified protective antibodies directed against epitopes on Ebola virus membraneanchored glycoprotein. Some of the antibodies protected mice as long as 2 days after exposure; doses were equivalent to acceptable (3 to 5 mg/kg) human levels. Antibody specificity is important, because some MAbs studied bound to Ebola Zaire but not to the Ivory Coast or Sudan serotypes. Much research remains to be done before the potential of antibodies in the treatment of Ebola will become realized. 140

Toxins are poisonous proteinaceous substances. Antibodies were first clinically used in the 1970s for protection against the toxin digitalis. 48, 102 Today, antidigitalis immunotoxicotherapy is a standard therapy. Digoxin is produced from sheep immunized with digoxin-serum albumin conjugate. IgG antibody specific for digoxin is purified and cleaved into Fabs, because the smaller molecular mass of the fragments allows faster renal clearance and more rapid action than the whole antibody. The Fab fragments bind to circulating digitalis molecules and generate a complex that is unable to bind to receptors. Adverse effects are rare, and the immunotherapy is generally effective against digoxin and digitoxin within 1 hour. 120, 141 However, because polyclonal antibodies may be difficult to produce and may cause hypersensitive reactions, researchers have attempted to develop humanized MAbs against digoxin and other toxins. 141 For example, 1 group has used a transgenic mouse to produce hybridomasecreted human MAbs against digoxin. 141 More recently, the effect of goat anti-colchicine IgG antibodies has been studied in mice exposed to a lethal intraperitoneal dose of anti-inflammatory colchicines, and preliminary studies in a 25-yearold woman with colchicine poisoning showed promise. 102, 141 Attempts have also been made to use drug-specific goat antibody fragments to treat anti-tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) overdose. 120, 141 Antidepressant overdose is the most common cause of intentional drug overdose in the US. However, lethal doses of tricyclics are 10-to 100-fold higher than those of colchicine, digoxin, and snake venom, which require higher antibody doses (up to several g/kg) to reverse the toxicity. 120, 142 High-affinity tricyclic antidepressant-specific MAbs have been shown to reverse the cardiovascular toxicity of antidepressant desipramine in rats and prolong their survival, and tricyclic antidepressant-specific Fab fragments, along with sodium bicarbonate, a standard treatment for tricyclic overdose, also minimizes the required dose of antibody. 142 The use of smaller antibody fragments, such as single chain Fv fragments, half the size of a Fab, may also be a promising approach because the single chain fragment retains affinity and has shorter half-life in the body.

Monoclonal antibodies may also help to alleviate poisoning due to environmental contamination. Hexachlorobiphenyl, paraquat, atrazine, 3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridinol, the chief degradation byproduct of the insecticides chloropyrifos, triclopyr, and chloroprifosmethyl, and other chemicals may soon be detected and remediated with the help of antibodies. 139, [143] [144] [145] Antibodies may also be used in the treatment of poisoning due to paraquat, hexachlorobiphenyl, domoic acid [amnesic shellfish poisoning], and other contaminants that are otherwise difficult to remove from the body or surrounding environment. [145] [146] [147] [148] 

The primary target of many abused drugs is the central nervous system (CNS), and immunotherapy against such chemicals must be able to penetrate the CNS. 149 PCP or phencyclidine (angel dust) is a type of arylcyclohexamine that affects multiple sites in the brain. 150, 151 It is linked to violent psychotic episodes that are similar to schizophrenia. 149 Treatment is difficult because there is no known antagonist identified, PCP has a high volume of distribution, and about 95% of it is cleared after being metabolized. 151 Recently, MAbs have been described that could bind to cocaine or PCP and act like sponges in the bloodstream to prevent them from reaching the brain. 152 It has been shown that a single dose of antibody reduced PCP effects for up to 2 weeks in animals, which might be equivalent to a several months in humans. High-affinity antibody 6b5 fragments against PCP function better in that the fragments with bound PCP are more quickly cleared from the body than the whole antibodybound PCP. 153 The crystal structure of the antibody fragment complexed with PCP has been studied in detail. 154 Antibody fragments are also preferable to whole antibodies in the treatment of PCP addiction because of their lower antigenicity and improved pharmacokinetics. 149, 151 Anti-idiotype antibodies could potentially be produced against the drug-MAb binding site and mimic drug structural features, although these antibodies do not cross the bloodbrain barrier. 151 By increasing protein binding in the vascular compartment and lowering the drug's volume of distribution, the antibody acts like a pharmacokinetic antagonist. 150 Evidence that the antibody can also reverse effects of other potent arylcyclohexylamine drugs suggests that antibody medications can be used to treat different classes of drugs. 150, 151 An anti-PCP IgG has been produced from a hybridoma cell line using both ascites and bioreactor methods, and the pharmacological and immune specificity of the antibody has been confirmed by administering the anti-PCP fragment to rats in three different studies without producing observable effects in behavior. 155 Active immunotherapy against methamphetamine addiction is also being contemplated. 156 Antibody therapy for cocaine addiction is also a possibility, especially with the development of catalytic antibodies having enzyme-like characteristics that can be used to inactivate drugs. 151, [157] [158] [159] Antibodies with esterase activity have been successfully mimicked, and because cocaine is believed to be metabolized by in vivo esterases, such antibodies would be useful in the treatment of cocaine addiction. 151 Catalytic antibodies probably would not be as useful as high-affinity anti-cocaine antibodies, but could be used in medical emergencies or as part of a withdrawal therapy. 151 Potential antibody applications against cocaine addiction have been tested in rats with a vaccine approach by (1) attaching cocaine molecules to a carrier protein for immunizing rats to produce antibodies against cocaine and (2) humanizing anticocaine antibodies derived from rats and producing them in bacteria. 152, 160 A catalytic MAb (15A10) has recently been reported to attenuate cocaine's cardiovascular effects in mice. 155, 159 Conclusion About 200 years have elapsed since Edward Jenner vaccinated a young child against smallpox. Since that time, the field of immunology has evolved at a rapid pace and has yielded many critical developments. Although vaccination has thus far proven to be the most cost-effective method of preventing diseases worldwide, the development of MAbs that use the specificity of immunological responses is one of the most successful applications of immunology to date. Chimeric and humanized antibodies have reduced the risk of allergenicity from exposure to nonself antibodies and heightened the clinical effectiveness of MAb treatments. Developments in radiology and pharmacology have allowed radiolabeled and immunoconjugated antibodies to be produced. Antibody fragments, heteropolymers, and bispecific antibodies are now available in addition to whole MAbs. These promising developments may soon allow MAbs to be used to treat afflictions as varied as substance abuse, cancer, asthma, viral infection, septicemia, and poisoning. As Heddy Zola observed in 1995, ""The therapeutic application of MAbs, whilst still limited in scope, promises to break its substantial shackles and realize the potential forecast by its proponents."" 46
